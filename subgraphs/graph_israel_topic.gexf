          <attvalue for="7" value="this is democracy Now democracynow.org The War and Peace report I'm Amy Goodman we're continuing this holiday special with tanassi coats author of the new book The Message democracy Nows Juan Gonzalez and I interviewed him on October 8th one day after hundreds of activists rallied in Union Square in New York for a jewish-led vigil on the first anniversary of October 7th to mourn Israelis and Palestinians who've been killed and to call for an end to the Israeli massacre in Gaza after the vigil I spoke to Ava borgart a spokesperson for the group if not now right now people are wearing signs that say no us money for bombs um and talk about the motto of this October 7th vigil so the motto is every life a universe and it's it's from piku nefes which says that to destroy a life is to destroy an entire world and to save a life is to save an entire world and our government is not treating every single life as a universe they're treating Palestinian lives as less sacred how did you get so involved with this issue I got involved through the Ferguson Uprising and I was watching black and Palestinian activists trading tips on Twitter about how to deal with tear gas and it became clear that it Palestinians in the West Bank are facing a military charged with policing and black Americans are facing a militarized police force and um that was my entry point where I said I need to organize my community which was unable to or which was limited in being able to show up for the Civil Rights fight of our time for the black lives matter movement because they were upset about the messaging for a free Palestine in those protests and so I've spent the last 10 years of my life working on building the movement of Jewish Americans who are calling for equality Justice and a thriving future for all no matter where people live that's Eva bergart of the group if not now one of hundreds of people here in New York City and Union Square for two large rallies on the anniversary of October 7th Our Guest today is tanassi coats the prizewinning journalist and author of the new book the message in part about a visit he took last year organized by the uh Palestinian the Palestine Festival of literature pal Fest uh to the West Bank um and Israel um talk about this whole journey you took you were part of the palfest and then you also stayed yeah and I guess to be honest my my journey began 10 years ago when I when I published the case for reparations um and there was a section uh again as a as a writer as a journalist you always trying to make people feel things make things real and there was a section where I offered an analog uh for reparations for how I could possibly look and it was um from uh West Germany to the state of Israel and I need to be very specific about that not to Holocaust Survivors but to the state of Israel itself and um that part of that essay came under quite quite a bit of critique and uh what became clear to me was deservedly so um it took 10 years is for me to get it fixed because writing takes a long time you know um but I but I knew I had to like that I was going to have to go at some point you know I knew it wouldn't be enough for me to you know appear to Rally do a slogan whatever and long story short um I began talking to palfest in 2016 finally got there in 2023 uh just in time for the message uh I spent 5 days with them uh mostly traveling through the occupied territories and through East Jerusalem as a Palestinian would getting a sense of of of what their daily was U and then the next 5 days I spent mostly in the company of a group called breaking the silence uh former IDF uh veterans who are against the occupation uh and I saw the country largely through the views of in Israeli how they move through the through the world how they move through Jerusalem how they move through the roads um but I also again you know spent a lot of time actually talking you know more to Palestinians um it was revelatory it was I don't think the average American has a real sense of what we're doing over there and I emphasize what we're doing because it's not possible uh without American Support I have heard people say over and over again that there are great evils happening in the world um States across the world perpetrating evils against uh uh whole groups of people why pick on Israel and the thing I say is I'm an American this is the thing that we have our fingerprints on those Bombs Over Gaza the planes that drop bombs on Gaza uh the plaques that I saw for instance in jerus all of that is America and we are going around the world propping ourselves up as the font of democracy we are going around the world propping Israel up as the only democracy in Middle East this is a deep deep fiction a very very dangerous fiction um that must be addressed and that's what I tried to do in the book you WR in the book uh quote it occurred to me that there was still one place on the planet under American patronage that resembled the world that my parents were born into can you elaborate yes and I think I talked about it the last time I was here actually um these are the words I have even now and they are probably insufficient to what a Palestinian uh would offer who experiences this but the words that come to me are segregation um when you are on the West Bank there are separate roads there are roads for Israeli settlers and citizens of Israel and there are roads for Palestinian Ians these roads are not separate and equal these roads tend to be separate and unequal it tends to take longer to get where you want to go if you're Palestinian uh if you enter a city like herin for for instance herin is quite literally segregated there are streets that Palestinians cannot walk down there are streets that you know Israeli settlers are giv complete and free movement of moving throughout the West Bank in general they there are checkpoints everywhere for Palestinians uh these checkpoints are sometimes normal checkpoints that they know are there some times checkpoints appear out of the blue with they which what they call Flying checkpoints your basic movement is constantly imp parallel the justice system which is deeply familiar for African-Americans here is quite literally segregated there is a civil justice system that the minority of Israeli settlers as Israeli citizens enjoy and then there is an entirely separate justice system that uh Palestinians on the West Bank are subject to you can be arrested for instance um as as an Israeli Citizen and you are you know uh do all the due rights that we are familiar with you have to be told what the charges are Etc if you are arrested as a Palestinian you can just be taken in another political context we would call those hostages because nobody has to say why you're taken nobody has to say what you were taken for nobody has to inform your family you are under the jurisdiction of the of of of of the military it has been this way since 1967 and the word we use for that is occupation which is a kind of uh uh deeply um vanilla word that does not actually describe what is going on how a country that maintains this this uh separate and unequal system how a country that that does not even allow the quote unquote Palestinian citizens of the state full equality with its Jewish Israeli citizens is allowed to refer to itself as a democracy is a mystery to me and the closest analogue I can think of is the time in which uh the United States of America referred to itself as a democracy even as it was disenfranchising whole swats of black people in the southern states and so when I say Jim Crow when I say segregation that is because that is the period that immediately comes to mind for me talk about being stopped by an Israeli soldier Tanashi oh well we stopped all the time to be clear you know because we were on the roads we were constantly stopped you know um I was you know you just kind of got used to it after a while which was also weely familiar but I think the instance you're referring to is when I was in Hebron um which is a you know a flasho for anybody that that that that's been over there um I was walking down the street attempting to uh patronized a Palestinian uh vendor uh and a guard IDF uh guard or IDF Soldier stopped out he was young enough to be my son uh stopped out and asked me what was my religion um it was clear that I had to State my religion in order to pass when I told him that I was not religious he asked what my mother's religion was when I told him my mother wasn't particularly religious he asked what my grandmother's religion was and this is a very very important thing because when you start asking what my mother and grandmother's religion is you are referring to something Beyond do I accept Christ as my you know personal savior or what God I I pray to you are asking a a deeper question about my ancestry and it became clear that if I did not give the right answer to that question I would not be allowed to pass I highlight this because when you hear Palestinian and Palestinian American activists make the charge of racism this is what they're talking about why does who my grandmother or my mother worship matter if we're strictly talking about a God not that it would be right even in that sense but when you hear the charge of racism this is what people are referring to tonassi this is a powerful book and you went on CBS This Morning recently to talk about the publication of it and I want to go to that interview on CVS this morning um The New York Times is now reporting CBS News has rebuked one of the morning anchors uh Tony deople uh over what he did in that interview to you and maybe you could also say to his fellow anchors as he dominated this CBS Executives said the interview fell short of the Network's editorial standards this is an excerpt of that interview I want to dive into the uh Israel Palestine section of the book it's the largest section of the book and I have to say when I when I read the book I imagine if I took your name out of it took away the awards and the Acclaim took the cover off the book The Publishing House goes away the content of that section would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist and so then I found myself wondering why does tanahashi coats who I've known for a long time r at his work for a long time very talented smart guy leave out so much why leave out that Israel is surrounded by countries that want to eliminate it why leave out that Israel deals with Terror groups that want to eliminate it why not DET anything of the first and the second antifa the cafe bombings the bus bombings the little kids blown to bits and is it because you just don't believe that Israel in any condition has a right to exist well I would say the perspective that you just outlined um there is no shortage of that perspective in American Media um that's the first thing I would say um I am most concerned always with those who don't have a voice with those who don't have the ability to talk um I have asked repeatedly in my interviews whether there is a single Network mainstream organization in America with a Palestinian American bureau chief or correspondent who actually has a voice to articulate that part of the world um I've been a reporter for 20 years um the reporters of those who believe more sympathetically about Israel um and its right to exist don't have a problem getting their voice out but what I saw in Palestine what I saw on the West Bank what I saw in hia in Israel what I saw in the South Hein Hills those were the stories that I have not heard so tanassi um you sitting on the set of CBS This Morning uh with uh the former football player now anchor uh Nate burlson Gail King very welln um both African-American anchors and Tony deople he dominated the discussion talking about your book belong could be found in an extremist backpack um talk about the backlash on this the aftermath of this and also who you felt was most wronged in this well it wasn't me I mean at that part I let me talk it was not me you know um it certainly and I don't know there was anybody on that set um look I think um there is a meta conversation that happens here uh where we end up because we're media where we end up talking about media and and media politics um but I do think it's really important to Broad the frame from the few people that that were there and talk about um what was actually excluded and who was actually excluded from that conversation by the very structure itself I just don't want to lose sight of that um I don't really have a problem with a tough interview you know I knew what I wrote you know I knew I'd be confronted I you know was he rude was he aggressive you know like I can't really get into that like it's not really something that I think too much about the question I would ask though is how often on CBS on NBC on ABC or or any major news organization do you see someone who is a defender of the Israeli state project get confronted in that kind of way um get uh given a tough interview in that kind of way when was the last time you saw for instance a defender of Israel defender of Zionism uh confronted with the fact that major human rights organizations say that Israel is practicing a Pare how do you defend that when is the last time You' seen an interviewer how often do you see interviewers cuz don't want to say it never happens how often do you see interviewers say listen we have you know the former head of Human Rights Watch that says you are practicing genocide right now in Gaza how do you respond to that how often do you how often do you say that how often do you see how do you define yourself as a democracy when fully half the people under your rule are not equal there is no problem with confronting me you know I would like to see some other people confront it and the second part of that is who gets to do the confront in the first place I have said and I will continue to say I am a little uncomfortable with this role and a little uncomfortable with with the publicity not because I feel like I I do not know but because I feel like there are people who are going through this experience and who have gone through this experience who know so much more who are completely out of the frame and those are Palestinians and Palestinian Americans so it's not just the issues that I raise in the confrontation the question I was I would ask is you have to imagine a world where a Palestinian amican journalist could be on a mainstream show like CBS This Morning and confront someone who wrote a book that say defended Israel or defended Zionism with that kind of aggression it's fine if I get it but I want to live in that world too you know and that really is you know like one of the things I was really really trying to get at in the book in the message you know it's it's the questions we ask it's the stories we get to tell and the stories that we don't tell and perhaps most importantly it's who gets to tell them who doesn't and I just I I really feel this passionately this is not about me this is not about Tony this is not about Gail this is not about n we're going to be fine it's the people who are invisible it's the people who were not in that set you know on that set to begin with who are not part of that conversation and and tassi this this criticism that you were sufficiently taking into account that history uh when the reality is here we are on the anniversary of the October 7th uh attacks uh and very little discussion is occurs about what was Gaza like before October 7th of last year and uh and and how were the the the residents of of Gaza being treated essentially in an open air prison yes no I I I I completely agree look I I I you know I I love that um the young lady who was saying uh earlier in the lead in every life is a un i i i Tru truly believe that and so you know as I've said before like there really is no part of my politics that has the ability to look at October 7th and not mourn the death the massacre uh the the atrocities you know perpetrated I just wish that some of my countrymen especially my countrymen especially Americans who are responsible for this who are propping this up had that same sort of compassion and that same sort of energy for October 6th October 5th Etc you know this kind of abstracting events outside you know of of of their historical context is really necessary to the political order because it allows us to justify ourselves and not have to think harder and not have to ask you know much deeper question you really have to be able to hold both you know and I know that that sounds a bit cliche but I I I I truly do believe that you have to you know believe in this idea that I actually just heard today that every life is a universe I you know I think that's really really beautiful articulation you know um and that has to be true for all life that has to be true on October 7th you know and loudly said but it has to be true on 654 321 also uh and also I wanted to go back for a second because we are we are running out of time and ask you about sry my answers are so long yeah about President Trump and in the coming upcoming election uh the great surprise to me all these these years now is the enormous support that Donald Trump still has on among huge swats of the American public to what do you uh attribute this Darkness there's a darkness in all of us I mean this is um this is not new you know I mean and if you if you just took American history from the perspective of an african-amer and I suspect the the the from the perspective of the indigenous people of this continent what what they would tell you is there is nothing new and people using power and people using you know the worst tropes in the world to win and to to to dominate for any black person that you know grew up in the south from I don't know 1876 to 1964 and probably Beyond I'm being very conservative by saying that this is what politics was like this is this is just what we you know grew up under and so I I think maybe we thought or we allowed ourselves to believe that somehow you know we had escaped the gravity of history but no people no country escapes the gravity of History we live within it we we we are part of it and so you know I I think it's a very very dangerous thing that our leaders led us to believe um in 2016 that this was like a thing that could not happen in in America you know whereas had we looked at history from another perspective we would know that this actually very American you know that doesn't make us you know inhuman or somehow demonically evil you know on the contr it just makes us human it means that we're subject to you know the darkness in our souls like any other group of people would be tassi I wanted to go to that point you say of who gets heard um we were at the Democratic Convention everywhere we were interviewing people saw you in the background we were interviewing the delegate from what uh Michigan from Florida from Connecticut who unfurled a banner in the Florida delegation that said stop arming Israel um you were there as we were interviewing them in the hallway uh when we were outside when they were about to begin the sleep in overnight demanding that kamla Harris allow a palestinian-american to speak you were there uh and then the next day um and you wrote a piece and Vanity Fair about your experience of Palestinian Americans place under the Democrats big tent the looking at the uncommitted movement and their unsuccessful efforts to have such a speaker this is rura Roman of the uncommitted movement she's a Palestinian American Georgia state representative this is part of what she would have said if she was chosen for 322 days we've stood together demanding to enforce our laws on friend and foe alike to reach a ceas fire and the killing of Palestinians free all the Israeli and Palestinian hostages and and to begin the difficult work of building a path to Collective peace and safety that's why we are here members of this Democratic party committed to equal rights and dignity for all what we do hear Echoes around the world they'll say this is how it's always been that nothing can change but remember Bonnie Lamer shun for her courage yet she paved the way for an integrated Democratic party her legac lives on and it's her example we follow so that's Georgia state representative Ru Roman and um needless to say uh there was not a Palestinian American Voice on the stage last night um kamla Harris uh did an interview with 60 Minutes at least they played it last night um this is what she had to say about Israel Palestine when we think about the threat that Hamas Hezbollah presents um Iran um I think that it is without any question our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks now the work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing Pursuit around making clear our principles which include the need for humanitarian Aid the need for this war to end the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages and and and and create a ceasefire and we're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and and in the region including Arab leaders that's Democratic Presidential nominee Kam haris speaking on 60 Minutes last night uh as we wrap up you were just talking about Trump talk about um what the position of the Biden Harris Administration is right now they did hold two separate um uh commemorations yesterday President Biden was at the White House and he lit a candle and also I think crossed himself right after and um uh kamla Harris the vice president the Naval Observatory planted a tree a pomegranate tree well and you know that that's good and appropriate you know um like I said you know we we don't want to uh have a politic that um does not take life serious and does not take loss of life serious um on the larger question and maybe even as an extension of that but we have to take all life seriously I don't think we're doing that um this is morally untenable what I saw was and this is the first time I've ever said this or put this in this Frame and maybe you know the uncommitted delegates understood this um there was as much a moral gap between what I saw in Chicago that is to say to go on stage and promote these values of diversity Humanity big tent and to exclude um the people whose families are being bombed right now as it was in the early 1960s and you know before when the Democratic party you know claimed to be for the Working Man and the working person while millions of workers all through the South were effectively in a system of indentured servitude and they refused to give those people political representation it is a gigantic moral golf um that is trou disappointing heartbreaking and deeply deeply personally upsetting tanassi coats author of the new book the message that interview was

          <attvalue for="7" value="the Israeli Air Force has made a decision and the  fighting in the Gaza Strip undergoes a tactical   revolution welcome to this special edition of  Boots on the Ground i'm your host Y Pinto and   today we're going to give you an in-depth look at  what's happening in Israel as we dive into the Air   Force's combat revolution this is more than just  a change in the way that the Israeli Air Force   strikes it is a revolution in military affairs  that is already changing the face of modern   warfare worldwide since the launch of Gideon's  chariots the current route of fighting in the   Gaza Strip we are already seeing a new layout of  the Israeli air force that includes less bombing   by fighter jets more precise operations and  significant coordination with the Navy it's all   about close support for ground troops using UAVs  and attack helicopters this is being done in order   to redirect the fixedwing aircraft and related  forces toward broader operational activity in the   Middle East strikes in Iran and distant Yemen are  complex operations that require sending aircrafts   refueling planes and of course putting the pilots  at risks so why has Israel chosen to focus on   smaller faster aircrafts is this a mistake that  needs correction let me know in the comments is   this context the question arises is why doesn't  Israel fire long range missiles at Yemen in   response to the Houthi launches instead of sending  pilots on a long dangerous mission beyond enemy   lines do you have the answer for that let me know  in the comments we'll provide the professional   explanation for this question and meanwhile the  Israeli Air Force is preparing at the home front   and the general staff systems for a multiffront  war ensuring continuity defensive readiness and   protection of vital operational components so get  ready to dive into all the in-depth analysis of   the Israeli Air Force i'm Yay Pinto and this is  your boots on the ground explainer edition today   we're examining the brave fighting of the Israeli  air force in the war against Hamasbala the Houthis   in Yemen the Shia militias in Iraq and all the  other armed groups in this region that are acting   under the orders of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary  Guards Corps which is the head of the Axis of Evil   in the Middle East in just a moment before we take  off with all the details I want to invite you to   continue spreading the truth and to support us  with a click on the subscribe button it helps us   reach more people so let's begin with the fighting  in the Gaza Strip and how the Israeli Air Force   is doing its part the Air Force is changing the  way that it strikes in Gaza by making less use   of bombings by fire jets in favor of more precise  close support from maneuvering troops using UAVs   drones and attack helicopters in the first days  of operation Gideon's chariots the air force of   Israel acted with great intensity carrying out  hundreds of bombings sorties on Hamas and Islamic   Jihad targets throughout the Gaza Strip including  terrorists and mid-level commanders of Hamas   it included also tunnels and buildings that were  used for storing weapons and containing explosive   devices and weapon systems intended to harm IDF  maneuvering forces these strikes using heavy   munitions aimed to break Hamas's defensive lines  in Canunes in Javalia in northern Gaza in Gaza   City and in the central camps but now that the  IDF has deployed five divisions into the battle   including all its regular forces three armored  brigades five infantry brigades the commando   brigade and three combat engineering battalions  the Israeli air force had to shift its force   operation and moved to close support operations  mostly based on intelligence from the Shinbet and   military intelligence as well as fire control  centers of maneuvering battalions and brigades   operating numerous aircrafts over Gaza sky the  main firepower now comes from UAVs and attack   helicopters immediately available to strike in  response to battlefield developments and the   needs of the maneuvering ground forces this is  in contrast to what happened in the first days   of the war when the Israeli air force struck  every known terror command post in the field   sending hundreds of sorties every day utilizing  bunker busting bombs and focused GBU39 bargages   every intelligence marked target got personal  treatment from the sky there was a complete   focus on kamas targets including operational  squads headquarters launch sites and tunnels   running under residential buildings and public  institutions the first hitunes Jabalia Gaza   city and every refugee camp that turned into a  bunker for Hamas terrorists but then something   changed in this round the IDF went big on ground  operations instead of distant strikes and indirect   fires suddenly the air force stopped acting like  a detached squadron and became a soldier on the   company on the ground there was a shift from long  hours of coordination with headquarters to direct   and immediate connection to the forces at the  front lines of the battle anytime ground forces   spot a threat the Air Force responds like a team  member uavs and Apache helicopters circle above   not waiting for instructions they're part of the  immediate response so if a terrorist emerges he's   hit with pinpointed fire if there is suspicious  movement on a third floor the balcony vanishes   this shift is dramatic because kamas the terror  group that thought it ruled the field has suddenly   and totally lost control every building that they  thought was safe all of the sudden becomes a death   trap as soon as a UAV arrives every attempt  to set up an anti-tank squad is interrupted   in under 2 minutes this is no longer an air  force that bombs at night and then flies away   this is an aerial force living near the ground  spotting reacting and supporting the ground   fighters at every step it's not detached fire it's  tactical fire smart sharp and synchronized to the   platoon commander level this breaks Kamas's entire  operational logic they don't know whether the blow   will come from the ground from the air an alley  and a backyard intelligence assets follow them   from every angle and fire lands on them within  seconds of the emergence from cover and that this   exactly is what reinvents the whole concept  of combat in the Gaza Strip because for the   first time the air force doesn't just strike it  fights it doesn't just hammer bunkers it covers   its comrades it doesn't just prevent future  threats it eliminates threats mid battle and   when the warriors of the sky fight like soldiers  on the ground Hamas with all of their tunnels and   their slogans simply loses control it only reacts  and once an enemy is only reacting it's no longer   winning so guys continue spreading the truth  about Israel by sharing our videos on YouTube   and

and we know whose side   God is on and guys speaking of which since the  beginning of the war the Israeli air force has   struck countless times deep behind enemy lines in  dangerous territory this raises a question about   why Israel sends its planes and its pilots on  such dangerous missions far from home instead of   just responding to the Houthis or to the Iranian  missiles with our own long range missiles which we   have very very advanced missiles so on the surface  it seems simple launch a groundto ground missile   quickly and hit the target precisely with no risk  to our own warriors it even seems cheaper than   risking a fighter jet and a pilot training but  once you dig deeper the story changes entirely   one of the main claims from advocates of a  missile core attack in Iran and Yemen is the   cost angle and on this point they have a point  because a missile certainly is cheaper than a   fighter jet but then again the fighter jet that  struck in Yemen also conducted strikes in Gaza   also in Lebanon and Syria and Iran a missile is  a one-time use item once it's launched and hits   it's gun from inventory when comparing missile  costs to aircraft munitions the longer a missile's   range the more expensive it is a L missile with  a 400 km range costs about $3 million per unit   missiles with ranges of 1,500 to 2,000 km can  cost tens of millions each a medium or long   range missile costs 10 to 20 times more than an  aerial munition some missiles cost nearly as much   as a fighter jet which can perform missions for  40 years or more the maintenance cost of missiles   and launchers and the readiness infrastructure  are also no less than maintaining a fighter jet   so if you're talking about a serious missile  force it may cost even more than the aircraft   a missile launched to Yemen or to Iran carries  a warhead weighing half a ton to a ton and it is   effective only against a limited range of targets  furthermore launch preparations are relatively   easy to detect especially with long-range missiles  as we saw before during Iran's attacks of Israel   the launch itself is detectable and the trajectory  is fixed and interceptable just look at the   Iranian launches at Israel which included dozens  or even hundreds of ballistic missiles with only   marginal damage relative to cost and effort  to see how limited a missile's power can be   on the other hand a fighter jet can carry 10 to  11 tons of bombs and missiles and hit multiple   targets or change targets mid-flight if needed  the damage that a plane can inflict is therefore   significantly higher than a missile and beyond  that air launch munitions have better penetration   capabilities than missiles which is critical for  Israel when targeting underground infrastructure   and tunnels from Gaza to Iran to Yemen finally air  power can be approached from multiple directions   and fly below the radar making interception  very hard equally important from a political and   diplomatic angle jets allow plausible deniability  unlike groundto ground missiles yes munitions   launched from jets can also be intercepted as we  saw in Syria but because of their size price and   quantity many can be launched from several jets  overwhelming air defenses and hitting the target   this is far more cost effective and efficient  than using expensive missiles a missile core   is therefore nothing more than a niched used for  very specific targets it can be a force multiplier   but it cannot replace or substitute an active  air force no advanced country in the world has   a missile core instead of an air force or even as  a major part of one in fact terror groups and some   of Israel's hostile threats the states that are  attacking Israel rely on missiles and on rocket   forces because they do not have the ability  to maintain an advanced air force just look   at decades of rocket and missile attacks on Israel  to understand the differences so guys here at TBN

          <attvalue for="7" value="let's go to the latest developments in Gaza and the West Bank where the UN is struggling to get aid into the enclave while the IDF has fired warning shots near foreign diplomats in the West Bank david Sedfield is the director of Rise University's Baker Institute and is a former US envoy for Gaza aid he joins me now from Houston uh good to have you with us David appreciate your time now first to the news you know that the IDF had fired these uh what it calls warning shots at a group of foreign diplomats d touring in Janine in the West Bank how could this possibly have happened and and what you know would those diplomats be thinking you were one yourself uh in in the area i think the answer to this is a very simple one but it's also complex the simple answer is it's it's fog of combat fog of engagement the IDF is is heavily involved in operations in the West Bank as it is in Gaza um there is obviously a deconliction mechanism that's necessary in these kinds of circumstances my understanding is the diplomat's visit had been pre-arranged uh on a cleared route with the IDF what happened there will be the subject of investigation uh but there is obviously no justification uh for any form of risk uh or firing in the vicinity of diplomats yes i mean uh you mentioned fog of war the IDF says that you know this delegation had deviated from an approved path i mean is that is that a good enough excuse for the IDF well it's not a question of excuses it's an issue of of how to ensure that anyone uh who is conducting business that has been cleared by approved by the IDF is able to do so safely if the route was one that was not authorized by the IDF then that needs to come out in the form of investigation but we've seen many many cases in Gaza uh where humanitarian actors following completely approved routes no deviations uh still came under fire from or adjacent to fire by the IDF this kind of of problem deconliction problem uh has to be addressed at the highest levels okay let's uh look at the aid front you know we are still getting reports that the desperately needed food supplies are not really getting into those who really need them they're desperate for for them from your assessment where's the hold up look there there are two issues here first the population of Gaza approximately 2 million people has been denied uh humanitarian assistance since March 2nd uh the need is extreme a few trucks entering a few dozen or even a few hundred on a oneoff or two off basis won't address this need and because the need is so severe you have two problems the aid is inspected and moves to a platform a loading platform just inside Gaza it then has to be moved by the humanitarian agencies to their warehouses and from the warehouses to distribution points this has always been a difficult issue because those aid movements once they're within Gaza are subject to extraordinary security threat whether from lutters criminal gangs or what the humanitarian community calls self-distribution a desperate people taking the aid off of trucks off of lries as they move through my understanding is that the aid that's moved in over the past 72 hours a significant quantity has now been moved to the warehouses of the humanitarian actors away from that Gaza border platform but the point here is not what happened to a 100 trucks or 200 trucks you need hundreds of trucks a day 300 400 every day they're going to suffer predation initially and to keep it going yes and if Israel knows that in uh you know that the people in Gaza Palestinians there do need these hundreds and hundreds of trucks that you're talking about you know just to get by as well is there a a sense that you know this is a deliberate strategy to starve a population when Israel as a matter of declared state policy as it did at the beginning of March halts all movement of food humanitarian assistance that's state policy it started a clock ticking a powerful political international clock ticking which had to be addressed but the difficulty in Israel now and its political problem uh is you have two circles that need to be squared the recognition and I'm quite certain there is full recognition at the highest political levels and certainly within the Israeli Defense Forces they've got to get food in before actual starvation and famine appears that's one imperative the other imperative is purely political it's within the coalition it's within the cabinet of how do you meet that requirement to move assistance without triggering the threatened departure from government uh of two uh extreme nationalist parties from uh Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition it's the attempt to combine both of those imperatives that have created the difficulties but frankly unless the volume of assistance by the international humanitarian community increases and increases rapidly there will be at a point in coming weeks where famine and starvation do appear it's not a controversial point it's well understood it needs to be addressed now while there is time remaining and what's we've seen uh you know international pressure on um on Benjamin Netanyahu we'll speak about that later but can you give us a sense you've been to Gaza of at this moment how Palestinians are then viewing um Hamas as it is because it's it's still a force where it is there is little doubt that the Palestinian population of Gaza does not have strong support for Hamas hamas has brought this disaster this miserable uh situation of suffering onto the Palestinian people no question about that at all indeed the popularity of Hamas is lowest in Gaza if you take polling throughout the Arab world but still Hamas on the ground possesses the gun possesses the ability to influence the population and that's the difficulty where the IDF is not physically present in force hamas is the effective presence it has not been eliminated and and I'll make the point here elimination of Hamas i put the phrase in quotes how do you achieve that it's a goal everyone supports it's a vicious terrorist group it has agency it has produced this suffering it sustains the suffering of the Gazin people but you need both military pressure and you need a political framework and it's the political framework which has been absent uh during these past 19 months who might be responsible for the political framework i we are looking at actors beyond Israel and Gaza here well we are looking primarily at the government of Israel and I don't listen to analysts such as me on this listen to the public calls of the most senior Israeli national security leadersh who said the ability to eliminate Hamas through kinetic through military means only uh that can't be done you do need military pressure absolutely but you also need a framework and that framework is not just important for any resolution in Gaza that addresses Hamas it's critical to bringing in stabilization reconstruction assistance from the Arab world it's vital to the conclusion of the so-called Saudi deal that needs that political commitment from the government of Israel to a negotiated permanent status resolution those are hard words to hear in a traumatized Israel and I fully understand that but hard words are sometimes necessary to be spoken and that political framework is an essential element of anything in Gaza other than a continuation of desperation radicalization and misery and just briefly um are sanction sanctions against Israel or the threat of sanctions by some countries uh going to make any difference i do not believe those threats or application of sanctions are a useful tool in this situation look Hamas as I said has agency hamas created this in the massacre that occurred on October 7th 23 it could end the suffering of the Gazin people tonight this afternoon if it elected to do so it hasn't and it won't why because it believes it will win and a victory by Hamas its survival is a threat first and foremost of course to Israel and Israelis but also to the region as a whole so no I don't believe sanctions are appropriate what is appropriate is continued counseling which I have no doubt is coming from the United States as well as other friends of Israel partners of Israel that this situation needs to change and it cannot change solely through application of military force okay Dr david uh David Satderfield thank you so much for your insights into this thank you so much thank you" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="- The Mossad has executed some of the most audacious spy missions on earth, going deep undercover into hostile territory, catching terror masterminds who seem untouchable and duping militant groups into buying rigged electronics through a ruse so elaborate no one suspects a thing until they explode without warning. The Mossad waits until terrorists feel safe, and then it reminds them that they aren't. - We are a global production company. We write the screenplay. We're the directors, we're the producers. We're the main actors. The world is our stage. - So how has the Mossad managed to take down some of its most elusive targets? Successful spies are masters of tradecraft. Strategies that help them gather intel without getting caught. It can take months or even years. But a good spy is patient. A good spy can wait over a decade for the payoff, and then when the target least expects it, the Mossad sends a little message. We're watching. We're waiting. There is no escape. No one is out of reach. Not even a ghost. Even when he was alive, Imad Mughniyeh was a ghost. And not the friendly kind. He'd always been extreme. As a teenager in Beirut, he controlled a savage gang that prowled the streets enforcing Islamic law, mostly by beating up drug suppliers and female escorts. But he had bigger ambitions. By the time he turned 21, he was second-in-command of a new shadowy terror organization, Hezbollah. Within months of assuming the position, he masterminded two blasts that claimed hundreds of lives. - 191 Marines dead in the explosion at their headquarters at the Beirut Airport. - He oversaw some of the most barbaric abductions the West had ever seen. And his reach extended well beyond his home turf. Mughniyeh ruthlessly targeted Israelis and Jews around the world. Israel had to eliminate him. But Mughniyeh was crafty, really crafty. All Israel had to identify him was one washed out photo. For over 20 years, no spy agency could catch him, not even the Mossad, which employed some creative strategies to lure him out of hiding like assassinating his brother, another Hezbollah operative. Mossad waited for Mughniyeh at the funeral. But Mughniyeh was too crafty to show up. His brother was buried without him, and the Mossad seemed to be out of luck. He was a ghost, a puff of smoke that no one could pin down. Until Hezbollah made a mistake. In 2004, Israel took out Ghaleb Awali, a senior Hezbollah commander. In a touching show of sentimentality, Hezbollah's propaganda department memorialized him in a short film. Bad move. Because the Mossad got their hands on the video, analyzing every frame for new information. They didn't expect to spot a ghost on camera, but there he was, standing next to Hezbollah's leader, Imad Mughniyeh in the flesh. It was the first sighting of Mughniyeh in decades. Now, Israel knew what he looked like, and they knew that if he was near Nasrallah he was probably somewhere in Lebanon. Where? And how would they get to him? As they pondered ways to reach Mughniyeh, Mossad pulled off a huge win. They hacked into the Iranian government system, which kept files on its allies and proxies, including Mughniyeh. And that's how the Mossad found out he'd been living in Damascus under an assumed name since 2006. It was the breakthrough they'd been waiting for. It was also a problem because Syria was a target country, an enemy state where undercover operations are especially dangerous. Organizing an assassination attempt would require lots of reconnaissance trips into Syria. But Syrian security was vigilant and sophisticated, and everyone knew what they do to a captured Israeli spy. It was too risky for Israeli agents to make the trips into Damascus. So the Mossad did something highly unusual. They ask the Americans for help. But the CIA has a strict policy of not picking fights with neutral countries. And at the time, Syria and the US had diplomatic relations. They couldn't just carry out an assassination on Syrian soil willy-nilly, or could they? Turns out they could. The US had their own reasons for wanting Mughniyeh gone, including the fact that he'd been sending men into Iraq to carry out strikes against American troops. So the CIA agreed to help under two conditions. One, the Israelis could target Mughniyeh and only Mughniyeh. That meant that if anyone else was in the vicinity, the whole operation was off. And two, US agents would help find Mughniyeh, but the Mossad would be the ones to take him out. The Israelis agreed. It was time for an exorcism. As American agents tailed Mughniyeh, they found the pious family man had a weakness. Syrian security services had supplied him with three women to be his special friends. He would drive to see them on his own, a surprising lapse in security for someone who was otherwise totally obsessed with staying out of danger. Because Mughniyeh was no dummy he knew he was a target, and he and his bodyguards were careful to check often for detonators inside and under his car, but they didn't think to check the case holding the spare tire in the back of a slick silver SUV. Bingo. This was it. If the Mossad could get some kind of blast material into the tire cover, Mughniyeh was going down. For months, Mughniyeh had a constant tail, watching and waiting for the right moment when his car was unattended. One night, while Mughniyeh was getting cozy with one of his lady friends, Mossad agents swooped in. They exchanged his tire cover for a new one, which had a special device that would eliminate Mughniyeh without causing any other casualties. The weapon was ready. Now they just needed everything else to fall into place. For weeks, Mossad operatives waited on edge. They almost detonated the charge 32 times, stopping at the last minute when Mughniyeh got into his car too quickly or when he got too close to another person. They didn't forget their agreement with the CIA. The target was Mughniyeh and only Mughniyeh. The 33rd time was the charm. On chilly February evening, Mughniyeh left the meeting with Syrian intelligence and other Hezbollah officers alone. This was it. As they drew closer to his car, the agents detonated. Mughniyeh was finally gone. After 30 years, they'd gotten the ghost. This wasn't Israel's first time executing a daring mission in enemy territory. They'd done it before and they would do it again, but the results would bring some unanticipated scrutiny. Dubai is the so-called playground of the rich in the Middle East. It's home to some eye-wateringly tall skyscrapers, improbable indoor ski hills, and the pristine turquoise waters of the Persian Gulf. It's also where some of Earth's most notorious militants conduct their business. Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh was one of these militants. Israel had wanted him for two decades, ever since the '80s when he and an accomplice had kidnapped and murdered two Israeli soldiers. Mahmoud was cold as ice. He admitted that his only regret was that he hadn't shot the gun himself. 20 years later, Mahmoud was coordinating weapon shipments for Hamas, running the network that moved Iranian weapons into the Gaza Strip, weapons that Hamas used to attack Israelis. It was time to get rid of him. The question was where and how? Mahmoud spent a lot of his time in countries like Syria, China, Iran, and Sudan. Not exactly Israel's buddies, but Mahmoud was a frequent flyer to another destination, Dubai. In 2009, the Emirati government was none too friendly to Israel. Dubai was risky, but it was the best of bad options. Tons of foreigners passed through the Emirate, which meant Mossad operatives could easily pose as tourists. And Dubai security wasn't as sophisticated as Iran's or Syria's. The Israelis figured that no investigation would get very far. Mistake number one. In 2009, Mossad deployed a hit squad to spy on Mahmoud and learn his habits. They entered the UAE undercover using false identities and foreign passports, passports that in some cases belonged to real people who had no idea that the Mossad had borrowed their documents. A few months later, they broke out those same foreign passports and returned to Dubai, this time to eliminate Mahmoud by poison. The mission was a failure. All the poison ended up doing was making Mahmoud feel a little unwell. The good news was that he never realized it was the Israelis that were the source of his illness. The bad news was that he was still at large and the Mossad was determined that the next time they tried to eliminate him, nothing could go wrong. So in January 2010, Israel's hit squad landed in Dubai for the third time, using the same foreign names and passports as before. Mistake number two. The hit squad wasn't sure where Mahmoud would stay, so they broke into small teams and checked into different hotels. Some paid in cash, but other agents paid with debit cards issued by one specific company, a company that was run by an Israeli. Mistake number three. Because the team was scattered around the city, they had to communicate with each other in real-time, so they used cell phones. But cell phones are very easy to track. So they didn't call each other directly, instead, the agents called a central switchboard in Austria, which connected them automatically to each other. Mistake number four. Any well-trained spy knows the part of successful tradecraft is switching up their look, new wigs, different hats, glasses, and even a costume or two. The hit squad had this technique down pat. They came prepared with disguises. Some posed as tennis players. One guy even entered a bathroom bald as a cue ball and left it with the head of luxurious hair. But even if they could evade the attention of other people, there were silent eyes watching them all the time. Dubai's hotels were absolutely chock-full of security cameras. Cameras that saw and recorded everything. Mistake number five. Just six hours after Mahmoud landed in Dubai, the hit squad broke into his hotel room. It took 20 minutes to accomplish the mission. After locking the room from the inside, the hit squad hightailed it outta the hotel and onto the flights. Mahmoud lay in bed after what looked like a heart attack. At first, the hotel security officers who found him thought they had just stumbled on a random tourist who had the misfortune to croak on vacation. The authorities didn't know it was Hamas' weapons guy. They only knew Mahmoud under the false name he traveled under. His body went to the morgue, and nobody thought about it again. Until Hamas started to get suspicious. You don't just ignore Hamas when they call. So when Mahmoud stopped picking up his phone, they knew something was off. One of their agents searched police stations and morgues until he found Mahmoud. And now the Dubai authorities were in for a nasty surprise. That random tourist not actually a tourist. That heart attack wasn't a heart attack at all, but the work of the Mossad. Dubai Security Services were furious at Hamas for using Dubai as a base for illegal activity, and at the Mossad, which had just assassinated someone in their city. They scoured airline passenger lists, looking for anyone who had traveled to Dubai around the same time as Mahmoud. A series of foreign names kept appearing and reappearing. Authorities crosschecked these names against hotel guest lists. And those silent eyes, Dubai's huge network of security cameras, gave them another piece of the puzzle. The faces of the agents. With the names of the agents in hand, investigators looked at data, a lot of data. Data like debit cards that were traced back to a company headed by an Israeli, phone calls that were all mysteriously routed to the same switchboard in Austria. Information that made it glaringly obvious that a group of people seemingly scattered around Dubai had actually acted in unison. Dubai's lead investigator was able to cobble together all the security footage to retrace the footsteps of the hit squad, almost to the minute. This grainy, silent movie wasn't gonna win any Oscars, but the evidence was irrefutable. Dubai wasn't the only angry government. Had the Mossad used real passports or had forged them? To the countries involved, it didn't really matter. They felt manipulated. And Israel couldn't afford to alienate their allies. The diplomatic fallout from this episode was intense. - France condemns this assassination. Murder is no way to carry out international relations. - The Dubai passports incidents also constitutes a clear and direct breach of confidential undertakings between Australia and Israel dating back some years. - On paper, the mission was a success. They'd eliminated Mahmoud temporarily interrupting Hamas' flow of weapons, but the operation was a bust. The Mossad had burned a number of agents and exposed its tradecraft secrets, which weren't even that sophisticated to begin with. It was a mortifying episode, but a useful one, because Israel learned a lot about what not to do. And though it took over a decade, they eventually put those lessons to good use. Remember this video from June 2024? I'm not a betting guy, but I'm willing to put money on the fact that over the next few years, Israeli secret agents are going to go on some pretty wild missions. After all, the Israeli government has vowed to take down every single person who planned the attack of October 7th. Turns out that was a pretty safe bet. Here's the story of how a broken air conditioner almost foiled Israel's operation to get rid of a top October 7th Mastermind. Ismail Haniyeh had been involved with Hamas since he graduated from university. By the time the terror group wrested control of the Gaza Strip in a bloody coup, he was in charge. For a decade, he ruled Hamas with an iron fist. But by 2017, he traded the Gaza Strip for Qatar, one of the richest countries in the Middle East. As millions of Gazans struggled to put food on the table, Haniyeh lived in the lap of luxury with a net worth of $4 billion. What a leader, right? As for why Haniyeh was enjoying the good life in Qatar, well, it's complicated. Qatar has hosted Hamas' leadership since 2012 at the request of the United States, which wanted an easier way to talk to the terror group. Israel agreed to respect this arrangement. That meant attacking any Hamas operatives on Qatari soil was absolutely out of the question. And Israel was not about to repeat the Dubai debacle and risk alienating its most important ally, the United States. If they were going to get Haniyeh, they'd have to wait for him to leave Qatar. Problem was, Haniyeh spent most of his time in Turkey, Russia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, highly dangerous countries for Israeli operatives. And when he was visiting Iran, Haniyeh wasn't exactly couch surfing. He stayed in one of Tehran's most heavily guarded hotels, the guest house of the Islamic Republic's notorious military, the IRGC. The IRGC is powerful, dangerous and sophisticated. But even they weren't immune to Israel's tradecraft. In May 2024, an unexpected event sparked one of the Mossad's most ambitious assassinations. On a cool spring day, Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi's helicopter unexpectedly crashed into a remote mountainside. No one in Israel or most of Iran was shedding any tears over Raisi. He was a monster, responsible for executing several thousand political prisoners in Iran. But right away, Israel realized they had a golden opportunity. The helicopter crash meant Iran would hold the state funeral, and shortly thereafter, the inauguration of a new president. And as a key figure in Iran's terror proxy network, Ismail Haniyeh would undoubtedly attend both events, which left Israel with just weeks to plan the assassination that would finally take Haniyeh out. Someone working for the Israeli smuggled the device into the IRGC guest house carefully positioned in Haniyeh's room. Some news reports say the device was placed soon after Raisi's crash, while others claim it was placed a couple months later, just moments before the detonation. We still don't know who or how or when, but we do know this, as the inauguration festivities wound down and Haniyeh made his way back to his room, a team of agents was waiting on tender hooks for go time. And then, the AC broke down? July in the Middle East is hot. Even the bad guys need to stay cool. So when Haniyeh left to get his air conditioning fixed, the team feared he was switching rooms. A twist of fate which would have led to a very different ending to this. But after a while, Haniyeh came back, but he didn't have long to enjoy the room because in the early hours of July 31st, 2024, a boom shook the IRGC guest house. And the man who had mastermind of the 10/7 attacks, the man responsible for tens of thousands of de*ths was finally gone. But the w*r was far from over. Since that horrific day in October, Israel had been fighting on multiple fronts. At first, they focused on Hamas, but as Hezbollah rockets reigned down on Israel's northern communities driving 60,000 Israelis from their homes, it was clear that the situation couldn't continue. It was time to take down Hezbollah. Back in 2014, Taylor Swift had just dropped her hit single, Shake It Off. Russia was hosting the Winter Olympics. And Israel, usually known for its high tech, was in the business of making clunky walkie-talkies for a very special customer. That customer was Hezbollah who were in the market for walkie-talkies for their fighters. They're the perfect method of communication on a battlefield, instant and secure. So Israel seized on the opportunity. Their plan was simple. Copy a popular Japanese design Hezbollah liked, replace some of the battery components with tiny blast devices, and convince Hezbollah to buy them. Easy-peasy. Using a complex network of shell companies, Israel sold 16,000 walkie-talkies to Hezbollah operatives. And then, for 10 years, they sat back and waited. Like KGB sleeper spies from the Cold War, the walkie-talkie seemed innocent. In reality, there were deadly weapons ready to activate at a moment's notice. Fast forward a few years, a female Mossad agent had a bright idea. Why not do the same with pagers? Rig some unassuming looking pagers, and voila, you have a handheld, remote controlled, exploding device. Pagers are the dinosaurs of communication devices. For the most part, they're a museum piece. - That belongs in a museum! - But for a terror group like Hezbollah, pagers had a lot of appeal. Pagers don't have much function other than receiving a message. But their limited utility also means that they can't be electronically hacked, perfect for a group that doesn't wanna be tracked. Initially, the Mossad said, nah, not enough people in Hezbollah were using pagers to warrant the effort it would take to make and distribute them. But over time, Hezbollah's higher ups were getting antsy about using cell phones, which could be hacked and tracked. It was too big a risk. So Israel jumped. They even got a team to flood Arab social media with fake news. about Israel's amazing ability to hack cell phones, trying to fool Hezbollah into looking for more secure alternatives like pagers. The Mossad knew that Hezbollah would be suspicious of new technology companies trying to sell them products. So Israel had to work within their existing supplier system. But the suppliers couldn't know either. Everything had to seem above board, which meant Mossad had to go deep. Hezbollah got its devices from a Taiwanese technology company. So Israel set up a shell company based in Budapest, which bought a licensing agreement from Gold Apollo to manufacture a new line of beepers. This new product line was bigger, more rugged and more durable, and it came with a little surprise embedded in the battery. - What a surprise. - Israeli engineers spent months testing and tweaking the pagers, which were designed to maim rather than kill. The blast radius was tiny. Only the person carrying the beeper would be injured. It was the most targeted attack the world had ever seen. The Mossad left nothing to chance. They tested which ringtones would be most compelling and how long it would take for someone to check their beeper after being paged. To convince Hezbollah that the pagers were a worthwhile investment, Israel tapped again into the power of social media, creating slick ads that played on YouTube. Even legitimate customers were interested, but the Israelis dissuaded them by quoting absurdly high prices. Of course, these customers had no idea they were really talking to the Mossad. Meanwhile, the sales team made Hezbollah an offer they couldn't refuse. The first batch of beepers were free, and they'd offer a discount if they bought in bulk. Hezbollah fell for it, hook, line, and sinker. By the fall of 2023, they'd handed out thousands of pagers to their operatives, but Israel was on borrowed time. One of Hezbollah's top technicians was starting to get suspicious that the walkie-talkies Hezbollah had bought 10 years earlier might actually be incendiary devices. He was asking one too many questions. So Israel shut him down permanently with an airstrike. And mid-September 2024, the now or never moment came. Israel's military intelligence learned that Hezbollah had asked Iran to examine the pagers, worried they might contain explosives. It was time to act. Five days later, in the middle of the afternoon, an encrypted message went out to the rigged pagers triggering the hidden detonators. Seconds later, a wave of explosions sounded all across Lebanon. The country was in shock, but Israel wasn't done yet. A few days later, they activated the walkie-talkies. 10 years of waiting were over. Hundreds of Hezbollah's fighters were taken out of action. Their communications network was shattered. And in one of the biggest blows to the terror organization, Israel capitalized on Hezbollah's weakness to finally assassinate its elusive leader, Hassan Nasrallah. It was the stuff of spy thrillers. So unlikely, it seems impossible. But that's the Mossad's MO, they have to remain adaptable, they have to think outside the box, they have to strike when they're least expected. Not every mission succeeds, but when they do, they remind Israel's enemies that Jews fight back, and that the Mossad is always watching, working overtime to protect their tiny nation." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="chaos at aid distribution sites in southern Gaza the UN has distanced itself from the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that's backed by the US and Israel what's behind this move to establish a separate aid mechanism and what needs to change to help desperate Palestinians this is Inside Story [Music] hello and welcome to the program i'm Fib Batibbo gaza has been under total blockade by Israel for nearly 3 months aid agencies have been stopped from delivering the most basic of supplies leaving 2.3 million people starving now the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is delivering food packages but it's backed by Israel and the US and uses American security contractors its first attempt at distribution allowed in very limited numbers of people and turned into chaos the foundation has also faced strong criticism from the UN and other aid agencies they say it doesn't allow humanitarian principles and appears to be weaponizing aid so why has Israel decided to let in some aid and only under an agency it backs could this be part of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's stated plan to take control of Gaza and ultimately what does this mean for Palestinians who are starving we'll get to our guests in just a moment first this report from Imagin Kimber all these people are desperate for aid to hold off starvation inflicted by Israel that has barely let any food into the strip for nearly 3 months we're dying of hunger the children are saying &quot;Father I want to eat so I want to salivate my blood to feed them we can't find anything to eat.&quot; This aid is being distributed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation or GHF that is backed by Israel and the US and based in Switzerland the organization's plan has been criticized by the UN and other aid groups who say it appears to weaponize aid chaos broke out during the first delivery of food with Israeli soldiers opening fire as people rushed forward several Palestinians were killed others were too desperate to hold back we don't care about gunfire or shelling what matters for us is to bring food to our children israel says the GHF is a mechanism designed to assume control of all delivery of aid in Gaza and exclude aid organizations like the UN we're going to put many more of these and the idea is basically to take away the humanitarian looting as a tool of war of kamas to give it to the population eventually to have a sterile uh zone in the south of Gaza where the entire population can move for its own protection israel has long claimed Hamas loot supplies but this has never been proven and the armed group denies the allegation the UN criticized the operation on Tuesday saying pictures of the chaos were heartbreaking to say the least and explained why it won't be involved we do not participate in this modality it is a distraction from what is actually needed which is a reopening of all the crossings into Gaza a secure environment within Gaza and faster facilitation of permissions and final approvals of all uh the emergency supplies that we have just outside the border it needs to get in other international organizations are also boycotting the scheme saying it doesn't follow humanitarian principles if there is a reduction in the number of sites where people can access assistance that would effectively reduce uh or exclude the most vulnerable people in Gaza from accessing aid it's not feasible that's not practical in addition to that humanitarian assistance is only humanitarian when it's delivered independent from political and military objectives israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly stated Israel aims to control all of Gaza and wants Palestinians to leave and critics say controlling and limiting aid would appear to fit that plan imaging Kimber Al Jazer for Inside Story let's now bring in our guests in London is Chris Gunners former director of communications for UNRA the UN agency for Palestinian Refugees in Gaza City is Amjad Shaw who's the director of the Palestinian NOS's network also in London Ial Visman who's a professor at Goldsmith the University of London and author of the least of all possible evils humanitarian violence from Iran to Gaza welcome to the program gentlemen thank you so much for being with us i'm Jad Shaw in Gaza City let me begin with you the images that we saw from Rafa were shocking they were heartbreaking as a humanitarian from Gaza when you saw those pictures of of people climbing fences crying for food being shot at what did that moment represent were you surprised or was this to be expected thank you yes it was very sad moments as we used to have along the 600 days of war but this time it's uh shown how much the effect of the starvation that the people had to walk about two and a half hours to reach this m military basement guarded by militants in order to get some food back to their malnutrition children these people were insulted suffocated all the time but this time it's different and difficult and what we witnessed that this as I said that these militants shot and the Israeli army shot towards these crowds who were just trying to get some food and this scared me because this is the application of Netanyahu plan to force the people to displace from Gaza north right towards Rafa as he want as his plan for I'm before we get into what's motivating the this plan uh by the Israelis uh let me just ask you uh you know what you heard and what you saw about the aid that was distributed what was actually in the aid package that was given to to some of the people in in Rafa i read that some of it mostly was dried and prepackaged food like uh pasta and beans food that needs to be cooked i understand but that's extremely difficult right now in Gaza isn't it yes very limited amount of items which I think it's for two three days of family of five six members so just to let you know that we as a humanitarian we will not let this happen along the 19 months of the war we used to get the supplies the humanitarian supplies to the people to the neighborhoods to the sides not to get the people from where they are to these military basement to have small amount of aid and we are working in kind of compreh comprehensive approach not only just to distribute such minimal amount of aid and to use this way of dealing with the people and to shoot towards them by fire and to have tens of people who were injured this kind of insulting of our people it's very serious and to be considered that this is the real plan of the Israeli not to elevate the suffering of the people but also to deepen the humanitarian catastrophe this will not solve the problem of starvation caused by the Israeli occupation through denial of the entry of the supplies to Gaza all right Chris Gunnness let me come to you and ask you about your reaction i mean you've seen many crises during your time at at UNRA what did you make of the scenes in Rafa i'm calling the GHF the genocide humanitarian fig leaf because that's precisely what this is it's a fig leaf for genocide when an army that's been committing a genocide against 2.5 million people and starving it out in the way that it has done allows in just a handful of trucks of course this is going to happen and according to unconfirmed ICRC sources six people at least six people were killed by gunshot wounds and um well over 40 were injured because of gunshot wounds and this is what happens when you let an aid organization be taken over by a bunch of cowboys a bunch of mercenaries a bunch of people who have absolutely no track record in delivering aid to situations like Gaza there was no community consultation that's absolutely essential when you're delivering aid there was no attempt even to set up proper infrastructure we saw the laughable pictures at the beginning of your show of those it looked like a cattle pen it was that insulting for the people of Gaza um there was no attempt to prepare the community there was no consultation there was no attempt to get the infrastructure up and running and this gets to a very important point only UNRA has the warehouses the food distribution centers the staff 12,000 staff who have been working all the way through this crisis delivering food coincidentally everybody um so you know it's it's an appalling situation it's insulting that you know Gaza should be a successful the most successful export economy on the Mediterranean they've been reduced to abject food dependency in violation of international law it's disgrace this operation should end right now the crossing should be opened and UNRA and the other professionals in the UN agency unra has a track record going back to the 1st of May 1950 that's when they started delivering aid in Palestine the professionals should take over from the amateurs all they're going to see is more needless killing but Chris of course the Israelis and the Americans have said this operation was successful even if there was a a bit of chaos at the start of it and they say they'll continue it uh I let me come to you now you your thoughts about what's happened what went wrong with this alternative plan was it flawed in in design was it flawed in execution or both you know it's exactly the difference between a plan hatched on paper on computer screen somewhere in Tel Aviv or in Washington people think in the abstract and the reality of starved people um being channeled um into this degrading architecture of control and supervision being you know uh pushed there um by starvation and of course to expect people that are starving um to be um controlled in an organized way is completely idiotic of course you would see those scenes uh of chaos and of course that chaos as much as it is uh something that whenever we see an architecture of control being overrun by people there is some hope in that in in the people's sort of response to um all attempt to control them there is a price to pay the the the the food has not been distributed right this is a completely idiotic plan and we see the result of it right and I think that Yeah and Chris I wanted to uh Chris made an important point yal uh about the why I mean why establish a parallel untested aid mechanism when the UN and established NOS's have the capacity and the experience and the networks to distribute this aid what do you think yal this suggests about the motives behind this uh GHF operation and and this new system of aid distribution that the Americans and Israelis are backing i mean what what is ultimately the motive behind this so I think according to our analysis is this is the endgame of the genocide this is the final stage of it um we have seen in very early on during the genocide the complete systematic destruction of all agriculture and fisheries that is the capacity of Palestinians for food sovereignty to feed themselves uh then we've seen the destruction of all um aid distribution centers um we have seen it in early on in attacks on bakeries then we've seen it moving into attacks on aid convoys that was going on that enabled Israel to exercise control over allowing aid in through the checkpoints okay so Israel wanted full control over aid what they couldn't have uh exercise control of is over the distribution so this is why I call it the endgame of the genocide where Israel is trying to wrestle control over the last element that fell outside of their control is the actual distribution of aid so they've created starvation and during the last 3 months they've intentionally created starvation in order to to to supposedly come up with a remedy for it pushing through the starvation people into the infrastructure uh that that they've put in place which we've seen has been overrun at the get-go amjan I'll come to you in a moment but uh Chris you wanted to jump in chris go ahead to what extent do you think this plan is about feeding people i mean when Netanyahu was trying to justify the genocide humanitarian fig leaf um he said they were doing this because Hamas was stealing aid cindy McCain the head of the World Food Program said in the American media o on the record over the weekend that there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that Hamas is stealing aid and there's plenty of evidence that gangs who are enabled by Israel have been taking some of the food so let's just get that right there is no justification whatsoever in blaming Hamas let me ask about that Chris because um I think the other really sorry yeah on that point I just wanted to get Amjad on that point because he's on the ground of course in Gaza uh that argument Amjad that Chris mentioned there that's being raised by the Israelis and Americans that you know this they're pushing for this plan because you know the aid is being diverted by Hamas to to what extent is there credible evidence of that happening on the ground at at a large scale aid being diverted what have you seen in regards to that let me start out by the the the the humanitarian system the traditional one the UN the Angels and the National Angels which was attacked by the Israelis since the beginning of this war mainly the Honora which is the backbone for the humanitarian aid which was banned by the Israeli conet and now nothing entered to honor and most of the honora premises destroyed and also there's about 280 staff members of Anora were killed also the national NOS's the international there's so many restrictions of the work of this humanitarian structure and then now you know they want to make it collapsing so now they are trying to replace it by this military mechanism and the aid convoys which used to come through Karma Abu Salam commercial crossing there is in certain areas which is controlled by the Israel There is there is gangs who stop these convoys and under the Israeli observation and this happened so many times till the last week there was a convoy of flower about 15 tracks which was looted by militants in in Salah street which is this area is evac forcible evacuated and the quadcopter is over so it's this thing that we have very credible humanitarian system and we are working with the humanitarian principles to be applied in our distribution wherever the people are but this time through the provocation of Israel in this system along the time they wanted to smoothly put this uh Gaza humanitarian foundation on the track it's not for Gaza it's not a humanitarian and it's not a foundation for Gaza Palestinians it's to serve the Israeli security and politics all right Chris I'll let you continue your your thought about to what extent is the GF GHF plan less about feeding people and more about using aid as a tool to to reshape uh the political and territorial reality of Gaza well what we're seeing is force displacement and we're seeing ethnic cleansing under the opaces as it were um of this operation and as a I think quite correctly said this is the endgame of the genocide that you know you bomb these people into submission and trying to force them out of Gaza um but you know I look at the donors because the donors have allowed this to get to where it is the donors have sat on their hands and watched the Israelis try to dismantle UNRA there was a totally fictitious smear campaign based on the lie that was later shown by the Colona report the independent report to be a complete lie that UNRA staffers were involved in the October attacks the donors then withdrew their funding on the basis of absolutely nothing well those donors need to step up to the plate both politically they have to do what the ICJ has demanded and have a sanctions program against Israel so there has to be the political the economic they got to obviously stop supplying America Britain Germany these other countries stop supplying the genocidal weaponry and on the other side they have to step up to the plate in terms of first of all stopping the starvation then they've got to start doing the recovery these are the donors and then they've got to look at the complete reconstruction of Gaza it sounds daunting and it is daunting you know there are there are thousands and thousands of unexlo pieces of unexloded ordinance that have to be cleared but in 2014 after a devastating war not as bad as this one Gaza to some extent to a large extent was rebuilt you give the Palestinians the opportunity to do this and they will perform let me tell you I've seen it time and time again okay let me ask you then uh EA Chris mentioned the ICJ there and whether you think these recent events will uh affect the genocide case against Israel at the ICJ i mean the provisional measures that the ICJ called for was for Israel to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid and avoid actions that worsen the livelihoods of Palestinians but from what we've seen in Gaza especially yesterday that hasn't happened so how might these events impact that case so look you know Israel's defense uh on January 2024 was that it is warning the population it's providing aid and it's moving people for their safety now in the current operation it is admitting that the ethnic cleansing a force population transfer of Palestinians to places in southern Gaza are the aim of the operation so it's completely undermining its own arguments that you know were laughable already in January 2024 but now are clearly uh seen to be what they are when we speak about the endgame of the genocide Palestinians will be faced with and this is Israel's plan with two choices to leave Gaza under the Trump or any other plan or to die in Gaza and that in order to do that one has to create the space in which it is happen this is why uh spatial architectural analysis is very important in in cases like that because architecture when an architect works on a plan there is an intention to a plan it is very clear in architectural analysis to see what is the intention when you build a building you have a certain program to do that so we ask ourself what is the spatial architecture of Gaza designed for if not for the genocide of the people if not a transference of the entirety of the population to the one part of Gaza that has no agriculture that is no development uh within it there's no infrastructure so that every bit of infrastructure every bit of necessity that people need will be in the hands of the Israelis Now now we think that might be some kind of charity that Israel is uh is doing to the people of Gaza by delivering some sort of laughable amount of aid this is not charity firstly Israel is forced into doing that they wouldn't have done it if they wouldn't do it and so there's been the suggestion that this could also be in order to in order to bring the population into the places right by the Gaza Egypt border where just one more push would see them out of and there's also been the suggestion that this is also about starving support for Hamas about you know getting civilians Palestinian civilians to distance themselves from Hamas in the hopes of political change what do you make of that oh but you know I think I think both Chris and Amjad said it very clearly palestinian society is accustomed in the distribution and division of aid they know how to do it uh there are infrastructure of UNRA other organizations in Gaza that know how to divide the aid the the society knows how to do it it's been living under a a murderous blockade for two decades and it has learned how to do that uh very well no plan done by some architects on the outside or implemented by people without experience in humanitarian aid could replicate that palestinians know how to do that chris your your thoughts about the the motives and also this idea that this could be a way uh to to push Palestinians to distance themselves from Hamas and and lead to political change within Gaza look that's a joke i go back to the um elections in January 2006 where the world thought &quot;Oh we'll let Hamas stand in elections they won't get enough votes that'll split the Palestinians and there'll be no partner for peace we'll never have to do a two-state solution.&quot; I mean at every stage the international community led by Israel has completely got wrong the analysis on the Palestinian side and of course I mean of course the analysis is very much wishful thinking and here again we have more wishful thinking the idea that people will do Israel's bidding in Gaza do what the IDF has been incapable of doing for so long in spite of saying time and time again that they're waging this genocidal war in over in order to destroy Hamas destroy a political movement haha i mean we all know that you can't bomb a political and a social movement with high altitude bombers and this is going to be no different i mean all that's happened is Hamas is constantly um being reinforced as it were politically and in all other respects and I think this is going to backfire but I mean the good news is you can't spin genocide you really can't spin genocide you can dress it up as much as you can and I think the scales are falling from the eyes 19 months too late of course I think the Germans and who knows i mean the Brits too though they continue to sell 127 million pounds worth of military aid but you know you saw Trump raging spontaneously apparently against Putin maybe in one of his capricious fits he'll suddenly turn on Netanyahu and make some spontaneous decision to cut all military aid i mean who knows what motivates we have heard that change of tone yeah we have heard that change of tone from the Europeans but not yet from the Trump administration uh Amjad let me come to you now and ask you your thoughts about what we've heard from both Chris and EAL and also the important question um that raised and the choice that Palestinians in Gaza faced today um leave or stay and die in Gaza what is the mood on the ground i think yesterday there was a boom you know about this issue and about 85% of the Gazan sits clearly that they will stay in Gaza whatever the situation is nothing will abort us from here this is our land and this is where we belong to and we will not fulfill what Israel and Netanyahu want to reoccupy Gaza without its people and we are not investment project for any so the issue of our forcible displacement whatever the conditions will be we are staying here in Gaza North and the international community has to work hard in order to stop this genocide this war against civilians against the children against women to open the crossings to reenter the aid supplies which is waiting now for three months and part of it expired and damaged because of the denial of the Israeli towards it its entrance and the same time to protect the civilians every day yes I'm talking about starvation but the issue of killing of children women elders and to burn the bodies under their tents this thing has to be stopped and justice for these victims must be there thank you so much gentlemen thank you for for a great uh discussion an important discussion to have today thank you i'm Jad Shaw Chris Gunnis Eel

          <attvalue for="7" value="one of the first things Israel did after Hamas burst out of Gaza killing over 1,400 Israelis and taking around 200 hostages was bomb two Syrian airports Syria said Thursday that Israeli missiles had targeted airports in Damascus and Aleppo confused yeah well it's confusing Syria's a long way from Gaza Hamas doesn't have a base in Syria and Syria isn't really in a position to threaten Israel very much it's barely functioning after more than a decade of Civil War so why bomb these airports it's because they're used to supply the most powerful unofficial military force in the world Hezbollah now Israel's confident that they can defeat Hamas but h esbah is a whole different matter and they're allies of Hamas if Hezbollah joins Hamas it'll be a nightmare for Israel so in our third episode on the Israel Gaza War who is hezb how did they form it turns out it's because of Israel and an eerily similar conflict 40 years ago has Israel learned anything since then I'm Matt beon and this is if you're [Music] [Applause] listening the story of the birth of Hezbollah is one that begins not in Gaza not in Israel not even in Iran but in [Music] Lebanon lebanon's geography is in comparison with other Middle Eastern countries extremely strange in a region dominated by wide open desert expanses 81% of Lebanon is covered by mountains about the same proportion as Switzerland and Nepal but aside from providing good skiing conditions these mountains have had an interesting effect on lebanon's population see mountains keep people apart and over thousands of years the people living in The Valleys of Lebanon have developed incredibly diverse cultures it's the most religiously diverse country in the Middle East by far more or less evenly balanced between Christians and the two major branches of Islam Sunni and Shia most Muslims around the world are Sunni and Shiites are often marginalized only 15% are Shiites and Iran is the only Muslim country led by a Shiite the Ayatollah heni sunnis and Shiites do not always get along historically the division between sunnis and Shiites has led to intense conflict which is at times erupted in war but in Lebanon the mountains have separated these groups you have to be a lot angrier to attack someone over a mountain than across a plane this has maintained a centuries long balance a balance they now attempt to reflect in their Politics the president of Lebanon is always a Christian the prime minister is always a Sunni Muslim the speaker of the house is always a Shia Muslim there are quoters for how many MPS each sect gets it's all based on what the population of each group was the last time they held a census which was in 1932 they're worried that a new census will change the ratios so they just don't do censuses you count can't be wrong if you never count this is how it was for decades there were a few exceptions but mostly there was Harmony in [Music] Lebanon but in the 19 7s something rapidly changed Palestinian refugees pushed out by civil war with Israel and with nowhere else to turn began arriving in enormous numbers in Lebanon Palestinians are a human being and they are living in Lebanon because of Israel and because they have been driven up by force almost all Palestinians are Sunni Muslims and this began to upset the balance On's balance between Christians Shiites and sunnis now began to tip rapidly towards the sunnis before long Lebanon erupted into a horrific Civil War and just to make things worse as Lebanese communities attacked each other a group of Palestinians called the Palestinian Liberation Organization or PLO started using Lebanon as a base for attacks on Israel prime minister ban claims more than 150 Israelis have been assassinated on the country's northern border during the last 12 months by PLO guillas in southern Lebanon by 1982 Israel decided it was time to end it they would go all the way to the Lebanese Capital Beirut and take out the PLO once and for [Music] all it was the beginning of lebanon's hot dry summer when Israel invaded the speed and savagery of this latest Israeli offensive into Lebanon has shocked countries around the world the Israelis swept through southern Lebanon towards the capital Beirut where the PLO leadership was helded up remember there was also a civil war going on and now Israeli tanks were on the city's doorstep people ran for cover every time they heard the Israelis overhead usually crowded streets were deserted the people are terrified the effects of the invasion were horrific Lebanese civilians and Palestinian refugees were killed on mass as Israeli forces swept through the country what started out as a punitive raid into Lebanon four weeks ago has turned into what some are calling the brutal final solution to the Palestinian problem they reached Beirut and put the city under siege blockading food water and electricity and flattening apartment buildings with air strikes and artillery fire at the very center of this Siege was the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organization yasa Arafat Arafat said the Palestinians would fight to the last bullet appearing to relish such a prospect he urged the Israelis to attack saying his men we're ready he knew that he was Israel's Enemy Number One and that his life was at risk Arafat is a man constantly on the move he knows that much of West Beirut is under direct observation by the Israelis oddly enough he didn't seem all that put off by the spies and the air strikes as the city became a war zone Arafat seemed to be in his element you Arafat toured besieged Beirut with a smile on his face kissing babies cracking jokes as he visited the men fighting on his side one of the reasons he's popular with his Fighters is that he makes periodic inspections like this one he even looked like a rockar the Australian women's weekly published an article about how much he resembled Ringo Star as bombs rained down on Beirut and Israeli troops drew the net closer and closer around him he happily gave interviews and talked about how much he was looking forward to becoming an engineer once the nation of palestin was established and he could go home to Jerusalem I would like uh to work as an engineer it is my professional despite Israeli spies on the ground calling in air strikes directly against him and Arafat stayed alive if the Israelis invade West Beirut what will your troops do what do you expect me to do the scene in beut was extremely similar to the one we're seeing today in Gaza Israeli tanks waiting at the gates to a city destroying neighborhoods with air strikes trying to eliminate a Palestinian group today Israeli forces were still poised AR sign Beirut ready to deliver the final death blow to the Palestine Liberation Organization Israel's International allies watched on in horror as The Siege dragged into a second month finally they'd had enough the US President Ronald Reagan sent in Team America to end the siege the government of Lebanon has requested and I have approved the deployment of United States forces to Beirut as part of a mational force Arafat without his headscarf and thousands of PLO Fighters left Beirut on ships having withstood the Israeli seed for 10 weeks he called it a victory heralding a new dawn in the Arab world and left to set up new operations in Tunisia now you might be thinking okay interesting story but what does any of this have to do with Hezbollah and I would agree it is an interesting story and I would tell you that the time that I'll tell you about Hezbollah is now if you know anything about Hezbollah it's probably that they're backed by Iran so let's talk about Iran shall we Iran is a middle eastern superpower with a massive population like Lebanon it's mountainous and has a long history and strong culture but it's the black sheep of the family it's never really fit in the Islamic revolution in Iran Depends for its momentum on regular expressions of unity the leaders of the newly formed Islamic Republic of Iran watched the attack by Israel with interest and they saw an opportunity you see Finding allies is kind of difficult for them they were Shia Muslims Hardline Islamic fundamentalists and Persians and most people in the Middle East and none of those things but there are Shiites in Lebanon and they were Mighty annoyed with the Israelis so Iran's powerful revolutionary guard Corp got to work uniting Shiites who do not like Israel who live in Lebanon into one group and they gave it a name Hezbollah the party of God the most fanatical of Lebanon Shiite Muslims are now firmly openly and successfully established in Beirut ahood Barack a top Israeli military official who went on to become the Israeli Prime Minister later said when we entered Lebanon there was no Hezbollah we were accepted by perfumed rice and flowers by the she in the South it was our presence there that created hisbah hisbah has undergone a massive transformation since the siege of Beirut they started off as a fairly typical terrorist organization for 8 years They carried out bombings kidnappings and hijackings it was hisbah that destroyed the American Marine Barracks in Beirut killing some 240 people and producing scenes of the most awful Carnage they were famous for running through the streets covered in blood after conducting a ritual which involves cutting your head open with a sword and then hitting the wound over and over with your hand unlike most Palestinian terrorists who prefer to get away hisbah welcome death and this makes them more dangerous once the Lebanese Civil War ended in 1990 Hezbollah gave themselves a bit of a makeover the Muslim fundamentalist group Hezbollah has had unexpected success in the country's first general election for 20 years with funding Direct directly from Iran they spent big to build the support of Shia communities the party of God has CED the people lavishly in the runup to lebanon's elections it's built new mosques funded schools and Clinics and handed out cash to the needy since 992 they've won seats at every Lebanese election since 2012 they've had seats in cabinet a hisbah MP has been the sports minister of Lebanon for most of the last decade hisbah also owns a radio and TV station they provide social services and run a tourism operation we like it here very much it's peaceful but one aspect of Hezbollah hasn't changed since the very beginning they've been devoted to the elimination of the state of Israel it's something symbolized in their logo an arm holds a machine gun in the air officials say that is a threat to Israel the machine gun for for Israel and will continue to be M for Israel for this they have a military week and they are a real and terrifying threat to Israel armed by Iran they are said to be the best equipped non-government military force in the world their military Wing is apparently more powerful than the Lebanese Army thanks to lebanon's geography Hezbollah is apparently kind of like an iceberg you only see the very tip this is Hezbollah territory it's covered in deep valleys perfect for waging Guerilla war and deep caves perfect for housing Fighters and arms for four decades now they've been attacking Israel with rockets and raids Israel has struck back against Hezbollah gorillas in the latest round of tit forat attacks in southern Lebanon Hezbollah sits there in its Mountain Fortress Loom in over Israel's northern border like a giant Dam that could burst at any moment and flood into Israel and that's what Israel's worried about that's what Israel's allies and even some of its enemies are worried about if the damn bursts it would significantly escalate the scale of the current War but Israel's prime minister warned Hezbollah and it sponsor Iran not to get involved if Hezbollah decides to enter the War they'll be making the biggest mistake of their lives and hit with unimaginable Force since the Hamas attack in early October skirmishes have begun at the foot of the mountains hez blah has fired Rockets Israel has responded with air strikes Israel bombed the airports in Syria which are known to be part of the supply chain from Iran to Hezbollah so why hasn't Hezbollah launched an attack what what are they waiting for well the thing about a dam bursting is it takes a while for the dam to fill up again for the Iranian backers hesah is most effective as a spectre a threat they do not have the strength to defeat Israel and they may be defeated themselves and then the threat's no longer there but Hezbollah should also serve as a reminder for Israel the current Siege of Gaza is incredibly reminiscent of the failed Siege of Beirut 40 years ago her military armor continues to pound away at the strongholds of the 6,000 strong PLO Force trapped inside the city the group they were trying to eliminate escaped and as an unintended consequence Hezbollah an even more dangerous group arose that unintended consequence is still looming down on Israel from the Lebanese mountains what will the unintended consequence be be this [Music] time" />

permanently remove 1 million Palestinians from Gaza and transfer them to Libya On Friday UN Human Rights Chief Vocar Turk said Israel's actions in Gaza are quote tantamount to ethnic cleansing Gaza's health ministry confirms Israel's killed at least 53,300 Palestinians in Gaza since October 2023 The death toll does not account for thousands of people believed dead including those trapped under the rubble nor those killed by the indirect effects of Israel's assault on Gaza In fact the number could be more than two times three times higher For more we're joined in Montreal by Muen Rabani Middle East analyst co-editor of Jud Jalia and a non-resident fellow at the Center for Conflict and Humanitarian Studies He's a contributor to the book Deluge Gaza and Israel from crisis to cataclysm Welcome back to Democracy Now Men Thanks so much for being with us um if you can respond to the situation right now the escalation of the attacks on Gaza Well the situation as anyone who's following the news can see is thoroughly apocalyptic Um there is not only an unprecedented siege but also an unprecedented intensification of Israel's genocidal military campaign in the Gaza Strip And judging um by the statements of Israel's most senior leaders it aims towards the complete occupation of the Gaza Strip and the destruction of everything that remains standing in the Gaza Strip and ultimately the mass for forcible expulsion of its entire population And the past few days have have been um particularly cataclysmic At the same time uh negotiations about a potential new agreement are ongoing and um this will be decided neither by Israel uh nor by the Palestinians but by the United States To the extent that Israel continues with this assault it means that it has a US green light for doing so uh to the extent that the situation changes that means that Israel has been instructed by Washington to change course Talk about Israel partially lifting the blockade What exactly does this mean after 11 months of a full blockade on medicine and aid 11 weeks at this stage it doesn't appear to mean very much according to reports um available this morning Um Israel is preparing to permit something on the order of 50 trucks to enter the Gaza Strip And we're talking about a population of between 1 and a half and 2 million people who have been deprived of any um uh goods entering from outside the territory since the very beginning of March So this is clearly um a drop in the bucket Uh I think the more important question is whether this is the beginning of a lifting of the siege under US and international pressure and just as importantly whether Israel and the US are going to move ahead with this hairbrain scheme that has already been denounced by the international aid community of setting up a aid mechanism whose purpose is to force the relocation of the Gaza Strip population to specified locations where they can um uh access limited humanitarian supplies under the watchful eye of US mercenaries acting on behalf of the Israeli military government Can you talk about the US plan that's been reported to move Palestinians to Libya yes it's interesting that this report has now been formally denied um by the US embassy in in Libya um uh I think as a precautionary measure given what happened to that embassy about a decade ago But we do know that um President Trump has repeatedly uh proposed an initiative whereby the entire Palestinian population of the Gaza Strip would be forcibly relocated outside the Gaza Strip Um it would be taken over and rebuilt presumably by US real estate developers um acting in coordination with Israel And there have been persistent reports that the US and Israel have been approaching a variety of countries both within the region and beyond to accept these uh forcibly displaced uh Palestinians And in respect of Libya um the reports are that the US has offered Libya to unfreeze billions of dollars in um Libyan funds that have been uh frozen in international financial institutions since the reign of uh Muhammad Gaddafi who was overthrown and killed over a decade ago If and only if Libya accepts um uh 1 million Palestinians on its territory this would increase the Libyan population by over 10% And it's effectively bri bribing Libya with its own money to participate in this war crime and crime against humanity But it seems to me exceptionally unlikely that Libya will even um seriously consider this proposal for one moment given um the impact it would have on on Libya's uh domestic uh politics which is very strongly pro Palestinian And I think the real issue here is not the extent to which this um initiative can actually be implemented but rather the legitimization it gives to Israel's determination repeatedly expressed to expel the Palestinian population of the Gaza Strip and further down the line from the West Bank as well On Friday President Trump actually said quote &quot;A lot of people are starving in Gaza under the Israeli blockade.&quot; He said the US wanted to help reduce the suffering What can the US do what can the world do you have up to a 100,000 people in the Netherlands protesting outside the H You have a number of Italian parliament members going to the Egyptian side of the Rafa border uh demanding that uh um the world stop arming Israel Can you talk about what the solutions are at this point well you had as you mentioned the 100,000 approximately protesters in the Netherlands um with reports of something in the range of half a million in London um uh the day before And there is um growing opposition and and disgust with Israel's engineered starvation policy and absolutely genocidal military campaign in the Gaza Strip And a number of European governments are now beginning to speak more loudly as well calling for example for a reconsideration of Israel's preferential trade privileges with the European Union But at this stage the decision really will be made not in London or Brussels or Berlin but in Washington because of the extraordinary leverage that the United States exercises over Israel And it will take no more than a phone call from Washington to the Israeli government to effect a complete reversal in Israeli policy within the space of a day Um that's really the only reason we're now seeing this limited very limited resumption of aid And with respect to the statements by um uh President Trump I think we also need to bear in mind we're dealing here with a quite erratic leader who can contradict himself in the space of a day or even an hour So what we really need to focus is not so much on what he says but what the United States does There are ongoing um negotiations for a new agreement and it's difficult to tell exactly what's happening there Of course they're being held um behind uh closed doors but we still need to find out the extent to which Washington is exercising genuine pressure if any on Israel to force it to um accept an agreement that will um uh res that will lift the siege lead to an exchange of captives and ultimately put an end to this genocidal war Uh let me ask you finally Drop Site News is reporting a senior Hamas official received assurances from President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff the US would force Israel to lift the Gaza blockade within two days after releasing the USIsraeli citizen um Edan Alexander Basam Naim a member of Hamas's political bureau said the Trump administration reneged on its promise saying they didn't violate the deal they threw it in the trash your response to the report and if do you think that's why they lifted Israel lifted it partially well these these reports may well form part of the background of today's developments that we've uh been discussing but at the time it was um you know Hamas said it was uh releasing this um Israeli soldier who's also a US uh citizen as a goodwill gesture on the eve of uh Trump's uh visit to the Middle East And the Americans also said they had offered nothing in exchange So um quite clear clearly there were no formal undertakings by the United States But I think it's entirely reasonable to suppose that there were informal assurances given and those once again ended up uh not not being worth um uh the paper they were or in this case were not written on Um but at the same time they could form part of the background of the developments that we're seeing now which is that negotiations seem to have been intensified I think it's very premature to conclude that they will succeed or result in a meaningful agreement but there's quite clearly more going on behind the scenes um than than we are directly aware of Muin Rabani I want to thank you for being with us Middle East analyst co-editor of Jadalia and

          <attvalue for="7" value="through all the chaos in the Middle East there is one big unanswered [Music] question how did Israel not see this coming we have breaking news out of Israel this morning where Hamas has launch a surprise attack a surprise attack a surprise attack a surprise attack how did one of the most well-resourced intelligence communities in the world specifically designed to prevent this exact thing from happening failed to detect an operation that involved months of planning meetings in multiple countries and thousands of militants in part two of our series on the Israel Gaza conflict we're looking at Israel's Security operation an operation that's maintained nearly full control over the borders and movement of people in Gaza for a decade that suddenly saw a rag tag bunch of militants flood through literal holes in the wall and threaten Israel in a way it hasn't been threatened before I'm Matt Bon I'm a little bit Husky and this is if you're listen it was October 1973 in London and an Egyptian man named Ashraf marwin called a meeting marwin was well connected he was the son-in-law of the previous Egyptian president and now the top Aid to the new president bit of a nepo baby what is bosses in Egypt didn't know is that he was also a spy marn's meeting was with the head of the Israeli spy agency mad you see Egypt was planning to attack Israel and marwin was giving Israel a warning they had 18 hours before Egypt and Syria would invade but the Israeli were a little bit sick of marwin you see he'd warned mad twice before that war was imminent both times it had been a false alarm thousands of troops had been mobilized for nothing it was a classic boy who cried Invasion scenario and now marwin was telling them that the war was going to kick off again this time on yum kapor the holiest day on the Jewish calendar a massive national holiday in Israel news of the invasion was slow to reach the top levels of the Israel government time was wasted and Israel was not prepared but marwin was right the war's outbreak took the World by surprise Egypt and Syria launched a simultaneous surprise attack Egyptian forces are at present engaged in military operations it caught Israel off guard and led to thousands of casualties the armies of Egypt and Syria are still battling with Israeli troops on the Sinai Peninsula and the Goan Heights it was seen as the biggest intelligence failure in Israeli history that is until exactly 50 years and one day [Music] later Israel's main method of Defending themselves from Hamas is to literally contain them in the Gaza Strip no one goes in and no one goes out without the express permission of the Israeli government to achieve that they've built what they refer to as the obstacle from a distance it looks like a fence but it's so much more than that the fence is 6 M high and under it is a deep underground concrete wall which will be very difficult to Tunnel through but that's not all that bario is not standing alone and it won't stand alone it's part of a cocktail the main ingredients of the cocktail are a concrete wall and two fences but it's the garnishes that are really interesting remote control drones remote operated cameras remote operated gun turrets with AI assisted targeting remote seismographs to detect any digging nearby it's all Wireless with solar panels and battery backups to save it from power outages it can be operated from a central location and doesn't need thousands of troops patrolling up and down the Border it's 65 km long and gives Israel confidence that they can decide who comes to their country and the circumstances in which they come on top of that Israel's installed the high-tech Iron Dome missile defense system which can automatically detect rockets and shoot them out of the sky Israel is very proud of it the military says hundreds of rockets have been intercepted so far and in any case the Israeli government was increasingly convinced that Hamas was less extreme dream now and weren't as much of a threat besides they were trapped behind an impregnable Ultra Hightech border fence and so Hamas slipped down their priority list a long way down with their new sense of security the Israeli government focused on expanding and protecting settlements on the West Bank now it's crucial to understand what a settlement is if you look at the West Bank on a map it looks like a kidney bean but if you look at it properly it's actually more like a piece of Swiss cheese the Palestinians live in the holes the cheese bits are controlled by Israel on nearly every Hilltop around here are Israeli settlements gated communities of Jewish residents in the middle of the land Palestinians want for their future state so pockets of Palestinians surrounded by Israelis this has not yet led to peace and Harmony and so the Israeli security Services have been deployed to keep the peace Israeli soldiers occupy more than 60% of the West Bank there are checkpoints patrols military posts and noo zones throughout the whole area we'd save a heck of a lot of money if we could disand if we could disband the Army it's there to protect us according to international law these Israeli settlements are illegal I believe in the right of the Jews to reestablish our home homes in our villages in areas which were for thousands of years uh part of the Jewish history one of the long-term residents of these settlements is itamar Ben who has been making news for decades as a member of the radical Jewish kak movement branded a terrorist organization by the US government he's been arrested hundreds of times and spent more than 9 months in jail benav is an ultra Nationalist and a violent activist a convicted criminal with a WRA sheet that includes inciting racism and supporting a terrorist organization go home anti his politics are so extreme that he was disqualified from compulsory military service for years he had on his wall a photo of Jewish terrorist Barak Goldin who killed 29 Palestinians and injured more than 100 in 1994 in court he likes representing himself he's done this so often that judges started suggesting that he probably should just go and study law to give himself a better chance once he became a lawyer he specialized in defending Israeli Jews accused of hate crimes and terrorism he was elected to the Israeli parliament in 2021 that didn't stop him from getting out into the streets to to defend the rights of Israeli settlers in October last year he was filmed at the sight of a violent clash between settlers and Palestinians in East Jerusalem as he's pulled away from the scene by police he urges them to shoot Palestinians who throw stones then he reached under his suit jacket and pulled out an actual handgun and started waving it around that's at the time he was a minor party backbencher prone to trolling and don't we all know and love those guys but the following month he got a massive promotion Benjamin Netanyahu desperate for Coalition Partners signed a deal with Ben gavier in exchange for his party support Ben gavier would become the minister for National Security in charge of keeping Israelis safe and protecting them from Hamas but he had other things on his mind Benjamin netanyahu's six term as Israeli Prime Minister has been dominated by right-wing parties in his Coalition that want to Annex the entire West Bank just days into his tenure Ben gav decided it would be a good idea to go and visit the AL AXA mosque at Jerusalem's Temple mount in Israeli politics this is the equivalent of waving a gun around in the street for extremely complicated reasons that go back literally thousands of years is Israeli leaders visiting the mosque tends to make many Muslims extremely angry and has on several occasions in the past led to violence a surprising Unity ticket formed with Hamas the United Nations and the United States government asking benier not to do it Hamas called it provocative the UN and US said it risked inflaming tensions and the Israeli opposition said it risked the nation's security and the safety of its citizens keep in mind Ben is the national security minister the Temple Mount is open for everybody Muslims Christians and yes also Jews we make it clear to Hamas we don't give in we don't surrender we don't blink sure I mean what are they going to do about it right the Israeli government meanwhile ramped up the establishment of settlements in the West Bank benav personally ordered several unauthorized Palestinian homes to be bulldozed to make room for more settlements with that violence increased around the settlements as well according to the United Nations 2022 was the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank since they began recording fatalities in 2005 2022 was bad but 2023 has been worse Ben has expressed little interest in doing anything about this what he's very interested in doing something about is attacks on Settlers the Palestinian gunman shot dead seven people near near a synagogue in a settlement in East Jerusalem except now he's not waving his gun around he's encouraging Israelis to arm themselves I want weapons on the street I want Israeli citizens to be able to protect themselves benav made Law and Order in the West Bank his top priority deploying more troops and police to defend settlers and raid the homes of suspected terrorists it's one of a series of Israeli raids that have killed dozens of Palestinians in the last month alone with the high-tech but lightly manned Gaza border fence Israel's strategy was based on the idea that they would deploy troops there if they were alerted that something was coming picking up warnings was vital so were there any warnings [Music] well 25 days before the attack Hamas released a video of their Fighters training for a massive assault on the border Defence and Israeli Army Camps the video was highquality propaganda of what looked like a very well equipped operation with drones flying around and large groups of well-armed men moving quickly through a training course I've watched the video of this rehearsal and video of the actual attack and they're difficult to tell apart aside from the blood in the real version this is the kind of thing that should have triggered an alarm in Israel I mean Israel has spy agencies surely they would hear or see something concerning and then send troops and guards to the fence to deal with it and yet it seems that the system didn't really work the thought of 2,000 Hamas terrorists overcoming a multi-billion dollar security system I don't think was on anybody's radar screen in terms of possibilities so so the propaganda video from Hamas was warning number one 10 days before the attack came warning number two the Egyptian intelligence agency which is now a friend of Israel called Benjamin netanyahu's office to tell the Prime Minister that Hamas was planning something unusual a terrible operation and yet it seems this was ignored too six days before the attack the Israeli National Security advisor Zaki HBY was confidently telling the Israeli Defense Force radio station that Hamas had pivoted to a position of unprecedented restraint three days before the attack Egypt called to warn Netanyahu again according to Egyptian officials Netanyahu wasn't concerned and was more focused on the West Bank Netanyahu denies that he ever got a call itar benier began planning another another visit to the alaxa mosque when Israeli officials went to bed on the 6th of October exactly 50 years after the Yum kapore War Began they slept soundly with no clue of what was going to happen in the morning it started at 6:30 small drones packed with explosives flew out of Gaza they flew directly to their targets the mobile internet Towers which enabled the entire Gaza border security system to operate and the observation towers with AI targeted machine guns they dropped explosives on the towers taking them out they also dropped explosives on the tanks stationed along the border the billion dooll remote control defenses were offline paragliders took off covered by rocket fire and flew over the fence attacking any troops nearby then then Hamas Fighters charged at the fence with bulldozers explosives motorbikes and trucks they were able to drive right up to it and take it down the fence no matter how many senses at the end of the day it's effectively a metal fence right the militants attacked the headquarters of the Israeli border security operation they killed the soldiers inside many of whom were still in bed for the entire morning they rampaged almost unchallenged across Southern Israel before the Israeli Defense Force was able to arrive and fight back 1500 Hamas Fighters were killed which is an extraordinary number and it's indicative of how big an operation this obviously was from hamas's perspective in the days after the attack Hamas gloated about how successfully they'd fooled Israel they've openly said they wanted to lull Israel into a false sense of security something which appears to have worked perfectly you got to call spade and Spade and this was a massive costly failure and Israel knows that it was a failure almost identical to the 150 years beforehand Hamas has specifically cited increased settler violence and itamar Ben's visits to the alaa mosque as their reasons for the attack which they called operation alaxa flood benav hasn't accepted any responsibility despite the fact that the border of police are his responsibility as the minister of National Security he says now is not the time for investigations but it does seem that his role in this debacle has been noticed he's been excluded from the war cabinet formed by Netanyahu and opposition parties to deal with the current emergency it's worth noting that in 1973 Israel did eventually win the Yon kapore War we'll see if the parallels continue

          <attvalue for="7" value="JEFFREY GOLDBERG: The end of President  Trump's friendship with Elon Musk was   never really a question of if, but  when. And now we know the answer,   except maybe we don't. For all we know,  they could be back together before summer. Meanwhile, in the real world, Russia's  war against Ukraine grows more dire,   Iran gets closer to nuclear breakout,  Israel slides further towards prices,   and at home, the rule of  law is in real danger, next. Good evening and welcome to Washington Week. I  want everyone to know that I take the Trump-Musk   breakup drama seriously in part because Donald  Trump gave his former best friend Elon Musk access   to enormous amounts of secret government data, and  there's no predicting what Musk could do with it. The world at large is in a state  of seemingly permanent tumult,   and so it's a good time for a general  checkup. My guest tonight is Thomas Friedman,   a three-time Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and  foreign affairs columnist for the New York Times. Tom, thanks for coming in for our seemingly annual  checkup. I want to ask you about this Elon Musk   business and maybe we can put it into some  serious context. Before we jump to that, I want   to read something that my colleague, Charlie  Warzel, writing in The Atlantic this morning   had to say. The sun rises every morning. Spring  turns to summer. Water is wet. Donald Trump and   Elon Musk relationship has ended with  a post about Jeffrey Epstein. And then,   of course, you know, he tweeted,  these guys really do escalate quickly.   Trump -- Musk tweeted time to drop the really  big bomb real Donald Trump is in the Epstein   files. That is the real reason. They have  not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT. So, put this into some kind of context that makes  sense for ordinary people. What is going on here? THOMAS FRIEDMAN, Foreign Affairs Columnist,  The New York Times: Well, I confess, Jeff,   on the way over, I thought you'd asked  me about this and the first thing that   popped into my mind was the Iran-Iraq war.  What did we say about the Iran-Iraq war?   If only both sides could lose, okay?  So, there's no hero in this story. What it really is is the latest manifestation  to me of the central truth of the Trump 2   administration. Trump 1 was surrounded by buffers.  Trump 2 is surrounded by amplifiers. And therefore   stuff that used to begin at the Mar-a-Lago  bar and then get muffled in the Oval Office   now goes from the Mar-a-Lago bar, right to the  Oval Office, right to you and me. And whether   it's what he feels about, you know, Musk or  his role, he wants him in the government. But to me, the whole Musk phenomenon is  part of a much deeper and more disturbing   phenomena from an American citizen point  of view, which is nothing here is modeled,   nothing here is stress tested. Everything  is a riff. The country is being run like   the Trump organization today, not  like the United States of America. And so as a result of that, Jeff, there's  no second order thinking, all right? What's   second order thinking? I'm going to put on  tariffs, okay, 10 percent across the board,   including Canada and Mexico, even though  I'm violating an agreement I signed with   them when I was president last time. Second order  thinking is, oh my God, you mean the Ford F-150,   only one third of its parts are made in America?  And the other two thirds now are going to be   tariffed? I will bet any amount of money no one  told him that. And that's true now everything. And so, you know, for the first trimester of this  administration, you think the first three months,   all of this was kind of entertaining, but now he's  running up against a wall. It turns out he can't   solve the Russia-Ukraine war overnight. It turns  out tariff wars aren't easy to win. It turns out,   you know, Musk is not going to, you know,  do the revolution in the government for him. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: It turns out courts  sometimes don't like what you do. THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Exactly.  And so I think the second,   you know, three months are going to  get very interesting as he runs into   this reality. And I don't know where it's  going to go, but it leaves me disquiet. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: That's interesting. I  was thinking -- as you were saying this,   I was thinking about John Kelly, General  John Kelly being -- and along with General   Mattis and others being those buffers or  filters, there's literally no one in the   White House or in the whole system who does  anything but amplify? Is that fair to say? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Yes. I mean, I just don't -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: The treasury secretary? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: I just don't see it, you know?  I mean, yes, you hear these stories that the   treasury secretary had to wait, you know, for one  of the other, you know, economic guys that Peter   Navarro to be out of the room for him to come in  to try to change the tariff. This is crazy stuff. Now, I happen to be in China twice in the last  six months. I've watched a lot of this from China   actually. And when you see it from China, I mean,  they say a couple things. One is, you know, we are   never going to put our president in a situation  like Zelenskyy in the Oval Office where he can   be embarrassed, number one. The second thing they  say, Jeff, is that this isn't cute. We just saw   Donald Trump tear up a trade agreement that Donald  Trump made with America's two closest neighbors   and allies, Canada and Mexico. What is the value  there for of a trade agreement with him now? And, you know, the Chinese, these are -- like them  or hate them, these are serious people, you know? JEFFREY GOLDBERG: And they are not spontaneous. THOMAS FRIEDMAN: No, exactly. So, when Trump put  the 147 -- 45 present tariff on them, they said,   are you talking to me? Are you talking to me?  Do you realize that we control 90 percent of   the rare earths that make the magnets that go  in every car you make? Do you realize that?   Which he didn't. Which is why Ford and G.M.  and Stellantis had to announced this week   we may actually have to curb some production  because we're running out of Chinese magnets. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. Stay with this Musk  question for a minute and this issue of Musk   as a radical isotope in a kind of way. He's  been given access to government secrets across   the board in order to cut government  agencies through the DOGE operation. That seems like an operational security nightmare  if he goes rogue. Surprising to you? I mean,   where does this relationship go? Can  they bring it back from the brink? Is   there anybody who's trying to bring it back  from the brink, or is this just more chaos? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Well, you know,  I think the best way to understand   this is not with the analogy of political  science but World Wrestling Federation. THOMAS FRIEDMAN: And those in world Wrestling  Federation, there are breakups and comeback   and new teams and whatnot. I put this all  in the area of entertainment, you know,   not in something serious. We're dealing  with two extremely unstable characters. But what really is more important is, what's  the wider world audience saying? What's the   wider world audience saying? They're saying,  you know, for all of our lifetime, Jeff,   sort of post-war America, if I had an extra  dollar and I'm a foreigner, I'm going to put   it in America. If I have an extra, you know,  brain power and a brainy person, I'm going to   study in America. And if I have a little extra  dollar for trust, I'm going to trust America. Now, you take all three of those  things away and you end up with   a very different relationship  between America and the world. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Okay. So, I have to ask  you. And, by the way, it's interesting,   right? Miami is Miami because it's a safe place  for people's Money. Harvard is or was Harvard,   because people want to come from around  the world and so on. And United Nations   is headquartered in New York, you know, I  mean, everybody -- for a reason. We were   the -- we wrote the rules of the road  for the post-war international order. So, the question is, you're an ally or an  adversary, and you're looking at this clown show,   by the way, on the weekend that marks the 81st  anniversary of D-Day, noting, just for the record.   You put yourselves in the shoes of an ally and  adversary. Are you thinking that this is a midlife   crisis America's having, a nervous breakdown,  or is this some kind of weird terminal illness? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: You know, I don't know, which  all I know is I'm completely disoriented if   I'm an ally. And I'm completely  disoriented if I'm the foreign   affairs columnist for The New York Times,  because I've never covered this world. And, you know, our friend, you know, Fareed  Zakaria wrote a book 15 years ago or so called   The Post-American World. And Fareed's book  was really about a change in relative power,   you know, between that there'll be the  rise of Brazil and Indian other countries,   so we won't have as much power as we had before.  Well, really, if I were writing a book today,   Jeff, would be called the  Post-America World, okay? That's what I'm really worried about,  because America stood for some things.   It stood for universal values. It stood for  stability. It stood for the rule of law. It   was a loyal ally. We were always against the  dictator versus the people seeking freedom.   What really worries me that at the  end of my, you know, career basically,   I'm dealing with the post-America world, the  America I grew up and loved and was devoted to. And as someone who lived abroad, like you have,  know how important that America is to the whole   world. American optimism and stability makes the  world go round. You take us out of the equation,   it's not like anybody else comes in. I'm sorry.  You have a no superpower world, you know? JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. But come back to this.  Is this -- do you think that this instability   that we're experiencing, emotional, political,  all the instabilities that we're experiencing,   could it be temporary or is this -- can  we not come back reputationally to start? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Well, the thing  I'm worried about most is that,   and it may seem like a simple thing, but you  know, Donald Trump came in and he told all   the Democrats on the board of the Kennedy  Center, you're gone. Now, traditionally,   every president sort of left the other party's  people there, and then he put in his people. So, when you enter into a kind of  zero sum politics now in America,   when you fire the head of the NASA after you  appointed him because he made a donation,   a tiny donation to a Democrat, you're into a  kind of politics that I grew up with in the   Middle East. What was that? Rule or die.  Okay, you're either in power or you're -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Zero sum. THOMAS FRIEDMAN: It's zero sum, okay? JEFFREY GOLDBERG: I'm on top or I'm in -- THOMAS FRIEDMAN: And so there's a  book about African dictators called,   It's Our Turn to Eat, you know? And  we're just going to eat everything. So then now, if you're a Democrat and  guess what we do have -- God willing,   if we still have elections, rotations in power,  do they come in now treat all the Republicans   in these traditional bipartisan forum, you  know, the same way? And if that happens,   we're really off to the races, then the  whole thing just starts to disappear. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: What country does  that remind you of that tradition? THOMAS: FRIEDMAN: You know, I mean so  many dictatorship just in general that   I've covered over the years. That's what you  come in, you wipe out all the other guy's,   people. Well, that's not how  we do things in this country. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. Well, let's talk about  a country that's not democratic for a second.   You know, the -- I want you to watch this. It's  the latest analysis by President Trump of the   current state of play in Russia's war against  Ukraine, and he's talking about Putin here. DONALD TRUMP, U.S. President: He  got hit, he's been doing hitting,   so I understand it. But he got hit hard.  And I don't think he's playing games. I said, President, maybe you're going to  have to keep fighting and suffering a lot   because both sides are suffering before  you pull them apart, before they're able   to be pulled apart. But it's a pretty known  analogy. You have two kids, they fight, fight,   fight. Sometimes you let them fight for a little  while. You see it in hockey, you see it in sports. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Not Henry Kissinger,  but he's trying to impose his own   real politic understanding. What is he  misunderstanding, from your perspective? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Jeff, do you know how flat  out crazy that is? I mean, it's like saying,   well, you know, I mean, Hitler and Poland, they  fight, they fight, they come back. You know what   I mean? Trump came in and said, I can end this  war, all right? There's one way to end this war,   you say of Vladimir Putin, if you don't stop  the war and we agreed to the ceasefire terms   I dictate, we are bringing Ukraine into NATO  in 30 days. Which part of that sentence don't   you understand? Do you want to mess with  me? Test me. That's how you end this war. What you just heard of Donald Trump,  that sounded like a commentator on Fox   T.V. He's not that commentator. He's  president of the United States. Well,   he hit him and he hit them and he hit -- this  guy invaded a country. He's basically tried to   rape a country. That's what Putin did, okay?  And the Ukrainians, with incredible bravery,   stood up and defended basically the western  alliance on something that's very important.   Because if Ukraine were able to join the European  Union, Jeff, then you have a Europe that's really   whole and free. That's actually a big deal for  Europe and for us. And this guy's talking about   it like it's some schoolyard fight and they're  morally equal. It's nuts and it's disgusting. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. Is there any issue  from a foreign affairs columnist perspective,   is there any issue in which Trump is not  transactional? Have you ever seen a sign of   what we would think of as, in a  bipartisan way, American idealism? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Out of Trump? JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Yes. THOMAS FRIEDMAN: None comes to mind. What I would  say, and where I thought you might be going is   you know, some things are also true even if  Donald Trump believes them. And, by the way,   his transactionalism sometimes can also be an  advantage. For instance, I'm glad he's sitting   down with the Iranians. Let's see what you  got. I'm glad he told the Syrian president,   I'm going to give you a reputation to  live up to. I didn't mind him talking   directly to Hamas if I can get the hostages out. So, there is that transactional side of him that I  think could be an advantage, but it's not grounded   in any moral, you know, framework of what we stand  for as a country and what we've always stood for   if it's just, a kind of free floating  thing. It becomes very, very dangerous. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Yes. In his non-sophisticated  analysis of the current state of play   in Russia and Ukraine, he didn't really  talk about the drone attack that Ukraine   launched on Russian aerial assets deep in  inside Russia. Does that change this war? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: You know, Jeff, I say two things,  and, again, it's part of the craziness of this   moment. Let's start at 30,000 feet and then  come down to the battlefield. At 30,000 feet,   you and I are having this discussion on the eve  of the greatest technological revolution in human   history. We are very close to birthing a new  species, not a new machine, a new artificially   intelligent species. And it's going to be with  us some time while Trump is president. It is   not going to change one thing. It's going to  change everything. We are not talking about   that at all. So, that's, I would say, number  one, under that technological revolution. And,   you know, one of the things they say about A.I.,  it'll actually be mankind's last invention.   Because once we invent that, it will invent  everything else. That's going to be a big deal. Under that, though, we're seeing a revolution  in military affairs. Basically, Ukraine   spent $20,000 to knock out, you know, $20 million  planes. $20,000, that was probably because they   couldn't get Costco online, you know, from  Kyiv and they had to buy them from Amazon,   you know? So, the asymmetric warfare world  that we're entering now, wow, I mean,   if you're the U.S. Navy and you're sitting with  12 aircraft carriers and you just recovered from   the fact that the Houthis, you know, you lost  an F.A. Hornet because you had to swerve your   aircraft carrier and the plane fell off the  back because you were getting out of way of -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Not a sterling  moment , in naval history. THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Right, which is  you're avoiding a Houthi missile,   a bunch of guys in flip-flops, basically,  in a country that's based -- water starved,   the asymmetry we're going to be dealing with  right now. I think these events are really   disturbing and they're going to require a huge  revolution in how we think about military affairs. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: You know, as I'm listening  to you about A.I., AGI and drone warfare,   I'm just thinking that the preoccupation this  weekend in America is the emotionally febrile   relationship between this ketamine-taking  billionaire and our reality T.V. star   president. And it's like there's something  that's so deeply unserious about our -- THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Well, yes. And I  think it's been true of our country   that basically everything became politics. And  so we don't have just ESPN now. We have PSPN,   you know, sort of politics sports network. THOMAS FRIEDMAN: And it's a testament to  the underlying strength of our country,   Jeff, that our economy goes on, we still  invent amazing stuff and we think we can   afford this. And you know what, Jeff,  we can't afford it until we can't. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. Let me  pivot finally toward the Middle East   and ask you this. And, you know, I've read your  recent columns on this subject. You're a severe   critic of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime  minister, and the way he's conducted this war -- THOMAS FRIEDMAN: And of Hamas, which is -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: No, and I want to get there. But  what I don't understand from reading you is this,   so Hamas and its allies seek the annihilation of  Israel. They state that. It's not a secret. How   does Israel end the war without totally defeating  Hamas? In other words, is it -- I understand the   criticisms, but how do they coexist with  a neighbor who won't allow coexistence? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: They don't. I'm all for  Israel completely defeating Hamas militarily.   What I am not for are the three alternative  choices that Israel had after that defeat   that Netanyahu refuses to make. One  choice is we defeat them and we, Israel,   the Jewish state, occupy Gaza forever. That  will be the moral and economic end of Israel. Another choice is we just leave and we turn it  into Mogadishu. That will also be terrible for   Israel. The third choice, the one I favor, is you  create an Arab international peacekeeping force in   partnership with the Palestinian Authority, and  over time, you build an alternative to Hamas. I am -- well, my criticism of Netanyahu is not  fighting Hamas, not even crushing Hamas. It's   not creating any alternative Palestinian structure  and therefore leaving the Jewish people with the   choice, Jeff, of permanently occupying Gaza or  having Mogadishu there. And permanently occupying   Gaza, you know what that's going to do? That's  going to create a world where your grandchildren   and mine are going to grow up in a world where  they will learn what it is to be Jewish in a   world where the Jewish state is a pariah. And  that is a disaster and that's what I'm fighting. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: There is a double standard  obviously in the world when it comes to judging   Israel's behavior. But I guess you're just  saying that you have to live with that -- THOMAS FRIEDMAN: that's the world as it is, yes. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: That's the world as it is. You  quoted Ehud Olmert, the former Prime minister of   Israel, a center right prime minister, saying  that Israel is committing war crimes and this   is why he needs the war to stop. Do you  agree that Israel is committing war crimes? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: You know, I have not  entered into that whole linguistic   fight because my position has been for the  very beginning. I'm here to do one thing,   figure out how to end this thing. You know,  I'm old, Jeff, 71. I covered the Hama massacre,   Sabra and Shatila, the American embassy  bombing. I've covered all of them, okay? And I said to myself, I'm not going to be the  scorekeeper of this. I'm focused on one thing,   not who shot, who did the worst thing to  the because. They all do terrible things   at different times. I would've figure out how to   end it. And that's where I put all my  energy from the very, very beginning. And my -- if you've read my stuff on  Hamas, it's the same thing. What is   Hamas' position today? Very simple, we want a  ceasefire and we want Israel out of Gaza. Oh,   really? What did you have on October 6th before  this war started? That's what you had. So,   you fought this whole war. You allowed 40,000,  50,000 people to be killed to get you back to   where you started? Shame on you. But I can't,  you know, control them. I can't figure them   out. All I know I am -- I do believe that if  we want to see a Jewish and democratic Israel,   that's what I do care about. Palestinians have to  figure that out. You've got to find a way to get   out of Gaza in a way that will create a, also in  partnership with a different Palestinian party. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Let me ask you one last  question because you're an expert on this   for many decades, several decades. Many  sounds too dire. What does Netanyahu not   understand about American politics  and about American Jewish politics? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Well, I think Netanyahu is  shocked by what's going on here. Because Trump,   Netanyahu always could go around any  American president and now he can't,   because he's looking for the Republican base.  He's pulling that lever and it comes off. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Kind of looks  like a little bit of a sucker,   thinking that Joe Biden was bad for Israel. THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Yes, exactly. You know,  it turns out there are other worse things. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. And what about --  what doesn't he understand about American Jews? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: You know, I think what he  doesn't understand about American Jews is that,   you know, they're ready to be with him.  They wanted Israel that's successful,   democratic. And if you -- they are really  important to Israel standing in America,   and you abandoned them for evangelical  Christians, you'll regret that one day. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. Well, it's  enormously complicated, as is Russia,   Ukraine, as is everything. And thank you  for coming on and not talking about Elon   Musk only because I'm a little  already -- I'm a little tired. THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Iran-Iraqi war. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Iran-Iraqi war. THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Sit down on a night (INAUDIBLE). JEFFREY GOLDBERG: We're going to have  to leave it there. But I want to thank   Tom for joining me and thank  you at home for watching us. For more on the Trump-Musk fallout, sorry,   be sure to check out Charlie Warzel's  latest article at theatlantic.com.

          <attvalue for="7" value="Hello. – Hi. Do you speak English? – Yes. Can I ask you a question? We're looking for the green line, do you know where the green line is? It doesn't exist. – It doesn't exist? All of Israel is our land. All of Israel is yours? – Yeah. Did the the green line used to exist? – No, never. You don't recognise the green line, there is no green line? God gave us Israel, all of it. Reporting in the Middle East for over 20 years, I've seen the conflict between  Israelis and Palestinians deepen, shift and return to the same painful questions again and again. At one point, there was hope for a resolution based on the green line. Drawn in 1949 to separate Israel from the West Bank in Gaza, it was seen as the boundaries of a possible two-state solution. But today, amid Israel's devastating war in Gaza and the occupation of the West Bank, that vision feels more distant than ever. The green line still exists on maps, but on the ground it's been blurred, physically, politically and in  ways that continue to inflame the conflict.   How can you have your next door neighbour saying,  'I want to have a safe house right next door to you and also I want to kill you and I want to drive you into the sea.' In this series, I'm travelling along the green line, meeting  Palestinians and Israelis living just kilometres apart, but shaped by vastly different realities, to discover whether peace is still possible and what future they envision. Now in this moment, I'm looking, and I see the Dome of the Rock, and I see the al-Aqsa, and I know things are going to change in Jerusalem.   In episode one, I begin in Jerusalem, a city at the heart of the conflict, and where divisions run deep. Excuse me, do you know where the Green Line is? It used to be here somewhere, I think. I don't know. It's not here any more? – No, I don't know. All right, thank you. Do you know where the green line is? This way? – Straight. OK, shukran. Do you know where the green gine is? No idea. – Do you know what the green line is? No idea. I don't know anything about it. Go from there, all the way to the right. Is it a border, do I need my passport? [Laughs] No? – You don't need your passport. OK, thank you, shukran. I'll go find it, thank you, thank you. For most of those I ask, the green line no longer exists in Jerusalem,  and hasn't for a long time. In many ways, the erasure of the green line began in 1967, when Israel occupied the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including here in East Jerusalem. Sorry? We didn't occupy the Gaza Strip, it's ours. What did – What did the gentleman say? He's saying that Israel never occupied the Gaza Strip or the West Bank,  that these territories belong to Israel, they're theirs. years after the occupation began, Israel  annexed the eastern part of the city, expanding Jerusalem and declaring it as the complete and united capital of Israel. For Palestinians, many of whom were displaced from western Jerusalem during the creation of Israel in 1948, the ongoing occupation is a painful reminder  of the loss of their most important city. Why? Today does the green line  still have any meaning for you? This is 'bullshit' in English. For me, this is my past and it's my future, and for you, when you come here, it's a story. For us, this isn't a story. It's our life and it's our survival. As the the Arabs express themselves, they're saying, 'no Jews should live in Israel', and they say it openly. They have an open agenda not a hidden – But I think the official position of the Palestinian government in any case has been of one of two states. Is that not something you would support? One of the three characteristics of a Jew is that they're compassionate, and we're compassionate until they're standing with rifles at us wanting to kill us and kill our children. Then we say, hang on a second, a two-state solution? Before we can talk about a two-state solution, we need to say, 'are you willing to live in peace?' The majority of those living in East Jerusalem are Palestinians but since the occupation began, an increasing number of Israeli settlers have crossed the Green Line and moved into Palestinian areas of the city. Shalom. Tziporah Piltz is one such settler. A mother of 10 and a tour guide, she's chosen to raise her family in the Arab neighbourhood of Ras al-Amud. Her home is located in the middle of a Jewish cemetery and overlooks one of Islam's holiest sites, al-Aqsa Mosque compound. We'll walk around over here, we'll see the view of the Temple Mount. Let's do it. – OK, let's go. We've lived here for 23 years. This is a very special cemetery because in the redemption, we're going to have the Messiah, we're going to have the temple, and all the dead people are going to become alive again so it's going to start from here, from the Mount of Olives. That's why people – – This is where going to where it's going to – Exactly, it's going to start from here. – OK, interesting. This is East Jerusalem and I like to talk about the Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem. You see there's a wall at the end of the the trees over there? – Yeah. They have 10 families living over there. Now all the mountain over there, that you see there now, is empty, that's going to be a big Jewish  neighbourhood of 300 families. So who makes that? The Jerusalem municipality, the Israeli government?  The Israeli government, yeah. That will be the eastern neighbourhood of of Yerushalayim What does it feel like for you, living, as you described, surrounded by Palestinian Arabs from this community in East Jerusalem. Well I feel it's a privilege, OK, living here,   because the first reason is as making  all Yerushalayim, all Jerusalem to be Jewish, that's like one of our aims, and to live overlooking the holiest site, overlooking the Temple Mount. This is the reason why I live here, you see this is my house over here. Wow, I have never seen the old city from this perspective. Yeah, this is amazing, amazing. The world was founded from this spot, OK, because over here is still the first temple of King Solomon, over here is the second temple of King Herod, and I believe where is going to be the third temple. So tell me about that, you say you want to build the third temple, why is that important to you? After the destruction of the second temple, we were all separated to Poland, Germany and Morocco and Yemen. What kept the Jews in all of these countries is the coming back to our nation, to our homeland, and rebuilding the Third Temple. Now, in this moment, I'm looking and I see the Dome of the Rock and I see the al-Aqsa and I know that it doesn't have to be in this spot. So, is there a place for both of them to exist or do you have to actually destroy one of those Islamic sites in order to build the temple?   We cannot have a mosque together with the Third Temple together, it doesn't go together. Meaning one of those structures, the al-Aqsa mosque, has to go in order for the temple to be built? Yes. My daily music. Instead of hearing the muezzin calling people to pray, I know that I'm supposed to hear the levites playing their instruments in the temple. I know it's music I'm supposed to hear, this is something temporarily,  it's not supposed to be in Israel. Do you ever see a solution based around two states –  one for Israelis one for Palestinians – based on the Green Line?   Definitely not. To give the Palestinian state, it means to give away, to give up, my homeland. The more settlements we'll have in Judea and the more settlements we're going to have in Samaria, that will solve our side because we need Jews, not only living in Tel Aviv and Haifa, we need two million, three millions Jews living in those in our original homeland. Now you're asking what to do with all the Arabs, and uh – That's a logical question to ask next, I mean, what about all the Arabs that are living already in East Jerusalem in these neighbourhoods that you mentioned. OK, so first of all, we have to know that Jerusalem is the capital of the state of Israel. If other people want to live here, they're welcome, they could live in Jerusalem, but they have their obligations what to do, OK. If the Palestinians you mentioned were to to stay  in Jerusalem, what would they need to do exactly?   First of all, recognise that things are going to change in the Temple Mount, we're going to have the Third Temple, OK. Things are going to change. Look, we have a lot of Arab countries all over the world, and we have only one homeland.  Everybody has to accept that this is our homeland But for Palestinians like Ramzi Abbassi, whose roots to Jerusalem trace back generations, this is the only homeland he's ever known. Like Tziporah, Ramsey is also a tour guide of Jerusalem. With a large following on social media, he creates videos about the issues facing Palestinians in this ancient city. Hi, Ramzi. – How are you doing, kefak. How's it going, nice to meet you, Matthew. The green line was here. – Yes, here, exactly. If a Palestinian from  the Gaza Strip or the West Bank, they want to come to Jerusalem, are they able to? and you have a lot of soldiers  and police walking around, I guess? in 2023, Ramzi was convicted by an Israeli court for communicating with a person affiliated with a terror group and for working with a banned social media platform, charges he vehemently denies. I've been noticing, we've been trying to talk with a lot of Palestinians here in East Jerusalem and a lot of people they're scared to say anything political, why is that? You're not worried about yourself to talk about these things? After taking me on a tour, Ramzi joins his  family for a meal at their favourite spot,   on the rooftops of the old city,  overlooking the al-Aqsa compound. How is it to live in Jerusalem? The Israelis will say they're doing all of this because they're worried about attacks from Palestinians, that they need to do all this for self-defence, what do you say to that? So, what's the solution then? As we eat, a group of a few dozen Jewish  Israeli women turn up on a tour of their own.   Leading the group is Tziporah. How's it going, we're filming. I'm giving a tour. – Are you? We've been going around the Old City  today just meeting all kinds of people   and it's funny we came across you here. So what are you doing? It's a tour that the whole aim of it is, first  of all, a connection between mothers and daughters. None of the women over here are from  Jerusalem, all of them are out of Jerusalem to increase the rebuilding of the temple, that's the whole aim of the tour, this is what we do. In the next episode, I'll travel north along the green line to the city of Tulkarm, meeting Palestinians  displaced from their homes and speaking with Israelis living in towns just across the wall facing the edge of the West Bank." />

Hamas militants rampaged across Southern Israel killing 1,400 people they also captured almost 250 hostages it was a core part of their strategy to give themselves a bargaining chip during the war they started they're bargaining hard demanding around 20 Palestinian prisoners be released in exchange for every hostage despite their reputation Israel seems to be struggling to get the hostages out

Israel there's a famous story there's movies and books about it it's told over and over at special events ladies and gentlemen like this one that Benjamin Netanyahu went to in 2016 this is a deeply moving day for me it's like the Israeli galipoli their watero their Gettysburg we have gathered here to mark an event that inspired the world and lifted the spirits of my people it's the day Israel rescued 100 and two hostages from the heart of Africa International terrorism suffered a stinging defeat and a legend was born the rescue mission proved that good can Prevail over evil that hope can triumph over fear and it's personal for Netanyahu because it's also the day his brother died I learned from my brother and from others that two need things are needed above all to defeat terrorism Clarity and courage he see the late 1960s and early 1970s were big for plane hijackings there was very little security in airports no x-ray machines you could take liquids on the plane nail scissors a gun even a bomb a couple of sticks of dynamite sitting in the seat next to him he told us right from the start that he meant business and he was going to throw us all up usually when someone hijacked a plane they would just trying to get into or out of communist Cuba but the era of high stakes poit iCal hijackings began in 1970 when Palestinian militants took four planes with Israelis on board the hijacking in a single week of four jet airliners by one of the more extreme Guerilla organizations the popular front for the liberation of Palestine one plane was taken to Cairo the other three to a runway in the middle of the Jordanian desert the Palestinians claimed they'd blow up the planes with passengers on board if certain European governments and Israel refused to release Arab Commandos held in their jails after 6 days in the desert heat the terrorist Dems were met and the hostages released though the people were spared the planes were not $24 million reduced to ashes giving into hijackers demands was not something Israel was Keen to turn into a habit so when another Plane full of Israelis was hijacked they decided to do something about it it was 1972 and Palestinian militants had taken control of a plane they landed at Tel Aviv airport and demanded the release of 315 Palestinian prisoners who were being held in Israeli jails after 24 hours of negotiations the Israeli government appeared to give in they told the hijackers they'd concede to their demands and bring the prisoners to the airport and they could use the plane to fly everyone off to Egypt the hijackers were delighted they were so happy they cracked open the plane's emergency doors a little bit to let in a breeze but the Israelis said they'd have to fix the plane before it could take off because the tires were flat because the Israelis had punctured them 16 mechanics in white overalls approached the plane in baggage carts among the mechanics were two future Israeli Prime Ministers ahood Barack and Benjamin Netanyahu sorry to be clear the men weren't actually mechanics they were Special Forces soldiers and in their tool boxes were guns watching from the sidelines was netanyahu's older brother Yoni also a Commando Commander Barack had refused to let both brothers join the operation in case both were killed the mechanics arrived at the plane and I don't know donked the side of it with hammers and spanners a bit before pulling their guns out and ripping open the emergency doors Netanyahu pounced on one of the militants and demanded and did she' tell him where the bomb was there was a scuffle people started shooting Netanyahu was hit in the arm two hijackers and one hostage were killed in a matter of seconds it was all over the hostages were released the story of bib netanyahu's daring rescue mission became famous and a part of his personal mythology but an even more famous and far more dangerous Mission the one spoken on in reverent tones to this day was yet to come and now the big one see 4 years later Israel was put to the test again and it was Yoni netanyahu's turn to go this time the hijacked plane wasn't in Israel it wasn't even in the Middle East we were really at the ends of the Earth we could have been on the moon the Air France plane took off from Tel Aviv and was supposed to land in Paris instead the hijackers diverted the plane midair Cynthia zega and 250 hostages were taken to the old terminal at uganda's International Airport on the shore of lank Victoria if you look at a map you realize that even if you escaped from that building where would you go the plane had been hijacked by Palestinian and German extremists but the hostages were now under the control of someone even scarier they now the virtual hostages of the Ugandan president Ed AR mean yes idam me the brutal dictator of Uganda the world's favorite evil buffoon idaman made no secret of his hatred of Israel but is it true that you said the Hitler didn't kill enough Jews during the war and of his support for the Palestinian C the year before the hijacking Palestinian leader yasa Arafat had served as best man at one of am's weddings when idaman found out about the plane he saw an incredible opportunity to get a bit of international attention he came every day with a television crew with a radio crew the non-israeli passengers were released leaving 103 passengers and crew still in the terminal building there was Terror constantly we were always surrounded by men with guns men with grenades we also were surrounded outside the building by the Ugandan army with heavy arms with Bazookas with machine guns the terrorist demands were the same as last time releasing Palestinian prisoners in Israel the families of the hostages protested outside government officers to demand the trade the Israeli governments understood to be under heavy pressure from Jews with relatives being held in Uganda earlier there had been emotional scenes when some of the relatives marched on the cabinet building to plead for the lives of the hostages Yoni Netanyahu by this stage was a battle hardened and highly decorated soldier a veteran of three Wars and several special ops he was put in charge of a rescue operation that was so insane that the terrorists never imagined it was possible the main problem was to get to the terrorist with the biggest surprise possible we used several tricks to do that the hijackers have been holding the hostages for a week when finally the operation began on July 4th 1976 Israel launched the most daring rescue of all time to save our captive brethren in the heart of Africa Israeli planes flew at an altitude of less than 30 m for thousands of kilometers before approaching Uganda over Lake Victoria they landed in the dead of night in a country led by a brutal dictator who gave Refuge to terrorists when the plane landed the Commandos rolled out in a black Mercedes identical to IDI ain's car flanked by Land Rovers they were dressed in ug Ugandan army uniforms Ugandan soldiers thinking it was their terrifying president let the cars approach the terminal it took less than an hour the Commandos burst out of the car and blasted their way through the airport killing seven hijackers and 45 ugandans most of them did not understand until the last moment what really happened they blew up 11 fighter jets to make sure they could Escape safely three hostages were killed and also a senior Israeli officer was killed shot in the back my beloved brother Yoni who led the force that stormed the old terminal overcame the terrorists and freed the hostages was the only soldier who was killed the operation immediately became legendary when the hostages returned home there were parties in the street it was retroactively renamed operation yonathan in net Yahoo's memory by the end of the year production had begun on eight separate movies about the raid Warner Brothers victory at nby starring Bert Lancaster Elizabeth Taylor and Kirk Douglas will premere in Sydney in a few days time the movie starred Richard dfus as Yoni Netanyahu we've got the terrorists we can start moving the hostages out there have since been questions raised about netanyahu's actions leading up to and during the rain with some reports suggesting that he was on the verge of being relieved of command just beforehand but that's not the narrative spread by the Netanyahu family Benjamin Netanyahu became internationally famous appearing regularly on American television to talk about his brother and I think it grew inspiration from the Bible from the biblical Heroes Benjamin Netanyahu is the brother of the Fallen Jonathan and he is now a ambassador from Israel to the United Nations and be the editor of a new book called terrorism How the West can win books have been written about y Netanyahu including the publication of his private letters this is a book uh that our guest has written the letters of Jonathan uh his brother netu self-portrait of a of a hero this is something you might enjoy reading around the world military forces tried to replicate Israel's success in fighting against terrorists they failed in Iran the is one of national delight at America's disastrous failure to bring home the hostages but this only added to Israel's mistake the idea that they were the only ones up to the job in the following decades other successful though admittedly less spectacular hostage rescues solidified this image and retaliatory attacks by Israel against Palestinian targets sent a clear message if you take israeli's hostage we'll get them back and then we'll kill you people ask for Revenge we determined to settle the account now Israel's reputation is being put to the test Hamas has 239 hostages being held in their vast network of tunnels dug into the soft Sandstone under the suburbs of Gaza Hamas claims the tunnels are more than 500 km long there so many hostages in so many different places that Hamas took a while to figure out how many they had hopes of a rescue operation are slim at least in previous operations they knew where the hostages were this time they're spread across Gaza so option b is a trade the hostages families are pleading with Benjamin Netanyahu to get their loved ones back I'm begging the world to bring my baby back home the families are desperate some are mourning the death of loved ones while they hope for the release of others the family is broken can their father saki is being held hostage in Gaza their 18-year-old sister Mayan is dead Hamas says that they are willing to do a trade Hamas declared this that they are ready for immediate exchange so that all civilians Israeli civilians will come home and in exchange for Palestinian prisoners being released I think that's fair but it's expected that to get them all released it will take a massive release of Palestinian prisoners potentially thousands in 2011 Israel had to release a th000 prisoners in exchange for one single soldier who was being held hostage in Gaza so far Hamas has only released four hostages two Americans and two Israeli grandmothers 85-year-old Israeli grandmothers yav lifshits and 79-year-old nurit Cooper are given treats and tea before being released one reaches her hand out to her armed guard and says Salam which is Arabic for peace one Israeli soldier who is being held hostage in Gaza has been rescued the families of the other 239 hostages have asked Netanyahu to trade all 4500 Palestinian prisoners for all 239 hostages in what they're calling an all for all deal and we the families will not stop until everybody is back nyaho says he's considering it but he'll find it difficult to persuade his hard-right political allies that it's the right thing to do Israeli defense minister says an all for all deal is impossible and the only solution is for the Defense Force to destroy Hamas sometimes in Gaza the living look like the Dead Israel said it hit more than 400 Hamas Targets in 24 hours Hamas says that Israeli bombings have already killed 50 hostages the question is will there be any hostages Left Alive by the time Hamas is

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] hi everyone welcome to the 700 Club israel has taken a historic step to protect itself from future terrorist attacks and prevent the creation of a Palestinian state right on its borders hamas has reportedly rejected the latest ceasefire offer from the United States that allows Israel to continue to expand its military offensive in Gaza chris Mitchell brings us the story from Jerusalem israeli troops push further into northern Gaza warning civilians to get out of harm's way us Envoy Steve Witkov's ceasefire and hostage deal would reportedly lead to Hamas freeing 10 of the remaining living hostages in the first week of the 60-day ceasefire in exchange Israel would free more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners a major sticking point hamas wants guarantees israel won't return to fighting after the ceasefire but Israel's prime minister says he wants the fighting to resume and continue until Hamas is eliminated in Gaza meanwhile the Israeli government has made an historic decision to approve 22 new communities in the biblical heartland of the Jewish nation Judea and Samaria also known as the West Bank this will help block Palestinians from forming a state in this area and according to Defense Minister Israel Katz it also provides a buffer for the nation security as he put it Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria serves as a vital security barrier for Israel's major population centers we must do everything in our power to expand and reinforce this protective shield it was the first volley in the government's effort to head off another unilateral move for a Palestinian state by some Western powers including France next month France's president at a summit in New York City will push for most of the world to altogether recognize a Palestinian state israeli foreign minister Gedon Sar warned that such a declaration would reward the Hamas terrorists who committed the October 7th atrocities he added &quot;Unilateral moves against Israel will be met with unilateral Israeli measures we will not get any dictates from outside with regard to our national security.&quot; This fits with the foreign minister's statements this week that if outside nations push to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state in Judea and Samaria Israel will respond by declaring sovereignty over more and more of the area all right Chris Mitchell joins us now from Jerusalem a lot to talk about chris how does Israel approving these new settlements help block the creation of a Palestinian state well one of the main things is this uh Andrew it actually creates facts on the ground it it strengthens Israel's claim to the land and what will happen is that more Israelis will be moving and living in Judea and Samaria uh and it would make the withdrawal that happened 20 years ago uh unlikely what happened 20 years ago Andrew is uh what's called the Gaza disengagement uh Israel unilaterally pulled out of Gaza and five communities in northern Samaria that was uh that was as we see right now we see the effects of what happened uh Gaza became one of the biggest terror bases in all of the world and so this is designed to help prevent a Palestinian uh state it's really a strategic shift really historic move uh Andrew away from a two-state solution and the next step as we mentioned in that report maybe declaring sovereignty over Judea and Samaria so what are Israel's biggest concerns about a potential Palestinian state well one of the main concerns Andrew is security and they looked at what happened after the disengagement in 2007 as I mentioned what Gaza became the biggest terror base in the world and then we had tens of thousands of rockets since then and then of obviously what happened on October 7th a Palestinian state would be in the heart of Israel and it would be close to Tel Aviv the Bengorian airport and Jerusalem and people are concerned it could be another terror base uh we also see a terror hub so to speak in places like Nabis and Janine and we also see that after October 7th many of the Palestinians in Judea and Samaria they actually supported October 7th and they believe that if you look at places like Palestinian Media Watch which monitors Palestinian media uh there's really anti-Semitic anti-Israel uh anti-Jewish propaganda almost every day so this marks uh no more uh going back to the Oslo style negotiations and a belief for many that this is really the land promised in the Bible to the Jewish people all right Chris let's talk about the war in Gaza there's a new way to distribute humanitarian aid to the Palestinians there what impact does that have on Hamas well it's a major impact Andrew and actually this is a dramatic uh development and what it does is it bypasses the ability for Hamas to steal the humanitarian aid uh and feed their own terrorists and then actually they often sell it back to the population and they've been doing this since the beginning of the war so what this new humanitarian effort which is called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation it really undermines Hamas's control over the population hamas is warning the people no don't go to these areas and get the humanitarian aid but many are ignoring Hamas uh and so Hamas wants to stop in any negotiations wants to stop this because it really represents a threat to their control uh and to their authority and weakens them dramatically all right Chris while I have you let's talk about another layer in all this there ongoing reports of worries in Israel about a possible Trump administration nuclear deal with Iran what are those concerns Israel has well here uh over here Andrea they don't trust Iran uh Iran violated the uh 2015 JCPOA that was an agreement that was designed to limit Iran's nuclear program and uh over here they believe that a bad deal by the US and Iran would allow Iran to continue to enrich uranium and they believe over here that Iran is committed ideologically and theologically to nuclear weapons part of their belief in the return of the Shiite Messiah the Mahi and they believe diplomacy really is not going to stop Iran uh and while this window continues there seem to be going towards a nuclear weapon an existential threat to Israel all right Chris always appreciate your great reporting thanks for being with us today thanks Andrew all right everyone in other news President Trump has won a victory in court on his top tariffs john Jessup has that story and more from our CBN News Bureau in Washington john that is right Andrew a roller coaster legal battle for the White House over the president's major tariffs over the course of just a day first on Wednesday a three judge panel at the US Court of International Trade block the president from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency powers law the panel ruled the president exceeded his authority with his liberation day tariffs the administration quickly appealed then on Thursday a federal appeals court temporarily halted the trade court's order and allowed the president to continue collecting the tariffs under the law for now the case is expected to go to the Supreme Court well turning now to the spiritual world in a time when churches are closing Christian leaders from across Europe met in Berlin at the European Congress on Evangelism this week not just for conference but for a wake-up call cbn's Brie Carter has that story [Music] you are [Music] Berlin is a city once divided by walls this week Christian leaders from

He joins Democracy Now! to discuss his work, the necessity of advocating for Palestinian rights, and the violence of Israeli occupation. Abu Toha, who evacuated Gaza in late 2023 after being arrested, beaten and detained by the Israeli military, now resides in Syracuse, New York. He says that, while grateful for the platform granted by the Pulitzer, he cannot celebrate the achievement while &quot;my sisters, my brothers and my parents in Gaza are starving.&quot; Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip has trapped millions of Palestinians in famine conditions, unable to evacuate and under threat of daily bombings and Israeli troop movements. &quot;The only celebration for me is when there is an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza [and] the West Bank, and when justice and peace are served in Palestine,&quot; says Abu Toha.&#10;&#10;Democracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on over 1,500 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

Amy Goodman with Juan Gonzalez israeli strikes on Gaza have killed at least 11 Palestinians so far today with deadly attacks reported in Kanunis in Bethlia in Gaza City the attacks follow Israeli attacks that killed 54 Palestinians Monday health officials in Gaza say at least 57 Palestinians have already starved to death the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees in reported some 66,000 children in Gaza are suffering severe malnutrition due to Israel's total blockade of food and aid now in its ninth week some Palestinians have resorted to eating turtle meat grass rotten or expired food one displaced grandmother Um Muhammad Al Talka said it took her five hours of standing in a line at a community kitchen in Gaza's Nusadat district to get one meal to feed her hungry children and grandchildren i've been coming here since 8:00 a.m to the Takaya soup kitchen for food to alleviate our hunger and be able to stand up we are suffering from famine real famine i have not eaten anything since this morning i cannot speak because of hunger on Monday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outlined plans for the stepped up offensive on Gaza saying the Palestinian population quote will be moved for its own protection he says the whole population must move south netanyahu did not say how much of Gaza Israel plans to seize reuters reports it could include all of Gaza's territory we're joined now by the acclaimed Palestinian poet Masab Abu Toha on Monday he won a Pulitzer Prize for commentary for his writings in the New Yorker magazine he was praised for his quote essays on the physical and emotional carnage in Gaza that combined deep reporting with the intimacy of memoir to convey the Palestinian experience of more than a year and a half of war with Israel.&quot; At least 31 of MSab's family members have been killed by Israel in Gaza his books include things you may find hidden in my ear poems from Gaza and Forest of Noise first Mosab it's terrible to say in light of what's happening in Gaza to start off by saying congratulations but wow you just won the Pulitzer Prize talk about what this means to you and the statement you put out um as you learned of this huge honor uh first of all I would like to thank you Amy u appreciate your work appreciate Democracy Now thank you so much for your voice um uh this honor has u brought to me tears and joy uh I mean joy because uh this is um um I mean this is a big prize this is something that every every writer um I mean writer and and artist and journalist it dreams of uh winning uh but this is also very sad for me because the pieces for which I I won the prize the the four pieces I mean I wrote about seven or eight pieces for the New Yorker uh this prize was uh awarded to uh four of my pieces uh the four pieces are one for uh one about an article that I wrote about starvation in Gaza the other one was about the difficulty of traveling as a Palestinian the third one was about uh the loss of the refugee camp and the fourth uh was about um the Gaza we leave behind uh and unfortunately as I'm you know looking at the titles of these essays the situation in Gaza is worsening i mean not day after day but minute after minute and people are are dying I mean children are dying of hunger uh people are dying for lack of uh not only food but also medicine uh so this this this prize means a lot to me but it also reminds me that that there's a lot uh to work on not only um uh by writing but also uh encouraging uh people who have the power to take action to stop all of this and Mosab uh I wanted to ask you given the fact of the continuing attacks of the Israelis in Gaza and the complete failure of the world community to be able to do anything to stop Israel uh your sense of uh what you're seeing in terms of the American public uh since you've been in the United States in terms of its response uh to the war i think the American public uh and also people around the world are eager uh to learn uh they I mean the unfortunately the mainstream media is not doing enough uh Israel has been uh preventing uh people from visiting Gaza not only after October 7th but even before but especially after October 7th um uh journalists medics u a few a very very few little number of of of uh doctors have been allowed to go to Gaza i think the American people need to uh uh need to hear more and more voices i mean my voice is I mean is one is only one voice that uh that that is necessary to hear but there are so many other voices that that are there still in Gaza journalists and writers and artists and and and and um and university professors who have so many stories to tell my story is one story my story is other people's stories but we we need to hear more and more people and I think that the American public uh is truly eager and not only eager but I mean they they feel the necessity they they feel the the duty uh to hear and learn uh about more and more stories in Gaza and I'm happy that my power pieces that won these awards are uh stories that I wrote about myself about my people in Gaza about the refugee camp where I was born my family members who were killed my my my students my my my great aunt whose body is still under until today since last October um so there are so many other stories uh that are to be heard and I hope that the American magazines and newspapers and the American channels news channels would open up their spaces to let these writers and people in Gaza share their stories because this is what we should be doing at least i mean I mean killing people in Gaza is one crime but also not not giving them the space to talk about their pain and also demands because all the time we hear you know politicians yesterday we hear President Trump saying that I we want to we want to help the people of Gaza we want to we they have to move we will feed them but I mean come on i mean we are not people who need to be fed we are not hungry because we don't have food we are hungry because we are under occupation we are under siege we are we are under genocide this is not this is not what people in Gaza want it's not that they want only to eat they want freedom this is what they want masab Abu Tawha I want to turn to you speaking at the Jewish Voice for Peace National Meeting this weekend you read If I Must Die by the great Palestinian poet killed in Rafa Rafat Alar if I must die by Al if I must die you must live to tell my story to sell my things to buy a piece of cloth and some strings make it white with a long tail so that a child somewhere in Gaza while looking heaven in the eye awaiting his dad who left in a blaze and bid no one farewell not even his to his flesh not even to himself see the kite my kite you made flying up above and thinks for a moment an angel is there bringing back love if I must die let it bring hope let it be a tail if I must die mosab Abu Toha you referenced Rafat uh in winning uh the Pulitzer Prize yesterday talk about your relationship with him who he was and what he means for the people of Palestine yeah I talked a lot about Rifhat i wrote about him uh Rifat was a university professor uh who was murdered and this is not mentioned a lot he was not only murdered alone he was murdered along with his with two of his siblings and four nephews uh Rifat died while he was holding a pen in his hand while he was wearing his glasses uh reading poetry and writing more poems to us um asking us to continue his message which is the tale of every people in who are oppressed by occupation who are under siege who are dying in a genocide if I must die let it bring hope let it be a tale if he must die we need to tell Rafad's tale we need to I mean as I said before if I must die this is a crime to be to for someone to die to be killed by occupation and we have to remember here that 70% of the population in Gaza are refugees so these refugees they have stories it's not that they were killed by an occupation no they were killed as they have dreamed all their lives to return to their homeland so died with his with two of his siblings and four nephews and in the past he lost another brother in 2014 so Rifatwas was not only a writer he was not only a university professor but he was also a mentor for so many young writers he introduced me to the we are not numbers project in 2014 after the Israeli 51-day attacks on Gaza which claimed the lives of three close friends of mine about whom I wrote uh in my poetry and in my essays so Rifat was was was more than I mean it is a huge loss and this is why we have to honor his memory by continuing to tell the tales not only and when Rifhat said let it be a tale it's not only Rifhat's tale because Rifhat's tale my tale my grandparents tail are the tales of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and our tales are not only Palestinian tales it is a human tale of loss after loss loss after loss while the world is watching us so we refuse to die just like that we will we will fight to live not only to live but also to tell the stories of those who died before us who were who were who were meant to die in blindness to die in darkness no we will live we will fight we will continue to speak up because this loss the loss of Rifhat and so many hundreds of my friends and family members should not uh be a waste they we should tell the stories of these people because we don't want to lose more people when we write a poem it's not because we feel we feel pain for those who we lost but we are trying to stir people into action when they feel what we are feeling and uh Moab you you have been you have been telling the stories of what has been going on there through your poetry and writing but even in the United States it has not been easy there right-wing groups have called for deporting you uh and uh and President Trump is cracking down on non-citizens critical of Israel talk about the problems you've had even being able to speak at many universities um I mean I mean this is this is the tragedy of being a Palestinian or being a pro Palestinian human rights you are not safe living in Palestine for example in my case in Gaza I was wounded at the age of 16 in an airirst strike that killed seven people i lost three close friends of mine in 2014 i was abducted by the Israeli forces in November 2023 i lost my house which is the family my family house in in October 2023 two of my brothersin-laws in brothersin-law were abducted by the forces and we don't know anything about them so and I lost so many members of my family as I said and I survived by the way air strikes I mean air strikes that were just two houses away from me in Jabalia camp or in Betah so it is I mean to live in Gaza is is very dangerous so I didn't feel safe living in Gaza and now when I'm traveling outside of Gaza not only in the United States I don't feel safe because I mean we are not usually welcome anywhere it's not only in the United States but it's it's most of the world and now when when when we come to the United States you know to raise our families and to to share the stories of people who we lost i mean I'm not talking about I'm not talking about another people so this is this is what is different about me as Muslim i'm not talking about other people i'm talking about myself talking about my siblings about my parents about my grandparents i'm talking about the graves of my great my my grandparents who I will never find because Israel destroyed cemeteries i will not take my grandchildren and show them the kindergarten where I which I attended not my my university where where from where I graduated in Gaza i mean to come here and speak about these things is not even welcome so what should what should I do as Palestinian i mean I don't know no I mean uh we we I mean this word doesn't make sense in Gaza you will be you will get killed wounded or abducted when you go out and try to speak about these things you are uh being chased by these hate groups these extremist groups so what what is what do they want to from me and when they talk about deportation I mean I mean someone would deport someone to to to their homeland but my homeland is occupied i wish I could go back to Gaza but before you deport me back to Gaza I need to be in Gaza where Palestine is free i can't go back to a country that is not only under occupation but that is undergoing genocide so I would I would I would love to go back to Gaza i don't I mean it is it is not my my my biggest dream to live in United States my biggest dream is to live in my free homeland in Palestine to to be able to visit uh the the original home city and live in the original home city of my grandparents Yafa which is also the name of my uh 80-year-old daughter this is this is this is why where I would like to be deported i would like to go back and live in a free uh Palestine masab I want to thank you so much for taking this time to talk with us i'm so sorry also that you had to cancel your tour all over the country you apologized to people at all the universities where you were going to be speaking saying how much you looked forward to sharing a Forest of Noise with them i want to congratulate you on your son's birthday this weekend as you were at Jewish Voice for Peace uh speaking and reading your poetry and also ask if it's Syracuse University where you are now if they'll be holding a big celebration you are now a Pulitzer Prize winner as was announced yesterday yeah I mean uh yes I'm looking forward to celebrate but as but but as you understand it is not easy for me to celebrate anything i mean um I mean during the some some of the events people would be dancing on music I mean I I I do not feel fine you know celebrating something i am the only celebration is for me is when there is a an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and also in the West Bank and when justice and peace are served in Palestine this is the only this is the only reason for me to celebrate but I can't celebrate while I'm while I know that my sisters my my brothers and my parents in Gaza are starving you know I'm sending them this this good news telling them that this is my hope that my voice would reach more and more people who have the power to intervene and stop this suffering i can't just dance or eat you know cake or or just you know I mean it is it is not normal for me but what is what is what is good about this is that this recognition I hope would prove uh to be a step towards great under a greater understanding and would uh stir people in power to take action to put an end because I don't want to continue writing essays and poems about these these the these painful uh memories and these painful realities mab Abu Toha thank you so much palestinian poet and author on Monday he won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary for his essays published in the New Yorker

          <attvalue for="3" value="Watch the second episode:    • How is Israel’s military tech marketed abr...  &#10;&#10;Uncovering how Israel profits from surveillance technologies using occupied Palestinian territories as a testing ground.&#10;&#10;Israel punches way above its weight when it comes to arms sales. The 97th country by population, it is the ninth largest arms dealer in the world with a $13bn military-industrial complex.&#10;&#10;&quot;Plenty of countries sell weapons,&quot; says award-winning journalist Antony Loewenstein, &quot;but what makes Israel's industry unique is the mix of weapons, surveillance technology and architectural techniques that combine to create a comprehensive system for controlling 'difficult' populations and are based on years of experience in Palestine.&quot;&#10;&#10;In this two-part series, Loewenstein goes on a journey to investigate how these weapons and surveillance technologies are used to control and repress Palestinians in Palestine before being sold all over the world.&#10;&#10;Antony Loewenstein is a Jewish, Australian journalist and author who for more than 20 years has written unflinchingly about Israel and its relationship with the Palestinians, even though it has often put him at odds with many in the Jewish diaspora and Israel.&#10;&#10;In Episode 1, Loewenstein returns to Israel to investigate how cutting-edge military and surveillance technology is being used on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip, before being marketed to international clients as &quot;field-proven&quot; and &quot;battle-tested&quot;.&#10;&#10;Hearing from Palestinians and Israelis, he uncovers how a pipeline of personnel and research from the Israeli army feeds into semi-private arms companies which form a crucial part of Israel's exports to the world. He also investigates the Israeli army's use of targeting systems that utilise artificial intelligence during the Gaza war after October 7, 2023.&#10;&#10;Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe&#10;Follow us on X: https://x.com/ajenglish&#10;Find us on Facebook:   / aljazeera  &#10;Check our website:  https://www.aljazeera.com&#10;Check out our Instagram page:   / aljazeeraenglish  &#10;Download AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile&#10;&#10;#TheTruthUncovered #documentary #ThePalestineLaboratory #AlJazeeraEnglish #palestine #israel #technology #westbank #gaza #surveillance #aljazeera" />

anti-missile Systems sell around the world to undisclosed clients overall Israel exports more than $13 billion of weapons and surveillance equipment a year and with adverts like this for the spike Firefly Israeli companies hint that their products may have been battle tested in Palestine so how does being a major armed supplier impact Israel's diplomatic position could it give the country a measure of impunity when it wants to undertake its own [Music] Wars I've just got a stash of books from my publisher today uh my book and other books mostly related to Palestine and uh Guerilla journalism just some light reading I'm about to do an event a Q&amp;A about my book The Palestine laboratory the book's been quite controversial it's a look at how the occupation of Palestine allows Israel to test weapons which are then sold around the world I wanted to do a book really not just about the whole concept of the arms indust industry which is an interesting subject but can be a bit dry but what Israel is testing and selling and promoting is not just Weaponry it's an idea it's a concept and it's a very appealing concept to many other countries Israel sells the idea of getting away with it to find out how tiny Israel has managed to develop this huge military and surveillance machine I'm heading back to Israel and Palestine it's not really clear if I'm going to get in I haven't been there for a few years wish me luck although I'm Jewish I'm not a citizen of Israel and their immigration rules say they can refuse entry to critics of the country or those who have called for boycotts so they have multiple reasons for turning me away my arrival was surprisingly smooth so I'm heading straight to East Jerusalem Israel has been occupying the West Bank since 1967 and has developed a unique system of controlling the Palestinian population from checkpoints in the separation wall to increasingly Innovative methods of surveillance these walls are not just walls they can listen and they are listening to probably us right now I suspect it's it's in these population management technologies that Israel is a global leader so I want to see how they first use it to control Palestinians before being sold around the world I'm on my way to Mama a businessman in East Jerusalem to find out how all this impacts ordinary [Music] Palestinians you can see my office from this camera inside so the cameras are both looking into Damascus gate but also out in and out so I'm standing on a balcony literally overlooking Damascus gate it's osama's office his insurance office and all around behind me over there there's multiple surveillance Towers right behind me there's a camera watching me so I'm going to watch it Asama wants to show me the very physical reality of the occupation the restrictions on the movement of Palestinians his daily commute from the West Bank to Jerusalem is through the Candia checkpoint AMA how do you feel when you cross kandia checkpoint you're crying I 24 hours about my my daughter my son if he need me I am here and this is traffic I need 3 Hour 4 hour to go to to help my son you understand that I do I can understand why this would make you nervous you can see Soldier here any mistake you lost your life and that's happened many times yes the soldiers have the power to detain people like aama for hours question them and place them in administrative detention without charge or trial [Music] should ask that's it I can go I ask him it's almost like you have to ask permission to go into Jerusalem to get back to your own City but this physical infrastructure is just the beginning Israel has a vision of a seamless future where technology minimizes the interactions between Palestinians and the Israeli Army Israel says it's safer but it's quite dystopic my hi a meeting Palestinian digital rights campaigner monaa to find out more explain the growing Trend within Israeli thinking of a so-called frictionless occupation well the whole automation aims to eliminate the the direct interaction between the Israeli as occupying force and Palestinians as occupied people and to make the main interaction between Palestinians and the technology so it could create this idea that our problem is not with the occupier but rather with a technology heon is the testing ground for many of these supposedly frictionless Technologies the city is split into two zones H1 with a population of nearly 200,000 in H2 355,000 Palestinians live under the Gaze of the 750 settlers and 800 soldiers who have taken over the center of the city Palestinians living in H2 face the heaviest surveillance in the West Bank and the strictest travel [Music] restrictions fore fore cat for under the so-called frictionless occupation these cameras are linked to artificial intelligence systems watching for what Israel deames threatening behavior there's someone who watch you who knows what you are doing but you don't necessar know who's watching you Palestinians need to think about behaving at our best all the time sometimes you might be angry from something that happens with your family in your home or at your work and then you might look like angry and with a predictive policing you never know when you would be identified as a security threat by the Israelis so you need to fake your emotions if the frictionless occupation can't get a fixed camera on you it can send a flying one this was recorded just a few miles south of Hebron [Applause] Issa Amro is a human rights activist living in H2 this is a military post full of cameras and surveillance and they watch us for sure now so let's say hi I usually say hi to them we are in the main street in teda Palestinians are not allowed to drive here pal shops are closed by military orders and the street here is full of Israeli military surveillance let's see the Palestinian K kids in the window they are caged in the house look they they put fences in their Windows to be protected from the settler and army violence look surveillance for the military is up there and this is the surveillance of the Israeli settlers so imagine that the Israeli settlers they have their own systems here these checkpoints are where the latest frictionless technology is tested including this AI enabled remotely controlled gun which fires stung grenades tear gas and sponge tip bullets it's made by Israeli company smart shooter these checkpoints also boast Israel's most comprehensive data Gathering tool Wolfpack from 10 to 15 cameras are at the checkpoint this is where they use red wolf and blue wolf the Israeli military recently invented two systems red wolf and blue wolf blue wolf in the soldiers phones they take your photo then they know all details about you where you've been where you go what you like what you don't like your private things then there is another system the red wolf is set up in the checkpoints and in the control rooms and it's profiling Palestinians according to their political stands when the soldiers scan a Palestinian face they get a traffic light style indication of their supposed risk white for Palestinians who are not doing anything about occupation you have yellow and you have orange for example I'm a human rights Defender I am red it means check him make his life harder he's a suspect so the frictionless technology actually enables a lot more friction for some people they use us as simulation objects for their technology Israeli sec SEC solution companies they installed cameras sensors drones and they tested it on us without our consent do they sell it do they use it for other research what kind of data they collect it seems to be the often secret Partnerships between the military and private sector that have helped Israeli companies become world leaders in their fields in 2019 a report revealed that Israeli company any Vision had installed Styles in the West Bank and was collecting movement and biometric data from the tens of thousands of Palestinians forced to use them early investor Microsoft pulled their funding after this was revealed the company changed its name to Uso and says it works in 43 countries with clients including casinos airports and schools another Israeli company visites make behavioral recognition systems that watch CCTV feeds for any threats the company actually created the ability to take a realtime video stream and understand what's going on within the stream the company is supported by the Israeli military it's marketed for use in cities prisons and refugee camps around the [Music] world we're in abis in East Jerusalem and I'm standing next to a old but now derelict Hotel owned by Palestinians and during the second Intero in the early 2000s the separation wall was built and it's kind of surrounded now on all sides no one can access it the owners can't use it the guests are not coming but what Israel has done is on the top they've installed surveillance cameras the location is patrolled by police and private security 24 hours a day just a minute ago we saw the move probably to watch us minutes later four young Israeli police officers with machine guns approached us so what are you explaining about the situation this formerly Palestinian Run Hotel taken over by the military and turned into a surveillance post could be seen as a microcosm of the occupation but what is visible is just part of the overall picture of how the occupation surveils Palestinians first there is the physical infrastructure of walls and checkpoints the checkpoints record movement data and biometric information then they have CCTV cameras which are monitored by AI for perceived threats of violence and that in turn is hooked up to databases like red wolf which track everyone's political profile but there's also a more fundamental level of surveillance which is that most of the phone and internet system is routed through Israel Israel is controlling the ICT infrastructure in the in in the occupied Palestinian territory which means that Palestinians are not able to have safe access to the internet with control of basic Communications infrastructure the Israelis know every phone number and can tap any call Israeli intelligence also have teams monitoring all the social media platforms many Palestinians basically they don't share their political opinion online because they would be afraid of being interrogated or arrested by the Israelis I find it remarkable that sometimes blanket CCTV coverage analyzed by artificial intelligence and backed up by biometric movement tracking just isn't enough surveillance I'm off to meet a man who once presented such a threat to the authorities that they deployed the world's most invasive spye on him Anthony hithon lovely to meet you U alaboodi didn't look threatening to me he runs the bisan center which campaigns for the rights of Palestinians do you have any idea why you were targeted I think it has to do with the targeting of any kind of Palestinian Civil Society Israel sees us as part of a establishing that there is a Palestinian people how did you hear that your phone had been infected by Pegasus and why do you think that happened you're working with Palestinian human rights organization El haak right I was contact by alhak in late 2021 they found that one of their employees had Pegasus on his phone I had my device checked and they told me that my phone was infected by Pegasus spyware a couple of days later the Israeli uh Minister of Defense uh benig Gans designated six Palestinian Civil Society organization as terrorist organization including ban including ban Pegasus is unique spyware that can access every aspect of your phone it can take control of your camera your microphone and broadcast it to those controlling the software they can see your location access your data and see what's on your screen including encrypted messaging apps is there anything you feel like you can do or do you ultimately feel like there's not much you can practically do it was explained to me by a citizen lab that once a state actor goes after any citizen or small organization there's basically very little they can do Pegasus is produced by Israeli surveillance company NSO and is marketed to government agencies as a tool for fighting crime and terrorism in 2021 an investigation revealed that around 50,000 people worldwide potentially had it on their phones and a large number of them were journalists lawyers dissidents and human rights Defenders 1 2 34 we don't want your cyber War it's no accident that this spyware was developed in is much of nso's staff is drawn from the Army's cyber intelligence unit [Music] 88,200 this unit is tasked with Gathering intelligence from electronic communications and conducting cyber warfare against Palestinians it's known for being highly Innovative and spinning out successful cyber security companies like NSO to find out how 88,200 has helped Israel become a global leader in surveillance technology I'm meeting Yakov Perry a former director of the shined intelligence agency this one here was you dressed as an Arab in Gaza when do you think that was 88 1988 can you say what you were doing no okay that's um 68 yeah okay in ness okay so the first year after six day occupation yeah yeah here we have all kinds of of way to smuggle hangers what hangers also with explosives how has Israel sold itself really for decades now as a global leader in defense and homeland security equipment you cannot defend yourself only by a human uh sources you have to use also a technology in order to be on the uh pinning side Israel had to be very very very creative to find solutions that um you cannot buy in the market or the um around the world one of the innovators is unit 8200 it's been around for many years talk a little bit about based on your experience what that unit is we have developed a unique technology how to where to tape whom be be raped and the ability to reach to top secrets that usually are hidden we say that if a ruler wants to H do something it's is in his mind but he cannot do it alone he has to share it with at least one two three or four people who are close to him and we have developed Technologies that can reach the right persons that we will tap and know so 88,200 became a one of the secrets of Israeli intelligence I'm not asking you to reveal top secret intelligence but give a sense what are the kind of methods that Israel was using to try to get that intelligence if you want to follow a certain terrorist or a certain cell you have to be equipped with surveillance technology that gives you the advantage to watch him without him sensing you you have to develop ammunition which you can use in a remote control for a long distance so sometimes the you headquarters is in Tel Aviv and the terrorist cell is in Gaza Strip and you want to uh kill somebody you have to be very very accurate you have to be with a the best technology that you will not be accused by killing innocent people we are getting hits send the lanus Israel is a leader in remote control bombing with small drones like the controversial lanus systems presents lanus SE an attack in one new Innovative autonomous lethal solution they're part of the class of small highly maneuverable quadcopters getting extensive use for the first time in Gaza the high budget promo suggests it may have been battle tested in Palestine and the Drone is exactly what Perry is describing andity in a complex Urban environment a remote controlled explosive that can be put next to the Target Israel is now about the ninth or 10th biggest arms seller in the world it depends every year how does Israel become for a relatively small country one of the biggest arms sellers in the world yeah it's true that Israel is one of the biggest AR arms sellers we have been also selling a um all the technology that can help you to deal with terrorists I mean the whole world is dealing with terrorist activity so the market is big I would say that 80% of the technology that we have developed in Israel is not top secret it's something that you can share with other ER organizations mainly H security agencies and armies H for instance the most most common technology that we have developed here is the Iron Dome and now we can sell iron do to the whole world with a wave of its innovative wand Raphael has developed a first of its kind counter rocket artillery mortar cram system with pinpoint accuracy interceptors against asymmetric threats Iron Dome the Iron Dome is often used to refer to all of these Israel's anti-missile interception systems together they make Israel a world leader in anti-missile protection and are a showcase for Israel's weapons companies who are Keen to promote how Cutting Edge and Innovative they are aro3 the ARA system counters high altitude ballistic missiles and is made by Israel Aerospace Industries II also makes the cafir jet Heron drones and its own Jericho ballistic missiles they claim to offer comprehensive Solutions in all domains since Russia's invasion of Ukraine II are marketing their interception systems to European countries on us in 400 m exit right to find out more about Israel's military industrial complex I'm going to meet security and intelligence expert Yosi Melman Israel from the outset decid decided we have to build our own uh strong military industrial complex that realization has been always in the mind of Israel we have to be uh on top of our enemies from the scientific technological point of view Israel's been developing a range of new technologies and weapons certain kind of Robotics certain kinds of drones quadcopters explain a bit about what you understand is being used there has been a major shift in the focus of the Israeli Industries if 30 40 years ago Israel industries were still selling rifles pistols ammunition nowadays they have moved to more advanced technological equipment the logic is very positive to try to minimize Israel's own casualties it's safer to first move into the tunnels with a robot rather than sending your foood soldiers a formation of autonomous aerial and ground systems can provide unprecedented ISR capabilities to units on the Tactical Edge from 3D Legion X is the integrated combat system for controlling autonomous robotic vehicles and drones all made by Elbert Israel's largest private weapons producer Andy Legion is maximizing now worth nearly 10 billion Elbert promotes itself as leading the world in Automation and Robotics and this technical Mastery is key to how Israel has governed Gaza Israel directly occupied Gaza from 1967 to 2005 when the Israeli Army and settlers withdrew but Israel retained de facto control over the fundamentals of the territory Power Water who could enter and leave how far fishermen could go from the shore and even how many calories people have to eat eat every day the depth of this control was constantly updated with technology in 2021 defense minister Benny gance launched a smart fence stuffed with the latest tech including tunnel detection equipment in 2021 Israel unveiled a huge amount of new technology around Gaza theyd spent billions of dollars they claimed that it was going to keep Israel safe was going to keep Palestinians essentially in Gaza what exactly was being put in place around that time well all sorts of equipment Israel surrounded Gaza with all these Technologies facial recognition hacking telephones visual intelligence from drones reconnaissance flights reconnaissance balloons Israel had the phone numbers of many Hamas members and not only Kamas members also innocent people that information came from bugging and listening and Observatory equipment so so Gaza was surrounded by the equipment and Israel believed that they can control the population and they control above all Hamas the domestic security service shinb and the military intelligence mistake they almost adored worshiped technology but on October the 7th 2023 as part of a highly coordinated offensive hummus drones attacked the watchtowers disabling the CCTV and automated guns with few soldiers on the border the Army claims they were effectively blun to what unfolded Hamas Fighters quickly overran multiple bases which were sparsely manned and not prepared it is said that thousands of hamus Fighters and other Palestinians broke out of Gaza by land sea and air it was the most deadly single day in Israel's history Israel claims that 1,200 people were killed nearly 800 of them civilians and most of them Israeli and that another 250 were taken back to Gaza as hostages according to Hamas and international organizations these numbers have been inflated hamas's attack begs the question of how this multi-billion dollar smart fence armed with radar CCTV and surveillance drones could miss an assault that took years to plan and rehearse so I'm on my way to see Israel Z who's a former Israeli General and he used to actually had the Gaza command for the Israeli Army and o on October 7 he grabbed a gun from his home near Tel Aviv and went down to near the Gaza border to try to as he says kill Hamas terrorists and rescue hostages so let's go see him explain what happened to you on October 7th I've learned that I'm still good even with the pistol I had a chance to to to rescue quite a few people you know some of them were hiding in the area that theas control what do you think as far as we know went horribly wrong everything it's the system collaps I think Israel took one step too far rely in too much on technology which in area like Gaza was very convenient to put all those visual toys you know and and it gave the feeling that we are protected but maybe it wasn't the technology that failed we know that IDF soldiers monitoring Gaza reported increased Hamas activity in the months leading up to October the 7th we saw the Maneuvers we saw the preparations we have listened to the plans we have photoed the terrorist coming I know but for sure that in the Israeli Secret Service and the Israeli intelligence Army intelligence service they uh information was there before October 7 before October yes but nobody thought that it's really going to happen everybody thought you know the Kamas would not there maybe they do a terror act but not such an operation the biggest failure starts from the higher level of command which actually refuses to to to believe or or to see it coming despite the supposed failure of the technology to stop the October the 7th attack 2024 is predicted to be the best year yet for Israel's arms industry and while the Israeli Army may have been slow to react on October the 7 they quickly announced their intention to unleash hell on [Music] Gaza what Israel calls the swords of iron War has resulted in unprecedented levels of death and destruction [Music] I've come to one of the few places in Israel where you can see that with your own eyes I'm in the Israeli town of sto and behind me is Gaza we're pretty much as close as we can get all these religious Jewish people who were behind me gathered as the sun is going down many of them actually want to settle Gaza occupy Gaza build settlements in Gaza and and they're treating it almost like a family get together they're are kids they're having fun they're smiling taking photos it's pretty surreal seeing Gaza here and knowing what's happened since October 7 the mass destruction the mass killing it's yeah pretty overwhelming the war has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians and seen more than 80% of gaza's buildings rendered unusable it might look like random destruction but Israel would claim these are all valid targets and they're all generated by the latest Innovation from unit 88,200 a new system powered by artificial intelligence I've come to Tel Aviv to meet the investigative team who first r red her AI is being used in Gaza some in the military felt that the systems that existed were not giving them in previous Wars enough targets talk a little bit about what that meant practically in previous war what is called in Israel the target Bank was very swiftly was was empty previously they would produce 200 300 targets a year now they can produce sitting an hour the AI targeting systems are only possible because as we've seen Israel collects data on every aspect of Palestinian life the system called The Gospel also takes in historical and Geographic data to generate infrastructure locations that the AI thinks are probably linked to hamus these include tactical targets like military bases and tunnels but there's another category called Power targets that include residential Towers and Civic buildings like schools and medical centers an alifer hospital they are being hit in order to create a psychological effect on the gazin pushing them to go against Hamas of course this didn't happen the Israeli Army says Al shifer housed the Hamas command and control center the bombing of it resulted in over a thousand people being killed injured or disappeared 25,000 people in the surrounding area were also displaced Israel never provided evidence that it had found the command and control center to identify individual Hamas members unit 88,200 created lavender this analyzes the key Behavior traits of active Hamas oper where they go who they talk to who was in their phone contacts and then looks for anyone in Gaza with similar characteristics what are they talking about what kind of words they're using uh all these kind of things you create a list of possible members of Hamas from the very low level or even people that are not really part of the military ring this is basically basically a death list once you are there you are Lely to meet tet the alel neighborhood known as the backbone of Gaza was hid in December 2023 the Israeli Army said it was because there were Hamas operatives concealing themselves there the entire area was devastated what the AI generates is not facts but targets with a statistically probable link to Hamas despite this the systems have led to another change a rise in the acceptable level of Civilian deaths prior to this war a very senior uh Hamas uh Commander there was a collateral damage of let's say five maximum 10 person in this war it was decided that for very Junior Hamas militant the collateral damage decided was between 15 and 20 his family and his neighbors could be killed in order to kill him and if it's a senior Hamas militant then the numbers over 100 sometimes 300 and we know it happened I wanted to know what someone close to the Israeli military thought about this use of AI it's really kind of a big step you know forward in terms of intelligence and also decision making because it's doing the right selection and and put in front of the decision maker much better and clearer picture in order to take decision we did of course ask former General ziv about claims Israel and its AI systems were perpetrating a genocide in Gaza his response the standard line that the Israeli Army is the most moral in the world so AI became a big factor in in in this whole component of Intel decision making command and control uh of the modern fight storing surveillance on an entire population generates a vast amount of data enter Google on Amazon who have been building cloud services and data farms in Israel since 2021 under a deal called project Nimbus After the War Began the Army's Computing division said they were collecting so much data that to move some of it onto the civilian Cloud A200 is using a cloud service by Amazon to storage huge amount of information about people in Gaza and that the This Cloud was used at least to help some of the attacks I've been looking at how Israel's Army and Tech sector benefit from conflict in Palestine but could it also be true of other countries and multinationals to find out more I met with Paul bigar the founder of a billion dooll tech company Google's motto used to be don't be evil and it seems like a lot of these big tech companies Amazon Google and others have no issue with working with Israel in fact they're often expanding their contracts do they not care about the reputational damage fundamentally they're about making money getting that cloud Revenue um you may have started as a $600 million contract but it is uh expanding massively over the years so we are talking uh at the stage where uh where they may be getting billions and possibly tens of billions of dollars from Israel via project Nimbus they're also setting themselves up as the de facto people to talk to when your government needs to uh needs to scale so there's a lot more governments that are a lot larger than uh than Israel and Google wants to be first in line for those contracts and more importantly they've realized there aren't any reputational consequences for what it does so it's not just Israel that uses the Palestinians to test their products on it's actually the whole world and there's no greater arena for testing weapons than a live War the iron sting is a guided mortar marketed as a Precision weapon the iron sting is so precise that it can even hit a specific room without causing damage to other rooms in the same building this is its first use in [Music] battle and looks like it might have damaged more than one room at least two Israeli companies have made drones stable enough to handle gunfire this is elbert's bird of prey seen here accompanying an armored bulldozzer into battle eyewitnesses in Gaza say these drones with guns are proving terrifying and deadly arms experts have told us the last moment of the life of Hamas leader Yaya sinoa were likely filmed on one of these drones his final Act to throw a stick at it talk about some of those things in Gaza that Israel has been doing militarily since October 7 and why you think that might be appealing to other nations everybody knows that that you know Israel is very advanced in in their technology but definitely after such a such a war in Gaza when when people see the demonstration in real life and it's working uh it creates uh you know the needs and the understanding how crucial those things are and and how critical for others to to hold it and to have it now Israel has physical access to Gaza they're rolling out many of the surveillance techniques used in the West Bank unit 88,200 is giving soldiers and drones AI enabled surveillance technology to search for anyone linked to Hamas or other rebel groups the system relies on technology from corite an Israeli video Analysis company and the Israeli Army is also using Google photos which can identify people from just a fraction of their face we are basically speaking about about a system where the government where the private sector producing and exporting the facial recognition technique they test those Technologies in Palestine in the occupied Palestinian territory so occupying people is profitable because it's not only you take the resources of the land now we are speaking about digital occupation where also your data is a new resource to develop a new technologies and to start selling that worldwide to profit from oppressing other people but perhaps the most advanced and gamechanging weapon being used in the Gaza war is the targeting of human beings by artificial intelligence so do you think that tools like lavender the gospel there's a decent chance of Israel could potentially be selling those tools to other militaries I think it's a very fair possibility that Israel will will sell it and this is I think one of the reasons they allowed our story to be published just explain a bit what you mean by that H you have to file any report that relates to the military the military censorship and they can allow disallow I suspect there were people in Israel who wanted the world to know that they have very very sophisticated AI surveillance methods that can collect and kill being here again I've seen how physical barriers and high technology divide this land in a way many human rights organizations call apartheid I've seen how this has allowed Israel to create World leading surveillance and arms Industries who export their products globally in the next episode I'm heading off to some of Israel's top customers I'll be asking if Israel is just selling its technology or if they're also exporting something else the ideology behind the occupation of Palestine

          <attvalue for="7" value="hold on tight guys cuz today we're talking about  one of the boldest and most talked about Mossad   operations ever to take place the incredible the  elaborate the complex assassination of Isma deep   in the heart of Tehran and the reason we're here  talking about this today is because this operation   showcases the ability of the Israeli Mossad to  penetrate deep into the heart of Tehran under   the nose of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps  to carry out an execution against Ismael Hine one   of the heads of Hamas inside a compound that  is supposed to protect the very guests of the   Iranian Revolutionary Guard this is the kind  of operation that up till now it's been over   a year since this took place that till this very  moment still puts fear in the hearts of people   still the enemies of Israel wake up sweaty at  night thinking that this too might happen to   them so today we break down this incredible  story this is a new version of a story we   call it boots on the ground explainers trying  to break down the incredible stories behind   the news of what happens here in this part of  the world now before we go any further pause   for a second and make sure you like share and  subscribe so you never miss another one of these videos okay so here's what happened in this  operation this is a really interesting story   make sure uh to watch this through the end because  it's unbelievable how this was carried out so   first of all let's start with who was Ismael  Hane well Ismael is one of the symbolic heads   of the Hamas terrorist organization and was so  for many many years but for the majority of that   time he wasn't on the top of the target list  for the Israeli forces or Israeli intelligence   organizations because he resided mostly outside  of Israel outside of Judea and Samaria and outside   of the Gaza Strip and wasn't considered to be  a immediate threat to the state of Israel or   the people of Israel much higher on the list were  names like Muhammad def an arch terrorist you know   that resided in different places but then in in uh  in the Gaza Strip uh let's call it the head of the   military arm the man who carried out executed  and planned the October 7th attacks uh and ha   is something different he is this very symbolic  character he's the head of sort of the diplomatic   office of the kamas and he resides mostly in  Qatar or Dha the capital of Katala a small uh   a small country or oil kingdom uh in the Arabian  Sea and this is where the story gets interesting   this all changes on the day of October 7th 2023  when Israel is attacked by kamas who invade our   land break through our borders uh murder mutilate  assassinate uh and kidnap the citizens of this   country everything changes on uh for the state of  Israel and a decision is made that also this man   uh hane also needs to be removed from the table  he's one of the people behind the scenes working   on this he's one of the people uh funneling  the money in and that means he no longer gets   uh to reside with the rest of humanity because of  what he did so here's what happened on July 31st   2024 so about a year plus uh ago uh the end of  the story is is Ha who's sleeping inside a guarded   compound in the heart of Tehran the capital of  Iran mysteriously blows up by an explosive charge   and let me contextualize what is happening here  he's in Iran for ceremonies related to someone   else who was assassinated uh Kasamsulimmani  anyway long story uh he's in uh in Iran as a   dignitary who's visiting and he's sleeping within  a compound controlled by the Iranian Revolutionary   Guard Corps an important party to remember here  and what they do they're sort of the executive   arm let's call it of the the Islamic government  or the radical Islamic government that rules   the country of Iran and is their official  guest traveling on business as they say   uh to Iran he's sleeping within a very guarded  very secure compound this is a place he's visited   before multiple times and as he sleeps there a  charge goes off killing him and injuring others   in the area and the big story here is how did the  Mossad get to Isma initially it's expected to be   and the Iranian government if I remember correctly  even says that it was an accident that had to do   with a gas leak or some madeup story along those  lines but very quickly uh the facts come out the   the facts surface and it's clear that likely the  Israeli Mossad and possibly others were behind   this assassination and think about this picture  one of our biggest enemies the Iranians in the   heart of their capital Thran in the most guarded  compound that they control that their elite   forces the RGC controls one of their top guest is  eliminated by Israeli intelligence and what that   tells you is the level of penetration that took  place into the int intelligence apparatus of the   RGC the level of intelligence that we were able  to extract in that time and the level of lethality   uh that our intelligence organization is  able to carry out this isn't something of   uh um let's call it a a nuclear scientist who's  um blown up on the way to one of their nuclear   facilities this isn't a guy who lives in Iran this  is a visitor that in exact timing as he's entering   into a guarded compound is assassinated by again  the Israeli intelligence organization so h how   does this happen so the facts are mind-blowing it  turns out that months before this visit Israeli   intelligence and again I don't know if this is  Israelis on the ground in Iran or Iranians that   were hired or convinced or someone else uh a bomb  was planted in the very bedroom that Ismael Hane   was going to sleep in and this bomb is planted in  a way that even though they look for bugs and they   sweep these rooms and there's security everywhere  all the time uh in many many different ways a bomb   is planted in a way that is it goes undiscovered  for multiple months and again let's get to how   this thing works when he enters the room we get  intelligent that he is indeed within the room in   the bed he's supposed to be in and then a charge  is remotely detonated so there's communication   going in and out of this compound uh that wasn't  caught there's a bomb that was planted multiple   months before that wasn't spotted even though they  swept this room and searched for it multiple times   they didn't have exact information but they have  security protocols in place for these kind of   things and even though all these things were done  the Israeli intelligence was able to eliminate   him in his sleep in the heart of this compound  so there's another point here that I forgot to   make which is that part of the reason that Israel  decides to go after Ismia in a more aggressive   manner is because it becomes very apparent when  the October 7th war breaks out that he isn't just   this figurine that stands in the head of the  organization the man is is deeply uh involved   in the planning the execution and the funding of  the egregious acts of terrorism against Israel in   October 7th and because of that it's clear what  needs to be done with him he needs to be removed   from every position of influence and also removed  uh from a citizen of this earth and that's exactly   what happens to him i think this is a just and  understandable action and it was also done as a   show of power by Israeli intelligence to send a  clear message that any terrorist and especially   the leaders of terrorist organizations that comes  against Israel his fate his uh his uh justice will   meet him sooner rather than later we need to ask  another question which is why this assassination   takes place inside Iran and not in another  country so Isma travels mostly in three different   locations he resides in Dhaqatar so within a  country Qatar is a tricky relationship uh because   Qatar is both a what we call it a friendmy of the  state of Israel uh they're the people behind El   Jazzer they're the people that funded Kamas but  they're not purely enemies of the state of Israel   they've even been involved on multiple levels in  much of the negotiations that have taken place   between Israel and between Hamas and other uh  entities Palestinian entities uh over past year so   they're not distinctly an enemy and it would have  jeopardized the relationship with them to try and   assassinate him in Katal proper another option is  Turkey he frequented Turkey turkey by the way for   many years was a uh sort of safe haven for kamas  high level delegates but again Turkey is a very   big a very powerful another friendmy of the state  of Israel and even though they've been on the path   of escalation the path of uh ever escalating  violence against the state or the people of   Israel it's not official war we still do negotiate  with them we still do cooperate with them and I'd   say in a larger scheme of things are also to a  certain degree allies of many European countries   and the Americans and they're not the kind of  country you want to carry out assassinations or   targeted attacks uh on its own soil it would  be an absolutely huge uh diplomatic incident   or and that leaves us with Iran iran as funny as  it may seem uh assassinating someone on the soil   of Iran isn't high stakes for Israel they're our  sworn enemies uh this comes from them by the way   not from us we have nothing personal against them  but their entire uh agenda their entire philosophy   is all about destroying Israel and destroying the  US uh so we would have no problem carrying out an   attack on their soil and we've done so many times  before and thus the uh location is chosen to carry   out an assassination within Iran so one might ask  ourselves how did Israel know that Hanya was going   to be in the exact room in the exact compound on  that date and time and this is where I think he   sort of handed us a unfair advantage uh it turns  out he was a creature of habit and I guess the   Iranians were too in in the way they uh hosted him  where he would repeatedly visit the same compound   and possibly stay in the exact same room and I  say this because it is possible and I don't know   this as a fact that there was more than one bomb  but what we do know is that he repeatedly came   back to the same place uh at least seven or eight  prior times to this visit which allowed us to plan   uh plant the bomb plan the attack plant the  bomb uh and then carry it out knowing that he   just was a creature of habit and kept going back  to the same uh place uh I think most people that   try you know that know that there's a target on  their back they try not to create a pattern that   is predictable and in this case it really played  into the hands of the Israeli Mossad the fact that   Haniah did exactly that carried out a pattern  that was repetitive and predictable so right   before we go into the events of the the night  of the attack uh on Isaiah that that ended the   life of Ismaia Israel's sworn enemy I want you  to pause this video for just a second uh after   I say this next bit uh and consider supporting  this channel i don't say this lightly uh we keep   running because of the support of viewers like  you and this channel has seen growth and it's seen   uh incredible you know response over the past 18  months but for multiple years now we deeply value   every type of support that we received and I want  to ask you to take just one second and consider   supporting this channel TBN Israel to keep helping  us create content and tell the truth from Israel   that is something that now now more than ever is  needed around the world and we need you at home   to help us keep that happening there's a link at  the bottom of the screen uh in the description   of every single video that we create it doesn't  take much just a small donation and especially an   ongoing small donation makes a huge difference the  operation was planned down to the last detail an   explosive device larger than originally planned  due to technical constraints was planted in   Hania's room in advance in fact multiple months  in advance as we know now that means Mossad's   shadow operatives bypassed security undetected  and gained unrestricted access without arousing   any suspicion for multiple months the MSAD created  an entry into the room into the facility and into   the room itself to plant the charge and then were  able to conceal its location for multiple months   but at the last moment everything almost blew up  pun intended due to a simple technical malfunction   the air conditioner in Ha's room broke down and  he had to leave imagine that just seconds before   the detonation the operation was hanging by just  a thread there was a concern his room would be   replaced but in the end the AC was repaired  and he returned to his original room until   he ascended to heaven or wherever he went around  1:30 a.m so in the middle of the night a massive   explosion shook the quiet compound understand  this in a hospitality facility there's a first   aid team they hear the blast and rush inside  only to find a scene I don't think any of them   imagined they would find after about a minute the  medical team pronounces him dead so clearly there   wasn't much consideration over situation  the precision assassination in the heart   of Tehran s unprecedented panic in the Iranian  leadership and understandably so the Kud's force   commander Kani disappears for three entire weeks  essentially going underground for fear of his own   assassination no one saw him if Khani is scared  it's as if the whole regime is expressing fear   from the situation the question still troubling  the Iranian leadership today is as it was many   months ago when this took place who helped the  Mossad in this complex operation and if you   want to know too click the subscribe button cuz  we're about to tell you so the big question that   the Iranian uh Revolutionary Guard the Iranian  government has in their head after this takes   place is how did they do it and you would say well  here's the technical details and stuff like that   but that's not really the question how does the  MSA Mossad gain access to get the intelligence   needed how do they get into the room how do they  get out of the room and how do they maintain   communication and knowledge of what's happening  in there and this all summarizes or boils down to   one word that's called a mole clearly there was a  mole or multiple moles within Iranian intelligence   organizations which is what allowed Israel to gain  that level of access and that level of information   and since this has happened you know it's very  hard to to underestimate how much panic and how   much fear this put in the heart of the Iranian  government they go on this witch hunt looking   for moles etc but just imagine in your head the  level of distrust and level of fear that it gives   people to see such a thing happen and I think  that's a logical thing i mean after the attack   of October 7th that Iran is absolutely behind to  a certain degree hamas executed but it was part of   their greater plan and after decades of fighting  against Israel it makes sense that this is the   kind of response they would get and I think on a  psychological level this seems like an incredibly   successful operation seems that an operation of  this magnitude couldn't have been carried out   without significant help from the inside from  inside Iran and the Iranian government this   kind of thing requires a network of operational  capabilities and apparently something involved   many people betraying their country by the way  knowingly or unknowingly cuz if you've tracked   the MO of the Mossad over the years they've been  very very clever about doing these kind of things   without people knowing they're helping Israel  and when you think about Supreme Leader Kamayi   uh hearing that this happened under his watch  within his country I mean forget the fear you   know they they did the usual thing of saying  &quot;Let's attack Israel let's retaliate Israel.&quot; Uh   but there's a huge embarrassment here where Israel  is able to penetrate deep into the organization uh   and they realize that whatever missiles whatever  forces they have were still able to work within   their cities themselves and this kind of operation  is exactly what tells us the incredible story of   the Israeli Mossad how time and time again and the  stories are countless we're going to go into many   of them in the future time and time again the  Mossad is able to reach the enemies of Israel   at the farthest corners of the earth and do so  quietly and without leaving tracks behind in fact   unless our minister of defense at the end of last  year would have publicly admitted that we were   behind this it wouldn't have been known till this  time that Israel was officially behind this attack   i think we're at the end of this video if you've  lasted so long thank you and thank you for being   with us take one more moment to like share and  subscribe to this channel and if you are a praying   person put in a

          <attvalue for="7" value="one sure sign that the narrative the tide is turning on Israel's war on Gaza when a former Israeli prime minister describes the war as genocidal enough is enough medics getting the story out the doctors and nurses filling in the vacuum in the news coverage and taking a look under the hood of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the agenda never has been to provide humanitarian aid to the Palestinians an organization that does not do what its name implies more than 600 days into its horrific war on Palestinians in Gaza even Israel's most loyal allies from foreign governments to news organizations have been forced to confront reality from Berlin to London Paris to Ottawa support for Israel is turning into disapproval verging on condemnation over the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in the strip starving Palestinians have been lining up for food aid supplied by an organization that is the brainchild of the American and Israeli governments and looks more like a PR exercise than a humanitarian response the external political pressure along with rising dissent within Israel over the Netanyahu government's waging of this war is having an effect on the media narrative there and fracturing a consensus that goes all the way back to October 7th 2023 try as the Israelis might it will take more than a trickle of humanitarian aid to silence their critics more than propaganda to hide the war crimes it is committing when they talk about Israel and its genocidal ways in Gaza European politicians choose their words carefully particularly German ones like the chancellor Friedrich who went on the state funded broadcaster where he said finally and more than once that Israel has gone too far we have been hearing more and more international criticism germany's is probably the most significant one because of the historical baggage that guilt of the Holocaust that brought Germany to just accept and support whatever crime Israel has been committing so the fact that even Germany can no longer whitewash Israel's crime is extremely significant at the same time the foreign minister said &quot;But you know what we will not ban the weapons to Israel we reject an arms embargo so the European government is saying &quot;We condemn a killing spree but we will give the killer a sharper knife.&quot; Telling Israel &quot;What you're doing is morally wrong and might lead to negative consequences but we're not going to implement those consequences yet.&quot; With the European governments you can see stronger statements at the moment but statements basically bounce off Israel's iron dome of impunity from mers of all people it is truly too little too late and I await to see whether Palestinian solidarity activists students who have been calling out this genocide and facing brutal policing in some cases deportation i look forward to Meltz welcoming all those people back to Germany and telling them that they were right all along chancellor Meritz added Germany's name to a growing list of Western countries including France the UK and Canada that have criticized Israel over this war threatened it with sanctions but have not yet acted that effectively buys the Israelis time which they are using to keep punishing Palestinians cloaking their war crimes under the cover of organizations like the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the GHF after consistently blocking aid from getting into Gaza and attacking the agencies trying to help Palestinians including the UN's the Israelis teamed up with American military contractors mercenaries to create the GHF whose first foray into Gaza proved disastrous crowds of hungry Palestinians were herded like animals into an aid depot in Rafa humiliating scenes worthy of a concentration camp the crowd surged overwhelming those contractors shots were fired at least three Palestinians were killed the government media office in Gaza called it a deliberate massacre a full-fledged war crime committed against civilians suffering siege induced starvation people in Gaza are literally starving especially children because their bodies are not able to to withstand that that level of malnutrition even some of Israel's staunchest allies are now coming out to criticize Israel for its starvation campaign because this war has gone on for far too long we cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve it's not because they're having these big epiphies that that mass slaughter of Palestinians is wrong there's a great liberal centrist tradition of standing on the right side of history only when the relevant moment to do so has significantly passed we are seeing that grand liberal tradition be repeated now by Kama Emanuel Macron Mark Carney and other leaders who are only willing to condemn but indeed not stop Israel's activities at this point i think future proofing of reputation to say &quot;Oh but we did indeed speak up might very much be in play here.&quot; But those of us who have been paying any attention at all for the last year and a half plus are all too aware that these very governments have been funding and ideologically enabling uh Israel's actions throughout its war on Gaza Israeli officials from Benjamin Netanyahu on down have routinely dismissed allegations of war crimes as inherently anti-semitic the anti-semitic decision of the international court in the H is a modern driver that argument is more difficult to make now since more and more of those accusations are coming from Israelis including a former prime minister what is it if not a war crime ehood Ol first made that argument in a liberal Israeli paper Harets before repeating it on CNN golan a former army chief of staff turned opposition leader is another who has strayed from the path there have also been shifts in coverage in the Israeli media although limited and more common in the print sector than the broadcast side they are notable in that they reflect what is occurring politically almer is one of the earliest founders of Netanyahu's party Lioot so he's known left-wing pro Palestinian peace he's the guy that carried out one of Israel's most atrocious wars on Gaza Operation Gas so to see him now condemning what Israel is doing in Gaza as a war of annihilation as genocide it is extraordinary it speaks basically of how far Israel has gone this moment is ripe for the likes of Yer Golan and and other opposition figures in Israel because Netanyahu is facing increased pressure and leaders around the world will be happy to scapegoat Netanyahu as the perpetrator of this genocide in Gaza rather than face the reality that this was a genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian people by the state itself and so this moment presents an opportunity to put all the blame on Netanyahu both internally and internationally israel is now panicking realizing that their strategy of repeated atrocities to exhaust the global attention did not work that's why you had saying our propaganda is collapsing our legitimacy is over and you had Israel Hom saying the world is talking less about us and more about Gaza and their solution is not to end the genocide but to propagandize more to whitewash the genocide even more to double down on the failing strategy that didn't work without a doubt there are media outlets and journalists who are reassessing their position regarding this war and Wet is a good example they're showing more pictures of what's going on in Gaza speaking through the angle of starvation referring to it more and more overall however Israeli media coverage that allows for empathy for Palestinians remains the exception not the rule [Music] [Applause] 600 days into this war there have never been more lives at risk in Gaza where day after day GHF aid depots have produced nightmarish scenes of desperation and violence politicians overseas out to salvage their legacies could be enough to save some of those lives but as Israeli journalists well know there will be no saving of reputations on the Israeli airwaves the moral standing of news channels that too many citizens there still use as their primary source of information if you're only consuming Israeli media in Hebrew you will know less about what the Israeli army is doing in Gaza than probably any given citizen in the rest of the world the Israeli media has been a collaborator with this genocidal mindset and actually promoting it and by concealing the Holocaust of Gaza from the eyes of the Israeli public when the day comes that the criminals responsible for this genocide will stand on trial i think next to them on the bench the Israeli media should be located there's a reason that um experts in genocide studies and humanitarians are using terms like final solution for this stage of the genocide in Gaza we're seeing images of children burnt trapped in schools the reports we're hearing from the imperiled hospitals has prompted certain world leaders to speak up but that shouldn't lead any viewers to think that this is because there's been some sort of uh dramatic aberration by the Israeli military this is a continuation and an escalation in Gaza after so many many months of this kind of genocidal warfare throughout Israel's war on Gaza health care workers have become key voices in the reporting of this story and over the past couple of weeks the dispatches coming out of hospitals there have grown more and more desperate minakshi Ravi has been tracking this story gaza's health care system and the Palestinians who work in it have been systematically targeted by Israel for nearly 20 months now at least 94% of all hospitals in the strip have been damaged or destroyed more than 1,400 healthcare workers have been killed with thousands of doctors and nurses arrested the few who have made it out of prison say their Israeli captives reserved specific brutal torture for medics international doctors who have traveled in with aid groups now say their mission goes beyond medicine the main thing is to come here to bear witness because you're not seeing what I'm seeing because there's been a complete block to all media i am getting very sick and tired of having as as are all my colleagues of having to go onto the the news programs because journalists aren't allowed in etc to to point out what is happening here physicians returning from Gaza have also been outspoken on how dire the situation there has become the starvation the particular nature of the burns and injuries they are seeing and the targeting of Palestinian medics people need to understand that civilians their families uh healthare workers are are being intentionally and deliberately killed and I just want to say that the IDF have said in their statement regarding this uh attack in Kunis they've said that the IDF evacuated civilians from this area you don't ask the perpetrator of of of genocide we have to Dr hassan we have to ask the Israeli government if you also in addition to that response mentioned that Amn A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A amnesty international doctors without borders human rights watch the international court of justice would all beg to differ this past week American trauma surgeon Dr firo Sidwa delivered testimony to the United Nations Security Council i'm not here as a policy maker or a politician i am a physician bearing witness to the deliberate destruction of a health care system the targeting of my own colleagues and the eraser of a people these doctors are not isolated voices they have formed a network of sorts a valuable one to fill the void in reporting on this story caused by Israel's refusal to let journalists into Gaza and its killing of so many Palestinian reporters more than 200 of them thanks Mina in our lead story we touched on the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the GHF formed just months ago it is an American Israeli coalition that includes ex CIA and military personnel it is a shadowy group that started distributing aid in the southern end of the strip this past week there is not a single international aid organization that has endorsed or cooperated with the GHF instead from the UN to Oxfam to Medsan Frontier warnings have been issued that the GHF is militarized privatized and politicized an exercise in quote aidwashing when a pretense of aid is designed to cover up something else entirely one of the news outlets tracking the GHF closely with reporting from Palestinian journalists in Gaza is Drop Site News its co-founder Jeremy Scill joins us now jeremy let's start with the name of this organization now handling aid in the war zone the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the GHF out to do what its name implies not in any way shape or form i mean f first of all let's just get one basic fact straight the amount of so-called aid that it's distributing is is a pittance relative to what is needed in these starvation conditions in Gaza that are being enforced as an act of war by the USbacked Israeli regime it's incredibly cynical to use the term humanitarian in this name because Netanyahu himself has been very clear that this is a scam a scheme that is intended to kind of quiet some of the criticism that Netanyahu has received primarily from Republican senators who have said &quot;We don't like the appearance of starvation in Gaza so if you can create the facade that you're actually doing something then we're going to make sure that the weapons keep flowing and our support for your war of annihilation continues i mean Richard you couldn't get uh a a sort of uh starker symbol of what the agenda is here that you have a circumvention of an existing program that was effective that you have American mercenaries deployed on the ground that you have Israelis opening fire at desperate starving Palestinians and that it's all actually out in the open that the intent of this is to be uh just sort of a facade of humanitarianism to enable a genocide the GHF's aid distribution got off to a bad start this week the images that have come out of this the Palestinians in those caged pens lining up for food when you looked at those images what went through your mind well look I've been speaking to sources on the ground we have reporters inside of Gaza and my understanding is that there was almost no coordination whatsoever with uh local aid organizations to even inform people where they would be able to go to pick up these parcels or what would be inside of the parcels people just heard through text message WhatsApp word of mouth there's going to be aid dropped in this location and so because the population is starving and you have acute malnutrition among thousands of children people started to trek through incredibly dangerous terrain and they arrive at these sites and and it was very chaotic in some cases they were using biometric identification systems or interrogating people in others they forced or almost like cattle Palestinians into barbed wire fencing apparatus um on the first day that they started getting uh this aid distribution underway um we heard from sources inside of Gaza that a man had been kidnapped when he was interrogated by Israeli intelligence they got his family on the phone they were supposedly looking for some relative that the family hadn't been in touch with uh since the start of the war and when he didn't provide information that they were demanding from him they disappeared him that family has no idea where he is we've heard of at least a dozen or so more uh other people that were snatched when they went to go and get aid also the Israelis uh opened fire at one point they say that it was warning shots um but Palestinians were killed you know Israelis compare Palestinians to animals and this is part of what the plan is they want to essentially bait them into a cage shut the door behind them and then they either get killed in this killing cage or the ultimate plan which they call Trump's plan is to take that cage filled with Palestinians of Gaza and ship them to another country what we are witnessing here right now is is a a completely disgusting trap that Palestinians are being forced to as part of what Netanyahu has described as the final stage of his war to conquer Gaza now its backers say that the GHF is specifically designed to bypass the UN its relief agency ENROA why do the Israelis and the Americans involved in this say that that's even necessary the bypassing of established tried and tested systems of aid distribution richard it's because the the agenda never has been to provide humanitarian aid to the Palestinians um UNRA was established uh around the same time as the state of Israel was imposed on Palestine and and the reason that Israel has always stood against UNRA is because it is perhaps the most powerful symbol that uh that makes it clear that Palestinians have a right of return to their land have a right of return to their homes what we saw from the the the the moments after the October 7th operations happened inside of Israel was a very intense campaign to try to demonize the United Nations as a whole but UNRA specifically and the Israelis began planting stories that said that scores of UNRA employees had participated in the October 7th attacks and perhaps the the chief launderer of this narrative in the media was the Wall Street Journal and those stories were actually published with a by line uh of one of the reporters who herself was a uh a former IDF soldier and they they essentially portrayed UNRA as a Hamas front organization the United States and other countries responded to this propaganda and they admitted that they didn't even do their own independent review by moving swiftly to try to defund UNRA when the United States and major US media outlets began serving as conveyor belts for the lies of Israel about UNRA this was a devastating uh series of events and UNRA has been fighting for its life and so by creating an alternative pathway that circumvents international bodies that essentially seeks to to disintegrate UNRA what Israel is doing is saying &quot;We want to always be in control of the calorie intake of Palestinians we want to be able to shut off the water we want to be able to shut off the food we want to be able to block the medicine.&quot; The intent of this is to create the appearance of some alternative that would be viable to UNRA while at the same time ensuring full spectrum domination of Israel over the lives of Palestinians in Gaza you and Dropsite have done extensive reporting on the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation how difficult has it been to do that how transparent is this organization what kind of challenges are you facing in trying to tell this story you know as someone who's done a lot of reporting on mercenary organizations um and CIA front organizations it looked like what we would call a cutout that it's not actually intended to be what the public is being told but that it was set up for an alternative purpose sometimes intelligence agencies or governments set up fake companies uh to try to cover their employees as they do espionage other times they try to set up a company that has some legitimate front to it but the agenda is different i think we can safely say that the fact that there's very little information that's been released that we know the connections to both Israeli and American intelligence that this was intended to be a cutout uh that would serve the purpose of uh allowing Netanyahu to continue his war of annihilation while claiming that they're actually giving aid to people um in Gaza but Israel has been very effective with its propaganda in part because of its allies in the Western media particularly American and British news organizations that have promoted these lies or have not pushed back hard enough in demanding evidence so you know at some point uh all of these governments and officials are going to come out and pretend like they were always against the genocide we're seeing more and more media outlets coming out and taking that position we're seeing more and more academics and scholars taking that position you're seeing former Biden administration officials taking that position well history is full of people who want to be right uh through hindsight courage means speaking out in real time and so this should serve as a very serious lesson for journalists and governments when it comes to Israel you cannot ever believe the first draft of what they say you know Ronald Reagan used to say trust but verify in the case of Israel you have to assume it is lying and then check the facts jeremy Scill Drop Site News always great to have you on the show thanks again for speaking with us

          <attvalue for="7" value="public support for Israel in European countries has fallen to its lowest level on record that's according to a new Yuggov poll when asked about Israel's actions in Gaza more than half of all those surveyed said they were not justified with less than a quarter believing Israel was in the right and regarding who they sided with more than double those surveyed in the UK and Spain said they sympathized more with Palestinians than Israelis now last month the UK Canada and France released a joint statement condemning the starvation of Palestinians in Gaza under a three-month blockade on international aid they also vowed concrete action if Israel didn't reverse course the UK followed it by summoning the Israeli ambassador and suspending free trade talks in a week's time from now France will co-chair a UN conference with Saudi Arabia calling for recognition of a Palestinian state which could grant the Palestinians greater legitimacy at the UN and the ability to take Israel to international court on their own behalf france's President Manuel Macron has reportedly also been lobbying other countries to step up and recognize Palestine calling it a moral duty and a political necessity if we abandon Gaza if we consider there is a free path for Israel even if we do condemn the terrorist attacks we kill our own credibility in the rest of the world and this is why we do reject double standards and this is why I think it's very important in our current environment to be consistent and to follow our principles our rules and to consider that what is at stake is clearly the global order and what is at stake is our credibility to protect this global order now all of this has had little impact on the Netanyahu government which continues to expand its military occupation of Gaza displacing the majority of its population and depriving them of aid netanyahu himself struck back angrily at Macron saying that Israel will not stop and will not surrender but is rising diplomatic pressure on Israel changing how Israelis themselves see the ongoing genocide in Gaza to tell us more we're joined now by Israeli academic and philosopher Annette Matar annette thank you so much for being with us yes I think but not for the whole population i mean we we've seen recently it started a while after Israel resumed its war or whatever is genocide actually it's not a war um in in March uh 18th but it took some time until that sank uh and then liberal liberal in intellectuals um people who were protesting against Netanyahu throughout the last years realized that I think the West started to to to be annoyed and I think they somehow maneuvered their way out of the the the indifferent or whatever position that they held before it could have been indifferent it could have been supportive of the war and we're talking about different studies it's a very very long uh period that we're talking about so what was true for October November December 23 was no longer true for some of those people at the end of 24 say uh but uh but since March and especially since we've heard exactly what you said I mean the the this appro um by the allies I mean people they think themselves as part of I mean they these intellectuals they see themselves as part of the intellectual or liberal uh left and and or or the west and and now I think they're finding their alongside that so you you see much more protests against the war they still call it the war by the way um so much more protests even in my university and other universities somehow things things were shaken up and and we've been protesting since I think October and and only very recently other people joined which I find really it's it's good that it happened it's not good that it happened so late but it's good that it's happening i want to dig a little more into this because when you listen to the statements coming from Israeli officials whether the Netanyahu government or whether at the United Nations you get this recurring theme that the entire world is against Israel unfairly the United Nations itself is against Israel European leaders are targeting Israel unfairly that there is this double standard that Israel is being held to internationally do you think Israelis themselves when they hear this criticism coming from overseas are they following this line that their government is is holding or or do they believe this criticism to be legitimate again I think that the Israeli population is split almost half and half if you if you ignore the the my margin which is not part of any half but uh but let's forget about that so the Jewish majority I think is divided more or less u for in two halves and one half will go after Netanya whatever he says and and and they are still supporting of whatever remains of that war and and they even don't really care even if they say uh that they do about the hostages uh they're saying yeah we want them free but not at the expense of the holy war so so yeah that these people will buy whatever whatever slogan uh and for them Israel is the eternal victim and that's it and nothing will change there the other population is the one I mean in in in degradations but but uh but I think that the other population starts realizing that maybe in this case we're not the sole victim last month when Israel began allowing a trickle of aid into Gaza under the controversial Gaza found humanitarian foundation Netanyahu had to justify it to his own public saying that this is going to shield Israel from pressure that it was under from its allies and allow it to continue the war what kind of pressure do you think Israel is feeling in in real terms from its allies right now i I really don't think it's feeling any pressure i must say I don't buy this uh because there is no pressure when when you you look at the ground israel has a total impunity and we've seen that all along and we've seen that since October 23 of course but we also have seen this after March i mean when Israel Israel really explicitly breached the agreement it was signed on so I mean that it cannot be denied uh and still they they they are accusing anyone else who doesn't agree with them and no and I don't see any uproar not in England not in yes we've seen Macron and we we we've seen Starmer and we've seen Lami in England and you know and we've seen the in Canada and nowhere in other places but where are the real sanctions where is something that is go that goes beyond words so they're contemplating of you know putting aside an agreement and you know they're contemplating some symbolic steps but I don't see the the the real payment now many and it is my own conviction that until until a real payment will come nothing will happen now you mentioned sanctions there you have been one of those voices at the forefront of calling for sanctions against Israel why do you hold this position because I don't think anything else will change the the the situation here i really don't think anything else i'm not sure this will help by the way because of course there may be the the the knee-jerk reaction that you know oh they they sanction us we hate them even more and they're anti-semite and whatever so that it may be the case but any other option was already tried not reproaches articles in the papers uh you know expositions in the New York Times well new discoveries in the Guardian whatever i mean but nothing really changed you talked uh before about that sliver that you consider yourself a part of in Israeli society what does it mean for someone like you to say something like this publicly in Israel given describing the public mood that you are saying describing these two groups that are you know one they're both essentially against the war but on different levels what does it mean for somebody to call for sanctions against their own country given this climate yeah well it's not easy but I've been used to it for years so so just that the the last couple of years were particularly heavy but and they were heavy they are heavy um and still you know we have hostages in both sides and prisoners in both sides in terrible conditions in both sides and and I care about both sides um and I've been involved for years in committees for the Palestinian prisoners and I know what the situation in prison in the Israeli prison is so you know I worry uh it's not an easy period for me to to to live in Israel or anywhere because I I I don't think I would change anything if I was abroad uh but I have my circle of friends and and comrades and we we've been protesting together from you know very early on we've known each other for many years that that helps that helps m and I mean what do you take uh a hope in and where do you find strength to continue carving this very lonely path that that you're on well I don't see any hope at the moment i hope I hope I'm mistaken about hope but u but the strength well I've got it and um I think many because of my experience many because of the so many years that I've been active it you know it gives it gives you some energy to to keep going and as I said I mean there is this cluster of friends and and and comrades that you know we hold each other together now Today there was this explosive story that we saw about the Israeli government all but confirming that it has been arming gangs inside of Gaza affiliated some of its members with ISIS what do you make of the story i'm sure it's true i'm sure it's true because first of all be not not because of Fleerman or other people i don't I don't buy the the what what they're saying but it was covered in which is a reliable source and I I I know that when they say they have reliable source sources then they do but I also remember it from months ago i remember people I've I've been in touch with in Gaza directly uh telling me that you know that Israel disrupts the the ordinary um functioning of of the aid delivery and then that it supports the gangs and that was months ago i can't recall now but it was months ago and it came from you know many many people just you know I know or friends know so it was in the background already then but then now you have you have names you have faces you have pictures you have Tik Toks so and yeah I'm sure this is true and it's actually very typical when you think about Israel's behavior all along why not it's so obvious that this would be the the road it does betray a kind of cynical thinking when it comes to the way that uh the government chooses to pursue uh a military um it's the the way that it chooses allies in a place like Gaza um the way that it would arm one faction to go after another it is quite a far cry from the uh refrain that you hear from a lot of Israeli spokespeople about the IDF being the most moral army in the world and and and things of that nature uh I mean how do you think the Israeli public the ones that you say are are following Netanyahu blindly wherever he goes how do they justify for themselves some of these tactics that might be difficult to hear about well I don't know about them really because I cannot fathom what of Netanyahu really thinks because we know Netanyahu they may say that yes we're against Hamas and anything that can be bring down H kamas is in our side but this is what they said you know when they supported kamas years ago so you know this what I'm saying that this is not the first time it's not a surprise that Israel behaves like that so if they if they feel okay with all of Israel's history then they would feel okay now if they don't then okay they will be critical and I'm sure here we we will hear from that liberal part that I was mentioning in the beginning you know I'm sure that we will hear critical voices you know ex generals and all those people who just came to realize that the war is no longer u profitable was something they they will criticize I'm sure they will and finally and many Israeli voices that we have spoken to have said that the only pressure that only the pressure from the United States can have any influence on what Israel doesn't do and we saw the US's position quite clearly again yesterday at the UN when they vetoed a call for a ceasefire that all the other members on the security council supported without the US changing its position if that doesn't happen on the horizon what do you think the international community can do is there anything that they can do i I'm sure they can do a lot if they detach themselves from from mommy you know from from from the US i mean Europe is quite powerful i mean if they gather together and add this to to United Kingdom as well this is this is a strong power uh and actually when when uh when Trump announces announced his tariffs then you saw them you know uniting and and and and and you know talking against it and at least giving uh a sort of image of firm position and then he retracted a little bit so they can do this in relation to Gaza they simply don't" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="we're receiving reports that several people have been injured in southern Israel in the city of ashalon following rocket attacks video shows damage to parts of residential buildings Israeli emergency services are responding to the scene Imran Khan has more from Tel Aviv just after 3 p.m. local time loud sirens were head where I am in central Tel Aviv I counted at least eight explosions local media uh saying that 10 explosions in total took place in the South and uh east of uh Central Tel Aviv uh then there was a message from the Israelis via loudspeaker telling people to remain in their shelter also we've seen a rocket being fired from Gaza into ashalon where two people were lightly injured now where I am is actually nicknamed hostage swear it's worth showing you around uh this is effectively the headquarters of the bring them back campaign now their meeting uh with the Israeli War cabinet that's a meeting they've been asking for almost since the War Began 60 days ago um what they want from this meeting is to find out exactly what the Israeli War cabinet is doing to bring the remaining captives back home however the slogan of this campaign is not bring them back but bring them back now they want this to be done as quickly as possible and given the intense pressure uh that the Israeli War cabinet is under to fight this war from the more far right elements of the of uh the liid party which is the party of both the defense minister and the Prime Minister and the pressure that they're under from the Americans to allow humanitarian Aid in getting the captives out is although a priority not possibly a priority right this minute and that's what these uh captives families want they want these captives to be released as quickly as possible Imran Khan Al jazer Tel Aviv all right now mayor zon is a senior Israeli Analyst at the international crisis group joins us now live from Tel Aviv good to have you with us so first of all let me start with a line that's just been dropping about the Israeli government saying to families of the captives that they are unlikely to be able to release all of the captives how are families receiving this or likely to receive this kind of this kind of statement well I think the families of the hostages that are still there are absolutely up in arms about the what seems like a decision by the Israeli government uh when the truce fell apart uh to go into Gaza uh and continue its operation with full force and intensity without providing any information on how or when it will get back these hostages and as the families have said the hostages are the priority because they are the ones whose lives are at stake whereas the operation is something that can happen after they are securely brought back home so I think that there is uh extreme pressure and extreme anger amongst the families of the hostages and the Israeli public at large that the government doesn't really seem to be providing a clear plan not only on how to bring home the hostages but on how to secure a victory uh what we're seeing I mean the people who do see the images from Gaza are seeing death and destruction and we're not really seeing so much of the achievement of the military objective to bring down Hamas so I think Israelis are very upset and very confused how um does the resumption of Israeli strikes how does it impact netanyahu's position well netanyahu's position right now seems quite secure uh he has the full backing of the us to continue with this war he has a far-right government that some of them have been calling for uh reoccupying Gaza for settling Gaza now Israel claims that that's not uh its objective but uh despite the fact that most of the Israeli public is not happy with Netanyahu and doesn't trust him even before October 7th there doesn't seem to be any kind of way to get him out of office and so for now he's in office and people are still in trauma and in shock and and were at War and so the situation is that the longer that this uh operation continues it seems like he'll be able to continue to remain in his seat at the same time if Israel isn't able to provide um achievements in this operation I think Israelis will will lose uh more and more of their patience and there's also hundreds of thousands of reservists uh who are you know currently in the Army they're in the North or in the South uh the economy is being hurt so there is even an internal time limit I think to this and and there are more and more calls for Netanyahu to step down this is something that was going on a lot all of the last all of this last year um I think that will gain momentum but for the time being netanyahu's position is is quite strong and there is consensus in Israel that he that it's it's the right objective that it we need to topple Hamas so in that sense um he's in a pretty secure place we know that Israel withdrew its negotiating teams from qat do you think negotiations are going to have to resume at some point or how do you read the the mind set right now amongst Israeli decision makers do they just plan to go ahead and continue this bombing campaign endlessly well I think uh the reason for bringing back the uh negotiating team and whether or not some form of negotiation is still going on you know it's hard to tell it's hard to know exactly what's happening I assume that the actors Qatar Egypt the US and to an extent Israel as well is is and Hamas are they're interested in negotiating forther releases but uh Israel is very very adamant about uh a ground operation to um to get to Hamas uh senior officials I think they are very clearly interested in trying to take out senoir and they are determined to do that and they they don't think that anything less uh than toppling Hamas both militarily and as far as its governing capabilities will bring them security that's their line now I don't I don't necessarily think that that's an effective approach but that's the approach that they've chosen so it seems like they will continue to do this until uh the US uh steps up its pressure which does not currently seem likely to make them stop or the in general the humanitarian disaster which we're seeing unfold in Gaza starts to create more and more pressure um but so far that doesn't seem to be the case and if Israel is able to both allow and ramp up humanitarian Aid into the strip it seems like that will be enough uh for the US to stand down on that point we've heard from people like 35 un experts on October this 16th referred to a genocide in the making as to what Israel's military operation was doing how much awareness of the Carnage is there amongst Israeli public opinion how much focus is on that there really isn't that much focus on that because Israelis are completely focused inwards uh they're focused everybody has somebody that was either taken captive or a victim of the October 7th attack and as it is as I'm sure your audience knows uh the Palestinian issue was sidelined and has been sidelined for for decades really in Israeli Society uh Israel has not had to pay a price for its policies of occupation and segregation uh and what some human rights organizations of course call apartheid so these are not the issues that consume Israelis but of course the October 7th attack changed that so now Israelis are forced to deal with the Palestinian issue on some level but they're not dealing with it by you know by seeing images of what's happening in Gaza that's not that's not what's happening in Israeli mainstream media what we're seeing is just that Hamas is a terrorist organization that it's evil um and that it needs to be wiped out um that's what Israelis understand and and they are legitimately uh you know their security was shattered the government itself failed to secure and protect Israelis on October 7th so um Israelis are really just focused inward but I think what they're going to have to understand at some point is that it's not just about trying to Decap you know to incapacitate Hamas it's also about changing an Israeli government and making it so that Israel Israel and its leadership can actually provide stability and security something that we still don't see after 60 days in Gaza thanks so much mov on sign" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="JEFFREY GOLDBERG: President Trump's leadership  on the world stage is being put to the test   everywhere, and the challenge for America's allies  and adversaries alike is this, figuring out his   actual policies. As the president prepares for  the first major foreign trip of his second term,   we assess America's erratic and contradictory  role in conflict zones across the globe, next. Good evening and welcome to Washington Week. Let me try to encapsulate the challenge before  us tonight. Here in Washington, no one knows   for sure what President Trump wants to do about  the Iranian nuclear program. No one in Jerusalem   knows if the president has truly just left Israel  to fight the Houthis of Yemen alone. In Ottawa,   no one really understands why Trump keeps  threatening Canada's sovereignty. In Copenhagen,   leaders are asking themselves if Trump would  actually invade Greenland. And at the Vatican,   one likely subject, how will the new  American pope get along with an American   president not known for sharing the stage or  the pope's views on poverty and immigration? I'll try to unpack these mysteries  tonight with my guests, Susan Glasser,   staff writer at the New Yorker, Asma Khalid is  an NPR White House correspondent and co-hosts   the NPR Politics Podcast, David Sanger is a White  House and national security correspondent at The   New York Times, and Nancy Youssef is a national  security correspondent at The Wall Street Journal. Okay, we have to go fast because there's a  lot of countries to talk about. The first,   let's talk about the biggest news of the week.  And I recognize that the election of a new pope   is a matter of supreme ecclesiastical  import, but this is Washington Week,   so we're just going to do the politics  of it. I'm very sorry about that. So, Pope Leo XIV is among other things an American  on the world stage with far more followers than   the entire MAGA movement combined. And so one of  the questions I have is how is this relationship   going to work? I mean, the president was very  kind about the new pope. He said it's such a great   honor for our country to have an American pope.  I mean, what greater honor could there be? And we   were a little bit surprised and very happy. It's  just a great, absolutely great honor. It's sort   of like America won Eurovision or something, but  it's -- you know, he was very generous about that. But I also want to take note of an article that  the pope, then-cardinal, recently posted. The   headline that he posted was, J.D. Vance is wrong,  Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others. So, let me start. David, let me  start with you. Try to look out   a little bit into the future. What do  you think this relationship between the   two most important Americans in  the world is going to look like? DAVID SANGER, White House Correspondent,  The New York Times: Well, I think,   initially, the president will probably  treat him with enormous respect and -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: There'll be  a visit, a big visit coming. DAVID SANGER: And there'll  be a big visit and you know,   the president's going to have to like  read up on the White Sox a little bit   because this is a Chicago pope after  all. But there's all that commonality. The problem's going to be if the discussion ever  turns to migration, if the discussion ever turns,   as you said, to poverty issues. And at some  point, you know, Donald Trump's not a guy who   tends to love to share the limelight out here. And  I think the biggest problem's going to come if he   thinks the pope is beginning to talk to American  voters in different ways than Donald Trump does. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. Asma,  do you think that part of the   motivation on the part of the College  of Cardinals was to have an American   counterbalance to Trump? I mean,  I know that there are people -- ASMA KHALID, White House Correspondent, NPR:  I'm not in the mind of the cardinals. Well,   I'll say I very diligently listened to all  of the live coverage. It was fascinating,   as the Muslim watching this all unfold. But I will say, look, I think regardless of  intention, the result will be that you have   a very loud -- an American with a loud megaphone  on a global stage that is not Donald Trump. And,   arguably, under any other circumstance, the  American president would be the loudest,   perhaps most popular American  in the international arena.   And now you have another, you  have a counterweight to that. So, regardless of intention, that  is the result. And I agree with   David that I don't think that Donald  Trump is one to share the limelight,   but I'm also really interested to see ways in  which he presents an alternative vision of what   it means to be an American this time (ph),  because there's a lot of debate about that. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: That's interesting. Susan,   you know, I remember when Pope Francis and  President Obama famously got along very,   very well. How far will President Trump go to  make his displeasure known if this pope eventually   starts talking about immigration in ways that,  let's say, Stephen Miller disagrees with? SUSAN GLASSER, Staff Writer, The New  Yorker: I don't think you're going to   have to wait too long. Donald Trump is not  a man to restrain him himself or his views,   Jeff. And I would imagine that the social  media posts will be voluminous and forthcoming.   You already see, in fact, a lot of discomfort if  you look in the sort of very online MAGA world,   especially, you know, very conservative, very  right wing Catholics in the United States.   They're not a big fan of someone who's already  publicly called out the vice president of the   United States on immigration views. And,  again, pointing out that in recent years,   this has been a major friction point  already with Pope Leo's predecessor,   who has also criticized the United States and  others for lack of empathy toward migrants at a   time when there are more people on the move around  the world than, you know, in any for decades. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. I mean, Nancy, do you  see -- I mean, I think for American Catholics,   especially, let's say, conservative-leaning  American Catholics, it kind of puts them in   an exquisitely sensitive position. He's the  leader of the church. It's ecclesiastical role,   obviously. But his politics seem  to be very, very different. I mean,   is this is a -- is this an electoral story or am I  being too parochial in my questioning about this? NANCY YOUSSEF, National Security Correspondent,  The Wall Street Journal: I don't know. Because   what was interesting to me is the  church introduced him as the second   pope from the Americas. They didn't  introduce him as the first American pope,   and I thought that was sort of interesting. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Well, he has  two decades or more in Peru. NANCY YOUSSEF: That's right. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: So, he's very associated with -- NANCY YOUSSEF: He's an American polyglot. He's  an American who's really spent a lot of time,   as you note, in Peru and also in Italy. At the same time, to me, what was fascinating  about it is how we speak about an American   pope. You know, just 65 years ago, there was a  question about whether Kennedy could be president,   whether he would answer to the pope. We have  six of our nine Supreme Court justices that   are Catholic. And so to your question in  terms of the influence that'll have on the   Catholic population here in the United  States, I think he really personifies a   church that was trying to sort of find  a compromise between the vision that   Francis had and some of the more conservative  Catholic positions here in the United States. And so where he fits in that and how much  he's able to resonate with American Catholics,   I think, is going to be very interesting. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. It's going to be  completely fascinating. We've never seen it.   It really is historic, this decision by the  church. I mean, there's things that we used   the term historic lightly, but this is really  quite a week in American history and obviously   the history of the church. And it's going to be  fascinating to watch these two men circle each   other and size each other up and figure out how  to get their way with the other to some degree. I want to pivot to talk about a current conflict,  not necessarily a future theological conflict.   Let's talk about Iran a little bit. And what I  want to talk about specifically is our Iranian   policy or policies. Let's listen to President  Trump talk about Iran's nuclear program,   first on Sunday, and then on Wednesday.  So, just listen to this for a moment. KRISTEN WELKER, Host, NBC News: Is  the goal of these talks limiting   Iran's nuclear program or total dismantlement? DONALD TRUMP, U.S. President: Total dismantlement. KRISTEN WELKER: That's all you'll accept? DONALD TRUMP: That's all I'd accept. You know,  civilian energy often leads to military wars. And   we don't want to have them have a nuclear weapon.  It's a very simple deal. I want Iran to be really   successful, really great, really fantastic. The  only thing they can't have is a nuclear weapon. REPORTER: Isn't the U.S. position  that Iran can have an enrichment   program as long as it doesn't reach a weapons -- DONALD TRUMP: We haven't made that decision yet. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Nancy,  what's our Iran policy today? NANCY YOUSSEF: I don't know. I'll do my  best though. I mean, he has basically said,   I think we're leaning towards this idea of  total dismantlement that sort of appears to   be where they're trying to go with it. But,  practically speaking, can they get there?   Why would Iran agree to that? And there's  no in indication that they're willing to. I think there's an assumption that's happening  that because they've lost a lot of power and   influence in the region between their  proxies being weakened in Lebanon and   in Syria, and in some cases in Yemen, that  somehow Iran is in a vulnerable position. And I would argue that, actually if you're Iran,  because of those losses that the nuclear program   becomes all the more important, I think the  United States is approaching it as though Iran   is at its weakest and not maybe considering  that that very weakness makes it harder for   them to really consider a program where they  would truly dismantle their nuclear program. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Asma, inside the White House,  are there different factions on the Iran question? ASMA KHALID: I mean, I think there certainly are  different factions within the White House. I mean,   the other factor I will say is that I'm  actually unclear though as to how and what,   you know, Trump fundamentally wants. I don't  have a clear sense of that. I will say like   the talks are ongoing. They have said now they  are meeting again this Sunday. Will it actually   lead to any sort of deal before he heads to  the Middle East, before the president heads   to the Middle East? No. I mean, I don't think  so. I mean, these are just ongoing talks. But   I think the White House feels optimistic about  that the fact that they are continuing to talk. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: You do a lot of reporting  inside the White House on these factions. Are   there distinct hawkish -- is there a distinct  hawkish group and a distinct dovish group? ASMA KHALID: I don't know that there's  a distinct dovish group. I don't know.   Does anybody think that there's a distinct  dovish group? I mean, I think maybe Trump. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Maybe quasi  isolationist. I don't know. ASMA KHALID: Yes. I mean, Trump, as a  whole, I think his foreign policy is   hard to parse as to where he himself stands.  But I don't know that there's a dovish group,   what I would describe as a dovish  group within the White House, yes. SUSAN GLASSER: Well, it seems to me  that we actually do know that it's   not about ideology for Donald Trump and that,  in fact, often, in my view, we overprioritize   here in Washington the idea that there is a  consistent ideology or policy goal. Donald   Trump's goal, we actually know his goal  here. It's to come out with the biggest,   bestest, most importantest deal that there can be  because he's looking for his Nobel Peace Prize. And I don't say that lightly. You know, this  is something, first of all, people didn't take   seriously enough, but even in his first term,  Donald Trump -- it wasn't what the hawks in   his own party or even in his own administration  wanted. He was looking for an opening to talk to   Iran in his first term. This is in part, he sees  this as unfinished business from that, and he is   looking for a goal. And part of the risk, and,  you know, we've debriefed many people who worked   for him in national security roles, as you have,  Jeff, in Donald Trump's first term, the fear that   his own people always had was that he would make  a bad deal because he was so eager to make a deal. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: But the irony of that, David,   is that the thing he fears most is having his  Iran deal be equated to Barack Obama's deal. DAVID SANGER: That's right. And when he's  seen headlines on stories that we've all   done here that do that comparison,  he hasn't reacted well to the -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Well, tell me more about that. DAVID SANGER: Well, the fundamental  problem that he faces right now is   that his criticism of the Obama  2015 deal was essentially twofold,   that you didn't stop them from being on  the pathway to Obama, in other words,   didn't dismantle everything. So, as soon  as Trump pulled out of the deal in 2018,   the Iranians were able to go reconstitute  their program, you know, within a few years. And the second problem he had was, and this was  a legitimate criticism in my view, was that the   Obama program was on the clock, and by 2030, the  Iranians were free to do whatever they want. Now,   he keeps saying they just can't have a bomb.  Well, that isn't the issue. The issue is can   they have a pathway to a bomb in case Trump  or a future president pulls back. And that's   the problem that Steve Witkoff's got  to get at. And it's the one they -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: And Witkoff is doing  the negotiating on Trump's behalf? DAVID SANGER: That's right. He's doing the  negotiations. He's up against an Iranian   negotiator, the foreign minister, Araghchi, who  was the number two negotiator in the previous -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: And Witkoff has no previous   experience negotiating nuclear deals or  anything other than real estate deals? DAVID SANGER: None. And the  guy he's negotiating against,   Foreign Minister Araghchi, knows every  single inch of the Iranian program,   from the getting of the fuel, to  the enrichment, all the way through. So, President Trump wants a like really short  deal, not the 150 pages of the Obama era one.   I think the Iranians see that as an opportunity  to have vague wording about what they can do. And   the Iranians say, look, they're a signatory to  the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. That means   they have the right to enrich. The question  is, can Witkoff talk them out of enriching. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. Nancy, go  into this a little bit more deeply,   because I'm very interested in the role  Israel plays here in this drama. Obviously,   Iran has argued and fights against Israel,  doesn't believe Israel should exist.   The Israelis have been extremely worried  about Iranian nuclear potential for 20,   25 years. The current prime minister of Israel,  Benjamin Netanyahu, has signaled to us in manifold   ways that he trusts Trump to deal with Iran  more than he ever trusted Obama or Biden,   but here we are, when he seems to be looking  for a deal, as Susan suggests, at all costs. So, where does this leave Netanyahu and his  relationship with Donald Trump right now? NANCY YOUSSEF: Well, the truth is it changed in  some ways quite dramatically this week in that we   really saw more public tension and an expression  of frustration after the United States reached a   deal with the Houthis that essentially said, you  can continue attacking Israeli ships, and then we   started to see strikes by the Houthis into Israel.  And remember that the Houthis are backed by Iran. NANCY YOUSSEF: And so I think we saw a major  shift where that sort of promise that the   U.S. and Israel be lock step with -- if there  was a threat from Iran seemed to be framed. To me, what's interesting is  what happens if Israel decides,   as Trump has said, that you have to  deal with your threats as you see them,   they strike at Iran and need U.S. support?  Will the U.S. come through? The indications   we got from the White House today was that they  wouldn't, but that would be a major break -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: When you say the  indications, go into that a little more deeply. NANCY YOUSSEF: Well, we heard a lot of tension  between the two. The president essentially said,   we are here to strike deals for the United States.  We're not here to strike deals for Israel. And so   when they struck the Houthis deal, he said very  frankly that this was a deal for U.S. interests   and that Israel had to look out for its own  defense. But what does that look like? Because   if Israel goes and does that and then needs U.S.  help, is it clear that the United States will -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Or if it goes  and doesn't need U.S. help,   but has nevertheless ignited a conflict -- DAVID SANGER: It's almost impossible to  imagine that though, Jeff, because the   Israeli capabilities are somewhat  limited here. And the question is,   do they want to strike at the Israeli -- at the  Iranian facilities but not really destroy them,   because it really takes U.S. weapons to  be able to get into the deepest of -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: 2,000 pound bombs, the deep -- DAVID SANGER: Right, to get to the fordo  site, which is built inside a mountain. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. DAVID SANGER: And so there are  very few scenarios in which   there's an Israel-Iran conflict where  the United States doesn't get sucked in. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Go ahead -- No. Let me --  I'll come back. But, Asma, as someone who's   reporting in the White House every week,  are you at all surprised that Donald Trump   would kind of tell the Israelis, well,  look I made a deal with the Houthis,   they're going to stop attacking American  ships and your problem is your problem? ASMA KHALID: I mean, I was -- yes. I will  say I was surprised given the sense that,   broadly speaking, I think that there was  an expectation that he was going to be,   and he presented himself throughout the  campaign as being, I think, a strong supporter. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Much stronger  than Joe Biden in his argument. ASMA KHALID: Exactly, right? And, look, I  don't think this is just -- not just the   Houthis statement this week. I think it's  notable that the president's traveling next   week to the Middle East. He's not visiting  Israel. He's visiting three Gulf countries. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. ASMA KHALID: Part of this is  also, I think, the fact that,   you know, the war in Gaza rages on, he  doesn't really want to be committed to that. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: And there are more hotel  building opportunities in the Gulf, sorry,   I will say it, but that's  the reality of this trip. ASMA KHALID: But, yes, no, I think I'm surprised  in that regard. On the other side, I will say,   though, I mean, Trump has often presented,  and we can talk about this as -- you know,   we'll probably talk a bit about like India,  Pakistan. I mean, broadly, this administration's   view is sort of like we don't want to be engaged  in other wars, we want to step out of it. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Susan, I want to  talk a bit about India and Pakistan. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Not that Asma  is directing, but she is. I mean,   it's very important, but I think you  had one quick point to make on that. SUSAN GLASSER: Well, just -- I  think that people didn't understand   that Donald Trump had a much more charged  relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu than   his campaign season rhetoric would have  it, and actually never got over his fury   with Netanyahu for calling up Joe Biden and  congratulating him for the 2020 election. NANCY YOUSSEF: That came up during  the TIME Magazine interview. SUSAN GLASSER: Yes, exactly. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Which was, in ordinary  politics, a very normal thing to do,   you congratulate whoever wins the election. But  for whatever reason, Trump was offended by that? SUSAN GLASSER: Well, it's  Donald Trump's litmus test. SUSAN GLASSER: It's all personal for him. SUSAN GLASSER: And, again, it's not about policy.  But I do think that not visiting Israel this week   is very notable because Steve Witkoff was  also in charge of negotiating a ceasefire   that was going to be a permanent ceasefire  between Israel and Hamas. That has failed.   The administration doesn't want to call attention  to the fact that Witkoff has failed to produce a   ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. He has  failed to produce a meaningful ceasefire   between Russia and Ukraine. And now Trump has  given him this other assignment with Iran. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: He's a busy guy. Okay. So, in the next five minutes,  we have to talk about Pakistan, India,   Canada, and Denmark. So, I will  try to keep my question short,   but I do want you to listen to J.D. Vance  talking about the India-Pakistan conflict.   I mean, obviously, it seems to me that it's  America's business when two nuclear-armed   powers seem to be escalating a war, but J.D.  Vance has a more nuanced view. Let's listen. J.D. VANCE, U.S. Vice President: What we can do  is try to encourage these folks to deescalate a   little bit, but we're not going to get involved  in the middle of war. That's fundamentally none   of our business and has nothing to do with  America's ability to control it. You know,   America can't tell the Indians to lay down their  arms. We can't tell the Pakistanis to lay down   their arms. And so we're going to continue to  pursue this thing through diplomatic channels.   Our hope and our expectation is that this is  not going to spiral into a broader regional war,   or God forbid, a nuclear conflict. But,  sure, we're worried about these things. ASMA KHALID: That sounded like hopes and prayers,   right? We're offering our hopes and  prayers that this will not escalate. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Well, what it sounded like to   me is -- stay on this -- is a little bit  like we're no longer the superpower that   dispatches the secretary of state  to go stop people from fighting. ASMA KHALID: I mean, I would assume --  I shouldn't say, I would assume. Look,   I don't think that it benefits, I would say,   certainly Pakistan or neither India really  to escalate in this situation. And if they   could find a way to deescalate an off-ramp,  it would be open to it. No one, no country,   certainly not the United States, is publicly  offering that leadership for an off-ramp. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: David is  this war America's business? DAVID SANGER: You know, anytime that two  countries that combined have probably 400   more or more nuclear weapons come together, it  can become your business really quickly. And   that's the problem here. And, you know, back  in 2001, when there was another one of these   really bad conflicts, Colin Powell went over to  Delhi and to Islamabad. And I remember him saying   to me one time after he was done with this, it  had been his plan to make sure there was a senior   American in one capital or the other so that these  countries would not head into the worst of this. DAVID SANGER: And, you know, what have  we seen now just in the past few hours,   attacks directly around Islamabad on  some of their military sites (ph). NANCY YOUSSEF: That's a great point. But they  were also -- in the first Trump administration,   when there were tensions in 2019, Mike Pompeo,   writes about this in his book about the  U.S. intervention, that this was the U.S. -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Former secretary of state. NANCY YOUSSEF: Excuse me, yes. NANCY YOUSSEF: And, by the way, Rubio has  been in touch with the parties all week. So,   it's not like they weren't involved. And so this  idea, this has been the role that the U.S. has   played as a broker, and to say right now at the  height of tensions, we're stepping back, there is   no one else to fill that void that the U.S. has,  as you know, since 2001 and certainly before that   filled, this is not the time to sort of change the  fundamentals of how we approach these conflicts. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Susan, I want to play something  that President Trump said about two of our allies,   Canada and Denmark, and then I want you to comment  on it and then tie it up into a very neat package. KRISTEN WELKER: I asked you if you would  rule out military force to take Greenland,   and you said, no, you don't rule out anything.  Would you rule out military force to take Canada? DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think we're not  going to ever get to that point. It could   happen -- something could happen  with Greenland. I'll be honest,   we need that for national  and international security. KRISTEN WELKER: But you are not ruling  out military force to take Greenland? DONALD TRUMP: I don't rule it out. I don't say  I'm going to do it, but I don't rule out anything. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Susan, we have a lot of  problems and challenges in the world. Denmark,   which owns Greenland, is a NATO ally.  Why is the president of the United States   threatening a NATO ally with military  action when there's so much else to do. SUSAN GLASSER: Jeff, you know, I don't  think we need to get inside Donald Trump's   brain or pretend that we understand him to  look and see. This is the through line of   Donald Trump from the minute he stepped  on the public stage is attacks often   inexplicable on America's allies and praise  often inexplicable for America's adversaries.   And that is the one consistency that we've  seen from Donald Trump, a man who can change   his mind three times in one day on what our  actual goal is in Iran nuclear negotiations. But right now, the fact remains that Donald Trump,  a little bit more than 100 days into office,   is threatening Denmark and praising Iran,  okay? So, we are in a kind of an Alice   in Wonderland situation. And that I think is  the longer term damage to the United States. You asked it to put it together. What I would say,   and I've been thinking this week about the  passing of someone we all know, Joe Nye,   great professor from Harvard, came up with the  concept of soft power, America soft power in   the world. Donald Trump is trading that away  because leadership was our power in the world. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: That was a pretty  good answer. Thank you, Susan. We're going to have to leave it  there for now. We'll be talking   about these things obviously in the  weeks to come. But I want to thank   our guests for joining me. I want to  thank you at home for watching us. I'm Jeffrey Goldberg. Goodnight from Washington. (BREAK) END" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="joining me now is author Gideon Levy he's a world-renowned columnist at Harets the uh Israeli paper that is famous really it has taken a very critical line against the Netanyahu government particularly over the war in Gaza now but of course Mr levy has been writing about this for a very long time uh thanks so much for speaking to us at Worldview thank you for having me it's always nice to meet you uh you're there in Tel Aviv now in your latest column in the Harets you've asked a question of why even though many Israelis are against the war uh why they don't feel the pain of Palestinians in Gaza and you've made a very strong statement you said even though Israel has now committed a thousand October 7ths uh in just the past few years what is your sense of uh a the situation in Gaza today uh because of course we see a lot of the videos um and what is the support for the war inside Israel as about the situation in Gaza I think that both of us cannot imagine ourselves what does it mean to live now in Gaza those are walking dead people i talked to some of them but very very few of them we we cannot imagine it and we better don't imagine it because I don't I don't think many people went through what they are going through it must remind me from the worst times of history the starvation the children the the destruction you see the images of destruction it's it's really outrageous and the fact that the world is still silent and it is silent is condemning but not taking any measures to stop it is really astonishing astonishing now to your question look something happened in Israel on the 7th of October besides the crimes of the 7th of October israel got to the notion that after the 7th of October Israel has the right to do whatever it wants no limits no borders not legally not morally we have the right to do whatever we want because what they have done to us the second thing that happened after the 7th of October is obviously the feeling that all the embassy told the Palestinian people even by the peace camp was finished no more i mean it's almost illegal and for sure immoral in Israel to pay some kind of empathy some kind of mercy some some kind of humanity toward the people of Gaza it is immediately labeled as treason and those two things together with the unbelievable betrayal of Israeli media which does not show Gaza to the Israelis because they don't want to see Gaza you will be astonished to see how little any Indians saw more of Gaza than any average Israeli and this also enables the Israelis not to know and they choose not to know and to continue to feel good about themselves they still think that everything we do in Gaza is self-defense all together is a very very depressing picture because humanity is finished any kind of solidarity with the real victims and the people of Gaza are the biggest victims right now is off the table and the future looks very dark right well you know you have spoken about of course the suffering inside Gaza what we saw in the last few weeks uh was a statement by uh Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that he was now preparing for military control of Gaza uh first time since Israel pulled out in 2005 that announcement apart from the increase in bombardment of Gaza in the last uh week or so uh seems to have led to a shift on the part of three leaders who have so far been much more supportive of the Israeli position the leaders of United Kingdom France and Canada do you think this uh you know their statement together their uh threat of sanctions against Israel saying we will no longer turn a blind eye to what Israel is doing do you think it uh marks a turning point in the in the kind of idea that Israel still had support uh and do you think it'll make a difference no declaration will make a difference no declaration will change the policy of Israel the only thing that can change the policy of Israel will be measures actions and the world until now is just talking and Israel learned to live with condemnation and to ignore them as long as it is not being followed up by real measures like for example toward Russia a few weeks after the invasion to to Cremier as long as it's only talking it is with very little influence add to this the notion that most of the Israelis believe that the whole world is in any case anti-semitic that the whole world in any case doesn't like us so why would we care they all I mean it's their fault not our fault they are the anti-semites we are the moral people with the most moral people immoral army in the world right netanyahu in fact accused Macron the French president of speaking for Hamas absolutely macron who is really very devoted to find a solution is labeled as as a pro- Hamas anyone who dares to criticize Israel anyone is immediately labeled as anti-semite and uh you know words will not change it the only way to change it is taking actions by this I don't want to undermine those declinations they are showing a new tone in Europe they might be followed up with actions they might it might be a beginning of a new game but we have to see if it will be followed up with actions or it will remain as a hollow lip service right um you make a a fair point that eventually there has been criticism before the declarations don't necessarily translate to action that'll change uh the course inside Israel what about the domestic uh criticism of the war uh in Gaza which seems to be increasing you know so far we had seen most of the columnists apart of course from you and and others in in the haretss itself uh speaking really about the hostages that the hostages must be returned and for that criticizing the Netanyahu government but recent columns we have seen for example by former prime minister Ahoud Olmat um General Yar Golan's comments about the killing of children in Gaza uh I think former prime minister Barak has been critical as Well do you think that changes something internally in Israel because somehow Israeli politics does seem a little more difficult to uh you know is it seems a lot more complex when you're watching it from the outside it is not I I'm sure Indian politics is much more complex than Israeli politics but we will not make the comparison now in any case look there are two camps in Israel one camp will follow Netanyahu blindly and automatically no matter what he does this camp is quite solid the coalition a very fascist coalition is quite solid and it can and might continue until the next elections in two years there's another camp which is vocal which is devoted which is demonstrating day after day week after week but they have only two goals unfortunately so one goal is obviously releasing the hostages the other goal is getting rid of Netanyahu the goal of becoming more moral the goal of saving the children of Gaza the goal of saving the the last remains of Gaza is not one of their flags and therefore I'm so reluctant about them now which camp is bigger hard to say they are both solid and big i guess that if there would be elections today Netanyahu wouldn't win by all means not but you know uh even the alternatives right now you mentioned some names but the alternative is not promising ending the war the alternative is not premise promising ending the occupation of the apartheid so yeah things will be better after Netanyao but not good enough sure um finally the third poll as it were of uh you know international uh support or otherwise of um uh of Israel is always if you look at the world divided over the issue but there's always the US unequivocal support for Israel and yet we see US President Trump making statements uh he's you know almost uh threatening Mr netanyahu when it came to plans to strike Iran because there's a deal going on between the US and Iran uh and negotiations for that do you think the US is in any way withdrawing its support to Israel how is that ran uh over there because we are dealing with Donald Trump so it's very hard to foresee it can be one day can be one day like this and one day like this one day he supports Putin and to and today he's already cursing Putin one day he's insulting Zalinski and tomorrow Zalinski might become back an ally very hard to tell but it is a turning point and this is maybe the most important question right now what will the American administration do because would he like this war to end it will be within days israel is totally depending now on the West on the United States also on Europe but first of all on the United States like never before because of Israel becoming gradually a pariah state the dependence is much stronger in the few allies that Israel still possesses and therefore if there will be a shift in American policy this will be really a new scene a new era because until now for decades as you rightly said Israel had more or less a card blanch to do whatever it wants there were no limits attacking conquering nuclear weapons everything was allowed if America will change now Israel will face a new challenge which it never ch faced before sure you know in in the columns that you spoke about as well and there's a constant question what happens on the day after the day after Israel's bombardment of Gaza ends what is the plan for there and a large part of that is what is going to happen with uh the neighboring countries Egypt other Arab uh neighbors as well do you think uh that is something that Israel is is is working on right now are there contacts that might lead to meaningful uh cooperation in the future after everything we've seen in Gaza you know I ask because in India of course um India has been fairly muted on the issue partly because of India's own connections with Israel historical connection with Palestine but in particular in recent times India's hopes have been pinned on the India Middle East Europe economic corridor that goes through Hifa uh so many have asked is it is there a point in in thinking about such a project if the future of Israel's relations with neighboring Arab countries is never going to be fixed what are your thoughts first of all it's not about my thoughts about Netanyahu's thoughts and he was very clear he's he has a plan and the plan is as he phrased it to destroy Gaza to destroy Hamas which means to destroy Gaza and then to go for the Donald Trump's plan which is transferring 2.3 million people out of Gaza it is a plan it is a plan of crimes against humanity and crimes of war it is a plan which will never work but that's the plan anything else starts and ends with the question who will replace Hamas in Gaza the question that you raise must come only after solution for Gaza the Arab states not only Arab states by the way yesterday the prime minister of Indonesia was very clear about having diplomatic relations with Israel first time in history the biggest Muslim country in the world if only Israel will recognize a Palestinian state so the horizon is there israel is missing all those opportunities and there is no plan because first of all we don't know what to do with Gaza there will be no Gaza without Hamas unfortunately and if it will be a Gaza without Hamas it will be a Gaza of anarchy there's no substitute nobody prepared a substitute to kamas and therefore we are stuck with this war and all those big plans and dreams I must say must be postponed or even cancelled forever you know you spoke in India about uh six months ago and you had said that you are you no longer think that a two-state uh solution is possible explain that explain why you think that's not possible because that's still what everyone including the US including India including the Arab states are insisting upon it the two-state solution is the best solution two peoples are struggling over one piece of land both of them deser deserve self-determination let's share the land and two between the two peoples and create two sovereign independent states there's only one problem and this is the fact that the settlers did anything they could and succeeded to sabotage any potential for this in the West Bank in the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem occupied East Jerusalem there are 700,000 settlers Jewish settlers most of them are very extreme radical right-wingers part of them very violent and above all they represent the strongest political group in Israel without their evacuation there is no room for a Palestinian state their evacuation looks to me like a mission impossible i don't see who is going to do it no Israeli leader will be able to evacuate 700,000 settlers some of them are really powerful and violent it it might bring a total civil war here if someone proves me that the two-state solution is still possible I'll be the first one to sign on it but we have also to prepare ourselves to the scenario in which maybe I'm right and the two-state solution is not achievable anymore because of the settlers we cannot just say okay so the two-state solution doesn't work as it didn't work for the last 55 years yeah it's not that we didn't try the fact is that we are far from it than ever but we have to prepare a plan B and my plan B is obviously the one democracy the one state solution between the river and the sea one person one vote democracy as any other democracy in the world india is one person one vote israel should be one person one vote no matter what is your national or religious background that's the vision time will show all right um and and your sense of where uh IMC will actually go is it even a possibility if Israel remains on the route if Israel remains on the route it's going to a very bad place it will become an apartheite state it is already but a officially aparttheite state with a official apartheite system a pariah state totally isolated some kind of Iran or no Korea with very little embassy from the world and very little support this can end in a very tragic way that's the last chance for Israel really to change the roots but right now there's no one to lead it all right we we do ask uh in India many times about international conflicts of these kind does India have a role according to you does India have a role first of all in the first of all every country in the world has a rule because I believe that only by international pressure things will change israel will not change by itself forget about it israel will not wake up one morning and say the war must end because it's very brutal and barbaric the occupation must end because it is an apartheite system and so forth and so forth it will not happen by itself it will happen only with the intervention of the international community and the international community india has one of the strongest actors players with very good ties with both sides I must say and someone who has such good ties can influence the question is if India like any other country is ready to take measures not only to talk with talking we are fed up i mean everything was said everything was threatened everything was condemned it doesn't change anything does India is India ready to even sacrifice some shortrun interests of India in order to get to a solution and to really try to influence Israel to put an end to this crazy crazy war first of all that's a question that Indians should ask themselves sure uh Gideon Levi you're always so straight direct uh and you have remained in in a sense critical of the government many always ask how does Haretss do it uh if Israel is such a restrictive country and and the government has put so many strictures on people um uh and there is such widespread support for the war in a sense or uh uh you know the the unwillingness to criticize the war how do you do it it's not very pleasant but it is possible first of all I'm privileged to be a Jew would I be in a Palestinian I would be in jail long time ago Secondly I'm privileged to work with Har which is still a very respected platform in Israel and Harets gives us the full freedom of speech the government until now try to touch Har but only through economical measures not through censorship or things like this this is still far away even though it can happen very they just need to change some legislation and they think about it so nothing should be taken for granted but right now I'm very grateful for being free to express myself having the platform having the support and yes most of the Israelis don't like what I say I'm banned on Israeli TV now for many many months ever since the war started that's not a I mean I'm not the victim of this war obviously and yes I'm very grateful but I don't take it for granted it might change as as journalists shouldn't uh but Gideon Levy thanks so much for speaking to us of course Gideon Levy is the author also of the punishment of Gaza that's about a previous uh Israeli uh campaign there um but for the moment that's all we have time for thanks so much for joining us thank you so much for having me" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="democracy depends on a free press please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org/give this is democracyow democracynow.org israel's military has intensified its attacks on the Gaza Strip killing at least 51 Palestinians since dawn gaza's health ministry reports Israel bombed three electric power generators and fuel storage tanks at the besieged Indonesian hospital in northern Gaza they've also surrounded Gaza's Ala Hospital with Israel's latest attacks only 19 of Gaza's 38 hospitals are still operating albeit at severely limited capacity we go now to Nasser Hospital in Kyunas where we're joined by Dr victoria Rose a British senior plastic and reconstructive surgeon with the National Health Service she's been on three medical missions to Gaza since October 2023 we're talking to her on the day um this week um after it's been announced by Britain that they're going to pause trade talks uh with Israel given what is happening in Gaza right now dr victoria Rose tell us what's happening there what are you finding so um we arrived about uh just well we arrived on the 13th of May and we've been at working at NASA hospital in Carunis since the 15th um as you said it's it's um it's not my first trip so there's some comparisons here but the the main thing that's different really is the state of the population i mean it's it's it's very clear that we're dealing with a completely different patient population now these people haven't had any food in since the 2nd of March they are malnourished the children are particularly taking the brunt of this they are all a lot shorter than they than their uh western counterparts that's that's always been a problem from their chronic mal malnutrition but they are very very thin we are having a lot of problems with wound healing because obviously if you're not getting enough nutrients and vitamins your cells are not turning over in a timely fashion and you can't heal your wounds on top of that we are having dire problems with infection this is related to the malnutrition but also related to the situation that the people are in they are living in tents it's dirty we're running out of clean water israel have stopped the vaccination programs it's the worst it's ever been and Dr rose if you could say you know what kinds of injuries are you seeing most often and particularly on children so they're all blast and bomb injuries and there's a couple of well there's two types of wounds that you see from a a bomb going off or an explosion the first is a burn from the heat of the explosion and we're seeing some huge burns 40 50% burns in children the sort of burns that are very rarely survivable in the UK uh when we have all of our intens intensive care colleagues around us and specialist hospitals we still have problems supporting children with this size burn in the UK so you can imagine what that burn is like over here the other injuries that we're seeing are due to the penetration of the missiles so what happens in a blast is whatever is around you either the local masonry or a car or whatever was blown up with you is ejected at a very high speed and it hits the civilians like a missile this will either penetrate the head chest or abdomen and if it does that you're unlikely to survive if it penetrates a limb you're likely to survive and you'll be brought to the hospital what we're seeing is traumatic amputations of hands fingers feet toes legs arms and what isn't amputated is severely destructed so we are trying to piece together bones patch missing bits of skin nerves are damaged really really severe injuries so Dr rose you're describing these severe injuries uh on a large number of children but you're also working with very little medicine if you could uh you know explain how you're doing this uh surgical work with access to such little such few anesthetics yeah I mean the main thing that we're we're low on at the moment is antibiotics we ran out of um augmentin or coamoxic which is the most standard antibiotic that we use in these type of injuries and we're down to a very weaker substitute kerizone which which we don't actually use in the UK now and that's our real problem is that we're not giving adequate antibiotics to these people we just don't have them and Dr rose uh you know Nasser Hospital is not far uh from the fighting uh could you talk about your concerns about a possible forced evacuation and if such were to occur where the patients at NASA would go yeah we're checking the um the IDF website which is IDF.IL and if you're in Gaza it picks up your location immediately and they've gritted the entirety of the strip we are basically a grid away from the active fighting so about four streets uh about a K and a half from the evacuation zone we had dire problems on Tuesday when that zone was announced in that quite a lot of my team had to leave me to go and evacuate their families my anthetist today on Tuesday walked 20k with his five and six and eight year old to evacuate them from where they lived in East Carunis into Alawasi which is the humanitarian zone so we had a real problem with staff on Tuesday but our our main issue is we are the last standing hospital in the south of Gaza the European Gaza Hospital was taken on Wednesday of LA uh last week and the only other hospitals around us are field hospitals so there's some good field hospitals there's the UK Med ICRC MSF MSF Belgium there's also the Jordanian and the Q8 hospital but but they are all tents these are all tent hospitals that don't have any ICU capacity and they don't have any generated oxygen the only standing hospital around us is the Palestinian uh Red Cross Society but that's part tense and that again doesn't have an ICU and it can't generate its own oxygen so if NASA closes we have a huge issue on our hands because we have a adult ICU and a pediatric ICU and we have nowhere to send these patients anyone here at the moment that's dependent on oxygen is also at risk if NASA closes hundreds of patients will die let me ask you Dr rose if news of what's happening in the outside world is coming to you in a moment we're going to talk to the former labor leader of Britain Jeremy Corbin but the fact that Israel's staunchest allies um well UK your own country where um the prime minister Stormer has said that the suffering of the innocent children being bombed again is utterly intolerable and we're going to speak with an EU representative where the European Union is also um putting pressure on Israel does that make a difference and what are you ultimately calling for it has made a difference it does feel like finally our voices are being heard but it is a shame that it comes so late and I think we need a little bit more action than what we're seeing really what we need is an end to this enforced blockade as I said we haven't had any aid or any food in since the 2nd of March and the nine trucks that came in yesterday are still parked in Israeli territory in Gaza and the Palestinian trucks have not been allowed to pick them up so it's it's really dire i think we need to put the politics aside here it's a humanitarian crisis and Israel has got to open the borders to let food in to let medical aid in and to let aid workers in and then you need to let us work safely i want to thank you Dr victoria Rose for being with us british senior plastic and reconstructive surgeon with the National Health Service has been on three medical missions to Gaza since October 2023 my final question is your colleagues and yourself why do you put yourself in this incredibly dangerous situation where hundreds of health workers doctors nurses have been killed have been imprisoned it's it's difficult to understand unless you come here and see the difference that you make we always worry when we come here that we might not be of any use that we might get all our kit confiscated that we might not have a hospital to go to but what we always say is the main thing is to come here to bear witness because you're not seeing what I'm seeing because there's been a complete block to all media so I'm here number one to bear witness number two I'm here to stand with my colleagues and these are people that I worked with before this war started and every time I come they are so pleased to see me and they need a break and I'm an extra pair of hands and it makes a huge difference and thirdly it's one case at a time but I'm definitely making a difference and I know we've saved some lives

          <attvalue for="3" value="In the early hours of July 31st this year, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran.&#10;It's presumed Israel was behind the killing, with reports detailing a complex operation by its spy agency Mossad. &#10;So, if it was Israel that did this, why did they do it in such an extraordinary manner, and in Iran of all places? &#10;The answer tells us a lot about the complex political situation Israel finds itself in, where it feels the need for revenge, but only in a way that doesn’t alienate its allies.&#10;Matt Bevan takes a look.&#10;&#10;Subscribe: https://ab.co/3yqPOZ5&#10;&#10;Welcome to ABC News In-depth, where you'll find our long-form journalism and other videos to help you understand what's going on in the world around you.&#10;&#10;Watch more ABC News content ad-free on ABC iview: https://ab.co/2OB7Mk1&#10;&#10;For more from ABC News, click here: https://ab.co/2kxYCZY&#10;&#10;Get breaking news and livestreams from our ABC News channel:    / newsonabc  &#10;Like ABC News on Facebook:   / abcnews.au  &#10;Follow ABC News on Instagram:   / abcnews_au  &#10;Follow ABC News on Twitter:   / abcnews  &#10;&#10;Note: In most cases, our captions are auto-generated.&#10;&#10;#ABCNewsIndepth #ABCNewsAustralia #ifyourelistening" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Iran's most famous ski destination is tol Resort it overlooks the capital tyan you can get there on a 7 km chairlift from the tyan suburb of tajrish and on the way up the chairlift if you turn around at just the right time you can see something interesting a giant walled off area filled with lush green trees in amongst the trees is the Palace of the former Sha of Iran his majesty liked skiing hence the convenient chairlift these days it's where the president of Iran holds big events and meets with world leaders right on the edge of the palace grounds is a concrete building five stories high and if you happen to be on the chairlift at 1:37 a.m. on the 31st of July this year you would have seen the Western corner of that building explode windows were shattered and exterior wall crumbled and Rubble fell onto the Terrace below now that explosion was no accident it was the result of a bomb a bomb that killed an extremely high-profile Target Hamas leader Ishmael hania has been assassinated in the Iranian Capital tyan this attack appears to have been meticulously planned and carried out flawlessly probably by Israel as is its usual practice the Israeli government has declined to make any official comment the mozard simply never comments at all but if that's true it's wild killing a Hamas leader inside the compound of the Iranian president while he's under the protection of the Iranian revolutionary guard is an extraordinary statement the Iran supreme leader said Revenge was our duty and that Israel had prepared a harsh punishment for itself by killing a dear guest in our home there's some debate about the mechanic of how they pulled this off which I'll definitely be getting into later in this episode but no matter the methods they used the risk involved in this assassination operation is Extreme if it was Israel that did this why did they do it in such an extraordinary manner well the answer is fascinating and it tells us a lot about the incredibly complex political situation that Israel has found itself in where it feels the need for Revenge but only in a way that doesn't alienate its allies today the unbelievable assassination plot against Ismael Hanah and what it tells us about the escalating conflict between Israel and its enemies the world is on the brink of a fullscale war in the Middle East I'm Matt beon and this is if you're [Music] listening the Israeli intelligence agency mad was once considered to be one of the most terrifying ruthless spy agencies in the world known for its daring and brutal missions the kidnapping trial and execution of Nazi Adolf Aman the Israeli bombing of the Syrian nuclear reactor assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists the purpose of these plots was to communicate to Israel's enemies that there was nowh they could hide without mad finding them and yet for nearly a decade Ismael Hanah leader of Israel's number one enemy Hamas has been living in Qatar for safety security the Israelis would like to kill him he's not alone a bunch of Hamas leaders live in qat it's a weird setup billionaire gas princes the US Military and Hamas all living next door to each other on the Arabian Peninsula and they're not hiding there either they live out in the open Ismael hanas spent years there and nothing happened to him you might think that sending your spies to assassinate your greatest enemies would be easier to do in a country that you share a bunch of allies with but it's not and the reason for that goes back to a series of mad operations that went terribly terribly wrong Israelis once saw their foreign intelligence Service as Invincible not anymore throughout the '90s and 2000s mad bungled a few really high-profile missions the Mad used to have the image of working like a Swiss clock and now it is almost like a Swiss cheese but the biggest of all their screw-ups came in 2010 and that's because they screwed up in a very particular way this is the Spy story that could well spell the end of old fashion Cloak and Dagger Espionage this time the operation was in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates the target hamas's top weapons supplier a man named Mamud almu the Palestinian resistance fighter was known to mosad for buying weapons from Iran and notorious also for kidnapping and killing two Israeli soldiers in 1989 it was called operation plasma screen I assume mad had run out of intimidating operation names and had moved on to household appliances it involved more than 20 mad agents all traveling on non-israeli passports that's really necessary for the operation to work at the time more than two dozen countries including the UAE did not accept Israeli passports so while the CIA and MI6 can print Jack Ryan and James Bond new passports whenever they like Massad agents have to use foreign passports without those foreign passports there's no operation plasma screen not to mention operation DVD player operation Lazy Boy recliner and operation universal remote so how do you get hold of foreign passports well apparently Israel developed a system if you're in Israeli with two passports be that second passport British or Australian you can be approached by an official the official asks you if you need that second passport in the short term and if you say no you're asked if out of Duty to the country whether you'd be prepared to have your passport details borrowed borrowed best no one asks what they're being borrowed for operation plasma screen would require more than 20 of these borrowed passports using fake passports more than once is risky they'd have to get the job done with as few visits to Dubai as possible on visit one the agents followed elabo around Dubai observing his patterns on visit 2 they slipped poison in his drink but he inconveniently failed to die and went home to Syria thinking that he was just sick 2 months later alive and well he headed back to Dubai spies traveling on the same set of passports followed him again M arrives from Damascus midaf afternoon and is watched by several operatives the man in the baseball cap goes by the name of Australian Adam Corman virtually the entire operation is captured on CCTV Israeli operatives follow alabu from the airport to the hotel when he goes to his room two spies with tennis rackets manage to slide into the lift with him hate it when people do that one of the tennis players watches which room he goes into the operatives book a room opposite and still more agents move in and when the Hamas man leaves to go shopping he's followed every step it's quite funny watching these surveillance teams go about their business you can see them changing disguises into business suits pushing on doors that say pull endlessly wandering up and down Hotel corridors like weird business ghosts meanwhile while four of them break into albo's room the Hamas official arrives back from his shopping trip and into the ambush of four assassins they use a special ultrasonic device to anesthetize him without a needle and lower him to the floor waiting for his heart to stop but they aren't out of the woods yet once a team like this starts working it is very easy technologically to trace them at each and every point of the whole of the whole maneuver unlike in the movies they don't have a guy in a van who hacks into the security system and erases the CCTV footage the whole thing is caught on camera their only hope is that nobody will ever bother to check it so they take off albo's clothes and Tuck him into bed it'll look like he died in his sleep in the absence of signs of a struggle for days police thought he' died of natural causes and with agents safely out of the country it seemed the perfect hit it was the passports that blew their cover after Hamas notified duai police that their man was dead it was simple for investigators to check immigration logs for anything suspicious they discovered that the same group of people had clearly been following al-mu in and out of the country Dubai Police say Mahmud al- mau's Killers tracked him from the moment he arrived in the country warrants are now being issued for their arrest which was a bit of a nasty surprise for the people who the passports belong to imagine waking up one morning only to find out that apparently you've traveled to an exotic Middle Eastern location and assassinated an alleged arms dealer the Australians Brits Irish French and Germans whose passports had been used were not very happy I'm angry why is this happening to me does this mean I can't visit my parents because someone used my name it's like a movie the governments of the countries the passports came from were also not very happy they were all friendly with Israel and here was their Ally using their passports for international assassinations such misuse of British passports is intolerable the fact that this was done by a country which is a friend only adds insults to injury this was not the act of a friend this is this is not the first occasion where there has been misuse of an Australian passport by Israeli agencies needless to say Dubai was angry too that is a deplorable and unacceptable method of operation it was extremely embarrassing and damaging for Israel Israel relies on the support of its allies well for its very existence they couldn't risk doing this again in a place like Dubai that's why hamas's headquarters are now in Qatar the Americans had an agreement with the qataris and the Israelis that you don't kill Hamas leaders in Qatar this has provided a challenge for Israel which previously pledged to eliminate Hamas leaders when those leaders aren't in Qatar they're other highly developed Western Allied countries like Egypt and turkey if you Aspire for a country that's pledged to eliminate Hamas leaders it might be easier for you to get them there logistically but diplomatically it's Kryptonite when those Leaders Travel to meet their allies in Iran though well the Palestinian militant group Hamas says its political leader isma hania has been assassinated in Iran so how'd they pull it off mad couldn't get is Hana in Qatar where he lived so they'd have to get him while he was traveling mad knew that Hana traveled regularly to tan mad also knew that he stayed in the guest house of the Iranian revolutionary guard Corps on the edge of the presidential Palace complex at the foot of the mountains it seems they had also managed to bribe two of the building's guards offering them cash and asylum in Europe in exchange for attaching a brick-sized bomb to the bottom of hania's bed they had the where and the how but they were missing the when you can't have a crew of Massad agents hiding in the hills of tyan endlessly staking out the building waiting for your guy to arrive but on the 18th of May this year something happened to help with that third thing I've seen vision of it already there's a huge plume of smoke coming from that site the Iranian president Ibrahim REI was killed in a helicopter accident we did a whole episode about it at the time give it a watch after this one the president's death opened up an opportunity for mad it knew that hania would be invited to the inauguration of the new president in July what happened next is still a little unclear there's at least three versions of the story The New York Times and the Jerusalem Post report that the bomb was planted soon after Rey's death and sat there for 8 weeks waiting for hania to visit for the event the Jewish Chronicle in Lon reports that in fact the bomb was planted on the afternoon of hania's arrival But whichever version turns out to be true we know that by the time hania turned in for the night on the 30th of July the bomb had been planted and it wasn't on a timer it could be detonated when the time was right luckily for Mad the building was unbelievably easy to spy on you can see it clearly from anywhere on the hillside that stretches up behind the palace you can see get from the chairlift on your way up for a ski or you could dress up in green camouflage and climb any of the several hundred trees surrounding the building which is what the Jewish Chronicle reports that Massad agents did hania attended the inauguration of Iran's new president met with the country's supreme leader and then went to the guest house the agents watched hania's car arrive they watched him go into his room watched him turn off the light waited a few moments and then pressed the button two assassinations 14 years apart the differences between them tell us a lot about Israel's position in the world in 2010 mad's operation in Dubai really irritated Israel's allies in Europe and Australia but in 2024 Israel needs those allies more than they've needed them in decades by carrying out assassinations in Iran they're operating in a way that is far more risky for their but much less likely to anger their friends what mad does though it's it's different from the CIA or MI6 CIA people they don't like they don't like this stuff you know it's it's messy while British and American spy agencies do assassinate people they do it in war zones and they tend to do it with military operations or drone strikes and they tend to tell the public about it why don't they do sneaky James Bond St sty assassinations because it was believed to be counterproductive you're just creating martyrdom you're creating that feel of persecution and in the long term that's negative and top it off it usually doesn't achieve anything all terrorists are replaced sooner or later the point of these assassinations is to create fear to terrorize your opponents to make your enemies constantly worry that you've planted a bomb under their bed that the places that they think are safe aren't really Israel's basically sending a message to the Iranians can kill any one of you anywhere anytime it's the same reason Russia kills people by poisoning their underpants or their tea or their door knobs isma hania was the chief negotiator in the peace talks aimed at ending the war in Gaza and now he's been replaced as Hamas Leader by a far more fanatical islamist Yaya sinoa hania's death potentially indicates an Israeli desire to prolong the war and it's part of a series of tit fortat attacks in recent weeks that could signal an escalation of the conflict the thing is though when Russia pulls stunts like this they're condemned by the Western World Israel thinks it's found the guard rails for how to carry out crossborder assassinations without losing friends but right now their friendships are quite stretched they cannot afford to make any mistakes [Music] [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] thank you so much R Shir for sitting here with me today talk about many things that Hing we can explore together one being Judaism in relation to Zionism and vice versa what you've turned uh Israel's armed materialism then possible new for of allyship between Palestinians and Orthodox Jews and everything in between those things but perhaps we can start with this question which I know is one you've explored so thoroughly is this relationship or lack thereof between Judaism and Zionism and for you if I understand correctly um they are not only different but at odds yeah it's more than at odds they work as kind of a team actually in the sense that a disease works as a team with its cure Judaism is the disease and Zionism is the cure Zionism was designed to create a new type of Jew the reason they wanted to create a new type of Jew is because because the uh old zionists back in the day 1800s uh they looked at the Jews as disgusting they looked at the Jews as weak they looked at the Jews as cowardly unmanly was a word that they used often they basically absorbed the anti-semitic tropes of Jews and they believed it see a little history is in order over here Jews for thousands of years were religious uh people a monastic people we lived in what they called ghettos but about a thousand years ago the Jews themselves requested to be segregated because we are loyal citizens to the countries we live in but we have a mission in the world as a religious people it's not just merely a religion that you have to believe in God and then you're saved but rather it's a actual lifestyle and a job description that governs every facet of our lives and not only are there dos and don'ts but but there's actual uh a job that we have to do we study and we pray and we the more scholarship you have of God's Bible and the Torah then the higher level you are the closer you are to God and the the deeper your prayers are the higher you are and the closer you are to God and it's a it's a lifetime it's a lifetime uh program being a Jew and the reason why it's a lifetime program is because after the lifetime is over then we stand before God and however much we accomplished in this world that's how much we can retire with for billions and billions of years forever more that's Judaism in a Nell we're here in this world to prepare for the afterlife and if you ever prepared for a test you know that you shut the doors and you shut the phone and you just lock everybody out and you say come back to me in a couple of weeks when the test is is over we're also preparing for a test but takes our whole life so we had our our way of living Imagine by way of analogy I know shaol and monks on a Hilltop but without the martial arts you know instead there's biblical studies and that's the way Jews were now not everybody uh wanted that lifestyle but Jews were forced to have that lifestyle there was a old historian a Cambridge historian Sao Baron who had a very good line he said that the locks on the inside of the ghetto doors were there before the locks on the outside but there were people that wanted to get out but they weren't allowed to get out until then came the Enlightenment and the Emancipation and we had freedom of religion and freedom from religion and there were Jews that said who whoop we do now we could assimilate and be like everybody else and they tried to assimilate and instead of studying the Torah they wanted to be artists and they wanted to be writers and they wanted to be like everybody else um it didn't work though that was the problem it started in Russia in about 1881 there were programs and the anti-semitic programs attacks lethal attacks against Jews which included the assimilated Jews as well as the religious ones these guys figured that why would anybody attack us why would anybody hate us we're the same as the Russians we're the same as the ukrainians they that led to kind of an identity crisis amongst these assimilated Jews they didn't want to be Jews because they thought the Jews were disgusting um weak pathetic cowardly unmanly um not part of History uninterested in anything useful um but the non-jewish world will not let them be non-jews so what do they do there are various different answers um communism was one of the answers the idea of communism if you believe in it is everybody's going to be treated equal and then the Jews will also be treated equal one of the ideas was Zionism and that ended up the dominance one because at the end of middle of the 20th century um the Jews in Europe were pretty much W wiped out and um because Zionism took place in Palestine to a large extent they ended up the dominant Jewish movement because the others were just wiped off the face of the Earth Zionism believed that the Jews need to change that the reason why people don't like Jews is because the image of the Jew is still of that religious Jew of the disgusting Jew in addition there's something else uh hatable about Jews they don't have a country nationalism in those days was a very strong movement Empires were becoming nation states and the Jews don't have a state and the Jews aren't the people like other people now we weren't because we were religion but they figured look if we could change the Jews into a nationality we could be like everybody else that will have two important results result number one people will look at the Jews differently now you're normal because now you have your own land you have a language you have a culture you're not these weirdos and two more importantly it'll change the Jews themselves the aspirations will change they instead of wanting to finish volumes of the talmud they'll want to win Olympic gold medals they'll want to win euro vision song contests they'll want to be like everybody else they'll want a strong Army so the Zionist set out to create a nationality out of the Jews this was a very it was a daunting task because the Jews had no National characteristics because we were not a nationality we had no common land language or culture h there was no common land cuz for thousands of years the Jews were all over the world and there was nothing wrong with that absolutely nothing wrong with that that's what God wanted and that's where we were God is all over the world we could also be all over the world we had no language or culture because they were Jews in Ethiopia there are Jews in Morocco Yemen uh there are Jews in Syria there are Jews in Germany Spain Russia England these Jews have nothing cultural in common they had one thing in common their religion that's it but the Zionist said no land language culture we need it for the Jews we'll make the Jews a flag like old people have they made a flag that's what's today's Israeli flag which existed before Israel did will create a language so they sat down aen Yehuda his name was to create modern Hebrew a Biblical Hebrew or Rabin Hebrew is not really a speakable language there only few hundred uh root words um so he created an actual modern language modern Hebrew um a national anthem they created H they created uh a culture they had various different ideas about what the culture should be it should be right-wing leftwing fascist socialist and that those differences of opinion led to differences of political parties today in Israel um long story short the religious Jews were very much against this they considered it a form of idol worship it's an actual denial of jewi Jewish identity because Jewish identity is only religious uh for many many centuries the Jews understood the only thing that unites the Jewish people is the fact that God gave the Jews the Torah at Mount Si as the Bible says and that's the only common denominator that Jews have the definition of a Jew is somebody en joined by God to fulfill the Torah being a Jew is a job description the Zionist said no that will not do we will become a nationality and there was always this not tension it was it was worse than tension the zionists wanted to cure the Jews of the aspirations which were to be meek mild humble uh Priestly uh the Bible says the Jews areos a Priestly people you will become strong men Warriors especially Warriors Jews did not like Wars it was very much against our values um you you will become Warriors you'll become strong men you will stop with this cerebral um lifestyle and the studious Pious lifestyle you will be like the kacs you will be like the Germans you will be like the Russians exactly how exactly which country you'll be like in what culture okay there are different Zionist opinions about that and again that resulted in different Zionist political parties today um and that was Zionism designed to wipe out Jewish identity uh destroy it and replace it with Zionist identity very simple and that way the Jews would be normalized and everybody will and the Jews will be normalized will be normal in the eyes of the world they had educational centers they created history books that changed Jewish history that the Jewish aspirations all throughout history was not for a messiah to come and make a renewal of the world and the world become spiritual place no Jewish aspirations were always for National self-determination we were always looking to 2,000 years to come back to our land no we were looking for a Messianic renewal of the world for an esoy for God to come back and end of days no that's not what we were looking at for said the Zionist we were looking for return to our homeland and the the Holy Land Palestine Israel it is never our homeland a Homeland in English the word homeland doesn't say much about what a Homeland is but in other languages including Hebrew Homeland like in French La Patria Fatherland there's Mother Russia it's motherland his Fatherland in Hebrew moles the place you were born and there's a certain in nationalist philosophy a certain organic connection between a people and the place that where the people were born where the people were formed according to Judaism the Jewish people were created at Mount Si in the desert there was no country according to Zionism the Jewish people were created as Israel's Declaration of Independence says in Israel before Israel weren't real Jews Moses never went into Israel but Israel is where the Jews were created and Israel is therefore the Homeland for us it's a holy land Israel for the Zionist it's a Homeland change all the Jewish Concepts change everything from spirituality to politics or from spirituality to physicality from spirituality to materiality keep the names keep the the symbols yes the holy land is valuable to us but not because of the way the Jews think and Jews think it's holy no it's your what Russia is to the Russians and German is to the Germany is to the Germans Israel is to the Jews we wanted an es eschatology in End of Days spiritual spiritual renal of the world said the Zionist no we want National self-determination the Jews are a people only United by our religion by our God we Jews are brothers because we have one father God no it's not true Jews are brothers the same way the Russians of Brothers we are Nationals and that's it now that's why Zionism is opposed to Judaism and never mind the fact that the zionists violate the Jewish religion in all sorts of ways um the most blatant is that we're not allowed to have uh sovereignty over that land until the Messiah comes but set that aside for now the very definition of a Jew according to Zionist is different than the definition of a Jew according to Judaism when I say Jew and Benjamin nanyu says Jew it's only hins so if you want to know the definition of Zionism really the Zionist won't even tell you what the definition of Zionism is they'll every Zionist will tell you that whatever you say that's not really the definition definition is the right for the Jews to do the all Zionism instead of talking about the definition of Zionism it's better um to realize that every Zionism presupposing is two things thing number one the Jews are a nationality not just the religion thing number two Israel is the state of that nationality in the words of Israel's own website aan wrote an article there that says the following and Dani alone said the same thing uh the zionists say this Netanyahu wrote this kind of different language but same idea in one of his books what Japan is to the Japanese and France is to the French Israel is to the Jews okay and therefore by the way that's why Netanyahu and all of these guys say anti-zionism has to be anti-Semitism this is coming from Benjamin Netanyahu you cannot say I'm against the existence of the United States of America but I want an American identity you can't say I'm against the existence of France France and say I want a french identity so too you can't say I'm against the existence of Israel and want a Jewish identity without Israel it's like French without France it's like the Japanese without Japan now the whole thing is baloney because the Jews existed way before Israel did we exist now independent of Israel there was no connection between the existence of the Jews the identity of the Jews and the state of Israel yet the state of Israel wants to own Jewish identity to the point where Japan is to the Japanese what Israel is to the Jews that's Zionism it's the nationalization of Jewish identity okay it's not even Jewish nationalism it's more than that a Christian nationalism let's say would say that would agree that Christianity is a religion but it should rule the nation um white nationalism would agree that whites are whites but they should also be a nation Zionism doesn't say merely that being Jew is a religion but this religion should run a country the Jews are primarily a nationality they also had a religion like the Greeks had a religion they had they worshiped Zeus and I don't know what the Scandinavians had Odin the Jews had our God but the Jews are a nationality like Greeks are a nationality okay that's Zionism and that's a absolute eraser of Jewish identity now this idea of Zionism it causes a lot of problems for the Jews and for non-jews first thing is that I am a Jew by religion I'm a citizen of the United States of America my family's from Poland we've been there for hundreds of years is Israel my country there is United States of America my country well Israel has a nation state law 2018 that Israel is officially the nation state of the Jewish people remember Zionism means the Jews are nationality and Israel is the state of that nationality but I thought I'm an American and America is my country this was one of the biggest objections to Zionism from both religious and non-religious Jews in England when they had the ball declaration there was one Jewish member of the um cabinet his name was Edwin montigue he was against the bord Declaration he was against Zionism he said you're going to make Jews um strangers foreigners in their own countries he says you want to make a Jewish state that means that the Jews will be strangers in their own countries and indeed Netanyahu comes to America he did so when he he came to speak to Congress about Barack Obama's Iran deal which he wanted a squelch and he said I come here representing not only the people that elected me but I represent all Jews all over the world Netanyahu claims to be my prime minister na toi Bennett said after Barack Obama insulted nanyu he called him a coward using a nasty colloquialism that insulting Netanyahu is insulting all the Jews all over the world Netanyahu is not only the prime minister of Israel he's the prime minister of the Jews Jonathan Pard the Israeli spy that was convicted for spying on America he did his time he would move back to Israel he had not long ago said it was in all of Israel's papers he would advise Jews to spy on America for Israel according to Zionism Israel is my country when Israel says that Japan is to the Japanese what and France is to the French what Israel is to the Jews imagine there's two people in France a Jewish guy and a non-jewish guy Fran is to the French what israels to the Jews he doesn't mean the Israeli Jews he means the French Jews too so Fran is to the non-jewish Frenchmen what Israel is to the Jewish Frenchmen Zionism by definition is anti-Semitic therefore because it it makes Jew it's a it's a um dual loyalty Trope not only dual loyalty Trope it demands my loyalty it demands that it claims that it represents Me by its own law now mind you there is not a single country in the world like that there is no other country in the world that claims to be the state of people that are not its citizens never were its citizens don't live there never did live there I have a right by international law to change my nationality if I don't like my President Joe Biden I can move to Mexico and then Mexico is my nation states if they'll have me but no matter where I run what country I live in Benjamin who claims to be my prime minister because I was born Jewish that sounds like a dictatorship not a democracy to me you know they may give people equal rights over there but if I can't escape from that that being my nation state doesn't sound like a democracy to me there is no other country in the world like that now we need to understand this Israel is different than all other countries in the world all other countries in the world are the countries of its citizens Israel is not the country of its citizens by Israeli law Israel is the country of the Jews meaning if you are an Israeli citizen but you're not Jewish Israel is not your country by that I mean Israeli law says you have no self-determination rights in Israel unless you're Jewish so if this is the country of the Jews and the non-jews are there yes they're there with equal civil rights they are citizens but Israel is not their country Israel could never allow non-jewish people to run the country has to be a Jewish majority now more than that by Israeli law remember I said that the Jews are a nation and Israel is a state by Israeli law there was no such thing as an Israeli nationality Israel census uh it has various different categories for people there's religion and there's nationality and citizenship nationality is Jewish nationality is Arab nationality is Jews citizen Israeli Israel is the country not of its citizens Israel is the country of a nationality now you have to understand how Israel looks at themselves and if we understand this we'll understand a lot of things about why Israel behaves in many ways that they do and why they look at themselves in certain ways as opposed to the rest of the world looking them at them in other ways there are people who have said that Israel is a racist State because it favors Jews okay is turkey a racist State because it favors Turks over people who are not Turks I'm talking about Turkish citizens well obviously not countries are there to serve their people Turks turkey is there to serve the Turkish citizens France is to there to serve the French citizens but Israel is to serve the Jewish Nation they look at all the Jews as other countries look at the citizens of those countries it is the country of the Jews it was made to be to be the country of the Jews now you're going to tell me well okay but every other country you can become a citizen of that country regardless of your nationality well you can convert to Judaism and then you are officially an Israeli National which is weird because even though Israel claims Zionism claims that being a Jew is not a religion it's a nationality if you go through a religious conversion not a naturalization process you go to a rabbi in Belgium and you go through religious conversion maybe anti-zionist rabbis rabbis that don't recognize Israel if you are a Jew by religion you are now a Jew by nationality and by the way that doesn't apply to all Jews by Israeli law even if you're an atheist obviously you you're a Jew and you're entitled to the law of return because has nothing to do with religion although it's kind of contradictory to the fact that if you become if you convert with a religious conversion now you're Jewish National however according to Israeli law if you're born Jewish and you believe in another religion other than Judaism you believe Jesus is the Messiah you believe Muhammad's the prophet you're not a Jew you you believe in no God then you are a Jew you believe God's a trinity no Jew there was a case of a Jew that was born uh Jewish his name was Daniel refusion polish guy he later converted to Christianity he was no anti-semite he helped Jews Escape in World War II because of his status um and after World War II 1948 he like when Israel was formed he wanted to move to Israel and become a citizen on the law of return Israel Supreme Court ruled no he's not Jewish he's Christian but wait if an if a Jew could be an atheist why can't the Jew be a Christian imagine this this brother Daniel that's what was a commite monk if he would say all right I don't believe in Jesus anymore I don't believe in anything anymore I'm an atheist oh now you're Jewish now you can come I'm Christan you're Christian you're no good okay fine I don't believe in Christianity anymore I'm an atheist oh now you're an atheist come to Israel now you're Jewish now you're none of this makes any sense and the reason it does doesn't make any sense is because Israel tried to create something that doesn't exist they tried to create added the Jews a nationality had they wanted to create a new nationality they were pseudo kind of zionists that did want to create a totally new nationality have nothing to do with the Jews they were called cananim never never got off the ground that would be one thing it was a valid idea it was also a fiction but they had no nobody to buy into it nobody what they did was they tried to Gaslight the Jews and change the Jews and re-educate the Jews to look at themselves differently as a nationality rather than a religion the problem is the Jews for thousands of years have been very very solid in their identity that they're nationality and that they are a religion they have no National characteristics and this whole idea that well if you're a Jew anywhere uh you could come to Israel what's the definition of a Jew Israel has never defined what a Jew is Israel claims to be a Jewish State the Jewish State what's a Jew" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="or Isahar thanks for joining us you're with the IDSF tell us about the IDSF and why you feel it's so important right now yeah good to be with you Chris um our mission is really to think about Israel's national security interests not for the next 5 minutes but the next five generations that's really what we do so our edge or added value would be our host of generals retired and reserved generals from the IDF Mossach and Bet police together with 40,000 Israelis who joined the movement they generally believe like myself I'm not big a big shot general but I came for the military and security industry and I uh firmly believe in Israel's right to self-defense and uh how we make sure that Israel thrives for generations that's through the education system by founding a a premilitary uh program of our own and through the speaking in high schools and giving uh policy papers and advice to to decision makers in Israel and abroad um all this combined media social media uh we became sort of a powerhouse of Israel's right to self-defense talking about self-defense right now the Trump administration is negotiating with Iran over their nuclear program uh do you have concerns about this i do but I think we we need to give the president a chance look I learned Farsy i have been studying Iran for several years now they're very good at what they're doing they understand very well that confronting the president is far less productive than sort of sweet talking him into a bad deal that's really the danger the sort of the sweet talk of Iran taking out one of the bizarre merchant you know haggling skills and they know what they're doing so basically they're trying to do three things they're trying to convince the president that a good that a bad deal is actually a good deal sort of not really dismantling the nuclear deal but giving vague promises number two they're offering business opportunities what do you know like let's you know doubling down and saying you know what let's construct 90 new nuclear power plants in Iran sort of making the president face a dilemma and number three trying to create daylight between Israel and the United States they recognize that Israel is the main roadblock to a deal or a bad deal um and they sort of try to accuse Israel for uh for um holding back the deal my fear is that either either two happens either a bad deal and sort of the anti-neocons in Washington so to speak will tempt the president into signing a bad deal or Iran simply fudges a time buys time it's a delay tactic it's a well well-known strategy and sort of clutches nuclear bombs uh under the radar in secret that's my main concern you talked about number two about 19 uh nuclear reactors in uh that's what she said and the foreign minister said you know what i mean this could be uh you know billions of dollars were up for grabs for American companies why not and I think he's trying to sort of la or allude to the sort of business background of the president i don't think the president is that naive and I I think he's disillusioned by Iran's sort of malign activity he saw how they tried to take his own life and and he knows very well he was the one of the you know main uh opponents of the original JCPOA deal uh by Obama so it remains to be seen but I think that he needs to lead a hard line against Iran demand accountability and if they fail to do so yes then yes military action is very much on the table so while these negotiations going on what position does that uh or dilemma does that give for Israel so Israel is currently facing a dilemma whether or not to sort of back up the efforts of the president into signing a deal and I do believe that Israel will have to face you know the reality of it which is the president wants a deal but he doesn't rule out military action we cannot compromise on Iran's nuclear program they have to absolutely demolish it uh otherwise there is a big shadow hovering over the Middle East they stated you know widely I mean openly that they intend to destroy Israel and they say it on a weekly basis and they act upon the promise i don't think we can risk it so uh Israel is facing either two e either one of two choices either we lead a military action and sort of update the president but I think with this president will be far more complicated we need to keep good relations or we sort of you know uh um provide backup to the president's efforts but in a way that will ensure the complete dismantlement of the nuclear program this is not something you can compromise on it's like sort of an arbitrary debate they threaten to destroy Israel with a whole host of nuclear weapons so that's not something that Israel can compromise on and uh the prime minister wants the Libyan model where all of the uh reactors centrifuges would be destroyed you you know that's interesting because Iranian the Iranians are are amazing at haggling and they know they even the Iranian government spokeswoman said we want to manage the narrative her words right so disinformation is some sort of a you know considered to be a bad word in today's day and age and I'd like to think of it as narrative engineering they try to control the narrative and they say look uh Israel is trying to offer the Libyan model he's trying to pull you away from like you know peace talks with Iran trying to prevent you from this amazing signature diplomatic achievement come to us build nuclear power plants and let's sign a deal that will be reasonable for both sides it doesn't work like that you cannot negotiate with terrorists uh this the dismantlement of their own weapons uh you can negotiate with them only to find out that in the end of the day they don't intend to dismantle the nuclear program they want to control the Middle East and becoming nuclear is their uh instrument to achieve that end how do you see the Middle East right now in terms of you have since October 7th how would you define what has happened since October 7th tectonic shift absolutely full stop i mean we saw how the war changed the way people see and feel you know the regional architecture security architecture uh me the Middle East air defense has proven very much on the table with the Iranian attack sort of Arab countries providing intelligence to US Sentcom against Iranian missile attacks on Israel and on them so I am optimistic about the Abraham Accords about normalization with Saudi Arabia maybe even normalization with Lebanon possibly with Syria this these things were unheard of so I think sort of reshuffling the cards and presenting us with novel ways to look at the region reach out to the Drews and Kurd minorities create a network of alliances between Israel and the pragmatic Arab world but there is one caveat to this which is the Iranian nuclear program you cannot have uh nuclear weapons in Iran the one reason why they're not going to fall peace with Israel yes they want some concessions on the Palestinian front we can talk about it definitely not a Palestinian state but we can talk about concessions with Iran there it's a no-go zone you need to destroy your nuclear program otherwise uh we can all start counting the minutes with the fall of the Assad regime and the rise of the new regime right there uh many people are concerned not only of that but also the rise of Turkey and its influence on Syria and its threats against Israel right so Syria cannot become a Turkish sphere of influence much like it used to be an Iranian sphere of influence and I think in that regard we should look at the rebels or I should say those who rebelled past tense now they are in power HDS and realize that they actually are a wolf in sheep clothing yes but they do have interests so I think the West can work with them but they need to need to show much more sobriety about it they want to bring back all the Syrian refugees back to Syria that's that's great ir Israel wants to maintain some sort of a cold ceasefire with the Ashara that's fine um let's not drag us all into war deliberately i don't think Ashara wants that number two the Drew community should defin be on the table and they're closed with Israel the fact that Netanyahu and Israel say whoever hurts the Drews hurts us that's amazing progress and number three Turkey as you said they cannot become the new landlords in the Middle East they shown quite a bit of a you know tough rhetoric i think Israel and Turkey should have some sort of emotus vendi learn how to live together it's not really Israel's fault it's Erdogan's hardline rhetoric um Netanyahu is a Hitler i'm going to invade Gaza and so on let's avoid this scenario and sort of ease and moderate Turkish the Turkish influence in Syria while uh building new regional alliances talking about Iran again how fragile is the regime and uh and how strong is any opposition against them and could an attack on the nuclear sites actually lead to the fall of the regime look I um I cannot predict the future but let's not even live in fantasy world uh I don't think the regime is in any danger right now anything can happen we learned that from October 7 my understanding is that the regime is very much stable and and nuclear weapons are the means for it to maintain power what Israel and the West the United States need to do is sort of disconnect the direct link between uh nuclear weapons and the survival of the regime they need to learn if they want to maintain the stability of the regime they need to throw out the nuclear program uh they their the nuclear program for them is an instrument to maintain the regime uh I can see there's opposition in Iran i can see that you know Iranian exiles sort of are very vocal in Western media and so on it's a nation of 90 million people it's half the size of Europe i don't foresee that happening anytime soon but I do think that the regime is very much stressed about that uh eventuality and um I don't know if that's a strategic goal for Israel or the West top of the regime i don't I think we should really be aware of that simply deny them the capability that's all no nuclear weapons no missile program yeah any other thoughts at war well I think we're facing really exciting times right now in the Middle East because the war is kind of a blitmas test sort of uh surfaced all those who are anti-semitic on the one hand or sort of anti-Israeli activists and the real interests of the region saudi Arabia all those countries who are much more programmatic than what we'd like to think and right now we can create interconnectivity in the Middle East we can create really an alliance of peace- seeeking nations inter interestbased coalition with the United States Israel and the pragmatic Arab world this is where we should be heading based on energy and on peace deals and on trade and trade routes the IMC the India Middle East Europe corridor all these things can really work to our benefit i hope we can make it happen hope so too or isart thanks for joining us thank you very much" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="just days ago the Israeli Defense Forces and Shinbet executed a targeted air strike on a Hamas command center situated under the European hospital in the Khn Unice region of Gaza The strike killed Muhammad Sinoir a high-ranking Hamas commander and the brother of Yaha Sinoir the former head of the Gaza based terrorist organization who was killed by Israel the previous year Muhammad Sinoir was believed to be Hamas's top military leader in Gaza Israel tried to assassinate the younger Sinwir brother multiple times over the past decades Now new details have emerged on how Israel tracked and eliminated Muhammad Sinoir Here's all you need to know about the Israeli mission to kill the younger Sinwir [Music] brother For long Israel kept a tab on Muhammad Sinoir monitoring the terror leaders movements and nefarious plots After Hamas released Eden Alexander the last living American hostage in Gaza Israel discovered that Muhammad Sinoir was organizing a significant meeting for Hamas's military wing in an underground facility located beneath the Khan Ununice Hospital Intelligence tipoffs helped the Israeli military know the exact time of the highle Hamas meeting And soon all hell broke loose Several fighter jets from the Israeli Air Force participated in the attack on the Khan Ununes hospital utilizing bunker busting munitions to reach the underground facility Israeli authorities reported that the location contained numerous senior Hamas members and was used for planning terror attacks Muhammad Sinoir joined the self-professed military wing of Hamas the Alcasam Brigades in 1991 The Palestinian Authority arrested him during one of its crackdowns on the terrorist group After serving 3 years Sinoir somehow managed to escape prison As per the Foundation for Defense of Democracies Muhammad Sinoir was behind several suicide bombings in the '90s that claimed dozens of Israeli lives In 2005 after flying below the radar for several years Muhammad Sinoir became the commander of the Khan Ununice Brigade in southern Gaza In 2006 Muhammad Sinoir was involved in the Hamas kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilead Shalit Shalit was subsequently held in Gaza for 5 years Think Tank analysts say Muhammad Sinoir was part of the secretive Hamas cell responsible for holding Shalit who was released in a prisoner swap with Israel in 2011 Muhammad Sinoir was reportedly in the tight circle of Hamas leaders who planned the October 7th horror On the morning of the October 7th crossber attacks the younger sin war announced on Hamas's Al Axa television that the terror group had decided to put an end to all the crimes of the occupation The strike on the Khan Ununis hospital again spotlighted Shinbet Israel's globally feared spy agency Israel's intelligence agencies have gained an aura of invincibility over the decades because of a string of achievements Israel depends on the unique relationship between its security establishment intelligence network and the high-tech sector Israel has foiled Westbank plots allegedly hunted down Hamas operatives in the UAE and been accused of killing nuclear scientists in the heart of Iran Even when their efforts have stumbled agencies like the MSAD Shinbet and military intelligence have maintained their mystique" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="the police stopped them from getting to the Gaza crossing at Karam Shalom So they held their protest at the side of the road All the pictures of the children here of Gazan children that have been killed uh by our army Yeah And how does that make you feel Furious Um we are here to say no more There have been many demonstrations in Israel about the hostages still being held in Gaza but it's quite unusual to see people holding up pictures of Palestinian children Of course these people are on the left but still there is a growing concern about what is being done in Israel's name Some on the Israeli left thought the war was initially justified because of the October the 7th Hamas attacks but now they see nothing but cruelty Although we are not the majority uh we are the reality is still the same reality of genocide extermination famine uh transfer and expulsion plans Amongst the speakers reserveist Captain Ron Feer who faces 20 days in prison starting on Monday for disobeying orders by refusing to serve in Gaza Those orders are not moral They are not serving the h security interest of Israel They the only thing they will bring is death of more soldiers more Gazan civilians and our hostages I would prefer to not get punished but if this is the the price I have to pay for making my moral decisions and choices I'm okay with it A counterprotester arrives asking why they're holding up pictures of Palestinian children when Israeli children have also died &quot;We mourn both,&quot; she's told before the police move her away Across the road a small group who say that Israel must continue to attack Gaza were praying and cursing their enemies The wicked will perish Those who hate you will be destroyed Some were ready for an argument with any left-wing protester who ventured over We are not attacking civilians If you are taking babies under the ground and taking babies in your basement and you are a terrorist don't think we we not shoot you Okay This is a very very specific orders The Arabs make terror and terrorist And you're disagreeing Of course I disagree because in Egypt we did an agreement with the same Muslims There is peace in Jordan We have peace Agreements make security not military And and when he say they they the children the women they are bombing us I think it's a long war and somebody will give up Okay we are not going to give up because this is the land of the Jewish people I think the land is the land is of of God The land is of God I'm going to leave you two to carry on your argument A few miles away in Gaza they gathered not to protest but to dig out the dead and injured from the wreckage of a house in Jabalia destroyed by an overnight Israeli air strike About 50 people had been sheltering there A baby and a child were amongst the dead Neither protest within Israel nor sensia from European countries is stopping the Israeli government from continuing their onslaught The people of Gaza do not have the luxury of argument just the reality of trying to survive Well joining me now live from Tel Aviv the former Israeli Prime Minister Eh Almouth who was once in the same party as Benjamin Netanyahu but is now one of his biggest critics Thank you for joining us When we see Israelis accusing their government of war crimes of genocide it's a it's a remarkable thing Do you agree with those people that that's what's going on Well I uh may not use necessarily the same terminology of genocide Uh I'll be very hesitant Uh but uh the one thing is obvious What is done now in Gaza is totally unacceptable intolerable and unforgivable We have to stop the war immediately There is nothing that we can achieve by expanding the military operation that can be of any value Uh on the contrary we are likely to use the hostages to lose the hostages and to lose soldiers that will fall in battle and to kill many uninvolved Palestinians in Gaza None of which is something that worse this uh military operation We have to stop it and we have to try and come to some kind of an accommodation that will bring back all the hostages We've seen Netanyahu and his ministers attacking the British prime minister the French president effectively blaming them accusing them of uh of anti-semitism and of feeding anti-semitism with their language I mean what is happening to Israel's international relationships Look uh we certainly uh disagree completely with this uh language which is absolutely obnoxious and outrageous Uh Great Britain prime ministers Mr Sturma uh President Mcron Prime Minister Ki of Canada all are friends of the Jewish people and the state of Israel There's no question about it They may not be friends of the Israeli government I'm not a friend of the Israeli government and the majority of Israelis I believe today are not friends of the Israeli government So uh yeah we are all uh victims of this uh very uh very aggressive u government uh Prime Minister Netanyahu is a captive of these uh messianic groups of extreme right-wingers fundamentalists Benvir and Smriidge and their supporters and uh I think it is going to cost Israel a great deal in the international relations However I I can't criticize President Mcron Prime Minister Sturma or Prime Minister Khani or Prime Minister Melan or or the Prime Ministers of other European countries because I also criticize the Israeli government for more or less the same things So and I think that most of the Israelis feel like me They think that the war should end today and that we should bring all the hostages and there is no reason and no wisdom and no moral foundation for killing so many innocent non-involved people in Gaza has to stop The the opinion polls keep suggesting as you say that a majority are against this going on but the Israeli political process does not deliver that right now and and doesn't look like it will in the foreseeable future Well the you know you are democracy in great you know that sometimes government has a majority uh when everyone knows that the majority of votes in the parliament does not necessarily reflect the attitude of most of the people You were in a similar situation in Great Britain last year For most of the year uh 2024 there was a government and everyone knew that Labor is going to uh win the elections big time but as long as there was a majority in parliament they can do certain things So we are trying we are rioting in the streets hundreds of thousands of Israelis day in day out uh and we are taking all kinds of uh protest actions against this government trying to uh uh overthrow the government in a democratic manner of course uh by adding actions uh against this government and uh maybe also the international pressure and the attitude of countries which are known to be traditionally very friendship to the state of Israel British people French people the Canadian people and their leaderships they never were against the state of Israel They are against the government and if they will carry on uh in expressing their attitudes it may be very helpful to the public opinion of Israel Well I mean should they go beyond that There are calls for sanctions against members of the Israeli government Do you think that kind of pressure would be a good idea by countries like Britain and those in the European Union I'm temp tempted to say something which might sound cynical Uh if Britain will uh put sanctions on Benv and Smidge they will not be allowed to go to Britain And some people would say in Israel they'd better go to Britain and not come back So I don't know uh whether these sanctions I I think that uh I'd not like that the state of Israel and the people of Israel will suffer from for instance economic sanctions as the Europeans are threatening to take and Great Britain talking about a trade agreements with Israel which may be cancelled which will affect the Israeli people I'd very much hope that we will not come to that point But if we will come to that point I think it will be clear that the um guilt uh of for this lies entirely on the shoulders of the uh Israeli government And if you're right that the you know Israel may change its government one day in the future do you would you want to see that government delivering international law to effectively hand over Netanyahu to face criminal charges Well my my desire and I think the desire of many Israelis is that Netanyahu will disappear forever from the landscape of our political and public lives Okay So I think at this time what we are interested in is making a political change that will bring back down this government and will allow more decent more responsible uh and more humane people to take over and that they will be dedicated to what I think is the main objective of Israel to conclude once and for all the historic conflict between us and the Palestinians to proceed rapidly into a two-state solution negotiations between us and the Palestinians which is the only possible way to resolve this conflict This is what I was trying to do when I was my minister Unfortunately at that time Palestinian leadership was was not courageous enough to come along on this path But there is no alternative and this is what the new Israeli government will have to do And I hope that the Palestinian leadership at that time will be compatible in terms of its openness to take part in this effort And what will be the personal fate of Netanyahu is less important in as long as he will disappear completely from the landscape of our political and public lives Hood on Thank you very much indeed" />

technology The Innovation the   amazing Cuisine the adventures the desert  that are also worth visiting I can't think   of a single other country in the world that  carries so much significance so much history   so much spirituality and also offers the  modern the exciting the vibrant the young   lifestyle that this country has to offer today  we're setting out on an adventure an adventure   through the holy the ancient and the modern that  the state of Israel has to offer let's do this yeah we're Tech technically on the brink of  the desert and the view is exceptional that   was amazing for me to experience how Elijah and  David and and Jesus and the Israel Israelites had   wandered through that Wilderness they go to the  beach they have the Falafel within 2 hours they   can be up in Capernaum the headquarters  of Jesus's Ministry to experience God I   would trade any year of graduate school I  ever had for an 8-day trip to the land of   is really absolutely to that degree and  I studied at some good schools [Music] today I'm off to the old city of Jerusalem  a Timeless magnet for Millions worldwide I'm   meeting Pastor Alan Jackson who is currently  leading a group on pilgrimage to Israel you've   come to Israel many many dozens of times and  led people through the trip to this country   dozens of times why do you do that and what is  the transformation you see in the groups that   that makes you go through this every time but I'm  a pastor I've served the same congregation for 40   years and I've been bringing tours to Israel for  almost that entire time because I have watched   the impact it makes in their lives you know  I can talk to them about the Bible when I'm   at home but if I bring them to Israel I watch  the Bible change for them it becomes a living   book yeah I can't think of a better investment  I can make in the lives of people my job is to   grow people and Israel is a very important part  of their story even if they don't know it so   anytime I can come I'll grab a group of people  put them on a plane and off the Jerusalem we had but more than that the accommodations  are beautiful when I first came to Israel   many years ago it was a developing country  yeah when I was at the University we said   they would deliver the mail if the donkey  felt like coming down your street it's not   that anymore you're not just a first world  country you're a global leader in comfort   and convenience they have the finest fruits and  vegetables in the world they fill the vegetable   markets of Europe the hotels are outstanding  this is visiting the the finest expressions of   technology in our world that happens to have  a window into Antiquity which is just simply unparalleled unlike other destinations a trip  to Israel has the capacity to ignite and fortify   pretty much anyone's faith if you're a Biblical  literalist and you come here it will give you a   confidence beyond anything you'll ever get in a  library yeah if you're a skeptic it will open the   the doors of your mind to the possibility that  maybe this stuff really did happen it wasn't   a Disneyland creation when they come to have an  experience what they don't expect is to meet God   and I watched that happen over and over again and  their hearts are open to God in a new way we're   sitting at the southern steps and just around  the corner they've excavated along the walls of   the Temple Mount when I was at the University here  that was speculation we hadn't seen it yet we were   pointing at the dirt thinking well maybe every  time I come it's like my Bible is being exposed   again and it's affirming what we've taken by faith  when I visit Israel and I see how God continues to   uncover the story and affirm it if you're willing  to look at it with the eyes of Faith you go home   stronger with a greater commitment to your faith  than when you came I don't think the people at at   home understand the tremendous pressure that is  up on them to Discount the authority of scripture   you know they try to convince us it's myth that  it's just intended to be metaphorical learning   but once you have the experience you don't need  the argument because you know the truth and if   we can help the people have the experience  they don't even have to debate any longer   they've experienced the [Music] truth so how did  you first young Allen connect to this country my   first trip to Israel I was in the sixth grade  it was 1970 my parents had made a trip the   year earlier and they were so impressed by it  that they went home and brought my brother and   I back the next year it it made such an impact  in my heart I floated in the Dead Sea I saw the   Jordan River I walked the streets of Jerusalem  I mean I wasn't old enough to process theology   or to get all the names or the Kings or the dates  but I began to build an appreciation for what was   happening here and I understood at a very early  age that what I was hearing in The Narrative of   the world didn't line up with my experience even  as a child and that still holds true today in your   mind you again you you see people walk through  this journey in the land what are the messages   that are changing in their hand as they're  traveling through you know when they come the   first time they think they're coming for the Rocks  but what happens really quickly is they understand   the lands about the people and their story and  once once they understand that it becomes very   personal to them every group that's ever come  goes home with a commitment to pray for the   Peace of [Music] Jerusalem in America we tend to  worship at the altars of comfort and convenience   that encroaches in our churches as well and when  I come to Israel it's a sacrifice to live in the   land without your sacrifices I have no story to  tell I have no Messiah I have no scripture I have   no prophets and when I see the sacrifices you're  making I've got to go home and understand which   sacrifices I have have to make to make an impact  in the world where I live our Lord our King was an   observant Jewish rabbi and until you have stood in  the midst of the Jewish people and understand what   it means to be Jewish in the world just a little  bit there's no way we can fully understand but   if we can come watch and try to understand what  that means it helps us understand the king that   we worship so I would encourage parents you know  if your children are old enough to be baptized   to process their faith they're old enough to  understand the land of

who's been bringing people   more times than he can remember right how's the  experience been it's been amazing it's really been   surreal when I first came here I I expected you  know to see the sights the Sea of Galilee and the   places where Jesus walked but what I really feel  like God has been drawing my attention to is just   the history and the experiences of the people of  Israel and what they've been through and and what   that means the land was desolate for so many years  that they were disconnected from that and are just   recently returning and so being able to to come  here to to be witness to that to be witness to   prophecy actually being fulfilled currently that's  very important to be able to actually reflect upon   that and witness has there been one sit where you  visited the way you looked at Israel the Bible   the combination of those stories together really  transformed for you yes it's very unexpectedly the   desert in the desert you're completely dependent  upon God you were able to just exist and be and   there was more opportunity to actually abide  in Christ and to dwell and meditate upon God   and His word that I definitely think is lacking  from where I'm from it's fascinating to witness   the deeply personal yet impactful ways in which  Israel leaves its mark on each and every visitor   so Brendan this is your first time in Israel yes  sir how's it been it's been incredible it's been   I would say lifechanging it's opening my eyes  to the Bible I mean I can not have asked for a   better experience when I first started out I did  no research I thought it was more of a third world   country and then the thing that shocked me the  most was the Sea of Gile and places where Jesus   was and how beautiful it was I could not imagine  how beautiful what were you expecting I don't know   I was expecting TR not taking offense at that  yeah I know I'm sorry I hope I'm not offending   you but you know I I was I was expecting it to  be kind of like Gloom and you know not a very   beautiful water maybe a darker color than it was  and you see where Jesus was standing and looking   over the see of Galilee it was absolutely stunning  to me was something that was incredible to me do   you think other people should come to tour Israel  2,000% yeah anybody that's a Christian I would say   everybody you want to come and see this with your  own eyes I mean you know our country in the United   States of America is very young you see something  that's 100 years old and you're mesmerized oh my   God 100 years ago and then you come here and it's  thousands of years ago and I think it increased   your faith with countless destinations to choose  from making a decision can be tough and yet One   Thing Remains clear the magic that Israel offers  is unparalleled I would say whatever sacrifice   you have to make to visit the land of Israel whom  you go with how you go is secondary if you will   go with an open heart towards God and the spirit  of God I have seen it in the lives of thousands   of people my own included repetitively God will  bring change so what does 10 years from now look   like 15 years from now God willing 15 years from  now I'm still bringing tours um I'll be amazed at   what God is uncovering that what he's hidden for  people a decade from now that we haven't seen yet   God willing um I'll visit the land of Israel as  long as God continues to give me breath [Music] today with us we have ruven donon who's the  director of sell Academy the educational   branch of sell ruen what a great honor Shalom  the slogan of the ministry of Tourism for years   in here in Israel was visit Israel and never be  the same right do you really believe it's true   I do I do we have seen it with our work mik for  over 30 years in this industry and we see lives   transformed all the time one of the favorite lines  that many of our pastor friends tell us they say   listen ruven one visit to Israel is like a year  in seminary beautiful Psalm 34 tells us God tells   us taste and see that the Lord is good amen God  wants us to experience his goodness so he gave   us a land not an easy land the land of Israel  is is right on the land bridge between Africa   Asia and Europe that's why we have the greatest  bird migration coming through here twice a year   50 million birds shik fly over our heads coming to  visit the land coming to visit the land they are   the original pilgrims and they come to taste and  see that the Lord has provided A Feast for them   and so the invitation goes to all of God's people  to come and see where the words were spoken where   the Miracles took place to relieve if you would  the biblical story it makes your faith real you   know I met a lady that came on a tour and she told  me you know I raiseed Penny after Penny to come   to see the land yeah and she said now that I saw  the land I'm ready wow to go home it was like the   dream of her life Wow the thing that she needed to  do I believe it I like Simon righteous Simon who   stood in the temple right over the hill to bless  the baby Yeshua and he says now that I have seen   the salvation of the Lord I may depart in peace in  sell Academy the educational arm of sell tours you   have an episode on every site in Israel I think we  have like 52 different sites which site speaks to   you the most oh that's a bad question the southern  steps wow by hula gate by the by the Temple Mount   and I'll tell you why because of all the places in  Israel that are dear to our hearts because of the   biblical Motif and especially the places where  Yeshua our Lord the Son of God walked Among Us   in the flesh we only know of two for sure spots  where we know he stepped on these Stones one is   in magdala in the ancient synagogue that was  dug up in the last few years and the second   place is right here at the southern steps of the  Temple Mount because these steps were discovered   and une Earth this is the original structure and  let's be honest I think people are coming here and   it's like a magnet there's something here that ATT  touch them do you have any ideas of new itinerary   new things that they can see that they didn't see  on the first regular pilgrimage you got to take   the fign to capernum we have got to go up to the  Mount of Olives and to the Temple Mount Anda and   Bethlehem and so on yes these are the musty sites  that that you got to see them but once you've been   there a couple of times we love to take our  friends to off the road places where other   biblical Miracles took place where Abraham tended  sheep in the netive in the southern regions or   when Lot's wife turned into a pillar of salt right  below us here behind this mountain range we just   shot one of our educational videos for SEL Academy  on Mount Kabir which is in Northern Samaria it is   that place where Father Abraham entered the land  of promise for the first time in Genesis chapter   12 and 13 this is where he received the first  promise from God I will give you that land and   we not very many Israelis make it there but we  love to take our pilgrims perhaps even you next   time the friends are in Israel to those biblical  spots we want to see the Next Generation standing   with Israel and supporting Israel we need to  bring them here that they experience and they   see the miracle of the return of the Jewish people  to the land absolutely what do you think I believe   that Israel is one of God's greatest gifts to  the church in this generation we have to pass   the ban and we tell you pastors friends Ministry  leaders teachers doctors professors pass the batan   to the younger Generations there's a story to be  told in Israel puts the backbone puts strength in   the heart of God's people Israel is a source  of blessing amen and all those who come can   drink from that cup of God's faithfulness amen  ruen donon what a great honor pleasure thank you   thank you very much and to you our friends come  see and taste how good the land is and don't   forget to pray for the Peace of Jerusalem while  Israel boasts many celebrated destinations also   known as the a region is a lesser known gem  located in the southern Judean desert it is   characterized by its breathtaking Landscapes  agricultural communities and Rich historical significance we're sitting here at a place that  from what I can tell is one of the most impressive   archaeological sites in this country and yet I  would say not enough people come to this site if   I asked you what is the significance of visiting  this site in this region what would that sound   like first I would say that uh I agree about the  first part that not enough people are visiting   the place because it's isolated it's distant  it's far away those who come are very impressed   they explore something that they never knew would  exist susia was a thriving Community between the   years 400 and 800 CE the people who lived here  approximately 3 thousands of them there were a   refugees who survived somehow the destruction of  the second temple 70 CE the people who arrived in   susia were kohanim were priests they spoke Hebrew  we see the inscription here the mosaics are there   in in Hebrew like it was written today in mod than  Hebrew more than letters so the way of living here   was pretty similar to what we did today after  the destruction of the second temple the major   outcome was the establishment of the synagogues  as a central point of Jewish religion they came   to this place and they built very large synagogue  very fancy one they were very much connected to   their tradition they were very much connected to  Jerusalem you're describing a fascinating story   which I think doesn't exist in many places that  answers in a physical place the question of what   did Judaism look like after the destruction  of the temple and this city is that this is   the reason that susia was declared was defined as  the National Heritage site because it's the only   place that you can actually see how people lived  in that hidden period of time of the Byzantine era   the state of preservation of ancient susia and its  synagogue is truly remarkable this is the entrance   to the synagogue welcome to the synagogue of Susan  and what's equally striking is its resemblance to   synagogues in use today what you see here is  a beima if you visit every synagogue in Israel   you will see a Bea like that it's exactly like  we have today after the destruction there were   laws that were differentiated from the laws in  the time of P mikdash of the temple in order to   retain the traditions of the temple wherever  Jews are living one of them was that we blow   the shuar not only in Jerusalem which was  the tradition during the temple time but we   blow shaar everywhere a je Community is living  these were their hopes these were their dreams   to remind themselves that we are here but really  really really we are part of Jerusalem I find it   to be incredibly grounding that we can come back  and visit and the connection to the people that   came before us is so immediate it's an incredibly  powerful experience I agree it's a very special place many young families have moved to the the  area feeling this deep connection to the land and   their Heritage sealit and her family live in  shanila a quaint agricultural Community where   she grows berries and has a coffee shop called  the house of ptil which translates to House of   berries what a place toal thank you very much  it's a combination of the desert the forest   around us Antiquities and your berries all in one  place yes for Friday I have here a my own Market   we have a cake and coffee good coffee very good  coffee I sell my fruits and people come to buy   fruit and vegetable I'm still deeply impressed  we're here and what is technically a desert that   has been incredibly formed into a forest and  now you're growing berries yes of all places here these are the blueberries   this is almost the end of the picking we have  here 10 different types of blueberries yes in   this one place yes this is the Blackberry  you have to pick the big one I want to say   these are the best I've ever had in the country  they're absolutely amazing wow in the desert in   the desert yes in the sun yes in the summer and no  pesticides or anything anything like that nothing wow my final stop for the day is the atel forest  not only is it Israel's largest man-made Forest   but it was planted on the very edge of the desert  a meeting with many for a bike ride that literally   offers it all I think Israel has really Advanced  over the past 5 10 years it it's just become like   the mecca of bike riding especially in in this  area which is the biggest planted Forest near a   desert okay so actually the The Watershed the  water line where this is considered a desert   this isn't considered a desert is actually  right here you can actually see practically a line you mentioned that Israel's become a hot spot  for biking worldwide right what is it about riding   a mountain bike specifically in this country that  suddenly made it so popular okay so first of all   I'm going to use the cliche I'm sorry I have to  it's riding through history right just in this   area you know this is where king of David's some  of his soldiers were from even one of his generals   came from this area and obviously Israel is a  small country yes but geographically where it's   positioned you have so many different terrains  to choose from you can go up North and into the   Galil and you can go right in judan Samara and you  can go anywhere in the South and you have totally   different climates totally different views if you  can imagine now we have trees behind us but you   know you go 20 km to the South and you're in the  middle of the desert you have nothing yeah with   a short drive short drive I think that's dri  many have been waiting three seasons to find   a way to incorporate bike riding into a show we  finally done it let's do it thank you [Music] sir Delicacies nature sport ancient

          <attvalue for="7" value="if Israel hypothetically decided we want to be in full compliance with international law what would it have to do in general there needs to be an end to racial discrimination and the domination by one racial group over another from the river to the sea taking center stage today is Ralph Wild a professor of international law at University College London he is probably best known for serving as senior counsel and advocate to the League of Arab States before the International Court of Justice wild argued before the court that Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territories is illegal and must end immediately ralph Wild thank you so much for joining us on Center Stage you argued in front of the judges of the International Court of Justice on behalf of the Arab League that Israel's presence on Palestinian territory is unlawful and must end immediately and that legal presentation got quite a lot of attention online it was described in some corners of the internet as a master class so we'd like to get the benefit of that for people who don't have a grounding in international law but who still want to know what the law says and what the law doesn't say can you sum up your arguments before the ICJ for us so the question that the court was addressing ended up being focused uh on the situation uh of the territories uh captured by Israel in 1967 which is of course only 22% of Palestine so within that uh limited framework the issue was what are the legal consequences of Israel's presence in that territory so we're talking about the Gaza Palestinian Gaza Strip and the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the court was considering is the presence in and of itself lawful does Israel have a legal right to even be there and also in the way Israel conducts its presence the way it behaves in Palestinian territory including the way it treats the Palestinian people is that lawful and the court determined uh uh that in the negative on both questions that Israel has no legal right to be there in the first place and must therefore withdraw and also that the conduct of the presence the conduct of the occupation is also violating international law so the opinion of the ICJ was that Israel and Israelis cannot be on Palestinian land that's right illegal on the land occupied since 1967 which is not the entirety of Palestinian land yes is that now binding international law that everyone must respect it was already the position in international law um the court was interpreting the existing law and determining what that law means so it amounts to an authoritative determination of what that law means by the uh the most distinguished uh jurists uh globally i want to make sure I get this right the binding versus non-binding because when I interview people who speak in defense of Israel and I bring up this advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice invariably they tell me &quot;Oh that's not minding.&quot; Yes the inference being it doesn't need to be respected well the law needs to be respected the law that the court determined uh uh the meaning of which the court determined in the advisory opinion needs to be uh complied with you opened your presentation your statement by saying &quot;Palestinians have been denied self-determination through and I quote a more than centurylong violent colonial racist effort to establish a nation state exclusively for the Jewish people in the land of mandatory Palestine.&quot; When you say racist is that a legal determination or is that a political statement in international law uh racial discrimination is unlawful and in general and then the uh a particular regime of uh domination by one group over another in a system of government and authority uh on the basis of racial domination is also unlawful as apartheite you use the word apartheite yes in your arguments the court in its advisory opinion did not what is the finding there the court uh clearly established that there was a violation uh of the relevant areas of international law uh without expressly referencing a partite as a a violation but nonetheless uh covering that uh without mentioning it in terms likewise when it came to um aggression in my reading of the opinion they did call it discrimination though discrimination and then they didn't specify whether it was racial religious or ethnic but in the way I read the opinion it's one of those three it's relig discrimination on one of those three grounds so the the the way that we can understand the court's decision is based on the arguments that were put before it which were all rooted in not only uh religious um discrimination which is also um uh the the situation but also discrimination on the grounds of race now if I try to cross-examine you I'm not going to be very successful i'm not a topflight international lawyer but what I can do is I can I I have read Israel's uh legal arguments that were put forward by uh Israeli the Israeli ambassador it's one-sided because it overlooks well dominating the other the Palestinians are not occupying uh Israeli land so uh the the by definition if the court's going to be considering the question of domination it it isn't going to be need needing to address any issue of the other side peacemaking has been scuttled on various occasions by the Palestinians themselves irrelevant to the issue of whether Israel has a right to dominate the Palestinian people it's a nonsear that's a uh introducing a consideration that has no bearing on the question of whether one uh racial group has a right to dominate another israel has a duty to protect its own citizens again uh irrelevant to the question of occupying Palestinian territory yes a duty to protect but not a duty to protect which involves the indefinite subjugation of an entire other of the racial group israel has valid long-standing historical ties to the land no legally no legally no i mean that's the claim it it doesn't have any legal foundation in in the League of Nations um uh uh covenant that was part of the Versail treaty the Palestine mandate um uh was supposed to be provisionally recognized as an independent state a state for everyone a single state for all the people on that land not a state for a particular racial group so the idea and Jew Israel is a a Jewish state by definition and there is no legal basis for a specifically Jewish state on that land in international law what is or would be Israel's strongest argument before a court of law for what to dominate the Palestinians to there is no argument for for for committing genocide i mean what what would be the what needs to be justified these come up often when I interview people who speak in defense of Israel let me let me Okay self-defense self Thank you okay you took the words out of my mouth this is the first thing that comes up yes so so let's go back to 1967 so why is Israel there there was a war between Israel and three of its uh uh neighbors israel started that war and it was a war started preemptively uh illegally because states cannot uh uh use force lawfully in non-immed immediately imminent anticipatory self-defense as a result of that illegal war Israel captures the territory it has no right a state has no right to retain control over territory simply for security purposes and the right of self-defense therefore is inapplicable to that kind of action states have to deal with security threats nonforcibly when it comes to the extr territorial use of force unless they are at risk of an actual or an imminent attack and Israel was not in 1967 it used force anyway and of course the clue is in the name it was over in six days there was no longer any threat in so far as there was a threat it was it was removed at that through that action well they they of course would disagree that there was no longer any threat but what about in the context i don't think Israel would disagree that after the six- day war there was no then immediate threat of attack from the three Arab states so Israel should have withdrawn at that moment on the seventh day there should have been a retreat because there was no legal basis to maintain the control over the West Bank and the Gaza Strip what about in the context of Gaza today and I'm taking you beyond obviously uh the the remit of the ICJ's advisory opinion but Israel today yes says more than ever that it is acting in Gaza in self-defense following the attacks uh by Hamas in Israel on October the 7th so Israel has been using force in Gaza since 1967 continuously and on on uh the on October the 6th two years ago Israel was already exercising military authority over Gaza and as I say illegally in that situation when a state is using force illegally if there is violent resistance to that illegal use of force the state's use of force does not somehow then become lawful as a means of defense to that defense there is no defense against defense if Israel hypothetically decided we want to be in full compliance with international law what would it have to do in general there needs to be an end to racial discrimination and the domination by one racial group over another from the river to the sea it needs to be a the return of all of the Palestinian people who were forcibly displaced and and have been displaced from that land um over for for a century um that that's also a legal require displaced since when you're talking 1948 or 1967 no return since even before 1948 certainly from uh you know the Nakba and 1947 1948 and onwards a legal right of return uh in international law that is vested in all of those people and their descendants the the remaining uh uh non-Jewish Palestinian people who were not forcibly displaced in 1948 uh but who are treated in various ways as secondclass citizens within Israel around 17% of the citizenry of Israel um that's unlawful and that illegal discriminatory treatment that constitutes apartheite needs to end there needs to be equality and then when it comes to the extension of Israeli rule into the remaining 22% of mandatory Palestine the West Bank and including East Jerusalem and and the Gaza Strip there needs to be a complete withdrawal immediately um uh the removal of all settlements and settlers and the provision of compensation to the Palestinian people for all of the um uh the harm that they have suffered um since 1948 this part gets lost u in discussions about the advisory opinion it does mention compensation in so far as it addresses the occ uh the 67 onwards yes the requirement of compensation as well as withdrawal so land that has been taken again according to international law as it is laid out in this advisory opinion land that has been taken from Palestinians by Israel since 19667 needs to be returned to them and where that is not materially possible they need to there is no excuse for not um uh returning uh the control of the land so Israel doesn't have the option to maybe uh withdraw from some of the land and retain some of the land and then just provide compensation that's not uh ac legally permissible what I mean by compensation is compensation for all of the other loss suffered by the Palestinian people as a result of the unlawful occupation there are 15 judges at the International Court of Justice that um rule were that rule on these opinions 15 judges had to decide say yay or nay essentially they could provide a dissenting voice but my point is this decision was not close it the judges were overwhelmingly yes um in favor of saying that Israel's presence in Palestinian territory is illegal and must end this was not close it was not and likewise there was an overwhelming uh support in the UN General Assembly affirming the the the finding of the uh um the ICJ uh in all key respects so the UN General Assembly which represents all the countries in the world one country one vote passed a resolution at the UNGA demanding that Israel respect this advisory opinion and that means demanding that within a year Israel leave Mhm occupied Palestinian territory cease all settlements and remove all settlers that was voted in September of 2024 so we're we're about The clock is ticking yeah the clock is ticking nobody thinks this is about to happen and there are no signs that this is about to happen states were also told in the advisory opinion and in the general assembly resolution that the illegality uh involved in the occupation has important consequences for them because of the fundamental nature of the rules of international law that are being violated in international law in a decentralized legal system where there is no global sovereign who can enforce uh the law unlike in a national legal system the role of individual states becomes much more important as agents of enforcement if you are any third party not Israel any other country in the world yes whether it's the Fiji Islands France or Venezuela how are you supposed to put yourself in compliance with that opinion and with international law first and foremost they must take positive steps in so far as it's possible to bring the illegality to an end and then they also have negative obligations uh not to recognize the illegal situation and also not to provide any aid or assistance to it concretely what does that look like positive steps to bring the situation to an end would include sanctions against Israel aimed at influencing Israel's behavior uh non-recognition involves uh states uh uh for example uh not doing anything when it comes to their diplomatic relations with Israel uh which involves expressly or implicitly um uh recognizing not only that Israel isn't sovereign over this territory but even that Israel doesn't have any right to be there in the first place so states should not be engaging in diplomatic relations with Israel and so that includes for example uh the current practice of affirming that somehow a right of self-defense would justify Israel's continued presence any state who affirms that position is violating the duty that they have not to recognize the validity and the legality of Israel's presence in that territory but you're not saying that countries for instance are required by international law to shutter their embassies in Israel that's not what we're talking about they should not have uh embassies uh or any diplomatic representation to Israel on occupied territory for example in in East Jerusalem they shouldn't even have diplomatic premises in Jerusalem at all because the status of Jerusalem as a whole not just East Jerusalem but also West Jerusalem still is to be uh determined and Israel is not sovereign in West Jerusalem hence most states who recognize Israel as a state do not have their embassies to Israel in Jerusalem even in West Jerusalem because of that legal requirement that they cannot recognize uh a an invalid claim uh to sovereignty over that city what's international law good for if it doesn't protect people from abuses and doesn't work in the way it's supposed to or was was invented and was dreamed of so it's a limited system the new and the importance is not to make overblown claims for its potential but not to throw the baby out with the bathwater and say that it is worthless the better approach is modesty in the expectations um one has for um the significance of international law which I think then should have consequences in terms of um the extent to which time and effort should be spent uh utilizing um legal avenues of redress as opposed to other avenues which may include forcible revolutionary avenues news explain actually in international law um the Palestinian people have a right to resist a right of uh to defend themselves from their uh uh subjugation and oppression and to do so violently if necessary people are not of course cannot be expected to um simply put faith in a system that is not protecting them and be prevented because of the existence of that system the ability to take matters into their own hands including through violent means so that's the challenge if global society wishes to promote peace then it has to enable justice you're saying if international law isn't strong enough or effective enough in guaranteeing people's rights people will fight for those rights international law permits that actually so for example if we think about another situation the right uh of self-defense that a state the people of a state might have so if we think about the discussions around uh for example Russia's uh uh war in Ukraine um international law permits the rise of self-defense if the situation is dealt with peacefully and through the application of international law then of course the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian state would not have a right to use uh force against Russia the same logic applies to a non-state self-determination uh uh grouping of people the Palestinian people in an analogous situation so there is an argument that Israel makes and the US sometimes makes it too you're not going to like it which is in essence international law is getting in the way of resolving the Israel Palestine conflict it is because it is getting in the way of diplomacy politics and dealmaking and that's where a solution is going to be found in those arenas not in international law so says Israel so stop the lawsuits and engage in dealmaking yeah but I think the question is what is international law preventing when it comes uh to to the issue of um ending the uh uh subjugation of the Palestinian people nothing but what international law is preventing is for Israel um stealing more of Palestinian land and that's why Israel doesn't like it people within Israel or supporters of Israel are against international law because international law is against um Zionist domination uh on a on a racist basis of the Palestinian people and the theft of Palestinian land so of course they're against international law when it comes to deal making when we drill down on the question of these supposed deals what they usually involve is a further loss of um the land of of the uh the um the 22% of Palestine that was left after the proclamation of the state of Israel in 1948 that Israel somehow wants even more of that land like extending from 78% into some of that 22% and the idea idea being that the Palestinian people in rejecting that are somehow impediments to peace did you have any strong personal or political views about Israel Palestine before you became invested in this um as an international lawyer i think I approached the situation with an open mind but also perhaps with a um a fairly typical European bias through my ed the education that I'd had which had not taught me anything about the situation um and and in general or indeed it's more specifically the British role in it whereas I had been taught about the shower about the Holocaust and um the onesided nature of my education I think led to a situation where I um had to educate myself and what I uncovered was shocking in terms of the uh consequences for the Palestinian people of the establishment of the state of Israel and the role of the UK in that and the role of other western states in supporting it ever since ralph Wild thank you

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] it gets very counterintuitive because if I understand you correctly Zionism is essentially a turning away from Judaism yet Israel is constantly employing or using their religious symbology of Judaism and so why would Zionism if it has this contempt or um even hatred for as you were describing earlier for Judaism why is it at the same time seemingly embracing this symbology as something that is very proud of it it seems like a mismatch three things thing number one the Evangelical C Christians the Evangelical Christians are Israel's biggest supporters and they're much more powerful and much more numerous than the Jewish zionists when you hear nanyu speak about biblical exegesis some interpretation of the Bible from experience I can tell you he's talking about Christian Evangelical interpretations and not Jewish ones that's one number two there are Jewish Orthodox Jewish zionists and these guys have developed a mixed up philosophy a mixed up ideology where they Incorporated Jewish nationalism into their religion settlers are the primary example we consider them regular normal Orthodox Jews we consider them Idol worshippers uh Zionism is idol worship because it phys physicalized a spiritual concept um the actual Jewish identity it spiritualized the whole Jewish religion uh they are like the olden day idol worship ERS in the days of the Bible that were religious Jews but on the side worshiped Idols as well that's the settlers as far as we're concerned so that's the second thing guys like benir guys like smotrich the settler rabbis that that's their thing third thing is that it's just an I question of symbolism it it's a question of um you know like they say that they no atheists in a foxhole it's a just a way to G the troops imagine Donald Trump for example like the least religious person in the whole uh Milky Way galaxy right imagine one day I know America would be at War and I know there would be Muslims against Christians or something and he would start quoting the Bible and Jesus and we would all know that it's a joke but it would have value in the sense that the trumpies his followers who are religious let's say evangelicals or whatever they would actually say whoa Donald Trump is quoting the Bible you know this is inspiring to us and Netanyahu is no more religious than Donald Trump and he's no and you know by the way Donald uh Netanyahu has a daughter who's religious an orthodox Jew he's ashamed of her okay yeah I know a rabbi that uh wrote an article about it um but Donald Trump has a daughter who's Jewish Ivanka I don't think he's ashamed of her maybe she's ashamed of him but I don't think I never heard that vice versa in any case Netanyahu is no more religious than Donald Trump and him quoting that it's just because he's in an environment where quoting religious symbolism um is Meaningful the whole idea of Zionism was to take the Jewish symbols and make them into Political tools to take the Holy Land itself and make it into a political tool so if they say Israel is the Jewish homeland right they're using Israel uh the Holy Land Jerusalem and the zionists came to Jerusalem when the zionists started Israel they weren't interested in Jerusalem Jerusalem was a place of Orthodox Jews but as Zionism the Zionist indoctrination succeeded increasingly in breeding these mixed breed Jews which are half Idol worshippers half zionists half Orthodox Jews there became an increasing connection between these Jewish symbols and the cooperation of uh Israeli citizens with people that invoke those symbols and that's why natany is doing it he has no idea even he has no idea what he's talking about he doesn't really mean it he doesn't believe in it it's just you know something he does kind of like a non-religious you know in the olden days even the non-religious Vikings would would talk about the name of Odin you know but it doesn't really mean anything that's that's that's just the way Israel is working and it is very confusing and it's designs to be confusing it's designed to be very confusing now there actually were zionists at the early days of Zionism that said well oh hey if Israel if being a Jewish is become going to become a nationality we can indeed have Jews who are Christians and the holy sepulture will be guarded by Jews who are Christians and the Omar Masque will be Ed by Jews who are Muslims but others disagreed with that now the zionists were creating some fantasy and they could make it anything they wanted they made it whatever worked whatever got people's Bard in even buying even if it didn't make any sense and today we have a Haj pod of unintelligible Babel that they call Zionist philosophy now here's more first there's the an there's the um idea that if you are not Jewish Israel is not your state which means that Israel can never be the state of its citizens it's the state of the Jews so as I was saying how they look at themselves they look at the Jewish people the way turk turkey looks at the Turkish citizens they don't think that they're discriminating against non-jews any more than turkey would think they're discriminating against non-turks non-citizens because in America in France um in Germany citizenship and uh nationality is together that're together not in Israel now listen to this about 10 years ago there was a Supreme Court case in Israel some guys uh wanted to make an Israeli nationality they petitioned the court because they said having a Jewish nationality and a Jewish state is discriminatory against Israeli citizens that are not Jewish and the court said no we do not want to make an Israeli nationality so well if we make an nationality and keep the Jewish nationality then you can only have one nationality so are the Israeli Jews Israeli or Jewish so you're talking about making an Israeli nationality and getting rid of the Jewish nationality which will be great that's the truth but they said first of all you know let me read it to you okay this from the Israel democracy Institute a think tank in Israel they're describing the the courts ruling if na the nationality of Jewish citizens of Israel were to be classified as Israeli the implication would be that Judaism is not a nationality for them but solely a religion this idea is anti antithetical to the fundamental doctrine of Zionism and its main thinkers from Herzel to benan who saw Zionism as the national movement of the Jewish people so here you have Zionism stating that we need to have an Israeli National a Jewish nationality because that's Zionism and I know the court didn't say that's why Jews looked at themselves throughout history they did not Israel's probably greatest political scientist schlom ainer in his book The Making of modern Zionism uh points out that gretz the historian was the first first one or he was more responsible than anybody else for making the Jews think of themselves as a nationality but that's Zionism it's not Jewish identity it's a new fangled identity for the Jews third if the nationality of the Jewish Israelis is defined as Israeli rather than Jewish then the national Bond We Believe binds together Jews in Israel and Jews in the diaspora will be severed the court dealt with this last Point extensively it adopted the position that one of Israel's essential characteristics as a quote unquote Jewish state is its responsibility for the fate of the entire Jewish people including Jews of the diaspora the responsibility of state of is of the state of Israel for World jury is an important expression of the fact that Israel is not an ordinary Democratic state but also a Jewish State though we may be divided by geography and citizenship Israeli and American Jews and their brothers and sisters around the world are members of One Nation so now we have clearly somebody submitted that a Jewish nationality this whole idea that Israel is not this country of its citizens but the country of this Jewish nationality is discriminatory and the the answer is well yes that but that's what Zionism wants a country for the Jews you either have Zionism or you have democracy and here by the way by the way there is no country in the world like this I cannot overemphasize this there is no other country in the world like this and if somebody understands this about Israel and about Zionism they'll understand a lot of things so for example I'm sure you've heard many times the talking point uh that well there's only one Jewish State and I don't know 25 Arab states or 25 Muslim states but I have news for you there is not a single Arab state in the world that's an Arab state in the sense that Israel claims to be a Jewish one because there's no Arab state that claims to be the nation state of all Arabs Saudi Arabia is the state of the Saudi Arabians but it does not claim to be the state of all Arabs all over the world there's no muslim state that claims to be the state of all Muslims all over the world there's only one country that claims to be my actually there are two two countries that claim to be my state United States of America because I carry their passport and I am the I am a citizen of America and Israel because I'm Jewish and they unilaterally decided that they are my country there was no other country in the world like Israel so somebody tells you well you need a Jewish State the Holocaust and all these things no excuse that Israel has no util utility value that Israel claims whether it's true or not no practical purpose that Israel claims is excuse or justifies Israel claiming that they are the state of all Jews all over the world as opposed to the state of their citizens the fact that Israel claims to be my state that it demands my loyalty there was no excuse for that now when I tell this to people they say you know you're right uh Italy doesn't demand the Loyalty or doesn't claim any uh status over the italian-americans why should my answer but I'm saying no that's that's not nearly the problem over here if I would be Israeli American then the analogy to Italy to the italian-americans would be a good analogy but I'm not an Israeli American my family's from Poland it's it's not that well yes it's like Italy doesn't claim any uh status over italian-americans it's that Italy doesn't claim any uh status over the Chinese Americans Israel arbitrarily decided that they are the country of the Jews who made them the spokesman for the Jews nobody they just unilaterally declared themselves such they declared themselves the spokesman of the Jews the speakers of the Jews the country of the Jews the nation state of the Jews their prime ministers the prime minister of the Jews and this is Zionism and if you want to get rid of the imbalance in Israel if you want to make Israel a normal country like all other countries you need to get rid of this law this idea of Zionism that Israel is the state of the Jews there are many people um who claim to be anti-zionist but they're not really anti-zionist they're really Pro Palestinian and I'll I'll tell you who those people are let's assume theoretically that there would be a two-state solution and let's assume theoretically the Palestinians and the Israelis would both be happy with it I know it's not happening but in theory and let's assume even that the Palestinians get 90% % of the land and Israel ends up with 10% of the negative desert but Israel's happy are these anti zionists now happy sure why not well I'm not happy because nothing changed about Israel in my theoretical scenario Israel still claims to be the state of the Jews Israel claims to be not the state of its citizens there are there will still be Muslims or Christians or Buddhists or whatever in Israel Israel is not their state if you're anti-zionist then you want Israel to be the state of its citizens not the state of the Jews because that's what Zionism is in a nutshell the Israel's own Supreme Court said it must be there that way only because Zionism says so because Israel claims to be the state of the Jews that you want to fight Zionism now I'll give you a Way Forward I'm wondering how this ties into a really interesting observation made on Katie Hal's show who we actually just had the sure interviewing here a moment ago Katie helper um so uh there's an issue you take now I have to get this right because there's so many qualifications uh there is an issue you believe with Jews who are denouncing Israel while partaking within Pro Palestinian solidarity movements um and what is the all the exactly there the reason why Israel isn't a one-state solution already right is because Israel is the state of the Jews and not the state of the Israelis if Israel would be the state of the Israelis like all other normal countries then you'd have Palestinian Israelis you'd have American Israelis you'd have I know Israeli Israelis and they one person one vote but that's not what Israel wants to be because that's when not that's what Zionism says it shouldn't be without Zionism Israel is a state of the Israelis with Zionism Israel state of the Jews when Israel says they're my country in the same breath the other side of the coin says it's not the country of the non-jews even if they're in Israel certainly if they're in territories therefore if you want to negate Zionism and that's really the problem over here you see this is the issue if Israel would be a normal country like Canada Australia or America we wouldn't have these issues it's because of the ideology of Zionism okay therefore Z since Zionism means that Israel is the country of the Jews any reinforcement or strengthening of that idea is strengthening Zionism and strengthening the problem I'm talking about the root cause of the problem you know Israel bombing Gaza you want them to stop bombing Gaza you can tell them stop bombing Gaza I got that so I can tell America don't bomb Afghanistan Israeli citizens can tell them stop bombing Gaza anybody in the world can tell America to stop bombing Afghanistan let's say right but if somebody comes and says well no an I'm an American and I'm Jewish and because I'm Jewish therefore I have special standing to tell Israel what to do even a Jewish guy says Israel is doing something bad tell me what do you mean even a Jewish guy if you don't like a particular act that Israel is doing you could be a Zionist and say you know I don't want I'm a Zionist I believe Israel is the state of the Jews because that's what Zionism means and I don't want Israel to bomb Gaza I want to ceasefire those are the leftwing zionists but if you want to fight Zionism if you want to negate Zionism not just make a ceasefire make peace you want to negate Zionism if you want Israel to be a country like all other countries which I wish it would be by the way this is much a fantasy as a two-state solution because Israel designist would never do this so it's not even on the table I'm talking theoretically I would love Israel to be like the United States of America anybody that comes and says because I'm Jewish therefore I have special standing and I'm using my special standing as a Jew to tell Israel what to do excuse me you're an American you're Jewish by religion or are you Jewish by nationality and if if you're Jewish by nationality is Israel the the state of the Jewish Nation if you agree with that then you're in you're a Zionist well yeah this what I'm trying to understand so is there like a subtext or an implication that when a person does that they're saying that Israel does represent the Jewish exactly because if you say look I say that all Jews should object to Israel's claiming to be the state of the Jews I say all the time I've done been doing it for decades Israel is no more connected to the Jews than China is that means not merely that Israel doesn't speak for the Jews you know people say not in my name not that this particular act that you're doing should not be done in my name even though you're the Jewish State wrong no Israel acting in the name of the Jews even when they're doing something good is like China is saying they're acting in the name of the Jews if we want to to end Zionism or everybody has to understand Jews and non-jews that Israel is the state of the Israelis not the state of the Jews Israel must become the state of the Israelis not the state of the Jews any implication any reinforcement any strengthening of the idea the subtext as you're calling it that Israel is the state of the Jews enforce reinforces Zionism and in the long run doesn't serve this the purpose of Peace ceasefire yes it may but and the truth is that Jews in America have an exaggerated sense of their importance to or their impact on Israeli policy but never mind that for now if you really want to negate Zionism you must negate this one factor Israel must become the state of the Israelis and stop claiming to be the state of the Jews if all Jews would get up and say I have nothing to do with Israel I'm an American you you want to act for the Palestinians as an American you can be on anybody's side you want you're an American taxpayer America is is supporting Israel I'm not talking about that politics you can be on whatever side you want but if somebody invokes their standing as a Jew to say look even a Jew is against Israel then that even a Jew only makes sense if you agree that Israel represents the Jews just this particular thing you say no don't don't represent me by doing that so that enforces Zionism and Israel loves when Jews these leftwing Zionist Israel loves it because it means that there's a connection between Israel and the Jews and Israel's own Supreme Court this is Zionism what Jews must do is to say and and by the way this will help peace more than anything else Israel you want to Annex the territories that you're occupying you on one person one state there is no reason why you should need a specifically a Jewish majority uh you're worried about security let's talk about it let's have a discussion give me studies let's put the energy that is used to discuss one state two State red state blue state which is going nowhere and figure out how to make to get rid of one law that Israel has this law that Israel is the state of the Jews as opposed to the state of its citizens you know people say all the time well you could be anti- Zionist Israel has a right to exist but you could still you don't have a right to say Israel shouldn't exist although you can uh criticize Israel policy no problem I'm going to criticize Israel policy one policy you're the state of the Jews as opposed to the state of the citizens change that one policy and everything's over the problem with Israel is not that it shouldn't exist the problem is it does not exist now meaning not as a nationality Israel exists as a country but it's only a doing business name it's a DBA Jewish the state of the Jews DBA Israel it has citizens but as opposed to United States of America Israel has is not a nationality it has no Israeli nationality as opposed to France there is no Israeli nationality let Israel exist like every other country does right now there's the Jewish state that exists there's this front called Israel you don't like the name you want to call it I don't care what you call it let the citizens decide what what to call it if you don't like the name Israel call it Herzel Stan I always say or whatever you want call it Charlie I don't care but what needs to done is Israel needs to become a normal country like all other countries and the way to do it is by changing this one policy of Israel and the truth is if people would know about this policy people would understand what Zionism is and what Israel claims there'll be a lot less zionists out there you know people say well so many Jews are Zionist but I've asked Jews you you you're a Zionist yeah you believe in Israel as the Jewish State yeah do you know what a Jewish State means it has a majority Jews well America has majority Christians is it a Christian State let me tell you what a Jewish State means it's not run according to Jewish law it's not run according to the talud it's run on contrary to all Jewish laws Israel's run according to more Roman Catholic laws uh more British laws than it is to American law to Jewish laws not run according to Judaism at all a je Israel being the Jewish State means and I'm talking to a Jew now Israel is your country and not America Israel is your nation state nanyu is your prime minister you don't have a right to vote see if you're a citizen but not a national of Israel you have a right to vote if you're a Jewish National but you're not a citizen you have no right to vote you're a Jewish you have no right to vote but Israel represents you do you think Israel is your country not America you believe that Japan is to the Japanese which is is to the Jews that America is to the Americans what Israel is to the Jewish Americans America is to the non-jewish Americans what Israel is to the Jewish Americans no I wouldn't believe that then you're an anti-zionist Israel's own Supreme Court said that one of the uh Mainstay of Zionism and it really is the main state of Zionism is that Israel is the state of the Jews as opposed to the state of its citizens any I agree all Jews should say not in our name but not merely this particular act I don't like you to do this in my name you you should do something else in my name rather we should say you're like China claiming to be the Jewish State we have nothing to do with you you're not the state of the Jews American Jews are the state of America when the Nazis came to the Moroccans and and told them to give them Morocco's Jews so the head of Morocco said we don't have any Jews here we only have Moroccans we are Americans by nationality I'm polish whatever however you are originally um American nationality now and I'm Jewish by religion that's it you want to be Jewish by bagels and locks that's your Judaism doesn't make sense to me but fine but Israel has nothing to do with the Jews the Jews are not a nationality and even if they would be Israel is not their country feel almost begs the question is Israel actually oppressing Jewish people yes and if so do you see any commonalities between that and how it oppresses the Palestinian people and this is kind of what I was getting at at the beginning of the discussion whether you see maybe a silver lining there um namely uh the potential for new forms of allyship i as a matter of policy look I obviously anybody who sees those pictures coming out of Gaza if he has human blood cells in him right you you you you can't be indifferent to it I mean it's just it keeps you up at night it's it no question about it but I will not do anything that promotes Zionism the Palestinians are suffering no question about it so are the weager Muslims tell me why I now yes anybody interested in human rights issues will be interested in what's going on in Israel and Palestine and with China and the weager Muslims and Indian Kashmir but I as an American by national it of Polish Descent of the Jewish religion why would I be more allied with any of these particular groups now again yeah Israel's doing it in your name well excuse me Israel says they're doing it in my name to me that's a joke it's like China doing it my I will not cooperate and I will not strengthen and it doesn't do the Palestinians any favors honestly in my view for Jews to do that I will gladly say Israel is not the Jewish State you're doing things you claim in the name of the Jews you're lying you don't you have no standing to do that uh you claim to be the state of the Jews no you claim to be acting uh for the sake of the Jews no don't do me your favors don't do me any favors nothing Israel is China any excuse that Israel has for doing whatever they do uh by invoking their jewishness I denounce that absolutely but for me to say this particular human rights issue it's not indifference to this issue it's saying that I have no reason to be more involved in this issue than any other human rights issue tell me this is worse now okay got it last year something else was worse that's not the point right the point is it's counterproductive really to the cause for people to perceive even that Jews are represented by Israel and this Ally ship yes it's true that they persecute Jews they persecute Orthodox Jews they don't like us they want us to disappear off the face of the Earth or they want to make us into zionists they used to want us to disappear off the face of the Earth more now they want us to become zionists because they see it's it's possible to to do that um I don't think I would be doing the Palestinians any favor by strengthening Zionism just because they have an ally that's Jewish I wish the Palestinian people would understand this I you know they're very happy when Jews Orthodox non-orthodox are on their side and I mentioned to you earlier today that I saw a interview he did with a very articulate uh Muslim uh who was saying that even Jews now are on are against Israel if I had an opportunity to speak to this this Muslim I would tell him when you say even Jews that presupposes that by default Jews should be supporting Israel why well Israel is the state of the Jews just like by default Americans would be supporting America but it's wrong that that's Zionism if you say that by default Jews should be supporting Israel and it's remarkable that they're not that means that you've you you're Zionist influenced it's so it's almost like there's an aspect of identity politics there yes I call it identity theft yeah identity theft identity theft almost reaches a level of superstition it's like yes the moment you say that or the expectation is the moment that you say I'm Jewish it must mean that he support Israel well of course if you say you're Turkish that means you must support turkey by defa not everybody does if you say you're American you support America remember Israel is to the Jews what America is to the Americans that's Zionism and if you think that by default Jews should support Israel then by default you're thinking that Israel is the state of the Jews the way Americans would support America that is what this Muslim guy is thinking in his head and if I had an opportunity to explain to them that I understand that they're looking for allies and I understand that they're looking you know I call it the Jane Fonda effect you've heard this from me they're looking for their Jane fondas but Jane Fonda was an American who was uh siding with the North Vietnamese you want Israelis I'm looking for ivp Israeli voice for peace that's what you should look for there were Jewish an there were excuse me Israeli anti-zionist organization there was matzen means Compass a communist organization a guy AA or who was absolutely not religious but he wrote books explaining this very well um if the Palestinians are looking for allies let them look for Israelis Israeli allies a Jewish guy in America as an ally yeah they got an extra Ally but the price they paid for that Ally is that they're now supporting Zionism in the long run they're promoting Zionism in the long run so yeah if you're looking for a ceasefire fine you you can be a Zionist and want to seize fire and you're looking for leftwing zionists cuz these are the leftwing Zionist that's that's the way they are fine but if you looking to end Zionism which is toxic for Israelis for Jews for Palestinians Zionism helps nobody and it hurts every Zionism is bad ideology I wish all the Israelis and Palestinians long life and health and peace and I'll do whatever I can but I do not believe in my my bottom from the bottom of my heart I have studied this for decades and I can bet a lot of money and I believe in my heart of hearts that strengthening Zionism is not going to bring peace and by Jews invoking their status as Jews to say by default Jews should support Israel but here I'm not in this particular thing I'm not long-term peace is not going to happen that's Zionism that means Israel's a state of the Jews that means it's not the state of the non-jews even citizens if it's not the state of the non-jews you need a Jewish majority if you need a Jewish majority you need to take steps to guarantee a Jewish majority and that's why Israel is not the same as all other countries in the worldi this has been such a multi-layered thought-provoking discussion quite honestly there's a lot I'm going to thinking about after it for days at least um but I'm wondering before we wrap up if there's any final thoughts or observations that You' like to share yeah I think that people need to learn about Zionism about Israel uh there are books out there akor is you can actually download his stuff uh the unwish State I think it's called in some other title that escapes me es escapes me for a second um there are books out there that explain this and we need to understand that Israel doesn't represent the Jews that understanding the more people understand that the closer we are uh to peace I'm not King Solomon and I can't solve all the world's problems but I do know that in reinforcing Zionism just makes us further away from peace and negating Zionism the idea that Israel doesn't represent the Jews that

          <attvalue for="7" value="- This was the Gaza Strip, a 25 mile stretch along the Mediterranean coast, home to just over 2 million people. Today, the once bustling streets and high-rise buildings have been reduced to rubble. But underneath the wreckage lies a vast, sophisticated web of tunnels longer than London's underground. This extensive network is a key weapon in Hamas' arsenal, from which they smuggle weapons and people for their w*r against Israel. The tunnels began as a lifeline for families divided by impermeable borders. When Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in 2007, they poured billions of dollars into this underground infrastructure, waiting for the day their enemy would meet them in this airless, subterranean battlefield. How did Gaza's tunnels go from a primitive supply network to the world's largest underground w*r zone? (gentle instrumental music) Our story starts in Rafah, a city in the south of Gaza with a tumultuous history. In a matter of decades, it changed hands four times, from the Ottomans, to the British, to the Egyptians, to the Israelis. In 1979, things changed once again when Israel and Egypt signed a peace agreement. As part of the deal, Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula. The new border between Israel and Egypt split Rafah in half. One part returned to Egypt, the other remained under Israeli control. And in the middle, a massive, impenetrable wall. - Right now, we are standing in the urban area of the town of Rafah. The immediate problem that the line, as you see it over there, should run across the city, and cut the town into two parts between Israel and Egypt. - Suddenly, neighbors who had grown up side by side lived in different countries. Families separated, unable to visit one another. But Gaza's people weren't about to let a wall keep them from their loved ones. Armed with shovels and determination, they dug the first tunnels beneath Gaza. Simple passageways carved out of sandy soil, connecting homes on either side of the border. These early tunnels were modest and easy to build with openings hidden in basements. On one side, a family in Gaza, on the other, a family in Egypt. In between, a secret passageway that allowed them to visit. For a brief moment, the tunnel stood as a testament to the enduring power of human connection. But it didn't take long for bad actors to exploit the system. With the wall cutting off access to Egypt, Gaza faced severe shortages of everyday essentials. Seizing the moment, enterprising smugglers turn the tunnels into underground trade routes, moving car parts, gasoline, and cigarettes into Gaza, all with a hefty markup, of course. When supply is low and demand is high, profits soar. And while the smugglers were cashing in, they were also filling a critical gap, helping your neighbors get the supplies they so desperately needed. For many Gazans, these tunnels became a lifeline. One Palestinian poetically called them, &quot;The lungs through which Gaza breathed&quot;, the only escape from the suffocating blockades that Egypt and Israel imposed. Egypt and Israel were well aware of the tunnels, but for a long time, the two countries just looked away. They weren't going to interfere with the smuggling of cigarettes or with the family reunions that the tunnels enabled. Everyone, from the people of Rafah to the governments on either side of its wall, understood that this underground network kept Gaza's economy and morale afloat. But everything changed with the First Intifada. In 1987, tensions between Israelis and Palestinians reached a boiling point. Palestinians, frustrated by decades under Israeli control, began protesting. But the grassroots movement escalated quickly. Protests turned to riots, screams turned to stone throwing, Palestinians took up arms, and the clashes between the IDF and the Palestinian crowds soon turned deadly. Gaza was tightly controlled by its neighbors in Israel and Egypt, and still weapons kept appearing in the streets as if by magic. The tunnels had become a pipeline for the w*r against Israel. Israeli authorities tried to destroy the tunnels where they could, but the network grew increasingly sophisticated, and no one in Gaza was going to give up their lifeline to the other side. In 1993, Israel signed a peace deal with the Palestinian Liberation Organization, creating a semi-autonomous Palestinian government for the first time. The Jewish state asked the newly created Palestinian authority for help in locating and destroying the tunnels, an opportunity for the PA to demonstrate its commitment to peace by cracking down on weapon smuggling. But the PA failed miserably. Through a toxic combination of incompetence, corruption, and complicity, the PA left the tunnels intact, and for the next decade, the tunnel network only expanded, snaking underneath more and more of Gaza. By the time the Second Intifada broke out in 2000, the tunnels had become a critical component of Gaza's underground w*r machine. Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Fatah smuggled weapons at unprecedented rates. Underneath the ground, weapons makers assembled the bombs that would detonate Israeli cafes, and buses, and streets, claiming more than 1000 Israeli lives. Israel cracked down hard, determined to stop the terror. And at the end of the Second Intifada, more than 5,000 people were dead. The military launched operations in Gaza to stem the flow of weapons. Demolishing buildings suspected of concealing tunnel entrances, but these efforts often meant displacing civilians and destroying homes, drawing harsh international condemnation. Despite these efforts, the tunnel network endured, smugglers kept profiting, terror groups kept building weapons. The problem seemed insurmountable, so Israel tried a different approach. In 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in the hopes that granting Gazans self rule would finally reduce tensions, - But the move backfired, spectacularly. Without Israeli forces on the ground, Hamas and other groups expanded their tunnel operations unchecked. What had once been a covert network grew into an underground empire, a sprawling web of tunnels beneath Gaza streets, the most important weapon in the fight against Israel. And that fight was now Gaza's first priority, because in 2006, Gazans voted for Hamas to lead them. - Now to be clear, these people weren't all terror supporters. In fact, exit polls showed that a shocking 40% of Hamas voters supported the peace process, and over 1/3 thought that the best path forward was the Two State solution. They saw Hamas as an antidote to the spectacular corruption of the Palestinian Authority. But Hamas and its rival party, Fatah, were unable to share power. Their attempts at a unity government ended in a civil w*r. By 2007, there was only one ruler in Gaza, Hamas, and they had one goal, targeting Israel. - So they poured their considerable resources into expanding the tunnel network. Billions of dollars earmarked for aid went instead to building a fully equipped w*r machine, with tunnels carved from solid rock more than 20 stories underground. For many Gazans, the tunnels still served a practical purpose, alongside weapons, they continued to deliver essential goods like food and medicine. But Israel and Egypt had imposed blockades to curb the flow of weapons and weapons making materials, and the blockades meant the demand for smuggled goods skyrocketed. Smuggling was lucrative, particularly for those who controlled the operation. Known as snakeheads, these individuals invested heavily to build the tunnels and then rented them out to groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. In return, they earned a cut of every shipment. The prophets were staggering. By 2010, snakeheads could rake in up to $200,000 a day. It was a fortune in a region plagued by poverty. But for the ones doing the digging, the story was starkly different. Thousands of Gazans had once worked in Israel, an economic lifeline for a region plagued by poverty and unemployment. But that lifeline soon dried up. Hamas had refused to give up on its goal of eliminating Israel, launching more and more attacks on Israeli cities. And so Israel rescinded the work permits that had allowed Gazan men to feed their families. Without other options, Gazans turn to the backbreaking, dangerous work of digging tunnels. But the burden often fell on children who were small and nimble enough to chisel away at the tight crevices in the bedrock, dozens of feet under the ground. A veritable army of kids risked their lives every day just to bring home a few dollars. - For many children in Gaza, digging tunnels has been a grim rite of passage. But the work was deadly. Cave-ins, electrocution, and exposure to toxic gases were constant threats. - By Hamas' own admission, at least 160 people had died digging tunnels by 2010. Yet the practice continued. Perhaps the most heartbreaking part is that these children understood the dangers before they ever picked up a shovel. - But with no other options, the risk wasn't enough to stop them. For many, it was their only chance to put food on the table. - The tunnels offer a devastating glimpse into Gaza's increasing desperation. For many, they provided essential income and supplies. But for Israel, the tunnels represented an existential threat. Eliminating them became a national security imperative. The Israeli government wasn't interested in cracking down on the smuggling of food, cigarettes, and other goods. It mostly cared about the terrifying prospect of the tunnels being used to launch attacks within Israeli borders. This wasn't just paranoia. - In 2006, Hamas fighters emerged from an underground tunnel and kidnapped an Israeli soldier named Gilad Shalit. For five years, they held him in a two-room complex lined with explosives, 50 feet underground. So the Israelis built a 20-foot high, 10-foot deep border wall equipped with sonar sensors to detect underground activity. But Hamas adapted, digging tunnels deeper, sometimes hundreds of feet below the surface, rendering the wall ineffective. In 2014, the IDF destroyed over 30 tunnels in a major military campaign. And on the other side of Gaza's border, Egypt flooded the tunnels with seawater from the Mediterranean. But the problem persisted. For every tunnel Egypt and Israel destroyed, Hamas just built more, deeper, stronger, and more sophisticated. Israeli engineers developed high tech detection systems and implemented a systematic process for locating and destroying tunnels. Dubbed the Steel Dome, this initiative aimed to neutralize the underground threat. In 2021, Israel announced significant progress, claiming to have destroyed 62 miles of tunnels. But Hamas was quick to counter, asserting that much of the 350 mile network remained intact. - These are no longer the narrow, rudimentary tunnels of the 1980s. Today's tunnels are fortified with concrete and steel rebar, designed to last. Some even resemble luxury living spaces, complete with toweled floors, air conditioning, plumbing, and ventilation systems, and they've grown in scale. Some wealthier Gazans have even used them to smuggle in luxury cars. This vast underground network is more than a military asset. It's an entire infrastructure hidden beneath Gaza's surface. Building hundreds of miles of deep, fortified, and well-equipped tunnels doesn't come cheap. Estimates suggest that constructing Gaza's underground cost nearly $1 billion. That's an extraordinary sum, especially in a region devastated by poverty. So where did the money come from? Much of it was stolen from the very people Hamas claims to represent. Israel approved construction materials to enter Gaza for civilian projects, like rebuilding homes, roads, and schools. But instead of improving life on the surface, Hamas diverted these materials underground, redirecting them to expand their network of terror tunnels. The cost to Gaza civilians was staggering. Homes crumbled, schools and hospitals were left unfinished. Communities in desperate need of support saw their resources vanish into the ground, literally. When Israel discovered this blatant misuse of resources, they stopped sending construction materials, a logical step to protect their own security. Unfortunately, this also made life harder for ordinary Gazans who were caught between Hamas' ambitions and the resulting restrictions. - Gazans lacked basic supplies. But they did have a sprawling, fully operational underground military base, complete with communication systems, storage facilities for weapons, training areas, and even weapons manufacturing sites. Hamas can move personnel, vehicles, and arms anywhere in Gaza without exposing themselves above ground. For over a year, they've been waging w*r from below the surface. But the most critical and dangerous function of the tunnels is their ability to shield Hamas from Israeli surveillance and airstrikes. The subterranean tunnel network presents a serious challenge to the Israeli Air Force. Many tunnels are buried so deep that surface attacks have no impact. The sandy soil, which made the tunnels easy to dig in the first place, now absorbs much of the force from the strikes. And then there's the simple but crucial advantage of concealment. No satellite, drone, or advanced technology can detect targets hidden beneath layers of earth. This isn't a side benefit of the tunnel system, it's a core feature. Hamas values the tunnels because they give them the ability to operate in complete secrecy, outmaneuvering even the most advanced military technology. - Meanwhile, Hamas officials refuse to let ordinary Gazans shelter inside, leaving them exposed to Israeli airstrikes. Hamas leaders shelter beneath schools, hospitals, and homes, turning Gazan civilians into human shields. The international community is quick to blame Israel when civilians are caught in the crossfire. - Gross violations of the human rights of civilians. - We believe that w*r cr!mes are being committed there. - But they conveniently omit the fact that Hamas intentionally places its terror infrastructure directly beneath civilian populations for this very reason. Hamas has been explicit about its willingness to sacrifice civilians. - So Israel is left with only bad choices. Should they sacrifice young soldiers to the booby traps inside tunnels and homes, or should they target Hamas' infrastructure with drones and bunker busters, knowing that civilians and Israeli hostages might be inside? When Israel has chosen the latter, it has been at a very high price for civilians. When Israel has chosen the former, it has been at a very high price for its soldiers. Meanwhile, Hamas exploits its remaining tunnels to move undetected and ambush IDF soldiers. This has dragged the conflict into a prolonged w*r, and that's part of Hamas' strategy. By forcing Israel into a drawn out conflict in a civilian heavy area, Hamas is betting on fierce international backlash. So far, it's working. Israeli citizens are fiercely critical of their government. While the rest of the world claims Israeli tactics are tantamount to genoc!de. - Madam Speaker, we are witnessing the Israeli government carry out a genoc!de in Gaza. - This w*r is unlike any of the world has ever seen before, but Israeli military is clear in its purpose. It's not waging a w*r against Palestinian civilians, it's not waging a w*r against Gaza, it's fighting Hamas, an internationally recognized terror organization that for years has treated its own people as cash cows and human shields. For everyone's sake, they must be defeated. Only then can the people of Gaza live the safe, dignified, prosperous life they deserve." />

Amy Goodman with Nurmine Sh today Palestinians marked the 77th anniversary of the Nakba which means catastrophe in Arabic the mass expulsion of Palestinians in 1948 when Israel was created many Palestinians say they face a second Nakba today in both Gaza and in the occupied West Bank where Palestinians marched in Ramla to commemorate Nakba Day [Music] despite all of the circumstances we are maintaining our land and rooted here our right of return will never be forgotten and Palestine will always be Palestine this comes as Democratic Congress member Rashid Talib of Michigan the only Palestinian-American member of Congress has introduced a resolution to commemorate Nakba Day with support from a growing number of co-sponsors including Congress members Andre Carson Summer Lee Alexandria Casiocortez Ilhan Omar Ayanna Presley Dileia Ramirez Latifah Simon and Bonnie Watson Coleman this is Congress member Talib hello it's Congresswoman Rashidita Talib and this Thursday May 15th marks the 77th year of government of Israel's ongoing neba against the Palestinian people we all know that in 1948 the government of Israel destroyed hundreds of Palestinian villages towns and cities and ethnically cleansed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians for more we turn to a major new report released today by US academics that analyzes Israel's actions in Gaza under the legal framework of the crime of apartate citing dozens of experts human rights organizations and judicial decisions it concludes &quot;Israel's treatment of Palestinians quote includes mass killing arbitrary detention torture and the imposition of a legal regime that provides far less due process than that provided to Israelis living in the same territory meets the legal threshold of apartate,&quot; unquote we're joined now by one of the report's principal authors Sandra Babcock director of the International Human Rights Clinic at Cornell Law School where she is clinical professor and is joining us from now welcome back to Democracy Now Professor Babcock if you can talk about the significance of today the day you're releasing this report and your major findings thank you Amy it's so nice to be back on the show uh we are releasing this report that concludes that Israel has committed and is committing the crime of apartheid which is a crime against humanity on Nakba day because Palestinians are now living through the most brutal phase of the decadesl long occupation of their territory that the International Court of Justice has recognized is an illegal occupation we are our report confirms that there is now a broad international consensus that Israel is committing the crime of apartheid we're not the first people to say this uh but we are the first uh group of academics to analyze over 25 reports and judicial opinions against the backdrop of what is now happening in Gaza and our conclusions are that Israel is not only isolating Palestinians into segregated enclaves in the West Bank that it is subjecting them to a different legal regime than their Jewish settler neighbors uh that it is not only subjecting them to arbitrary detention torture and killings uh but it is doing this against a backdrop of policies that are designed to ensure the perpetual racial subordination of the Palestinian people well in uh Professor Becock in uh last year in 2024 you co-authored a report which found that Israel's actions meet the international definition of genocide so if you could elaborate on the links that you see between uh Israel's complicity in genocide and the fact that you found uh that it is an apartheid state uh you know I think there are important links between the two crimes these are both crimes uh they are both crimes that are recognized under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court uh and both what they have in common is a treatment of a group that is motivated in part by racism uh in the International Court of Justice has found that Palestinians are a distinct national ethnic or racial group that is um the sub that is appropriately the subject of the the crime of genocide and what we found is that Israeli leaders have for decades now and this is leaders at the top echelons the prime minister the former defense minister have made comments about Palestinians that uh evoke age-old racist tropes comparing Palestinians to animals dehumanizing them in a way that is very familiar to your previous guests who were speaking about apartheid in South Africa what I was really struck by in listening to the South Africans that you just had on the show is when they described the features of apartheid South Africa if you took out the word South Africa and you replaced it with Israel that would perfectly describe the policies and laws that Israel has in place today we don't often think of them as apartheid because our thinking of apartheid is rooted in our perceptions of how white South Africans treated black South Africans but in fact what is happening in in Israel today is reflective of exactly that same treatment that we saw in South Africa i wanted to ask you Professor Babcock about the significance of you along with dozens of other uh senior professors human rights lawyers uh taking part in this report you're speaking to us from Cornell University in Ithaca New York um talk about that as protests continue across the country uh students who participated in encampments um are arrested or put in ICE jails some judges have ordered those people released you know Amy it is a very tough time um to be issuing a report that is critical of Israel it has never been easy to criticize Israel but this is what we do we are human rights defenders we are human rights lawyers we are human rights professors and if we can't call out genocide and apartheid when we see it we can't call ourselves human rights defenders the there is a double standard when it comes to Israel when we criticize Israel however it is really important to recognize we are criticizing a state we are criticizing a government we are not criticizing its people this is what we do we call out human rights abuses and government repression where we see it and those of us who have authored this report have been involved in human rights work in every single continent um and we do not make an exception when it comes to Israel what universities have done um is instead of protect in instead of protecting students faculty and staff who are standing up and taking a very principled stance and a risky stance to protest Israel's policies of genocide and apartheid they are penalizing those students they are subjecting them to disciplinary sanctions for peaceful protests they are criminalizing them and jeopardizing their futures when under international human rights law which uh protects the right of people who are protesting against human rights violations anywhere in the world to their rights to freedom of opinion freedom of expression freedom of assembly instead of doing that the university is criminalizing them instead of um invest and I'm talking about universities in general mind you i am not speaking on behalf of Cornell University i'm speaking in my capacity as a professor who has witnessed the criminalization and disciplinary sanctions that are being imposed on students across the country and that is wrong and it needs to stop students are doing the right thing they are standing in the line of fire they are standing up for people whose rights are being subjected to the most horrific repression who are being slaughtered every day who are being starved um th this is what we should all be doing we cannot silence ourselves and we cannot silence we especially cannot silence ourselves when people are trying to censor what we say well we want to thank you so much Sandra Babcock for being with us clinical professor at Cornell Law School director of the International Human Rights Clinic co-author

          <attvalue for="3" value="In his second appearance on “Palestine Talks,” American author and journalist Max Blumenthal discusses whether the recent but unusual “joint statement” by Western nations – pressuring Israel to end its “egregious actions” against the Palestinian people – holds promise, how major tech companies in the West, such as Microsoft and Elbit System, have aided Israel in carrying out atrocities against Palestine and what a visit to Iran (shortly before the interview) reveals about how Israel, disturbingly, has exported certain methods of torture beyond its borders and may be the same ones it is using on the Palestinian people today. &#10;&#10;Subscribe: http://trt.world/subscribe&#10;Livestream: http://trt.world/ytlive&#10;Facebook: http://trt.world/facebook&#10;X (Twitter): http://trt.world/twitter&#10;Instagram: http://trt.world/instagram&#10;TikTok:   / trtworld  &#10;WhatsApp: trtworld.com/whatsapp&#10;Telegram: https://t.me/trtworld&#10;Visit our website: http://trt.world" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="thank you so much Max for sitting with me again today for Palestine Talks i'm hoping we can talk about Gaza the Israeli military and your recent trip to Iran before we get into all that in earnest I'm hoping you can shed light on the recent statement and this is verbatim the joint statement from the leaders of the United Kingdom France and Canada on the situation in Gaza and the West Bank where on the surface at least they seem to be concerned with the egregious actions as uh it's stated in the statement of the Israeli government and uh the statement as I'm sure you know speaks to the uh the blockade and um the refusal of Israel to let in food is there any promise in this rather unusual statement from the West that might be too little too late well it's certainly too little too late from a group of states that have given Israel too much as a genocidal assault on Gaza was clear from the beginning and was signaled within hours of October 8th by key Israeli officials these Western European nations played a key role in shielding Israel from diplomatic accountability providing it with weapons the UK provided Israel with spy flights over Gaza which have been secret and unaccountable to the British public now they're suddenly stepping up at least with some rhetoric and the sanctions that they're looking to issue or individual sanctions that's where the too little comes in one of the figures they're looking at is Daniellea Weiss a fanatical settler leader who wants to colonize parts of northern Gaza after they're ethnically cleansed so my theory on what's happening here and why the Europeans the uh part of the axis of assistance has finally stepped up and said what's taking place is abhorrent is they recognize that the consequences of the apocalyptic final endgame final solution assault that Netanyahu is waging on Gaza is ethnic cleansing and that hundreds of thousands of people could be pushed out of Gaza through what Netanyahu calls voluntary migration but which is anything but voluntary through the Sinai desert and ultimately into Europe and you would have another refugee influx of war torn refugees many of them potentially radicalized by watching their entire families be slaughtered before their eyes this follows uh refugee waves from Libya when Mar Gaddafi before being betrayed by the West after he normalized relations with them warned that the shores of Lampedusa in Italy would be flooded with refugees from Africa that took place after Libya was destroyed and destabilized the refugee wave from Europe a million refugees following the dirty war which Europe participated in helped destabilize European politics and led to Brexit and so this coalition of leaders Starmer Mcronone they're afraid I think of another refugee wave which will drive right-wing populism in Europe and weaken their own domestic base weaken them domestically so this is a self-serving statement in my view and what also is interesting to look at here is how is the chatter from uh Israeli accounts on social media threatening Europe uh there's one count account account in particular uh open source or osent 613 on Twitter which consistently echoes the messaging of Israel's military intelligence apparatus and it has warned that if Europe goes forward with targeted sanctions even individual sanctions Israel could retaliate in a number of ways including by ending cooperation security cooperation security assistance and intelligence sharing which would then trigger in the words of this account a wave of jihadist attacks in Europe which suggests to me that Israel actually maintains jihadist sleeper cells in Europe which it can activate in order to punish the Europeans a kind of uh unconventional Samson option for any uh any accountability for this genocidal assault and that is absolutely terrifying as well as revealing about the the the role Israel plays as a so-called ally it's actually the ultimate frennemy and I I'm actually unclear about where the friendship lies here this is uh this is blackmail in the extreme you alluded to it just a moment ago about it being too little too late i'm wondering why did it take this long in addition perhaps to the reason you mentioned about the fear of um or the right-wing populism fear and um also maybe I should add like how do we ensure that even if this is promising in any way for the Palestinian people that these states are still held accountable that people don't forget that it took this long well I mentioned the the the threat of right-wing populism as a new refugee wave um you know looms on the horizon there's also the reality of Palestine solidarity mobilization we've seen recordsized rallies in the last week or two uh in Dublin and other parts and and and throughout the EU which certainly threatened the centrist neoliberal leadership uh which has tried to destroy these factions politically we saw that with the coup against Jeremy Corbin for example so they're concerned about instabil political instability the center is failing to hold they must recognize that the rules-based order that they represent through the transatlantic relationship with the US has been completely discredited through their support their steadfast support for what I consider to be the Holocaust of our times and billions of people across the world see it the same way and just the institutional uh lack of credibility any institution in Europe that seeks to uh play ball with Israel including Euro Vision the singing contest where we just saw an Israeli perform and was the the the producers of Eurovision actually had to lower crowd noise during the performance of the Israeli singer so that viewers wouldn't hear the loud booze and they had to play a message before the singer declaring that uh that that that that we stood we still stand with Palestinians for justice and human rights just to kind of soften the blow and the insult to our conscience of featuring this ghastly display on stage uh institutional credibility is collapsing across Europe european soft power is completely collapsing and the European public whether it's on the right for their own reasons which may be more sort of nationalistic or on the left just no longer support the centrist transatlantic consensus and how much have these states um since October but also before October 7th profited from their complicity and I'm wondering if in a very crass sense they don't see it now as being profitable and that has anything to do with the statement for the Europeans I think the Ukraine Russia proxy war the Ukraine proxy war is much more profitable and we saw this surge in sales and their defense industry after Trump humiliated Zalinski in the oval office and threatened to cut off arms to Ukraine um then it became clear what part of Europe's interest is in continuing this fruitless war but of Germany is the second largest supplier of weapons to Israel and and when I say second largest it's close it's a close second to the United States that's not widely recognized so Germany is not only uh mobilized by Holocaust guilt and this historic relationship with Israel which is a way of getting off cheap on the Holocaust kind of displacing it on the backs of Palestinians there's also a material interest there i mean they supply Israel with everything from dolphin class submarines uh a deal which Netanyahu exploited to uh fatten his own paycheck or or you know increase his own uh coffers but also uh cruiser like fast boats cruiser class boats everything that's needed to maintain the siege of Gaza as well as tech so Europe is deeply invested in the special relationship with apartheid Israel uh almost as much as the United States in the United States you see like Elbit Systems the Israeli state arms company putting factories strategically in congressional districts in Texas in order to ensure total support they'll spread out their factories and then say &quot;We're producing jobs.&quot; And then the members of Congress will actually show up at Apac and say &quot;I thank Israel for employing people in my own district.&quot; And what are they producing baby buster bombs uh drones that soar into the skies of Gaza and explode children with the push of a button that's those are the job creators in places like Texas Colorado and elsewhere so it sounds it's not just Israel it's other countries that are testing their weapons on Gaza is that the case how can these companies be held accountable legally or otherwise one company that I think needs to be looked at with particular scrutiny is Microsoft and the tech industry in general in Silicon Valley because Israel's uh genocide in Gaza has been the most high-tech assault in history and it's using AI pioneering AI to do targeting in ways we haven't seen before i assume the uh assassination of Muhammad Senoir who had taken over for Yaha Senoir in a tunnel in Gaza was arranged through AI targeting that's how he was located there and 70 civilians were killed in order to kill him that's sort of been standard operating procedure for Israel kill 70 people burn them alive in their tents bomb an entire wing of a hospital bomb a school slaughter entire families in their homes in order to get one senior Hamas commander who's quickly replaced and AI is at the center of this who's providing the AI technology companies like Palunteer which specialize in it run by Ultra Zionist CEO Alex Karp but also Microsoft is playing a quieter but much more substantial role as uh do not panic a Substack account that tracks the tech industry's involvement with apartheid Israel has documented Microsoft has hired an array of unit 8,200 personnel from Israel's cyber intelligence unit which oversees these AI genocide programs they're honeycombed throughout Microsoft's offices microsoft's they've helped design Microsoft's Azor cloud hosting program which actually hosts Israel's Rolling Stone program which is Israel's program to maintain the entire population registry of Gaza and to track the population's movements in order to kill them in the same way that IBM helped Nazi Germany maintain the Jewish population registry inside Germany it's the same level of criminality the same level of complicity there's actually a company that Microsoft just signed a deal with called AMD this is a company that was started very secretly in the 1980s by Israeli army veterans and Israeli intelligence veterans and it has maintained a very secret presence inside the United States during the George W bush era AMDOX was suspected of spying on the White House and the State Department and a counter intelligence investigation was initiated although they ultimately cleared them microsoft has just signed a deal with AMDOC to maintain telecommunications services so we're witnessing that at Microsoft meta has hired hundreds of former Israeli army personnel these are people mostly on the military intelligence side and so through the tech industry we are witnessing a vast Israeli intelligence penetration of American industry and American society which can then be weaponized against the United States in the event of a policy change i mentioned the threats against Europe before these uh these uh developments need to be challenged from inside the tech industry by people who are working there there has been an enormous amount of activism at Amazon at Google and elsewhere google which just signed a $ 35 billion deal with the Israeli firm Whiz which was founded by Unit 8200 veterans delivering a massive cash cow to the Israeli state which was starving for revenue after October 7th so these have to be challenged from inside the tech industry it's important for everyone watching this to understand that if you recognize that what we're witnessing is the holocaust of our time in the Gaza Strip and you are in a position where you can provide information or blow the whistle about complicity with the institution you're working in it could even be a Jewish institution in the United States because you were able uh as a Jew to get on the inside uh or a tech company or you are a police officer uh getting offered training with Israeli police personnel wherever you are you have the ability to blow the whistle and it's time for people to start stepping up and use their positions as insiders to blow the whistle on this genocide and it really starts with the tech industry right and these companies they're documenting the quote unquote performance of these weapons that they're using in Gaza and so they are So um what happens to this information does it get sold to states to um for them to figure out how to carry out uh more military-led atrocities that's one of the keys to the productive sector of Israel's economy is that according to journalist Yotam Feldman an Israeli dissident journalist who produced a documentary I think it's about 12 years old called the lab about Israel's military intelligence industry about 100,000 families virtually the entire upper middle class in Israel has some role or some material interest in the arms industry and Israel's weapons um you know a lot of them are good for sure they are at least they're as advanced as American weapons but what the advantage that they have is that they can go to any weapons fair around the world and market them as field tested because Israel is constantly at war and now the field testing is taking on new levels that we can't even imagine including you know quadricopters that would will fly into schools and private homes and assassinate individuals uh who knows it's still like a matter of debate what was used to kill Ismael Hania inside Thran but that's certainly something Israel would seek to market they have all of these opportunities to carry out hideous and daring acts of violence because of the nature of their state uh the unstable nature of the Israeli state as it and the logic of Zionism which sort of requires them to be in constantly in conflict to occupy a population of restive indigenous people simply because they are not Jewish and cannot fit into a state which Netanyahu just reaffirmed last week is not a state of all of its citizens it is the state of the Jewish people so this provides a boon for the arms industry as well as intelligence like if you take a direct flight from Tel Aviv to uh New York or Atlanta or somewhere chances are you might be sitting next to someone who's on their way to train security personnel privately or with some um state agency in uh their knowhow and they're so revered within like the NYPD or within corporate uh with within corporations israel's car Israelis carry this reputation it's a reputation bathed in blood yes that's perfect segue for this question I have here which bears on Israel's reputation or what was its former reputation as being the quote unquote only democracy in the Middle East and of course that's been exposed as a myth um since October 7th but of course before that and before our interview today you had some very interesting observations you shared with me about uh the consequences for Israel or Israeli society long term that aren't really being addressed in mainstream media i'm wondering if you can speak to that like what is going to happen to Israel and Israeli society after if we can put it this way after the genocide ends or after the hostilities end in Gaza what are um people who aren't from Israel for example traveling overseas going to experience after something like this well domestically Israel is going to go through a major shift which will be brought about through internal strife uh kind of civil conflict i mean sitting here it's hard to even predict when this ghastly horror will end when we'll stop waking up and opening our Twitter accounts and social media accounts and seeing images of shredded children it just been going on for so long and I think many people expected that after several months of that it would come to an end because it's just seemed unfathomable at this point in human history that could take place for so long what can we attribute that to to Jewish Israeli nationalists that can be attributed to an what they call an iron society national resilience that they were willing to go all the way to total victory and what is total victory in in the within the realm of in the framework of Zionism total victory is ethnic cleansing it's the completion of the genocide the genocidal process that began in 1948 which can deliver them an ethno religiously pure state free from these indigenous contaminants and getting the people of Gaza out is a priority that majority of them are refugees they have a militant mentality they're not going to stand down like the Palestinian Authority in in Ramla got to get them out of there how can you get them out of there without just be having the will to slaughter them shooting and bombing children as a kind of hobby you have to have a deeply deeply right-wing messianic society particularly among the youth that are pushing the buttons that are doing the killing and through this transitional process that really was consolidated with Netanyahu's election in 2009 he's now the longest serving Israeli prime minister they have been under this kind of right-wing messianic regime for long enough to have reached the point where they can just keep the killing going on a societywide basis indefinitely and they will be able to get the weapons because of their vast powerful lobby and and movement throughout Western capitals from Brussels and Washington indefinitely as well they'll have enough bunker buster bombs for the next year so the their uh s their their their ability to shed blood was underestimated including probably by Hamas i I I mean I think the theory of change of toan alaka alaka flood on October 7th did not include this going on for this long uh they assumed some kind of deal would have been brokered but there's this is going to come with major consequences for Israel their pursuit of total victory of a final solution which I mean so many Israeli young people I spoke to just want it they they would say we just need to push the button and oh just I wish they would all just disappear and die and this is their chance but that will come with a consequence there's still a sector of Israeli society that does not see uh the that does not see that as a resolution that considers it to be even inhumane and believes Netanyahu sacrifice the hostages in order to maintain this messianic fanatical coalition and pursue total victory and keep himself in power for as long as possible they're going they're in the streets but they're going to be uh pushing to topple this government there's also going to be pressure from the far right faction the Kahanist faction which has gained so much strength through this war the bezel smotrix uh Benguier who he just had a speaking tour in the United States where he found a large audience for his genocidal ideas they're going to be vying for more power and we're going to see a contest in Israel for I think the what what could be sort of the terminal phase of Zionism after Netanyahu israel without Netanyahu is going to face a lot of turbulence because Netanyahu has sort of united a lot of these factions before October 7th he had prevented a major uh a major war like this he'd always tried to negotiate his way out of it and then he went fully into it but most importantly Netanyahu was the most important propagandist for Israel on the world stage ever and the most effective one spoke perfect English he's a product of the United States of a high school in Philadelphia of MIT went worked in Boston Consulting with Mitt Romney he's as American as any American president but he's also defined Israel and he has this direct link to Israel's mythology through his brother Yoni who died in the Intebia raid so there's no figure after Netanyahu that can stand in hisstead so I see turbulence and social strife in Jewish Israeli society beginning as soon as there is a ceasefire and Netanyahu leaves the stage on the world stage I think it's pretty obvious where Israel is going it is a it is a pariah and you have a generation of Americans and Europeans and people around the world who see Israel as the new Nazi Germany which is tragic for me because I mean what is Israel's national logo it's the symbol of my faith community they've turned it into a swastika a lot of Jews are disgusted by this as well look at polls of American Jews liberal American Jews they simply no longer support Israel it's it's only Jews who have come from a conservative background and are raised in religiously hermetic closed settings that tend to support it that so that conflict is going to grow in the coming years and it's not going to ever move back into Israel's direction so the only way out for Israel going forward is more warfare and more threats and bribery of its so-called allies who are actually just too terrified to cut it off we even saw Marjgerie Taylor Green one of Trump's key allies in the MAGA faction in Congress suggest that she could be targeted with assassination for condemning Israel's actions and demanding a cut off in aid to Israel for actually for for condemning Apac she actually tweeted that she said &quot;I am a happy and healthy person and I would never take my own life.&quot; So I mean they know it yes they know that you know every Western leader I think knows that they face the threat of assassination if they turn on this monstrous apartheid entity well hearing you speak about Israel right now it's so violent so hateful even when you talk about those persons that you met who want to press the button it sounds like this is beyond bad politics it's pathological do you think that's going too far to call it pathological yeah sociopathic it is pathological you would say yes i mean you really have to be a sociopath to bear hug Netanyahu as Biden did you have to be a sociopath to look at what's taking place there and not use your leverage and I'm hoping on a positive note it will impress on people the urgency with which they should engage in say Palestinian solidarity um or do something to stop the genocide and I'm wondering if you have any final thoughts or observations well these are troubling times i remember our last talk in Washington and we were talking about many of the same themes and again it's just so dismaying and somewhat depressing that we're that we're the way that we're having having these conversations is is is is within the with within the the just abominable framework of an ongoing genocide so I hope the next one we have is takes place outside that framework and we're able to form a more long-term vision of how to prevent this from happening again uh but it's still important not to to lose motivation and to keep hope alive certainly thank you so much Max thanks a lot for having me thank you" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] is Israeli intelligence funding humanitarian aid in Gaza and why israeli opposition leaders say some 140 million a month is flowing from the Ministry of Defense and Mossad into the Gaza Humanitarian Aid Foundation the prime minister denies it but is Israel financially profiting from and deliberately creating more deadly chaos in Gaza i'm Andrea Seni and this is the Newsmakers [Music] when Israel banned ENRA's crucial humanitarian work in the Gaza Strip it claimed other NOS's could replace it but didn't quite specify which eventually the newly created Gaza Humanitarian Foundation took over operations it's backed by a private US company and partly based in Switzerland where it's often tough to discern exactly where funding is coming from the GHF's opacity and abysmal performance have led to a number of resignations and ultimately the suspension of desperately needed aid so who and what is really behind this organization here's a look june 5th NASA Day an annual commemoration the day of the setback marking Palestinian displacement after Israel's 1967 victory in the 6-day war now catastrophic setbacks are hampering the delivery of food destined for the besieged enclave israeli opposition leader Ya Laid as far back as the start of May questioning the origins of funding for the new Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the cabinet approved the expansion of the operation in the Gaza Strip last night no one yet knows what the actual war plan is or what the words conquest of the strip really mean but there is one thing we do know this war is costing a great deal of money the question is who is paying for it enra the UN body traditionally responsible for delivering supplies to Palestine is no longer permitted to do so the Israeli government banned it claiming it had been infiltrated by Hamas and thefts of supplies were being used to prolong the war the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation an umbrella name for a private organization has taken over the task this direct aid to the population in Gaza bypassing Kamas is already changing the situation on the ground providing food directly to those civilians in need breaking Kamas hold over the population and has the potential to seriously harm the terrorists and the and to shorten the war but increasing questions of the source of money have grown into even larger concerns about whether the entire GHF is designed to fail on purpose it's been widely criticized by professional humanitarians because of its limited reach because of the limited nature of the supplies that it is going to provide now senior opposition politicians have alleged in Israeli news publications that the Israeli government even Mossad itself may be among the biggest financial backers of the private fund the GHF's mode of sending aid only to a small number of aid hubs within the territory forcing Gardens to travel long distances has also been criticized as ineffective as you can see all that's left here are body parts israeli forces tell people to move to so-called safe zones but the reality is there are no safe places shots fired by Israeli soldiers towards crowds in Gaza in recent days people desperate for food and medicine gazans say that the rush was because people were starving and wanted food for their children israel denied shooting into the crowds merely above their heads to control the crowds and just last week the American head of one of the foundations involved in helping create the GHF stepped down leading to sources claiming that the foundation would struggle without them in the last 24 hours Israel has suspended the GHF's operations june the 5th is Knax Day and history often repeats and rhymes is the private organization tasked with delivering supplies to gardens a serious attempt at private management of a humanitarian cause or a shadowy Israelibbacked organization designed to cause engineered scarcity a setback on the road to war's end yet again for Gaza so is the chaos of GHF's aid delivery by design and who is actually funding it well joining me now to discuss that and more are from Exit in the UK journalist Jhan Alfara from London research associate at SOASS University and author of an army like no other how the Israel Defense Forces Made a Nation Khim Rashid and from Washington visiting scholar at Georgetown University Center for Contemporary Arab Studies and author of Blind Spot America and the Palestinians from Bour to Trump Khaled Elgindi thanks all so much for being with me him I'll begin with you what is the government of Benjamin Netanyahu doing here and how cynical should the world actually be about how Israel is managing aid in Gaza now after banning ENRA well let's be practical about it the Israelis have never said anything that proved correct every single time that they um release a message to um the media it's a pack of lies so this is also a pack of lies this is not about feeding the gazans this is about reducing the pressure uh on the US and the west um when uh people all over the world are so angry about what they see happening in Gaza so um they have created a company uh in a number of countries uh by the Mossad the MSAD has created a company and is financing it uh and this was actually told us by Israeli politicians of the opposition uh they are not better than Netanyahu because they say Netanyahu is feeding the Palestinians uh with our money he should not do this and he should continue the war so in a sense um both the opposition and the government in Israel are about destruction are about genocide are about getting the Palestinians out of Palestine and first out of Gaza um and they use every lie that they can um and this system this this system is terrible as we can see yeah you were you were alluding to I mean mainly Avidor Lieberman member of the Knesset who's who's been trying to kind of spin this against Netanyahu by saying Israeli taxpayer shekels are paying to feed Gazins but when you say that that Mossad is behind uh this operation to what end is Mossad actually financing this it's it's not to make lives better is it does it make any any life better i mean basically more than 150 Palestinian were already killed probably more than that um waiting for to get food uh people who are um unable to walk great distances and and wait in the sun are not even able to get there most gazins will not be fed by this this is a PR exercise by Netanyahu to show that um this is not a starvation um campaign but it is a starvation campaign it is part of the genocide uh so um both the opposition and the government are just as nasty and just as responsible uh for what we are seeing okay i guess they can try to argue though oh that you know what it's well-meaning we're trying to provide age it's We're trying to provide aid we're trying to feed starving people but the logistics are incredibly complicated now you have these massive crowds uh that can't be managed people are storming uh the the distribution sites so they mean well they're trying to take the place of Anra but it's just logistically very difficult well ANRA and the UN said all the time that this is what will happen everyone every expert said this will be a killing machine um at the uh at the food aid um distribution and and now we see it happen um we were warned UN warned Israel uh that they shouldn't do it and they did it because that's what they want to do they want to create chaos yeah jan I mean do you believe that there is any intention at all via the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to help Gazins absolutely not um your guest just said that it was a PR campaign and that it is uh a way to reduce pressure on Israel and while I agree completely I think it's it's even more cynical than that it is actually being used as a lever to reshape Gaza's demography in general by force and it is a way to actually further their goals and to complete this genocide this new aid mechanism uh potentially involving Mossad uh which is entirely plausible is not just flawed it's actually dangerous it fundamentally violates the core humanitarian principles of neutrality um and uh and you know Smutz uh Smatri in his uh latest speech actually laid it bare you know uh he said that these aid corridors are not humanitarian at all they are strategic tools to ethnically cleanse Gaza by engineering displacement you know if you are creating aid dependency and only allowing aid to be controlled in specific strategic locations in the south so it's not even entire uh across Gaza uh while uh destroying homes you know refusing the return of people to their homes and now planning uh for the transfer of these people that get eventually concentrated in the south to third countries it's it's not aid it's it's an expulsion plan dressed in humanitarian language frankly and Israel has already set up an official body actually a directorate the directorate for the voluntary immigration uh of Gaza residents as they called it they don't they don't hide their intentions the question is will the world let them carry on uh with this genocide and empty Gaza out and and even the people of Gaza they don't see this as a they see it as another layer of domination and of control m Khaled you are in the United States part of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is is run by a somewhat shady at best I guess US company so try to explain if you can who in the United States is actually gaining from this what is the US gaining from this is it is it just an effort to undermine Hamas or is there something more cynical at play involved well I I agree with everything that both uh Haim and Jihan just said this is not about uh this is not well-meaning i think it's pretty clear israel's record in Gaza and frankly anywhere uh is has been pretty clear there is a you know in the words of most human rights organizations Israel has shown a blatant total disregard for civilian life um it cannot it's just strains credul to believe that after 19 months of destroying all of the sources of life uh all of the institutions and infrastructure uh that sustain life uh in Gaza um that now they're interested in in helping the the civilian population in Gaza um it is not about that it is about as Jihan said it is about facilitating their broader aims which is to move the population what remains of the population in the northern part uh to the south uh and eventually we can expect uh to to points outside of Gaza this is uh clearly a weaponization of aid in the same way that Israel has weaponized starvation um and uh if this were about uh uh the well-being of human beings well there are existing institutions and networks that have done quite a an amazing job of delivering humanitarian assistance all we have to do is look at the the uh the the weeks uh in which the first phase of the ceasefire plan um in uh in February and March until March 18th uh in which there were up to 600 trucks arriving a day uh and and there was no one going hungry during those weeks why the United States uh is backing this has to do with with Israel um the Trump administration like the Biden administration defers heavily to Israel israel's preferences uh are the most important consideration and so if Israel says they don't want Anoa or other UN or international agencies to operate uh then the United States uh reflexively goes along with that he let me come back to you though because you know the original foundation chief here Jake Wood was his name he resigned in May just after the the organization was actually founded then the Boston Consultant the Boston Consulting Group actually pulled its participation then you have Swiss diplomats dozens of them complaining about the Geneva branch of the GHF being non-compliant so as a writer yourself I mean do you expect all this to kind of unravel and eventually expose something even far more sinister than than what's been exposed so far it is already unraveling we don't need to wait it it is um um we can see that this is something set up by the Israeli Mossad to actually undermine the um UN ANRA and the Palestinian um um and and the Hamas and the Palestinian Authority because what happens here is first of all you can see on the screen u all the food is supplied by Israeli suppliers so this is a way of giving them some work and money um the money goes from Israel to Israel you know um the other thing is um that um the person John Moore um the evangelical Christian who is now the new um leader of U G GHF uh is um someone uh who is been a um a soldier for hire um for many years with links to the contraair this is all u a mafia um operation uh in order to um undermine the UN and as suppliers uh and to um make sure that they cannot supply there are thousands of uh lorries waiting to deliver food to everyone in Gaza and Israel will not allow it because uh as Jian said they want the um the concentration camp with biometrics that they have built in four areas of Gaza as part of removing the Palestinians from Gaza this is all about ethnic cleansing and and and about uh continuing the genocide uh it's not going to help anyone uh people some people the minority in Gaza will get food once or twice u people will know not get any food because they cannot get the whole way and wait because they are old they are ill uh they are babies you know this is really a way of decimating Gaza okay okay i' I'd like to speak uh further in just a minute about the the biometrics the iris scans that that you mentioned there but but Jana let me come back to you because if you can I mean tell us how this total failure of aid distribution now and all the corruption and you know to hear him describe it time again now as a mafia organization all of that how does it feed into your history as a Palestinian and correspond with you know today marking Naka Day yeah uh I mean look Nexa Day isn't just something that Palestinians commemorate on a day or another it's something that they continue to endure it's really the daily reality and what we're witnessing in Gaza today it's the sequel shall we say the the force displacement the military control the denial of very basic rights it's the same story just uh different tactics and when you know when Israeli officials like Smotri uh openly speak of um pushing Gazans out of their homeland and when uh these aid corridors double up as tools to force people further south uh then it is the NAKa and the Nakba all over again it's just now it comes with rebranded language it comes with 2,000 uh pound bombs and it is live streamed for the whole world to witness um from behind their phone screens yeah it's I don't have words anymore because the depths of the the destruction of of everything we've seen here is just it's now so far beyond description but Khaled now as as Kim mentioned Israel is looking at the use of biometrics those those iris scans we've heard about to to check those receiving aid what kind of door does that open here once that that technology is introduced well it's it's extremely dangerous uh we've already seen instances uh I think on the very first day u in addition to people being killed there were people who were abducted and disappeared uh people who were waiting in line uh for uh to receive their uh meager rations and uh they are clearly you know they are as part of the process they're inquiring about certain family members uh other members of their household uh of people who uh who are waiting in line um and trying to leverage that to to use the the the food distribution as intelligence gathering um and of course when you have a massive biometric surveillance operation in place that is tracking the movements of of every man woman and child uh in Gaza um that is not for the safety of those individuals uh or even uh Israel's security that is for control and that is uh ultimately for uh I believe disposing of of the population and and I think it's pretty clear and and frankly it's not even just you know fanatics like Smatri uh and Ben Prime Minister Netanyahu is saying it openly that there will not be a ceasefire uh until the world agrees uh to the Trump plan the Trump plan being the removal of the entire population of Gaza so he says it openly um they don't hide it anymore and and I believe this uh very cynical food distribution is is in furtherance of that uh ultimate objective yeah him you know the uh government spokesperson David Menser very articulately frighteningly articulately explained why uh Israeli security forces shot at crowds that were heading to a distribution center for for those meager rations you talked about he said that there were you know people remind us all among among these giant crowds of hungry people that were deviating from the crowd and then moving kind of toward Israeli troops and that they were warned to back off from these distribution sites but they did not and then here the Israeli troops had to fire in self-defense how is that playing out in Israel itself is is it still being bought as the narrative that every killing of a Gazin civilian is somehow in self-defense i think that uh less and less people in Israel believe this but unfortunately uh the Western media buys into this and and gulps it um as uh as truth um we've he we've heard him this is the official liar of the Israeli government um and he had been lying for 19 months and he continues to do that and they still invite him to speak and actually some of the people who interview him tell him that he's lying but he continues to lie uh this is about breaking the Palestinian people breaking their bodies breaking their morale uh making them um easier to export as packages uh to other countries uh other countries that didn't come and and offer it either so uh this is about continuing the Naka and the Nakba in uh a different more nasty way uh when uh yesterday in this interview of Mercer um he was asked um about the shooting uh and uh did these people that uh advanced towards the soldiers as he said um were they armed he didn't answer of course they none of none of the people we see on the screen are armed these are uh you know people that are trying to find food um they don't uh actually um fight um Hamas they fight the whole of Palestine which they want to empty not just Gaza but the rest of Palestine everyone understands it apart from the Western media you know Jan most aid workers in the region complained I mean dating years back now that these were almost impossible conditions to work in to try and get aid fairly to Gazins even when it was only described as you know an open air prison even before the October September 7th attacks but now you have countless people in need they are starving so how can any logistical operation even go smoothly enough to save the number of lives that need help right now is there a way do you believe do you have hope that there is a way to conduct such a logistical operation and that gazins can be saved if conditions were to change i think we do need to support a return to principled civilian humanitarian leadership un has done this really well un agencies there are many NOS's uh that used to do this um but more importantly we really do need to deal with the root cause the siege the occupation the repeated dehumanization of Palestinians because even before this you know this blockade of the past few months um I mean it makes you wonder like 80 and you know a year and a half of bombing Palestinians of children being obliterated to pieces was something that the world was able to tolerate but now suddenly after a few months of blockade of people going hungry the world is kind of shifting it's kind of saying this is a red line so bombing people and destroying their homes destroying the infrastructure destroying schools houses universities everything is being obliterated everything is being destroyed in the Gaza Strip that is all tolerated but now that people are hungry and we need to bring aid in that's the the the final red line i I Yeah I'm so sorry to interrupt but we're actually over time uh for this edition of our program but I'd like to thank all three of you sincerely so much for joining me so much appreciated and join thank our viewers for being with us

          <attvalue for="7" value="this is democracyow democracynow.org the Warren Peace Report i'm Amy Goodman we spend the rest of the hour with award-winning journalist and author Naomi Klene she has a major new piece out co-authored with Astra Taylor for the Guardian newspaper it's headlined the rise of end times fascism it looks at the apocalyptic fervor of the far right in it they write quote the most powerful people in the world are preparing for the end of the world and and they themselves are frenetically accelerating that is not so far away from the more mass market vision of fortress nations that's gripped the far right globally from Italy to Israel Australia to the United States in a time of ceaseless peril openly supremacist movements in these countries are positioning their relatively wealthy states as armed bunkers naomi Klein writes she's also professor of climate justice at the University of British Columbia founding co-director of the UBC Center for Climate Justice her latest book Doppelganger a trip into the mirror world naomi welcome back to Democracy Now it's great to have you with us if you can start off by talking about um your piece and what exactly you mean um uh by talking about um the end times fascism well it's very good to be with you Amy um this isn't the most cheerful piece I've ever written um with Astra Taylor uh a a a very uh close collaborator uh founder of the Debt Collective and we were trying to kind of map what is similar and what is different about the type of far-right politics that we're seeing today uh and I should say the piece is not only grim uh it also looks at what this can mean for a response to this particular form of fascism because we can't fight it if we don't understand it so I think a lot of very good scholarship attempting to understand authoritarianism today whether it's Trump or figures like Duterte or Modi um have looked at similarities between these far-right figures and say Mussolini or Hitler um and and have taken a kind of a checklist approach of looking at what is similar to the past right and I think there's a lot of value in that but the risk of it is that it doesn't uh it doesn't look at what is new and what is particular to our time fascism always is an attempt by the right to resolve a crisis of its own era right so in the 1930s they were attempting to resolve you know in Germany the humiliations of the first world war the impacts of the great depression um and to propose a unity in the face of that you for the inroup but our moment is different and one of the things that makes it different I mean if you think about fascism in the 1930s this is before the atomic bomb it's before they understood climate change and we are in a moment where our elites whether they admit it or not do understand that our economic model and I've written books about this and talked about it with you in the past is at war with life on Earth right um we and they are barreling down this road of more and more extraction of fossil fuels of all kinds of you know basically anything they can extract from this earth and turn into energy and money uh particularly now with AI which is a energy and re resource hog water uh uh LNG um critical minerals all of it uh so so we're trying to understand how this is informing the kind of fascism that we're seeing and also we're trying to understand what unites this kind of strange Frankenstein coalition that Trump represents where he's bringing together these uh you know the richest people in the world who have ever existed with you know many workingclass people so what binds the vision right and what we come up with in this piece or what we propose in this piece is that they all have given up on this world like they all they all have bought into a kind of apocalyptic fever right whether it's Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and their investments in outer space and sort of writing off this planet whether AI which is willing to sacrifice this animate world in order to build an artificial world or whether it's the more populist MAGA vision of the fortress nation state right which is thinking okay um we know more and more people are going to be coming uh we know that disaster is on the horizon and I've listened to a lot of Steve Bannon for for Wright you know when I was writing Doppelganger and it's all very survivalist right it's you know all all the all of the the commercials pretty much are selling you know gold because the economy is going to collapse um you know ready to eat meals for 90 days because you never know what's going to happen so it it it sees the nation and the inroup as being inside the bunker and then it's exiling the outgroup to all of these um lawless territories that you've been covering on the show so it's not the same vision but what it shares is this apocalyptic fever and then of course all of it is following a similar structure like narrative structure to the biblical rapture and of course you have people who believe in that within the Trump uh uh coalition who are you know Christian Zionists like Mike Huckabe and Pete Hegsth who believe that the actual end times is coming and they think it's all going to go down in Israel and uh all of the horror that you that you report on so well and so committedly on the show you know these are all good signs if you believe in the rapture right because it means that the end is coming and the faithful are going to be lifted up to a golden city in the sky so you know what we're looking at is like the the the religious version of that story the the fundamentalist religious religious version of that story where you literally believe you're going to be saved and taken up to heaven or and but also the secular vision where your wealth protects you or your citizenship protects you and you get your own version of that golden bunkered city you mentioned Gaza and you just came from the Jewish Voice for Peace conference in Baltimore um where several thousand people gathered from around the country um our latest headline u the Israeli military calling up tens of thousands of reser as Israel's security cabinet unanimously approved plans this weekend to expand its assault on Gaza where Israel's already killed over 52,000 Palestinians and that's by far um an undercount for in the last 18 19 months israel's killed more than 2400 Palestinians just since it shattered the ceasefire in March um uh this comes as Israel's devastating blockade and food aid has entered its third months palestinian health officials say 57 Palestinians have already starved to death according to UNICEF more than 9,000 children have been admitted for treatment for acute malnutrition so far this year and aid groups like Norwegian Refugee Council blasting a new Israeli proposal to take control and distribution and put US security contractors in charge if you can talk as you so often do about what's happening in Gaza and the West Bank and what um the centrality of Israel in uh President Trump and the current US government although it was also the past president Biden's worldview and approach to foreign policy so I don't think there is a single answer to to understanding what what the driving forces are and this is what we're trying to get at is that there's a kind of an overlap of these different um apocalyptic worldviews some of them are religious and some of them are secular right so I think that people who subscribe to this like literalist version of of the rapture believe that all of this is good news in the sense that according to the story that they believe in that that the Israelites have to return to greater Israel those are the preconditions for the return of the Messiah they have to rebuild the third temple so you have this um convergence of interest between the religious extremists and the Netanyahu government who are absolutely committed to rebuilding the third temple they really want to do it they want to destroy Alexa this is why so much attention is focused on it um but then you know does Trump believe that i don't think Trump believes that i mean what he views for Gaza is he sees resources he sees money he sees a private you know reserve exactly um but you know this is what something I've been saying from from from the beginning i I think the the the interests have been fairly consistent in terms of what the end goal is which is a depopulation of of Gaza pushing Palestinians out whether through death or whether through forced exile whether through through through ethnic cleansing and under the Biden administration there was a denial that that was what was going on and under the Trump administration it's all out in the open so you know this is what is going on now what the what the reason for that is I think differs but this is what part of what we're getting at in the piece Astroni is that there's a confluence of interest in terms of what Israel represents some of the um the the supporters of the Trump administration in the tech industry are talking about wanting freedom cities for instance these these privatized corporate cities um and they talk about this as tech zionism um they they have a lot of admiration for the idea that Israel was created they say you know from a book um the Herzel's books um and they say well why can't we start our own country our own private countries why do we have to you know why do we have to abide by the rules of the nation state um so you know I I think part of the support for Israel isn't just our classic understandings either of Jewish Zionism or Christian Zionism Although that's absolutely going on it's also this idea of a very technologically advanced startup country right um uh you know Israel has marketed itself that way and a lot of these tech companies want to do that in San Francisco you know they want to push everybody out who doesn't agree with them who's poor have more needs um and create their kind of corporate privatized utopia uh so you know I'm not saying this is a coherent agenda um I'm saying that there's a lot of uh overlapping stories that that follow a similar structure and um and and share similar goals if that makes sense i mean yes i mean the overall issue obviously is hard to make sense of and most of Trump's supporters are neither wealthy nor are they Christian Zionists so why are they backing this whole approach well it's not clear the extent to which they actively back it but I think that they see a kinship in the ethnostate right because a lot of Trump supporters are becoming increasingly Christian nationalist about the United States and this has been you know carefully fostered by figures like Steve Bannon um and so when they look at Israel they see a country that is openly an ethnostate that is fortressing itself in a sea of its enemies um you know and they want to do something similar and they're sharing technologies they're sharing um you know legal precedents tools um so there's a you know there's a kinship and it you know and we we're seeing this now with India with its attacks on Kashmir following a you know using similar techniques um uh that you know Israel has used in Gaza so there is a kind of a solidarity of the ethnostates um and they are sharing you know they're even trading trinkets of you know golden pagers and swapping chainsaws you know this is something that we I I I think you know when you're inside um the crucible of it here in the United States under Trump it's hard to see the extent to which this is an international project on the right and they are influencing one another and what does unite them you know this whole fortress mentality is this hatred of immigrants uh you you have President Trump just saying uh he doesn't even know he's not a lawyer so he doesn't know if he has to uphold the Constitution he said right i mean this is what I'm trying to get at um about the awareness that we are in an age of consequences that when you don't act in the face of the climate crisis for decades after when when scientists have been warning you that more and more of the world becomes uninhabitable and lo and behold people move uh to try to find safety in the face of in the face of wars in the face of economic deprivation and in the face of ecological disasters and so that fortressing of the nation state and this is what I think um you know Israel's come to represent just as a very small nation that is extremely fortressed right whether it's with the high-tech walls the iron dome Trump says now I want a not an iron dome but a golden dome right um that that here um that all of this is is whether it's stated explicitly a military parade that'll cost tens of millions of dollars even as he uh slices es and dices the government on his birthday in June so the pattern is protecting the in-group and exiling and cleansing the out groupoups right and so that I think is is is you know if there is support among the MAGA base for Israel it's less out of a love for Israel than more out of an identification like they are doing what we want to do here you write um many things in your piece um and I just want to go to one of them uh you say in talking about um Musk's apocalyptic vision you talk about and also um detailing the end times fascism this whole issue of the rise of the city state the corporate city state I think this is a new concept for many they're not going to know what you're talking about in southern Texas star base just this group of people who are mainly workers at uh uh SpaceX have just voted to make a city right there yeah and we've had sort of I mean the idea of a of of a company town is not entirely new right um and Disney had Celebration Florida and you know that there are lineages to to this right um colonial line lineages to this you know I I I live in Canada which started as the Hudson's Bay Company right so it was it was a company before it was a country so there there is some precedent for this but I think what this is I've been following this out of the corner of my eye Amy because this is where the libertarians have been going for a while um there was an Peter Teal has been obsessed with this idea it's increasingly being called exit so exiting the nation and just starting your own country where you can set your own tax level you can set you can make your own regulations or not or not and countries and and and these little corporate countries will compete with one another to try to attract capital right so in a way it's an extension of the free trade zone right where it's and this is this is a a in a way like a denationalized country within a country but Trump started to float this in 2023 the idea that he would create 10 freedom cities uh on the campaign trail I don't think his base much knew what he was talking about but now you have all these lobbyists who fully intend to take him up on it and we're starting to see the beginning of this with the SpaceX city so you also write um about El Salvador's terrorism confinement center the notorious prison secut where so many hundreds of people um have been sent from the United States and at the same time in the last 24 hours President Trump saying he wants to reopen the notorious Alcatraz an island in San Francisco if you can talk about the prison as a model for what Trump wants to put forward and particularly in relation as we see motivating so much um to immigrants well this is an incredibly bleak vision so repression is always a huge part of any kind of fascist project right you need to contain the out group you need to disappear the out group so this part of it is not new but I think what is so worrying to me is that Trump was elected promising all kinds of things to his base right he was he promised to eliminate inflation he promised to bring these great jobs home he's not delivering on any of that so the sadistic part of his project is really all he has to offer right i think one of the most chilling things I've ever seen in the United States was Trump sharing that video at his 100 day rally of just pure sadism of just looking at prisoners as entertainment being shaved being shackled being paraded and he's not delivering on the price of eggs and he's not delivering on the jobs by the way because he's he's throwing all in he's going all in on AI so the jobs that are coming back are seem to be mainly for robots um it's not actually for his for his base and so this scales up the need for the sadism and and these spectacles right and and I think that that's what something like Alcatraz represents he he's he's a TV producer first and foremost right he's producing spectacles and the less he the less he has to offer economically tangibly materially the more he leans on the sadism uh you write the governing ideology of the far right has become a monstrous supremacist survivalism our task is to build a movement strong enough to stop them what would that movement look like or what do you see it's is being formed right now you know what we're doing in this piece by laying out the bleakness of the vision and when I say bleakness you know I think it's beyond something we've seen before because there's always an apocalyptic quality to fascism but fascism of the 1930s and 40s had a horizon like after the apocalypse people were being promised a future a pastoral peaceful little piece of land um where they could live out their lives you know even though Trump talks about a golden age there really isn't a future that that the base believes in you know and this is what I've learned by by consuming far too much MAGA media amy um they envision a future of endless war right this is why they're bunkering down this is why they're buying ready to eat meals to last this is why they're buying gold and crypto they think the whole thing is going down so and why Elon Musk is trying to have so many children at least 14 at this point but he's actually explicitly texted it saying &quot;We've got to do this much faster as he proposed to one of the women he has children with uh saying uh we got to start using surrogates.&quot; So they don't believe in the future is the bottom line um and that is you know I I think I've been in a lot of progressive spaces in recent months where we've talked about building these very broad coalitions including with people who we don't entirely disagree with i've never encountered uh a potential coalition more broad than the idea of how about if we believe in this world how about if we believe in the future because we're up against people who are actively betting against the future right not just actively betting against it but fueling the fires that are burning this world actively fueling it so I think that if we have the courage really to look at the bleakness of what they of what they believe in um which is an apocalyptic future then we have our work cut out for us of being the people who actually believe in this realm in this world in the beauty of creation and in of each other naomi Klein I want to thank you for being with us

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] [Music] since October 7th 2023 Israeli military raids and settler violence has surged in the occupied West Bank hundreds of Palestinians have been killed and thousands injured more than a dozen countries including the US have condemned the violence the White House has even announced sanctions against several Israeli settlers tens of thousands of Americans live in illegal settlements and many serve in the Israeli military people and power investigate the role US citizens play in Israel's occupation and settlement expansion hundreds of Israelis are attending this proar rally in Jerusalem supporting the bombardment of Gaza a far right settlers and American jeel Nationals since October the 7th there has been a spike in violence carried out by Israeli settlers against Palestinians and as a result the United States have said that they will impose visa restrictions on those carrying out the violence but some Palestinians say that this doesn't go far enough because the relationship between the United States the occupation and settlers runs deep in February 20124 after mounting pressure US President Joe Biden issued an executive order sanctioning four Israeli settlers accused of violence and intimidation against Palestinians since then more settlers and settlements have been added to the list but the US remains Israel's closest political Ally and continues to give it more military aid than any other country in the world Mr President you're meeting with our United War cabinet to lead Israel to Victory Israel has the right and I would add responsibility to respond to the slaughter of their people and we will ensure Israel has what it needs to defend itself against these terrorists [Music] if you could describe the relationship between the United States and Israel in one sentence how what would you say let's get Trump back in because he let's keep this broader let's keep I'm going say need the support of both parties they got to start thinking a little bit more like the enemies I mean the United States in Great Britain their forces are being shot at uh in the Middle East also and what are they going to let that happen we we have to we have to draw the line and say enough they don't understand restraint they don't understand negotiation they understand force and power so you smack them punch them in the face and knock them down it's different mentality in the middle eag we have children who are fighting for the IDF and and that puts us in a little different position as well since the Hamas attack on October 7th when at least 1,139 were killed and 240 people taken hostage Israel has carried out one of the most intensive bombing campaigns against a populated area in history so far killing at least 33,42 people and displacing 85% of the population there's been a lot of coverage about accusations of war crimes that have been committed by members of the Israeli forces do you think that there is an issue there for American Jewel Nationals to be in an army that has this accusation put against them the Israelis you know we're accused of war crimes whether whether we commit them or not we have suffered so many so many more losses of our guys and of our men and women in in in battle because we don't go in and carpet bomb the way they think we do why should that building who a death trap why should we send our guys in there just knock it down knock it down [Music] human rights groups accuse the Israeli military of collective punishment arbitary executions torture and starvation Israel continues to blame Hamas for its actions while the US vetoed multiple calls by the UN for a ceasefire and despite Biden's executive order Palestinians living under occupation say they face increasing restrictions on movement while settlers accused of violence enjoy near impunity settlers are Israeli citizens who live in the West Bank in East Jerusalem Palestinian territory which has been occupied by Israel since 1967 there are now around 700,000 settlers the 3 million Palestinians there are ruled under military law since October 7th more than 430 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or settlers in the occupied West Bank 29-year-old zachar Adra lives inaf Arata a collection of Palestinian Villages which have faced years of attacks and systematic Force displacement by Israeli settlers and the military on the 13th of October a settler shot him in the stomach he now has trouble walking and eating and is in constant pain there's a cell phone video of the [Music] attack for can you describe that moment did you know what was happening to [Music] you [Music] for Zacharia says the shooter came from the direction of havat on and legal Outpost in the southern Hebron Hills rights groups say it has a history of violent harassment of Palestinians yet according to recent media reports has received private us funding this isn't uncommon us residents have funnel millions of dollars of tax deductible donations into illegal settlements which violate international law and play a significant role in the expulsion of Palestinians from their land around 20 km North is heon City one of the starkest symbols of the occupation it's home to around 200,000 Palestinians and 1,000 settlers hagit ofran monitors settlements and their expansion for Israeli campaign group peace now in order to protect this small group of settlers inside the Palestinian City the Israeli Army sealed a whole neighborhood from the presence of Palestinians the heart of the Old City where you had all the shops are closed for 30 years already for Palestinians and there are parts of the streets that they are not even allowed to walk since October 7 the whole area became even more restricted for instance as I was walking up here I saw a Palestinian house where the roof of it is taken as a military post well so they just take over the roof of their home and they have a a military order it's called the seizure order and the commander is say I need this property for the security of the area and I take it temporarily so this family has to eat sleep go about their day while there is an occupying force on their roof sometimes it's not only on the roof sometime it can be in in the Next Room all of it is for the security needs suddenly our interview is interrupted so every time we do an interview we're met with soldiers they're sent here I believe to check if we're a threat or whatever I need to see your ID please you have authorization from the Israeli government to be here they know that we're here it's okay that you're telling me but we need authorization yeah but I'm just as well just so you the guy here not to film us they sent here a terrorist from El jazer we have to make sure you're not where's your accent from Michigan Michigan okay after checking our documents they finally left what was really interesting is I just spoke to one of the soldiers and he told me that he was from Michigan and a duel National how many of these settlements that you're talking about are funded by us residents we cannot really know uh how much money is going directly from funds or Charities American Charities to settlements there are many settlements that get funds from charities in America you can also look at you know the Americans give Israel x amount of of billions for our security so it frees ex amount of billions for other causes for Israel so you can say that it's indirectly support the the settlements do you think that there's any desire to try and limit people living on land that is deemed illegal internationally I don't see this still in the United States any big opposition to the very settlements what we saw is like the first step and I think it's not insignificant it is an important step and it puts a lot of political pressure within Israel and it's bringing the issue of settler violence to the headlines in Israel which is something very very very significant but of course this will not end the occupation the soldier we met isn't the only American in the West Bank according to a study by Oxford University released in 2015 60,000 settlers living in the occupied Palestinian territory are also American citizens they're playing a significant role in enforcing the occupation as we traveled through the city to meet Palestinians we witnessed just how difficult it was to move around there are many many Israeli checkpoints some denied us entry we're trying to find a different route to get to the Palestinian that lives in this area of heon high can we see the ideas please yes where do you how do you guys get in through the gate over there yeah is that an issue so this is the situation in heon now there's a lot of security and it's very difficult to move around over there it's called the red area but there's no signs on the gate there's literally none this is Asa he lives on the other side over here he's a local resident of Hebron told us that he was attacked after October the 7th he's now trying to communicate with the Israeli soldiers to see if we can pass through we didn't expect this to be the fast meeting sorry this is the reality so this is the reality of heon uh I am living here since uh almost 17 18 years you literally have to get through a dozen soldiers just to get to your home and people can't just come and visit nobody can come to visit me only the people who are living inside the area are allowed to come here so this is an occupied Palestinian Land by the Israeli settlers and they usually attack Palestinian families here and here they attacked us ASA Amro says that on October 7th he was attacked and detained by both settlers and Israeli soldiers and that in the days after his release he was also forced out of his home for weeks we put asa's claims to the Israeli military but we didn't hear back I was tortured I was almost killed I was coming from here to my house the way you you came and settlers in an arm uniform who are my neighbors I was kidnapped by them I was kept for 10 hours handcuffed blindfolded gagged beaten sexually assaulted they pointed the the gun and they put it on my head in count to 10 I fainted two times without any medical treatment spitting at me seeing B bad things to me they were celebrating torturing me for 10 hours continuously and you thought you were going to die I I said goodbye to everything you know I thought that it's my last moment and recently we've been hearing from the United States from some European countries that they are going to impose visa restrictions on settlers who were convicted of carrying out attacks what did you think when you heard this I can say that it's a kind of uh public opinion uh satisfaction the sers are attacking Palestinians are only four now in the West Bank there are 10 Palestinians killed by settlers directly what are they and many American citizens here that many American citizens they live here illegally inside heon as settlers they should take them to American courts and treat them as war criminals to be very honest they should be brought to the IC nobody was accountable for what happened to me and to many other Palestinians and the sers are not the only one who are attacking Palestinians the Israeli soldiers who are siters in an army uniform there are many siters joined the army and they kill Palestinians if you want really to make them accountable make Israel accountable the settlers they are backed up by the Israeli government they are supported by the Israeli government they are financed by the Israeli government so let's go after the Israeli government and stop them and dismantle all the Israeli settlements according to the international [Music] law the White House recently reversed Donald Trump's policy on Israel's settlement expansion declaring them inconsistent with international law yet organizations like the one Israel fund an American not for profit exempt from federal tax claims it's raised millions of dollars for settlements Kamas sent us a message on October 7th never again is now one of its prominent ambassadors is Gabriel boxer who regularly promotes and fundraises for settlements and Israeli soldiers boom shaka in February he also accompanied the Israeli military as it bombed Gaza wow that's all I can say right be behind me is hostile enemy territory that we learned what really they believe after October 7th we are now approaching the Cave of the M this huge structure is the burial place of the Patriarchs and matriarchs of the Jewish people it's also a holy site for Muslims the ibrahimi mosque in order to get around the Region's strict military control we met with David an American Israeli tour guide so what do you say to those in America who say that there should be more sanctions on even the funding of settlements by private us residents I think that the people who claim that they support the Palestinians are not aware of the facts on the ground are either being fed misinformation intentionally or imagining events that are not actually happening David takes us to ma alh its rare access to a highly secured and gated settlement which has received donations from the one Israel fund around 700 settlers live in the sprawling Suburban style luxury Community we're met by Gideon Ariel an American Israeli settler who's lived here for 11 years of different places here's my home watch watch your head when you uh pass by the flag that my kids fo up I'll let you leave the way this this is the view that uh that sold me on Mal my wife has a cousin who lives here and we would come from time to time for the holidays and uh one day her husband took me outside and said you see this house next door you can have it for 250,000 shekels which was a pittance in the time why is it important to live in a community like this well first of all why is it important to live anywhere a person lives where they want to live and this is as you can see a beautiful place historically God promised Abraham this is the land that is going to belong to you and to your children forever more right here in my backyard well it's h Shabbat tomorrow is Shabbat so my wife debah here is uh preparing for Shabbat deah BTO are you also American yeah every time I hear an American accent it's like I what's going on where am I we have people here from all different places of the world we have people here from United States from Russia from India from Germany from Ethiopia you it's just a small community of 100 there going be people watching who are going to say what the hell is a American doing in this land because they are all Jews we are all Jews who were exiled from this land about 2,000 years ago we kept that connection to the land all throughout those Millennium and now thanks to God we are coming back to our [Laughter] land if the United Nations says that there has been a significant increase in attacks from settlers and then also as this area was called by the United Nations an occupation that is a legal under the Geneva Convention then it is only right for the United States to take action how do you respond to that it is not illegal for me to raise my children here I'm not bothering anybody else this land never belonged to anybody else it was always state land we're going to decide what's best for us we've established a state which is thriving which is helping people all over the world and nobody's going to tell us what we can do or what we can't do I'm sorry Israeli rights groups say part of the settlement is built on private Palestinian land in a AUST around 500 M away settlers from an unknown location armed with M16 rifles were filmed physically assaulting a Palestinian farmer how would you feel about potentially having Palestinians live here this specific a community is a small community and it wants to stay a small community and we're also all religious Jews over here so not here but in other places yeah yeah in general however it's very important that Jews stay the majority and we even though we believe in democracy very much so we believe in the only place for Jews to live and call it their own the UN describes settlements and the displacements of Palestinians as a major obstacle to peace in the region at the heart of this obstacle are American citizens and groups like the one Israel fund one of the settlers accused of violence and sanctioned by both the US and the UK is by YF shown here on the one Israel fund website thanking them for donating a drone these are the guys who are really responsible for preventing Terror and saving lives and fighting the bad guys funding is often used to support Israeli paramilitary groups with surveillance equipment like drones vehicles and helmets missing a lot of equipment they needed before but now because of all the donations they've been able to receive a lot of stuff they wanted and thank God we will be improving the security of all Jud and Samaria so thank you all thank you very much in the US there's increasing pressure to explicitly ban the funding of settlements by groups like the one Israel fund who did not respond to our repeated requests for comment for now American dollars continue to fund settlements and soldiers while Palestinians like ASA bear the brunt of the occupation there's a drone up here just now do you think they know we're doing an interview what what is this Israeli settlers they have drones to film us to intimidate us to spy on us and now it's only on us they so they're filming us they are filming us now it happens almost every day whenever I have visitors I have uh uh journalists who are are here it's a kind of that we are watching you what do you think America needs to do America needs to uh work hard to punish the Israeli government government to punish the Israeli uh settlers leaders and to punish the Israeli uh settlement organizations and Nos and even to start with themselves first to stop the 3.8 billion dollar uh Aid to the Israeli military every year H and make it conditional on ending the Israeli occupation and ending the Israeli sitler violence and ending the Israeli AAR tide here and they should start with their own people to stop them from funding the Israeli settlers terrorist here it's really important that they should start first in their own countries according to their legal system [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="this was the scene on Tuesday afternoon at the displacement area of El Moasi Rafa tens of thousands of starved Palestinians throng to the place where the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had set up food distribution points we were made to queue inside fence lanes 1 m wide and 20 to 30 m long each after an hour and a half my turn came and I was handed a box but people were hungry and jumped over the fence to get the food israeli soldiers fired shots in the air the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation or GHF was created with backing from the US and Israeli governments to replace traditional UN aid agencies israel accuses Hamas of stealing the aid from civilians and says the new distribution model is meant to prevent that but UN agencies are critical and have refused to work with the new organization we do not participate in this modality uh for for the reasons uh that we have u given um it is a distraction from what is actually needed recent imagery verified by Al Jazzer shows how Israel made sure that three of the four distribution centers were set up near Araf in southern Gaza and only one towards central Gaza but none in the north alazer has also obtained images showing the inhumane manner people were squeezed into tiny spaces while queuing for aid the motive behind the plan according to critics is to force people in northern Gaza to move south to obtain food but once south they may never be allowed to return to the north they say Israel is weaponizing hunger and using humanitarian aid to facilitate the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians the hunger streak in Gazms say they have no choice we found people gathering flour off the ground so we went to this place and found humanitarian aid being distributed the distributing entity did not ask for identification or anything they just asked for citizens to take the boxes it's been over 88 days since the crossings were closed and we are suffering from severe famine on Sunday the executive director of the controversial USIsraeli agency resigned saying the mission couldn't adhere to humanitarian principles but despite international opposition and the chaos it has already created on the ground there is no indication Israel is about to abandon its plan muhammad Val also zooms outside in central Gaza's largest hospital in Dala tar there's very little water or electricity in Gaza even if people were able to get supplies how does that affect how much they're able to use well Rob even when people here managed to get their hands on humanitarian supplies the lack of water and electricity in fact turn these supplies into limited use items if not completely unusable altogether uh let me just give you a sense of what that means here on the ground it's very impossible to cook any dry food uh in Gaza including lentils rice or uh even pasta without having uh water and if you had water you would need also electricity or fuel source which have been both completely cut off entirely from Gaza and people started recently to resort to completely burning scrap wood or plastic in order to make fire and this has been completely very dangerous and unsustainable so it's not just about bringing aid to the Gaza Strip but what might come next i mean here the uh numbers of atrox that were sent to the Gaza Strip over the course of the past week remain nowhere close enough to meet the very widescale uh starvation here in Gaza and basically the Israeli systematic military acts on the ground that include the uh destruction of civilian infrastructure all kinds of electricity networks in Gaza and the systematic ban of water flow to the territory also adding layers and layers of complications regarding how aid will be used in Gaza because families have run out of all cooking gas and recently they started to walk for long distance in order to get one meal per day and at the same time they started to rely on the sole disselination water plant in Gaza that currently is operating uh uh by the uh solar panels after the Israeli latest decision to cut off the soul electricity the line that is feeding the entire diesel ship plant there so Gaza is still in Gaza with a very soaring humanitarian crisis and families on the ground still navigating unthinkable circumstances in order to survive the next day tar not only are they facing a humanitarian crisis of course the Israeli attacks are continuing there have been more of them in the last 24 hours just talk us through what the latest attacks have been well Gaza is still a very active war zone and Israel is mobilizing more troops in order to operate in multiple fronts in Gaza and over the past 12 hours we have seen a cleur strikes that had concentrated on targeting residential houses one of the deadliest was in Asawi neighborhood when a multiplestory building was completely flattened nine civilians according to medical reports were killed and 15 others were reported injured civil defense members are reporting horrific tales of how they managed to recover casualties from underneath the ruffle there as the escalation is continuing elsewhere especially in Der Balah where we are as the Israeli military targeted another residential house is not too far from our broadcast point here as six Palestinians were killed in the strike and there were earlier more today from the courtyard of Al Axa Hospital Ahmed a very uh chaotic and even uh desperate scenes of families being completely and physically broken following the uh following the loss of their loved ones and they have been wondering about whether this world will come to an end but the severity of the military acts on the ground and the ongoing escalation give a clear indication that there is no end in sight for this ongoing war as the humanitarian toll continues to mount day in day out d thank you very much indeed d A Zoom there talking to us from Adair Albala make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from

          <attvalue for="7" value="democracy depends on a free press please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org/g this is democracyow democracynow.org the Warren Peace Report i'm Amy Goodman with Narin Sheh we turn now to Gaza where more evidence is coming to light about how Israel has systematically used Palestinians as human shields in violation of both international and Israeli law that's the conclusion of a new investigation by the Associated Press based on interviews with Israeli soldiers and with Palestinians who said they were used as human shields to inspect buildings tunnels and other sites in Gaza and the occupied West Bank the AP reports the Israeli soldiers said the practice was used in part to spare combat dogs from injury or death one Israeli sergeant admitted to using Palestinians as young as 16 years old as human shields in February the news outlet 972 revealed how Israel used an 80-year-old man as a human shield troops tied an explosive cord around his neck then forced him to search abandoned buildings after he finished the mission he was ordered to flee but then another Israeli unit fatally shot him and his wife haratz and the Red Cross have also documented Israel's use of human shields the AP report is based in part on testimonies collected by Breaking the Silence a group made up of former Israeli soldiers opposed to the Israeli occupation the group's also released photos of Palestinians being used as human shields in Gaza we're joined now by the group's executive director Nadav Vimman he's a former Israeli soldier joining us from Tel Aviv thanks so much for being with us tell us what information you collected the Israeli soldiers you talked to and how exactly they are using Palestinians as human shields so Amy I've got to say that from the beginning of this war we got testimonies from soldiers that told us they they were ordered by senior officers to grab Palestinians next to them and to use them as human shields meaning that they were they were ordered to send Palestinians some of them were dressed up with IDF uniform cameras on their uh head or on their chest and then they were sent into tunnels and houses to check that there isn't any IEDs or explosive over there so the soldier could enter safely or clear the area and um we got testimonies from different units different times and different places in the Gaza Strip which shows as you said that it's widely spread this protocol and Nadav as far as you know how long has this practice been in place now um the first testimony that we have is from December 2023 meaning immediately after the ground invasion started and the last testimony that we had is from the beginning of this year beginning of 2025 just before the ceasefire and and it's something that the IDF is using more and more and more more units and more areas throughout the war and to what extent are you aware of soldiers resisting uh these orders to use Palestinians as human shields yeah so so it's interesting now every almost every soldier in the IDF learned about the fact that we used Palestinians as human shield during the second back then we called it the neighbor procedure when you come to arrest a high-ranking Palestinian or you know that he's armed so you grab the next door neighbor and you told the neighbor you knock on the door not me and maybe he will get shot and if nobody shot him then we told them get inside the house open all of the doors and open all of the lights so we will be more safe and that was banned by the Supreme Court in Israel in the end of the second father so the reserveist in the Israeli army grew up on that history that we did something it was bad but it was banned and that's it and now they got a command that is exactly that but I can say even worse actually right because he's dressing them up in IDF uniform some of the soldiers told us that it's maybe that they will be the target so they will get shot now the the thing is is that our testifier told us there was a debate inside their unit but it's our testifiers right i just read an oped in of an officer that served in Gaza and he said that almost every platoon is using human shields right so our testifiers told us there was a debate they came to their senior officers and told them hey you know that's we were trying to fight not to use human beings as human shields or that dea dehumanization of Palestinians or that's immoral or illegal or I don't know what but I cannot tell you what's going on in the greater IDF at the moment so explain the Dav why this is called the mosquito procedure and also talk about what these Israeli soldiers told you about what happens to the Palestinians many forced into houses buildings tunnels um that are suspected being booby trapped allegedly made to perform tasks like um looking for explosives uh in tunnels yeah so first of all a lot of things that uh the IDF has names for I don't know the reason but I can say that mosquito it's it's like it's a bug that flies in the air and like you can kill it who cares about it and that and that was the relationship a lot of times between the soldiers and those individual that were used and that's the word they were used right we have a testifier that called them a sub army of slaves now the the protocol is quite simple you need that individual with you for a period of time two days three days a week three weeks so it means that only when he's scanning a tunnel or an or a house or an alley so he doesn't have handcuffs or a blindfold the rest of the time when you're he's with you inside the house you need to feed him you need to take him to the bathroom uh but he's also handcuffed and blindfold so you need to help him in some unit there were um the mosquitoes inside the house were used to clean the house where the the soldier um stayed so it's not only you know don't only think about that time in the tunnel when they need to endanger their life think about the rest of the time the majority of the day that they they were living with the soldiers inside the house but again eventually they were supposed to be um released so it's um again I'm quoting that soldier a sub army of slaves and Nadav could you talk about the context in which this news has been coming out where there's mounting uh anger against Netanyahu protests all across the country yesterday uh for refusing to agree to a deal that would uh guarantee the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza if you could explain what the mood is uh in Israel uh the repeated calls for Netanyahu to step down you've said that he's acting like a dictator yeah so from the very beginning of this war we and other human rights organization we called for a deal to release our hostages ceasefire and enter humanitarian aid into Gaza now at the beginning we are we were a minority at the protest but as as this war it's hard for me to call it a war because as a soldier they told me that the war it's two armies fighting one another so is this intensive operation in Gaza went so long and we killed so many civilians and we lost so many of our soldiers and also we also some of our hostages more and more Israelis are resisting this war and if you look at polls in Israel at the moment you can see that the majority of Israelis meaning even BB's voters I believe are against the continuence of this war and pro- hostage deal and pro- ending this war and and you can see the atmosphere on the streets um what happened yesterday it was the 600 day uh of this uh operation or since October 7th and and we saw a lot of anger you know protesters in Tel Aviv took over the headquarters of the Liut party in Tel Aviv for a couple of hours right and they and they put signs they said it's the embassy of Qatar because of the allegation that Qatar paid for the close advisers of BB to support them more than anything else but but but I can say that what changed is in the mid mid-March when we returned fighting in Gaza when we continue bombing in Gaza and we broke the ceasefire and we stopped releasing our hostages the majority of of the audience in Israel understood that this is a war to protect BB's seat and BB's government not to release our hostages not to fight Kamas and not to defend our borders because if that was the case we will go to a hostage deal like um uh like Witkov help us achieve uh the minute Trump step into office now what we saw yesterday is more and more Israelis understanding that we are being lied to that our soldiers are sent to die and to be killed for themselves without any good reason without without releasing our hostages or ending this war i wanted to turn uh for a last example to the occupied West Bank israel admitting to strapping a wounded Palestinian man to the hood of an Israeli military vehicle during a raid on Janine relatives and neighbors of the man Mujahed Azmi said Israeli soldiers used him as a human shield instead of allowing him to get medical care after he'd been shot this is 13-year-old Alme speaking last year we told them we want an ambulance for the wounded person in the room so the army told us to bring him to them we got him outside and for about an hour or half an hour we kept asking for an ambulance then we called one 15 minutes later two jeeps came and they got in here the troops told us to turn around and not to look and they put mujah on the jeep's hood and took him after video of the incident went viral the Israeli military released a statement claiming the action was quote in violation of orders and standard operating procedures um Nadav if you can talk about how Israel is responding now to this latest news of this much more widespread use of exactly this kind of example now first of all I've got to say that IDF spokesperson a lot of times when they are confronted with something bad that soldier did that are against regulation they said it's against regulation we will educate the soldiers a mistake and that's it no investigation no nothing now I've got to say that that now the IDF announced that uh six investigation were opened after the IDF soldiers used Palestinian human shield in Gaza and it's a joke right because we have so many more incidents and even Yaniv Kubovich from Harit's newspapers published a couple of months ago that Helsi then commander-in-chief of the IDF was sitting in the meeting room while the mosquito protocol was discussed meaning that everybody knew now I've got to say that connects to something a lot bigger in the Israeli society and that's demonization of Palestinians right since October 7th it's even on steroids right we have government members that openly talking about genocide right when the head of the Labor Party Golan last week said that the right-wing politician likes to kill Palestinian kids and babies he was called as a traitor by our government you know we have ministers saying there isn't any innocent in Gaza that all of the Palestinians are assisting terror or terrorists by themselves and that sips down into the IDF into command that soldier are getting and if you connect that with the fact that we have more and more soldier officers and commanders in the IDF that comes from the religious rightwing or for the settler movement and believe that maybe it's a holy war uh not a war of defending ourselves you can understand why you have such a huge amount of those kind of incident dehumanization of Palestinians in in Israel uh became something so common that it also leads to this kind of practices inside the IDF nav want to thank you for being with us executive director of breaking the silence a whistleblower group of former Israeli soldiers democracy Now is funded by viewers like you please give today at

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] men have been fighting underground for centuries before gunpowder was even invented soldiers sneaked into castles through secret tunnels spies use them for getting in and out of fortified camps the ancient Romans used tunnels the Mongols used them Ivan the Terrible used tunnels to dig under the walls of the city of Kazan and bring it down so the tunnels under Gaza are not a new military challenge but they remain one of the world's most difficult it's actually difficult to believe that with all the modern technology and inventions that go into powering our 21st century War Machine something as ancient and simple as a tunnel could still pose such a big challenge to the world's most advanced armies in 2001 Osama Bin Laden outlasted a Relentless us bombing campaign by hulling up in the tunnels and caves of torab Bora even 15,000lb bombs and 100 air strikes in a day failed to break through let's look at the first world war armies on both sides were digging and counter digging Switzerland for example built an entire series of military fortresses under the Swiss Alps but the West also realized that regular soldiers could not fight at their best inside tunnels in 1914 the British army started getting in Miners and training them for military tasks Britain created special Bantam troops these were soldiers who were shorter and thinner than average in fact smaller size was one natural advantage that Asian armies had when they faced Western Invaders Invaders who were bigger in size strength and number tunnels became almost a symbol of resistance against a stronger enemy Japan used tunnels extensively to defend Pacific Islands against Allied invasion years later the Viet Kong fighting the US in Vietnam used tunnels to evade their enemies and launch surprise attacks and these were extremely effective attacks they cost the US heavily despite the fact that America had its own underground Warfare specialists in Vietnam they were known as the tunnel rats but the tunnel rats were up against a vast underground Network and an enemy that was agile inventive and determined the vietcong's network of tunnels was incredibly sophisticated they had armories hospitals mes hols manufacturing centers and storage facilities all underground and there were different varieties squads siiz tunnels which were generally less than 6 ft deep and 100 ft long there were company-sized tunnels which were WI rer but did not have too many compartments and then there were Battalion siiz tunnels which could be as deep as 50 ft underground and sometimes had up to four different levels many key connecting parts of these tunnels were as narrow as possible the walls were angled it was almost impossible for an American Soldier to fit through many of these tunnels and they were extensively booby trapped they were hard to spot from outside they had camouflaged airshafts disguised entrances almost imp pregnable even the B-52 bombs that the Americans dropped could not destroy many of the Vietcong tunnels and all of this 60 years ago so it's not difficult to imagine the level of sophistication that may exist in the tunnels beneath Gaza the tunnels under Gaza were built before Hamas had even formed and they were built by Smugglers who used them since the 1980s for smuggling goods under the the Egypt border most of the Earth in Gaza is rich in clay except near the coast which means that it's easy to dig through and does not need complex supports now over time the Palestinians realized that the tunnels could have a military use and they extended the underground Network Hamas expanded and utilized the tunnel system that they inherited with an eye to strategy and since they were operating beneath territory that they controlled they didn't have to worry about noise or vibrations alerting the enemy so the tunnels expanded quickly so much so that when Israel attacked Gaza in 2014 the IDF was stunned at the extent of the tunnels which was reported at the time to have surpassed 100 kilm Israel began setting up specialized units for underground Warfare fairly early starting with the combat engineers known as yaham set up in the '90s this unit was almost doubled in size after the 2 14 Gaza W that's when Israel really came face to face with the complex challenge of the modern Hamas tunnels now Israel has a commander unit called samur or the weasels they tunnel Warfare Specialists trained in undercover assault techniques leading the IDF when they enter the Gaza tunnels now the first thing to crack for Israel are the entrances to the tunnels these could be in the tens of thousands in Gaza most of them are hidden they're inside homes garage es shops warehouses under rubbish dumps and now probably under heaps of rubble now what Israel has been doing is using drones for 24/7 surveillance they're using Advanced software to analyze movement patterns and they're also using human intelligence from informers on the ground to build up a map of these crucial entrances they don't know it all but they're hoping that they know enough most of the Gaza tunnels have several entrances at each end so that if even some are discovered and blocked others will stay usable underground the tunnels are all interconnected so that even if one entire section is blocked off that may not make a big impact it's this interconnected underground web that Israel needs to map underground where GPS doesn't work satellite signals cannot reach Israel will have to fall back on magnetic sensors and INE movement trackers plus they can't use lights because that would give away their presence so night vision goggles are crucial and the US has been shipping hundreds of these to Israel preparing for just this battle underground in the darkness Israel's underground units won't have radio communication with the surface so again they may have to rely on Old School methods like field telones that's technology from over a 100 years ago Israel soldiers will have to stop at every Junction of the tunnel to map their positions secure the area and leave some troops to defend against counterattacks every time they find a shaft they'll need to figure out if the area above is controlled by Hamas or has been taken by Israel because an attack could come from above at any moment now imagine repeating this 50 times 100 times yes Israel has drones and robots but their movement is limited and signals underground may not be effective and then there will be the obstacles underground booby traps IEDs smoke bombs to suffocate Intruders may be triggered by motion sensors or light sensors Hamas has had years to set up hidden cameras underground detection devices to alert them of intruders and wires and cables that may trigger explosions if they're cut this means the entire section of the tunnel could collapse with one wrong move trapping Israel's forces it's not only Hamas who may use toxic gases underground Israel might also use chemical agents such as tear gas then there's the option of using water to flood the tunnels it's been used in the past Egypt for example poured sewage water into the smuggers tunnels going into Gaza from its side of the Border but this is such a huge tunnel complex that some experts have said there's simply not enough water in Gaza there's been a lot of Buzz about Israel's sponge bomb a device that creates rapidly expanding foam when triggered which hardens to form a kind of plug that will block a tunnel but the chemicals in this sponge bomb are dangerous ones and there have been reports of Israeli soldiers blinded after mishandling the bomb the simplest solution to many people may simp simply seem to be blowing up the tunnels but such a massive engineering feat during an active war is next to Impossible the whole of Gaza May quite simply [Music] collapse first there's the question of size there's no room underground to maneuver machine guns and rifles then there's the darkness The Flash after firing an ordinary pistol will leave Israeli troops temporarily blind especially especially if they're using night vision goggles then there's a question of space standing in a tunnel only one person can fire at a time at most two if one person kneels and the other person stands you're likely to be so close to the enemy that using something like a grenade could harm your own side as well the most likely option for the Israelis will be the smaller caliber weapons with sound suppressors that will prevent muzzle flashes again they'll be falling back on age-old weapons like knives tried and tested over Generations in hand-to-hand combat in this Arena every step could mean death" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] [Applause] [Music] relax heat [Music] [Music] hello and welcome to the West Asia Post i am Ready Francis coming to you from the heart of Beirut Lebanon and this is Won's weekly show where we bring you all things new from the most volatile region in the world from Gaza we are starting after back-to- back shootings further crippled the aid operation and further escalated the humanitarian crisis before we delve into that let's take a look at what's making the headlines across the [Music] [Music] region [Music] woo heat [Music] [Music] shootings and gunfires near aid centers have become the new norm in Gaza this is all happening while people are basically starving to death sometimes now why is this happening and why have the Israelis said that the routes to these eight centers are combat zones we tell you more [Music] gazms are starving there's almost no food the aid centers are deserted food items are selling at astronomical prices 1 kg of flour is selling at $300 one packet of butter costs $25 as per local reports a US-backed aid group is reopening two of its aid centers in the Palestinian enclave the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation says it is coordinating with the Israeli military for better coordination of aid distribution this development comes after the sites witnessed multiple shooting incidents killing at least 80 Palestinians and injuring hundreds according to the Hamas Run Civil Defense Agency the first incident took place early on Sunday morning when 31 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire another three people were killed by gunfire on Monday morning according to the International Committee of the Red Cross we only wanted to feed our children they're the ones who need food not us we're used to going without like during Ramadan that's why we rushed to the aid distribution site they tempted people with promises of help but in the end they opened fire why what did we do to deserve this again on Tuesday 27 Palestinians lost their lives israel denounced the claims as false reports claiming it only fired at suspects who drifted away from the designated route earlier today IDF forces fired warning shots half a kilometer from the distribution point at suspects who approached them and were endangering the safety of the fighters the incident is under investigation and also here we will arrive to the truth all three reportedly placed near an aid distribution center in the southwest of Gaza in the Tal Sultan area the facilities are part of a new US-backed aid system widely condemned by humanitarian groups aiming to bypass the UN which Israel has accused of failing to prevent Hamas diverting aid to its fighters but the UN and aid groups deny there is a significant diversion of aid to militants and say the new system which they have rejected allows Israel to use food as a weapon and violates humanitarian principles and won't be effective osher stresses once again um that after 80 full days of blockade on the entry of aid and any other supplies people in Gaza are starving this demands the urgent opening of all crossings and allowed unimpeded access for humanitarian organizations to deliver aid at scale through multiple routes and to all areas where people require assistance our partners tell us that more than 90% of families in Gaza lack the cash needed to buy what little food remains available in the markets israel has now banned Palestinians to travel on the roads leading to aid centers gazms now ask &quot;Is that practically possible?&quot; Thousands of Palestinians walk to the sites early each morning in search of a handful of food the scenes are desperate it remains unclear how aid agencies the new bagged aid system in Gaza will come to a common ground one that would revive Palestinians from famine iran and Israel are preparing for any eventuality if the Washington Tean nuclear talks don't get to a deal now Iran is focused on its uranium enrichment while Israel is carrying on air drills in our next report we discover how these arch enemies prepare for the battlefield take a look israel and Iran are gearing up for the battlefield gearing up for any eventuality if Washington's nuclear talks with Iran do not yield positive results independence means not waiting for the green light from America and the likes of America and not worrying about the red light from America and the likes of America un Atomic Agency has warned that Iran is stepping up the production of enriched uranium in the thick of its stocks with the United States it says Iran has increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% in less than 4 months the United Nations nuclear watchdog says that Iran's cooperation with the agency is less than satisfactory the the big difference here is that we are talking about 400 more or less 400 kg of uh 60% uranium it's a very high level of enrichment israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacted to the IAEA report saying that it was a clear warning sign that Iran is totally determined to complete its nuclear weapons program this is evident from the alarming scope of Iran's uranium enrichment activity such a level of enrichment exists only in countries actively pursuing nuclear weapons and has no civilian justification whatsoever the Islamic Republic accused Israel of providing unreliable and misleading information to the United Nations nuclear watchdog to be used in its new report in light of recent reports of an imminent strike on its nuclear facilities Thran is aggressively increasing the capabilities of its missile system ensuring that it has more nuclear capable weaponry in its arsenal recently Iran unveiled a new solid fuel ballistic missile called Kasimbasif which has a range of 1,200 kilometers thran had recently unveiled its underground missile city the country has drawn up detailed plans for five new missile bases these are heavily fortified underground military facilities that store maintain and can launch short medium and intermediate range ballistic missiles they form the backbone of the country's missile strategy designed specifically to protect key assets from detection or destruction during conflict this increased stockpile of weapons having a nuclear payload includes medium-range ballistic missiles such as Kuram Shahar Shahab 3 and Sil it also includes intermediate range missiles such as Imad and Gadr iran's defense minister Aziz Nasir Zadesh says Thran is ready to defend itself in case of an attack he added that Iran has no hostility towards neighboring countries but the United States bases in the region will be considered targets by Thran reports suggest Israel has been preparing itself to launch strikes on Iran's nuclear bases for months reports say US intel has gathered information regarding the movement of Israeli troops and ammunitions in the West Asian region israel has reportedly conducted air drills and is waiting for US President Donald Trump's not to attack Iran israel has even conducted strikes targeting Syria's coastal cities Flutakia and Tatus saying it struck weapon storage facilities containing missiles that posed a threat to international and Israeli maritime freedom of navigation according to a Reuters report Saudi Arabia's defense minister Prince Khaled bin Salman held a closed door meeting in Tehran with Iranian President Masoud Peshkan and foreign minister Abbas Arachi in April during the meeting the Saudi prince reportedly warned Iran that Trump had little patience for drawn out negotiations and that it would be better to reach a deal with the US than face the possibility of an Israeli attack if the talks broke down this situation raises a critical question will Israel proceed with unilateral strikes in Iran's nuclear program without approval from the United States still in Iran the Islamic Republic is recently facing tensions at its borderline with Pakistan now we have recently reported about the high tech wall that Iran is building along the Pakistani borders they recently removed the nationality from around 30,000 Pakistanis who had crossed over the wall now why is this happening on the borders between Iran and Pakistan we bring you the story spanning across Iran Sistan and Balojasthan and Pakistan's Baloasan the Iran Pakistan border is grappling with multiple challenges the highly poorest territory is susceptible to drug smuggling and terrorist activities despite maintaining a generally positive relationship both countries have often accused each other of harboring terrorists and failing to secure their respective sides of the border these concerns prompted the setting up of the Iran Pakistan border barrier that both nations agreed to in 2011 iran is securing its eastern front building high walls to safeguard its territory over the years Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatah Ali Kamini and top officials have sought to seal Thran's borders while maintaining designated crossings for legal trade and travel but despite the fortification project that is still underway the illegal crossber crossing is on the rise pakistan's passport and immigration department announced 34,000 undocumented Pakistani nationals have been repatriated from Iran over the past year 50,000 more were deported from Iraq many Pakistani nationals attempt to enter Iran illegally in an attempt to reach European and Persian Gulf countries for work and migration opportunities reports suggest as many as 135,000 Pakistanis have applied for political asylum in Europe and the United States over the past 2 years several countries including the UAE Italy the UK and other European nations have suspended student visa programs for Pakistani applicants pakistani officials point to the rising trend of Pakistanis overstaying while visiting Saudi Arabia Iran and Iraq for pilgrimage islamabad is now cancelling the passports of over 7,800 citizens who were deported from different countries for their involvement in beggar and other illegal activities abroad tensions along Iran's eastern border are part of a broader pattern of regional instability and conflict with Iran facing challenges from both within and beyond its [Music] borders now let's go to Turkey last week we reported about Razep Verdugan wanting to rewrite the Turkish constitution and this week we will report about his crackdown on opposition figures now he didn't stop at the mayor of Istanbul Imam Olu it's still ongoing take a look turkey's government continues its crackdown on the country's main opposition party amid growing political tensions five more mayors from opposition party CHP have been arrested the latest sweep includes three mayors from Istanbul and two more from the southern province of Adana the stumble Chief Public Prosecutor's Office issued detention orders for 47 people and detained another [Music] 30 the operation is the fifth wave of arrests against the government's political opponents starting with the jailing of Istanbul's mayor Erem Imamlu known as President Taib Erdogan's main rival in March imamlu's arrest on March 19 triggered the largest street protests Turkey has seen in over a decade despite his arrest CHP has declared Imamoglu as its main candidate for the 2028 presidential elections but his future in politics hangs in the balance as he is facing multiple ongoing trials and investigations erdoganal's administration rejects claims of political interference insisting the judiciary is independent prosecutors have opened an investigation into the leader of Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party on charges of threatening and insulting Estambul's chief prosecutor at least 11 mayors including Imamlu have now been removed from office as part of investigations into CHP municipalities istanul and a clutch of major cities fell to the CHP in 2019 with the opposition extending its control in last year's municipal elections chp won the municipalities of 36 of Turkeykey's 81 provinces in local polls it gained 37% of the votes nationwide compared to 36% for the president's party marking the CHP's greatest electoral victory since Erdogan came to power two decades ago the vote was seen as a barometer of Erdogan's popularity as he sought to win back control of key urban areas he lost to the opposition in elections 5 years ago the CHP's victory in Ankara and Estambul in 2019 had shattered Erdogan's aura of invincibility the sweeping crackdown against the opposition also comes at a time when Erdogan who has presided over Turkey for more than two decades as prime minister since 2003 and president since 2014 has been advocating for a new constitution that would put family values at the forefront the US is planning to withdraw all its troops from Iraq by 2026 but the question is will there be implications and is the Iraqi state ready to deal with the terrorist extremists threats we

group surged into Iraq's second largest city of Mosul members of the Iraqi security forces fled stripping off their uniforms after 3 years of fierce fighting near Baghdad Mosul was finally liberated

The Message In which he Journeys to Sagal Israel and the occupied West Bank and he's joining Michelle Martin to discuss what he found thanks Christian Tana Housey coats thank you so much for joining us uh thanks for having me Michelle I'm sure a lot of people know your previous work especially between the world and me but in this new book you go to three different places you write about your trips to three different places to sagol to South Carolina and to Israel and to the Palestinian territories you've already gotten a lot of attention for this book some of it quite heated it has to be said but I want to start where you start in the book which is synagogue I mean this is your first trip there you describe these feelings of real disqui while you were there sort of fear just sadness and a kind of a heavy can you just describe why or or what it is that you were feeling and why you think you were feeling that you know I'm I'm of the generation of of of children born in I guess the 70s maybe it started in the late 60s where it became popular to give your kids African names um and to really you know raise children with you know different views and different Notions of Africa and different ideas of Africa and and and that effort really was to overcome a a very racist telling and stories of of what Africa was and thus to justify uh treatment of African-Americans and that in turn was counted with different versions of um of of of History some of them themselves quite mythical um but here I was confronted with the real thing no more stories no more narratives this is it buddy this is actually what it is you know and I was going to be crafting stories on my own to say nothing of the fact which I actually think I took for granted that this really was you know um in some profound way as cliche as it is you know the motherland like I that was really where where I was going and so um I just I I I was terribly affected and maybe I was not totally prepared to be affected can I throw something out or were you afraid that you would be disappointed disappointed no because of the age I went because the age I went and and I understand why a lot of people are afraid by that but actually as I'm reflecting on your question maybe I was one of the things I I talk about is lurking in the back of my mind was you know what if all of those racist narratives were actually true you know that's terrible to admit you know but I certainly that was in the back of my mind and something that that was Haunting me I I you know I didn't expect to be you know welcomed with drums and you know welcome home brother brother yes no no I I didn't expect any of that that wasn't what I was looking for um but like I said this is terrible to admit perhaps I feared that I would not find um a city in dhar of of human beings that is a hard thing to admit so what do you think you found there that you that that is important to the the overall narrative that you're sharing in this book you know that the first I say and I guess we'll talk about this in a minute and the last I say are kind of in conversation with each other um when you when you've had a a horrific violent event happened to you such that it really you know breaks lineage and breaks time how do you reconstruct yourself um how do you reconstruct yourself in a way that is truthful reflects your ethics tell the stories that you you really feel like um embody your sense of justice I think there is great Temptation um when you suffer through an experience like we have and the humiliation that that that comes with it um to go completely in the other direction you know and maybe you know ignore some of the reality that actually makes you a human being synagog was really my opportunity uh to to to confront some of those stories and some of those ideas that actually I was I was raised on myself that are embodied in my very name actually in story I guess as you were as as you would say in story they were embodied in story and that story kind of infiltrated you in ways that you perhaps were not really aware of so then may of 2023 you visited Israel and the Palestinian territories so in the book you draw parallels between Jim Crow America and the Israeli occupation of these territories you called it separate and unequal alive and well you say it's a place where the glare of racism burned more intensely than anywhere else in your life that you had ever seen so tell us a little bit about why you say that you know there are two sides of me while there's a part of me that they you know does not like you know mixing it up and you know you know fighting with people there was also a part of me that says um there is something dishonorable and actually unloving about witnessing certain things that you think are important and and not saying anything about them the fact of the matter is I went to the old city of Jerusalem on two different times the first time I went in the way that typically Palestinian Muslims go and we were held for about 45 minutes uh by armed guards before they you know gave us entrance um there was no you went to Ala the Ala Al and you know no reasoning was given or or anything like that they just held us just because they could and then when I came back in the way that an American Tourist might come or Christian typically typically might come it was so easy I just breathed through it was the easiest thing in the world and this you know control of time and space extended out into the West Bank where you know there roads for Palestinians and then there roads for Israeli settlers which immediately set off my child you got two different rules for two different classes of people so that that immediately sets off alarm Bells uh for me you you know you're seeing in the territory and you can see one place where settlements are and where settlers live um and and they're marked in a certain way and then you can see other areas where they Palestinian Villages and hamlets and where they live and you can see that these are completely separate uh you go to the old city of heon as I've talked about and there's streets where I am allowed to walk down if it is made clear to the guards that my mother was a Christian that I am a Christian and that my grandmother was a Christian but my Palestinian guides do not have have access to that's just in brief what what I saw I saw much more but that sets off certain things for me and then I came back and had to do the reading and the research on top of that to understand the governance and and and and and the structures that are beneath that that make that possible and in some ways mandate that and I was left with the conclusion and in fact what I was witnessing was separate and unequal that it was you know the closest that I would see in my time to the Jim Crow that my parents were born into so is there a point at which you said to yourself I I can not only just see this I have to write about it and accept whatever comes with my writing about it in this way was there like a pivotal moment or was that always the plan that was always the plan but I Knew by saying I'm gonna like I I just knew I this is gonna be this is gonna be hard this gonna be what's hard so say more about what's hard what what is hard I don't like hurting people's feelings man I just I that sounds I'm kind of laughing but it's actually true I I don't like I don't enjoy telling people things telling people unpleasant things and it to to be really I guess direct with you there are people who I have had in my life who I care about um some of whom have been colleagues of mine you know I've spent very intimate time around um whose feelings this will hurt very very different view of the state of Israel than than I do have ties to it you know I I believe that what I witnessed was an immoral apar regime that that those are my conclusions that's what I say in the book um I don't take saying that lightly I I I would rather not feel like I have to say it but but but I did based on what I witnessed and what I read afterwards so your core conclusions are it's an apartheid regime the life there for Palestinians is unbearable it's unbearable it's demeaning it's to humaniz Ing and it's morally unjustifiable is that would that be that that would be correct that would be correct and and I just um you know I want to add two things to that the first thing is this this I know this word apartheid you know is is Harsh and it's one that FR yeah it tracks a lot of debate I don't want people to think that I'm just throwing you know that around casually um it was not just what I observed it was reading uh the the reports of Amnesty International where they made the case for aarth it was reading the reports of the human rights the Israeli Human Rights group uh betm where they made the case for a partti it was reading Human Rights Watch in their reports it was reading the reports of alhak it was actually doing that it was actually reading the words and the quotes of people like uh a former a prime minister ah ahud Barack or ahud Omar and them warning that Israel was in fact tipping into athe um that that is really what it was rooted in so I I know that is a heavy word for a lot of people but I don't want them to think that I'm just sort of casually you know lobbing grenades for the heck of it so let me go into just some of the some of the criticism of the work already the book is just out but a lot of people have already read it some of the criticism is you went for 10 days you went for 10 days this is a a nation state that has existed in its current form for 75 years at this point but this is these are people who have indigenous claims to this land for centuries you have two not just the Palestinians have indigenous claims to this land but also the Hebrew people the Jewish people have indigenous claims to this land and the these borders have moved back and forth for centuries this is one of the things people often criticize journalists for they say you go someplace for 10 days and then you're entitled to tell the world about it so what do you what do you say to that what what what I say to that is there there are things that we hold at at our moral quote that we witness that um context 600 word books reports even more time won't make okay uh I this's there's nothing that I can imagine that I will see that will make it okay that one group of people uh lives in a settlement and another group of people lives in a village and there is perhaps a half a mile between those two group of people and one group has direct access to water and the other does not um there's very little that I'm that I can imagine seeing there's nothing that I can imagine seeing that allows for a society in which there are tiers of citizenship and at the top tier of that is is a group of people be they Jewish or who whoever but in this case because it's Israel they Jewish who have the top tier of citizenship and everyone else is something less there's not something that I would have seen in in 30 more days and and I will add that even that criticism is familiar to me because in fact during the Civil Rights Movement what white Southerners would often say is you white Northerners who come down St stirring up trouble you don't know the Negro like we do you haven't been down here you don't live down here you don't really know what it is you don't understand the situation you don't understand the situation but if you ask the black folks there they would tell you you understand it perfectly you know um and so I just um you know I I get it I get that you know I would like to know more like to do more but I can't help but feel that if I had a different political perspective on this um the very people who are who are who are criticizing my just you know only going there for 10 days uh we would think 10 days were actually quite enough the other criticism is you did not in include in the book people who defend the government um in fact you criticize the idea of what we call what we have started to call both siding the issue especially in journalism but I still want to ask you about your unwillingness to include for purposes of this report other views because you know we are constantly being instructed especially in this very polarized time that that's fundamental to empathy and if we don't at least engage in that practice that we're not being true to that fundamental value of trying to see other people as human so how do you answer that the first thing I would say is um the uh pro-israel point of view the Zionist point of view um those who view the Zionist project as as as a good thing as a moral thing as a as a just thing uh they are not unrepresented um in the the uh the vehicles of American Media and our in our newspapers and our magazines and our and our our television shows that that Viewpoint is not unrepresented on the contrary it's one that I was very much exposed to and what the purpose of that last essay really is is I am someone who went somewhere and saw something and came back struggling with how it could be that what I saw was so different than what than the story that I was consuming in my media on on a regular basis and and and I really wanted to understand why and I thought that the way to do that my tool for doing that was to privilege the words of those who I believe have been you know unjustly pushed out of the frame and that is you know the the the the Palestinians um my feeling is that many of the Publications that would Lodge that criticism would do well to look at their own by lines and count how many Palestinians they've published over the past 10 or 15 years um and so it it is it is quite Rich to me that I am being criticized or that I would be criticized for not talking to people who would defend what I believe to be an unjust order you know in Publications that I think are actually part of how that order maintains itself when you don't allow people to speak when you don't allow them uh a place not just in your individual work but in the entirety of the conversation it becomes a lot easier to do things to them you know I I'm wondering if though you is the fundamental problem here that one Faith group is privileged over other Faith groups or is the because that is not unique to Israel Israel is not the only country that privileges One Faith group over another Faith group is the fundamental problem here that Israel is seen as different that Israel sees itself as different I just want to make sure I'm not excluding a very important group of people and that's Palestinian Christians uh who I you know I interviewed some of and felt as discriminated against as anybody else there's a there's a you know incident I describe happening in heon where I'm asked my religion but you know what was very interesting about that I was also asked my mother's and my grandmother's religion and when you start asking that you are asking something besides do I accept Jesus Christ as my personal savior there's something deeper going on you know there was great evil in this world you know and and and I I am wary of singling you know Israel out as somehow uh uh singular or more evil or or whatever but the point I would make is that I am responsible as an American and particularly as a citizen of a country that takes somebody like Martin Luther King as its patron saint that walks around talking about you know with great pride about the triumphs of the civil rights movement and equality how can I then go to a country where we boast about our special relationship with and see a two- tiered Society literally with citizenship is decided by ethnicity religion and rights are decided by ethnicity and religion and then just say you know what there's a lot of other evil in the world too and and turn my back I I just don't have that in me to do that before I let you go and I've been struggling to find this passage but it's this is when you were walking at yadvashem which is the memorial to the victims of the Holocaust you say that it hurts to know that in my own writing I have done to people that which in this writing I have invaded against that I have reduced people diminished people erased people I want to tell you that I was wrong I want to tell you that your oppression will not save you that being a victim will not Enlighten you that it can just as easily deceive you I learned that here in haa in rala and especially here at y vashem so this is another story about writing about power about settling accounts a story not of redemption but of reparation who are you talking to myself but I was talking to my students um I think that your imagination has to be slightly ahead and maybe even more ahead than the present politics and I think there is great great danger in thinking that because you lack power in a particular moment you don't have the ability to hurt and damage other people um I am not in that case making a narrow critique of Israel or of Zionism this is I think a very very human impulse to think that because you went through some horrific experience you therefore have a kind of moral Authority and are therefore then not capable of inflicting Horrors on other people um and as much as I feel like I saw that you know what I mean in my travels over there you're I mean I was talking to us too I was very much talking to us too um and I think that was like really important for me to say t hassy coats thank you for speaking with us thank you Michelle thank you so much [Music] [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="the IDF's Gideon's Chariots military operation in Gaza is now expanding idf chief Aal Zamir was with the troops in Gaza and said more territory will be captured unless Hamas agrees to release the Israeli hostages tv's Steve Lieuits reports the army says that combined ground and air force operations struck over 100 terror targets in the past 24 hours gazin officials say 19 were killed among the kamas operatives that were killed was the aerial commander for northern Gaza moata Deeb was responsible for planning and directing attacks against Israeli aircraft as well as launching drones that targeted Israeli civilians the army confirmed that Deeb was killed this week in an air strike other targets hit include terror cells a terror compound an observation post and underground facilities used by Palestinian Islamic jihad the Givati Brigade has now joined the fighting beginning a ground operation in Bethlehey idf Chief Aal Zamir was in Gaza where he said that the army will capture more and more territory until Kamas agrees to a hostage and ceasefire deal zamir said that the IDF was aware that a ceasefire could come at any time zamir took aim at those who have made accusations against the IDF conduct of the war amid the fighting the IDF announced that Staff Sergeant Danilo Moano was killed in South Gaza the 20-year-old from Cologne was killed in a building collapse after an explosive device was detonated thank you Steve for that report and Israel says around 93 trucks filled with humanitarian aid including baby food and supplies was brought into the Gaza Strip on Tuesday a significant boost from the five trucks that entered on Monday here's what else you need to know more aid continues to flow into Gaza although the United Nations is saying the aid has not yet been distributed after an 11-week blockade of humanitarian aid into Gaza with Israeli officials saying the aid helped Hamas the resumption of aid was made for diplomatic reasons five trucks entered the Gaza Strip on Monday and 93 trucks entered on Tuesday all which entered through the Karum Shalom crossing an official from the UN said the next step is to collect and distribute the aid through the existing system which uses several international organizations for distribution meanwhile the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation mechanism is set to open later this month for months testimony from Gazins has revealed Hamas steals aid and resells it at an extremely high value making it almost impossible to buy former Israeli officials tell ILV they worry there's no mechanism in place to prevent Hamas from stealing aid again the UN said on Tuesday they have not been able to secure the arrival of supplies into their warehouses and delivery points in Gaza the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Aid spokesperson said insufficient supplies is at a greater risk of being looted but does not mention Kamas's past involvement in stealing aid although the spokesperson did tell reporters looted products end up being sold at exorbitant prices on the black market and the US and Israel are reportedly facing differences in policy relating to both the Gaza war and a potential Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities iltv's Devo Klein has the latest cnn is reporting US officials saying that Israel is preparing for a possible strike on Iranian nuclear facilities on its own even as the Trump administration has been pursuing a diplomatic deal with Thran the official told CNN that such a strike would be a brazen break with Trump and could risk tipping off a broader regional conflict in the Middle East cnn said that new intelligence obtained by US suggests Israel is preparing to strike Iranian nuclear facilities it was not clear whether Israeli leaders had made a final decision and there was disagreement inside the Trump administration about whether Israel would ultimately decide to carry out the attack turning to Gaza where according to Axios US President Donald Trump is feeling quote frustrated by the ongoing war in Gaza and feels that ending the conflict is needed in order to bring prosperity to the Middle East a Trump administration official told Axios that the US pressured Israel to open the crossing for humanitarian aid after assistance had been blocked since early March and was reportedly upset by images of suffering children and babies axios reported an Israeli official responding that Prime Minister Netanyahu does not feel pressured on the matter by Trump the official went on to say that if the president wants a hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza he needs to put more pressure on Hamas thank you Devo for that report and as Netanyahu presses forward with an increased ground offensive inside of the Gaza Strip reports suggest Trump is frustrated with the war and wants Israel to wrap it up joining us now to discuss is former Israeli ambassador Yuram Edinger who served as congressional affairs liaison in the Israeli embassy in Washington and is a leading expert on USIsrael relations and the Middle East thanks so much for joining us today thank you it's my privilege so it seems as if the tone did a 180 degree flip after Trump visited these Arab countries last week when it comes to the war in Gaza what is making Trump so frustrated right now well I I suggest not to assess President Trump's position based on his talk uh it's much more important to judge his position in accordance with his walk and the walk has been very very positive on USIsrael relations while Biden withheld essential military systems and ammunition from Israel um President Trump uh provided has provided uh this items uh President Trump also uh did not react negatively uh when Israel uh took care of 11 of Kamas top leaders while he Trump was in the midst of his visit to the Persian Gulf supposedly it could have embarrassed him supposedly it could have undermined his visit but I have no doubt that Trump inside his hotel suite probably told his staffers finally Israel acting just like Trump would uh would do uh at the same time we cannot ignore we cannot ignore uh the worldview of President Trump uh which is not exactly compatible with the Middle East as he assumes that Middle East conflicts such as the conflict with the Houthis and with the Ayatollas and with Hamas uh are very similar to businesslike negotiation and while money talks uh in the west when it comes to business negotiations it's ideology that walks when it comes to the Middle East and negotiation that President Trump is eager to to conduct with the Ayatollas are perceived by him to be a step towards reconciliation but that Ayatollas view it as a step uh which is designed to bolster their capabilities and get ready for another assault on the so-called infidel west the great American Satan and the infidel Jew and last and not least we have seen President Trump being very much impressed with the Syrian leader with the Qatari uh leader and and again we should be very careful uh not to assume that you can approach the Middle East through Western lances the west welcomed uh Humeni back in 1978779 supposedly as a leader who wants human rights for the Iranian uh people uh a leader who is anti-communist and therefore would be very pro- US and we know that uh that leader became the number one epicenter of anti-American war terrorism uh the US also welcomed Bashar Assad in 2000 in a very positive way because Bashar Assad spent few years in Britain he's opthalmologist he was president of the in Syrian internet society married to a very modern Syrian lady educated in the US spoke few foreign languages and we know that he became a butcher a real butcher now Trump may be right about El Golani from Syria but I would suggest that before rushing into suspending economic sanctions and declaring El Golani a potentially peaceful leader I would expect American president to require the president of Syria to uh uproot all hate education in Syria before he uh gets those privileges from the US to uproot hate sermons from the mass to uproot hate uh media from the official uh media and introduced a United Arab Emirat like peaceful conduct once the Syrian does that obviously he deserves to be uh accorded a real generous uh treatment but not before that we have run out of time but thank you so much for your perspective today thank you and now President Donald Trump revealed plans for what he's calling the Golden Dome which he says is a cuttingedge missile defense shield that would protect the United States from foreign attacks similar to the Iron Dome in Israel the selected design comes with a hefty price tag ilv's Devoc Klein has the details at a press conference inside the Oval Office surrounded by space and defense officials President Donald Trump announced he selected a design for the Golden Dome missile defense shield system which he says would protect the United States from foreign attacks once fully constructed the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space and we will have the best system ever built as you know we helped Israel with theirs and it was very successful and now we have technology that's even far advanced from that trump said the system would cost a total of $175 billion and said it will be completed and fully operational by the end of his term calling it a state-of-the-art system trump says it will be utilized across land sea and space and will integrate with existing defense capabilities he says the Golden Dome aims to create a network of satellites to detect track and potentially intercept incoming missiles uh ultimately this right here the Golden Dome for America is game changer it's a generational investment in the security of America and Americans in a blow to bilateral relations with the leading ally the UK has announced a freeze on a trade deal in protest over the growing Israeli offensive in Gaza the government also placed sanctions on Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria itv's Steve Lee Woods has the latest we must coordinate our response because this war has gone on for far too long we cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve and the foreign secretary will come to the house shortly to set out our response in detail after the British prime minister's announcement British foreign secretary David Lammy announced the pause in trade talk the Israeli foreign ministry responded to the announcement of the trade freeze saying this even prior to today's announcement the free trade agreement negotiations were not being advanced at all by the current UK government the agreement would serve the mutual benefit of both countries if due to anti-Israel obsession and domestic political considerations the British government is willing to harm the British economy that is its own prerogative additionally the UK placed sanctions on a number of Israeli individuals and groups in Judea and Samaria who it said had supported incited and promoted violence against Palestinians in the territories the foreign ministry responded saying the sanctions against the settlers in Judea and Samaria are puzzling unjustified and especially regrettable after the recent deadly terror attack the British mandate ended exactly 77 years ago external pressures will not divert Israel from its path in its struggle for its existence and security against enemies working to destroy it israel bonds the heartbeat of solidarity the powerhouse of support when the Israeli Hamas war hit Israel bonds stood tall proving we're more than just an investment we're a lifeline israel bonds pledges to ensure Israel thrives and flourishes investing in Israel bonds isn't just a financial move it's a declaration for resilience strength and a better future for Israel join us and let solidarity echo through generations and the family of hostage Matans and Calker said they received a troubling sign of life from their son after they learned he was held with American former hostage Don Alexander while in captivity according to Israeli media reports new information suggest Zenalkker is struggling to stand on his own and is suffering from severe stomach pain and intestinal problems they described his condition as barely being able to stand mute and starving zincalker suffers from muscular distrophe and experiences muscle tremors and weakness so severe he cannot stand and testimony describes him as refusing to eat or speak and isolating himself as his mental health continues to decline reports say he is believed to be held by senior Hamas terrorists and is and is experiencing a lack of oxygen flea and rat bites and is eating moldy bread and contaminated water his mother told one Israeli outlet the IDF discovered a handwritten note from Zancauer in an underground Hamas compound the note included his full name in Hebrew and English his ID number and text in Arabic his mother confirmed it was his handwriting and speaking of tunnels as reports continue to detail the horrific suffering of Israeli hostages in them an Alazer reporter tooured an underground tunnel with Hamas terrorists in a video released on Tuesday al Jazer reporter Mustafa Sethan was led through a narrow tunnel by Hamas terrorist armed and with their faces covered in the video the reporter was guided with a blindfold on by armed terrorists into the narrow tunnel and is heard saying it was it was difficult for him to breathe they arrive into a small room where you can see the reporter barely being able to stand up completely in the tunnel he interviewed the armed terrorist who told him the tunnels are for quote temporary stay until Israel attacks them however one terrorist did say if Israel expands the fighting they quote will be found throughout the entire Gaza Strip now the terrorists say they had no shortage of weapons and that they're quote preparing ambushes to kill Jews and expel them from our land end quote that was all heard on Alazer and a unique educational movement is taking root in Israel's north and south where fields stretch wide and communities grow resilient the Adamava Adama schools translated as man and woman uh man and land are redefining what it means to uh learning by doing supported by Jewish National Fund USA these schools are cultivating more than just crops they're growing a new generation of young leaders grounded in Zionism sustainability and a deep connection to the land today we are joined by two students um Adho and Shahar Stalber to take you inside the classrooms and green houses where Israel's future is being shaped by one student at a time thank you guys so much for joining us thank you for being here i have seen one of your amazing uh campuses before tell me why you decided to join this program um I can tell about myself that I grew up my grandparents they met in the agricultural school Mikv is they've been together for almost 50 years now and I've always grown about their stories i've always learned about I have always seen their excitement when they're talking about their experiences from waking up in 5:00 a.m to go to work and agriculture or um being in a room with 10 other people always the the light in their eyes when they're speaking about those experiences is always something that brought me so much joy and I always knew that I will go somewhere that is similar like that and I started looking in in 10th grade I started looking for agricultural schools for something that will expand my eyes expand my seeing of the Israeli culture and I came for Danma amazing now you told me you're from Ramatan which is nothing like where the school is located which is in Arava literally right next to Jordan what do you enjoy so much about this program i love I usually I do nothing at home i used to go to school where you work you you don't work you learn from 8:00 a.m to 3:00 a.m to 3:00 p.m and you don't do nothing at all here in this school we wake up at 5:00 a.m we go to work we work in the fields with the farmers and after this we finished something like 11 11 and a half a.m and in 100 p.m we start learning we're doing the whole we're studying till 6:00 a.m and after it we uh have study groups we have dinner and study groups and there I remember both of you told me before we went on set you can't believe how much day you typically wasted before going to this program now you're farming in the mornings tell me uh briefly just one life lesson that you learned from this program and how it might have shaped um how you envision your life in Israel uh like I said you said earlier I'm from Ramadan which is a city and I've never even thought of going to a gap year before the army and doing something meaningful for the country for our people not only like joining the army straight after school doing something that makes the next to the people i never even thought of going to a gap year so now now in this school I thinking of it and I want to do it in my school again i want to be here till like five years not four years of of learning of high school oh it's amazing to see uh how much you you have learned and grown um tell us just how old you guys are um I'm 16 i'm in 11th grade i'm 15 15 15 and uh 10th grade wow and and for anyone out there who's interested just give me a brief sentence of what you would tell them about this program um like what you what your biggest takeaway so far h how much connection we how much the land especially in Israel means for our culture how much without the without the farmers how much without the community that it brings to us i remember David Benuan said where the that agriculture should be a part of the school system it teaches us so much about our life our work ethics it brings so much peace and connects us to nature so much more i think agriculture has so many different aspects big bring so much positivity into our lives and I think I know about myself that it really changed my my aspects a lot of aspects of my in my life we do important things we help the farmers that's something that goes and it last it won't last long if we won't help them and we're doing it and we're happy for it and we chose it thank you both for sharing that thank you and now the documents and personal items of legendary Israeli MSAD spy Ellie Cohen were re were recovered and returned exactly 60 years after his public hanging in Damascus

          <attvalue for="7" value="democracy depends on a free press Please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org/g This is democracyow democracynow.org the Warren peace report I'm Amy Goodman with Narin Sh We turn now to look at how criticism of Israel is growing in Europe as the UK pauses trade talks and the EU reviews its relationship with Israel That is this is British Prime Minister Kier Star speaking Tuesday But first Mr Mr Speaker I'd like to say something about the horrific situation in Gaza where the level of suffering innocent children being bombed again is utterly intolerable The recent announcement that Israel will allow a basic quantity of food into Gaza a basic quantity is totally and utterly inadequate So we must coordinate our response because this war has gone on for far too long We cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve Kier Starmer the British Prime Minister long an ally of Israel The British foreign secretary David Lami also condemned Israel's actions in Gaza in a speech to the House of Commons Prime Minister Netanyahu end this blockade now and let the aid in Regrettably Madame Deputy Speaker despite our efforts this Israeli government's egregious actions and rhetoric have continued They are isolating Israel from its friends and partners around the world undermining the interests of the Israeli people and damaging the image of the state of Israel in the eyes of the world Therefore today I'm announcing that we have suspended negotiations with this Israeli government on a new trade free trade agreement The comments of the British Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister came days after as many as 500,000 people took part in a massive march for Palestine in London to mark the 77th anniversary of the Nakba Meanwhile the European Union has announced its re reviewing its relationship with Israel We're joined now by two guests from Brussels Lynn Boland is with us a Irish member of the European Parliament chair of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Palestine And joining us from London British MP former Labor Party leader Jeremy Corbin welcome back to Democracy Now Um MP Corbin if you could start off by responding to the shift We just were in Gaza talking to a British doctor who's there helping uh the children and the people of Gaza saying that what Kier Starmer has done does make a difference Now uh you were certainly opposed to uh the prime minister It's so much of the support of Israel What is causing the shift in the British government's position it's pretty clear that the huge demonstrations in Britain and the outpouring of uh public condemnation of Israel's bombardment of Gaza has eventually forced the British government into a slightly different position in that they've now suspended as you reported the trade talks with Israel They claim to have suspended all arm supplies to Israel but we question that because we believe that parts for the F-35 jets are still being sold to Israel And we're also questioning the amount of arms that have been sold over the last few months But there's no doubt that the uh position of the Palestinian people being starved to death bombed to death in Gaza has forced the British government into a different position We are keeping up all the pressure we can in order to get aid in but also to end the occupation because that is clearly what the ICJ position is end the occupation of Gaza and of the West Bank Well let's bring in uh Lynn Bolan Uh Lynn you're a member of European Parliament Uh could you talk about and also chair of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Palestine if you could talk about the significance of this review Uh the European Union is of course Israel's largest trading partner but what do you think could come of this review given that there is no unanimous position uh within the European uh Union on Israel well I think for first and foremost I' I'd echo what Jeremy is saying is that the the only reason why the EU has announced this review and there isn't even a an overall like there isn't even a majority at the EU council level to review the trading agreement is because of the people power and the pressure that is coming on politicians right across the European Union and I'd encourage people to continue to do that Um but I would say that the time for review is long since passed So what we're calling for is to spend the agreement pending the review The review can take place They can do the the research If they haven't seen what everybody has seen on their phone is that Israel is not upholding uh human rights and article two of the trading agreement it should be suspended But we're calling for them to suspend it then carry out your review and come back with your findings But what we're fearing is that the announcing a review is like kicking it down the road It's I suppose addressing the people pressure but actually not doing anything concrete um to address the situation So we're also calling on MEPs right across Europe uh who are frustrated by the lack of of Europeanwide action to call on their national governments to end trade with Israel For example in Ireland we have what's called the occupied territories bill um which would cease trade obviously just with the occupied territories but it would be a significant uh message sent out that at least Ireland wants to be compliant with international law and we're encouraging MEPs across Europe to do similar initiatives in their countries And so Jeremy Corbin if you could talk about what sanctions the UK has already imposed on Israel and against whom and talk about the new inquiry You've been calling for a new inquiry into Britain's relationship with Israel If you could tell us what that's about Sure On June the 4th I'm introducing a private members bill into the House of Commons calling for an independent inquiry into the whole process of policymaking in relation to Gaza the West Bank and uh Britain's arm supplies to Israel particularly during the period since October uh 2023 This is similar to the inquiry that was headed by Sir John Chilcott eventually to inquire into policym surrounding the Iraq war My purpose in doing this is because the government has obfuscated on many many occasions over the past 18 months over the level of arms supplies over trade over aid over uh credits and so on to Israel and also particularly about the manufacturer of Israeli weapons in Britain particularly in Sheffield and other places where parts with the F-35 are made So a group of us in parliament have been raising this consistently The issue of arm supplies goes something like this Britain was a was and remains to some extent a supplier of arms to Israel David Lammy the foreign secretary suspended 30 arms licenses out of 300 that were in operation without ever specifying what these 30 licenses were And to be honest I still don't know what those 30 arms licenses are He claims they were over supply of weapons that could be used for crimes against humanity But we later discovered that many weapons have continued to be supplied And yesterday we published a report from Progressive International and other groups which is outlining the whole case for suspending arm supplies and pointing out the dishonesty of the British government over the past 18 months on this And that report is being circulated to MPs and will be part of uh the case I'll be making to the British Parliament on June the 4th The question of suspending the trade talks is an interesting one and a very interesting development because to some extent it is running in tandem in parallel rather with what the European Union is doing because Britain is no longer a member of the European Union We welcome that suspension There has always been the legal case against buying settlement goods because of the illegality of the settlements But it has been very hard to trace what are settlement goods and what isn't But actually a consumer boycott is gathering pace The members of the cooperative society a very big retailer in Britain with a huge me membership base across the whole country voted by 70% last week to request their board to suspend all purchases from Israel So no Israeli products would be stopped in co-op stocked in co-op shops And there's a lot of pressure on to the other big wreathers to do the same So there's been an enormous shift in public opinion And it's caused by utter revulsion at seeing emaciated children starve to death or dying on the operating theater where there's no anesthetics or even antiseptics to treat their terrible conditions they're suffering People can stomach no longer the sight of Palestinian children being starved and murdered by the Israeli occupation of Gaza MP Corbin the UK sanctioned violent western uh West Bank settlers but the British foreign minister Lami stopped short of targeting Israeli officials Can you talk about the um significance of those sanctions and uh what you think has to go further the sanctions themselves against individual violent um settlers are important and a good a good step forward So far the only sanctions apply to um Beny Netanyahu and Benny Gance who have um arrest warrants out from the International Criminal Court And Britain as a signary to the Rome Convention is required to carry out those arrest warrants should either of those individuals turn up in UK territory What David Lammy stopped short of doing was what many of us requested which is a wider sanctioning of officials in the Israeli government who've been a party to the decision making on the bombardment of Gaza Their names are well known but also of uh Israeli Defense Force um high command who are also obviously very much part of the decision-making process on which buildings to bomb and which buildings to blow up not that there's many buildings left in Gaza that are still to be blown up And so we are continuing that pressure So there's a big move in parliament on military equipment on demanding aid get in rapidly rapidly rapidly to Gaza um and also sanctions against Israeli officials And so changes are happening but it's desperately slow And already over 60,000 have died in Gaza Can I also ask you about your response to what happened in Washington uh all these young uh embassy and consular uh staffers uh from different uh consulates uh and organizations gathered at the Jewish Museum and uh a young man uh opened fire killing two of those who worked at the Israeli embassy Your response it's absolutely shocking Nobody should be shot Nobody should be killed at any event anywhere around the world That is not the way to solve the issue And so we have to be resolute in demanding peace for all and also recognize that um in the case of Britain and also in the case of the USA the big demonstrations in support of the Palestinian people are of Christian Jewish and Muslim and people of no particular faith And one of the biggest groups on our demonstrations in support of the Palestinian people is actually the Jewish block Uh Lynn Boland finally before we end uh if you could also respond to events here Washington DC the killing of these two uh Israeli embassy staffers and then the fact that within the EU it's France that's leading efforts for the official recognition of Palestine if you could talk about the significance of that France meeting Saudi Arabia next month apparently in uh uh New York Foreign Secretary Lammy has said he's also in talks with Fr France and Saudi Arabia about officially recognizing Palestine Um please Yeah And and just to echo I suppose what Jeremy has said and send my condolences to the family of the two who who were shot dead last night Um nobody should be losing their lives Um what we want to see is peace We want to have a a longstanding peace uh in Gaza in Palestine for the Palestinian people and Jewish people to be able to live in peace Um in regards to President Mcron and leading the the case for the recognition of the state of Palestine look it is very welcome Um Ireland and Spain recognized Palestine I think it was about a year ago You know Sweden some years before It is it is important It's a really significant step and I'm sure it be very much welcomed by the Palestinian people But for me the urgency within the EU now is ending the blockade is demanding the ceasefire And demanding the ceasefire means that EU countries need to stop supplying weapons to Israel So Jeremy was talking about Britain's role in in arming Israel We have countries within the EU who are significant weapons providers to the Israeli state if they wanted this conflict and this war and genocide to end tomorrow then they need to stop supplying weapons to to Israel Um and the F-35s is a critical part of that Um we also need to see the aid getting in and the aid needs to be delivered and and supported through UNRA Um and we're fighting very hard back at any push to to militarize the aid agenda And we're seeing Israel talking about setting up compounds where you know women would have to to to go to areas putting themselves in vulnerable positions people with disabilities children having to go and that Israel would decide who is deserving and who isn't deserving of aid Uh this cannot be tolerated What we need is UNRA to be allowed to do their job lift the blockade let the trucks in and deliver the aid to the people who so desperately need it those children 14,000 children who are at risk of dying from starvation in the next 48 hours That's where our focus should be Absolutely Recognize the state of Palestine But right now the people of Palestine need food They need medicine They need water And they need to stop the bombs dropping on them Democracy Now is funded

          <attvalue for="7" value="the Palestinian people are being starved bombed and forcibly displaced by Israel they're unlawful occupier the International Court of Justice here is another case against Israel in what could be a test of Israeli defiance of international law more than 40 nations argue its ban on the UN agency for Palestinian refugees is a breach of the UN charter so can the World Court hold Israel to account this is inside [Music] [Music] story hello and welcome to the program i'm Fib Batibbo on the first of five days of hearings at the International Court of Justice in the HG Palestinian officials have told judges that Israel is using humanitarian aid as a weapon of war more than 40 countries are arguing that Israel's November decision to stop all coordination with the UN agency for Palestinian Refugees or UNRA is a breach of the UN founding charter but however the court rules the result will be an advisory opinion that means it's a suggestion non-binding and Israel has shown in the past it has no issue ignoring international law so can the ICJ make a difference this time and will any decision made in Europe have an impact on the millions of Palestinians in Gaza struggling to find food under an Israeli blockade that's now lasted nearly two months we'll get to our guests in just a moment first this report from Laura Khan children among the huge crowds pushed to fill their empty plates knowing that food is running out in Gaza this desperate situation has been made worse by Israel's heavy bombardment and more than 2 months of its total blockade on food medicine and fuel to the strip the coming days in Gaza are going to be critical uh today people are not surviving in Gaza those that aren't being killed with bombs and bullets are being are slowly dying everyone is suffering from malnutrition especially the children what are the children eating they spend all day standing in the line at the food kitchen to get rice or beans and sometimes there is none in stark contrast to the streets are these empty distribution centers belonging to UNRA the UN agency for Palestinian refugees not only is it facing severe shortages but also Israel's total ban on its operations across the Palestinian territories far beyond the blockaded fences of Gaza israel is facing legal pressure at the International Court of Justice at the Hague monday's hearing goes beyond Israel's blockade of aid and examines whether Israel's ban on UNRA violated the UN's founding charter the court can only offer an advisory opinion but can carry political weight israel has long advocated for the dismantling of the UN agency it accuses some of its members of involvement in the October 7th attacks of its 14,000 members working in Gaza UNRA found nine people may have been involved and no longer work with them now the agency has been forced to shut down schools clinics community centers and Israel has revoked visas for international staff 66 back in the ICJ Palestinian representatives were the first to speak in the hearing this campaign of erasure was a central hallmark of the Nakba that started in 1947 and whose darkest chapter yet unfolding before our eyes and yours on three separate occasions in the past years the court issued provisional measures ordering Israel among other things to ensure and facilitate the unimpeded flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza israel did not comply weaponizing food and humanitarian aid and negating refugee issue and and their rights including by banning onora are prohibiting now the focus will be on the ICJ and UN states decisions as to whether they will defend the UN body or whether the hearing will result in further Israeli defiance of international law laura Insight story Alazer now let's take a closer look at UNRA the United Nations Relief and Works Agency was created in 1949 to provide assistance to Palestinian refugees there were 750,000 back then now 5.9 million Palestinians are eligible for UNRA support the UN agency runs schools healthc care facilities and also women's centers and micro financing unra doesn't just operate in the occupied territories it's also in Lebanon Syria and Jordan but it's in Gaza where the small strip has been bombed besieged and starved that the AY's operations are most needed and most in danger of complete collapse well let's bring in our guests now in Oxford in the UK Sam Rose who's the senior acting director of UNRA affairs in Gaza in the Canadian city of London Michael Link who's a human rights lawyer and professor emeritus f at the faculty of law at Western University and in Tel Aviv Gideon Levy who's a columnist with the Israeli newspaper Harets gentlemen welcome to you all thank you so much for being with us on Inside Story sam Rose if I can start with you um the UN General Assembly first asked the ICJ to weigh on Israel's legal obligations a year ago uh since then we've had tens of thousands of Palestinians killed and for the past two months there's been a total blockade of Gaza what are you hoping this new case is going to achieve what value do proceedings like this one uh have in the immediate thank you and thanks for for having me on look firstly we we hope that that we we welcome the case it's very timely but it's also increasingly and incredibly urgent we have been talking to the media advocating with member states every day several times a day for 18 months now about the plight of the civilian population in Gaza whose misery uh the inhumity and the cruelty and humiliation that they face is just deteriorating on a daily basis right now things are quickly going from very bad to to to worse the colleagues that we speak to on the ground the refugee communities that we speak to on the ground they have they have nothing this is beyond any level of suffering that we've seen in this most dehumanizing of of conflicts uh and conflicts in Gaza and Israeli Palestinian conflicts over the past 75 years so now is the time for the lawyers to deliberate but more than that now is the time for for action because we are running out of time to meet these needs of the population in Gaza which has immediate implications for them but longerterm implications for everyone in the region sam let me ask you what uh has the ban meant for UNRA the ban by the Israeli Nesset which uh came into effect in January last year what have been the real life consequences of that ban for the people who work for UNRA but also for the people who uh depend on on UNRA yeah I mean the ban had two elements to it one was banning UNRA's activities on the sovereign territory of of Israel the other element to it was prohibiting contact between uh UNRA and Israeli officials uh now I work for UNRA and I represent UNRA in in inside of Gaza so in theory of course the laws do not impinge on our activities inside of Gaza the the reality is is though that we have to coordinate and we have to communicate with the Israeli authorities on a daily basis to do our our work to bring the supplies into Gaza we're going through Israeli controlled borders and for our international staff to move in and out that has to be done in liaison with the Israeli authorities who control all the borders right now so I am speaking to you from Oxford because I as the director of UNRA in Gaza i'm not able to enter the Gaza Strip right now we still as as you said at the top have 15,000 colleagues working on on a daily basis but it impacts the ability of international staff to enter it impacts our ability to bring supplies in as well that also have to go through through Israeli controlled borders and of course we can turn to the situation in in the West Bank in a bit but the impact on our services in East Jerusalem for children for patients etc all right Gideon let me bring you into the conversation we we've have yet to hear Israel's defense in this case because it's absent from the proceedings at the Hague but we do already have an idea of what it's saying to try and justify uh terminating the agreement with UNRA and banning the AY's activities how is this new case first of all at the ICJ against Israel being viewed in Israel and does Israel's refusal to cooperate with UNRA uh represent a legitimate uh security concern or is it a part of a broader political strategy first of all Israel is not concerned at all about it because it's even hardly informal the hearing in the Hi it took me some time to find it in Israeli media out israel turned toward the world and this is just one chain in this behavior in this perception that the whole world is anti-semitic and therefore we turn our back to the world we don't participate in the Pope's funeral because he criticized Israel we are expelling an UNRA senior worker who lived here for 17 years married to an Israeli has three Israeli children she came to Israel for a short visit and they expelled her from the airport israel is doing anything possible to turn into a par state even by its own policy not only by the attitude of the world and this hearing now will have no effect on Israelis because for Israelis UNRA like the ICJ like the UN like any other international organization is anti-semitic and therefore we can we can only ignore their advices you know for so many times I asked myself what does Israel want you killed 50 55,000 people you destroyed Gaza what do you want now why not to give human aid to those displaced poor people what is the logic yeah it's an important question you ask Gideon no doubt michael Link let me come to you and and to this ICJ case and these new hearings there uh legally speaking Michael how does international law weigh a state's right to sovereignty against its responsibility to uphold human rights and international humanitarian law in other words does Israel today have any legal basis for blocking UNRA no i guess the short answer is and I think that's going to be heard all week long by most of the states and international organizations who are going to be speaking to the court um there are two legal issues uh both of them related to each other that are before the court first is uh what are the u privileges and immunities of the United Nations and it's very clear in the charter of the United Nations which Israel is bound by and but by the 1946 convention on the privileges and immunities of the United Nations that um the facilities and buildings and work of the United Nations in whatever territory uh of a state that they're in are to be absolutely protected and that includes obviously uh their presence in the occup by territory the West Bank including East Jerusalem and Gaza um so that's one of the issues in front of the court the other is the one that you've uh you've spoken to with with Sam is what are the obligations of an occupying power under the international humanitarian law and particularly the 1949 Geneva Conventions which is the beating heart of uh of IHL and basically you know one of the one of the absolute fundamental obligations any state has particularly in a zone of conflict or a zone of occupation you cannot harm the civilians who are under your control and particularly you cannot starve them we thought that was something that was all done with uh with the end of the second world war the creation of a modern body of international law and here we are 80 years uh after the end of the second world war and we see vast starvation deliberately imposed so what happens uh um Michael before I come back to you Sam what happens if it's found that Israel is indeed in violation of the UN charter what action could could the United Nations take i mean could the UN General Assembly decide to expel Israel as one of its members for example that certainly uh is something that may be on the table let's keep in mind that Israel is in defiance of more than 30 Security Council resolutions over the last five decades it's ini in violation of scores of resolutions coming from the general assembly and the human rights council um much less was needed back in 1974 for the United Nations General Assembly not to recognize the credentials of apartheite South Africa and indeed kept that state out of the organization for the next 20 years if Israel defies this again and proceeds with this man-made famine um then I think you're going to start seeing action by some members of the General Assembly to question whether Israel should continue uh its status as a member uh of the United Nations all right uh Sam uh your thoughts about what is likely to happen here and what you are hoping this uh uh this new hearing is going to achieve some countries like the US uh have said that uh uh perhaps if if aid is not delivered through UNRA that other UN agencies uh could step in uh what do you make of that and and would that undermine uh UNRA's mandate if other UN agencies were to step in and fill uh the void that that is being left by UNRA thanks i mean look we're hoping for immediate action given the urgency of of the situation inside of Gaza we also recognize how polarizing this situation is as as as as Michael alluded to and Gideon as as well uh but ENRA is the provider of key basic services in Gaza and has been for for 75 years as you showed in your in your graphic educating in Gaza alone hundreds upon hundreds millions over a million children have gone through through UNRE schools some of the most literate people in in the region in including girls everything's been reduced to a supply of aid and boxes of aid and and food parcels through a border which is both incredibly dehumanizing but also uh ignorant uh of what people need to to live a dignified life and yes WFP could quite easily bring the aid in to to Gaza they need UNRA's assistance to get it to the people who need it as as quickly as possible what we're talking about here are the the 16,000 people a day who go to UNRA's health clinics the 500,000 people a day who receive uh clean water who receive garbage collection services from UNRA these are systems that we've put in place with the support of the international community over decades and it's those that will not be easily replaced and that's the plight of the civilian population of Gaza if UNRA's services are further constrained gideon UNRA as uh Sam said there is the only UN agency specifically dedicated to uh Palestinian refugees and which explicitly maintains the political definition of Palestinian refugees so are Israel's attacks on on UNRA also part of a broader campaign perhaps to to erase not just the Palestinian suffering but also uh Palestinian uh identity and Palestinian rights altogether that right to return uh that is part of Unoir's mandate no doubt that this step is just as I said before one chain and it has a much broader context namely and above all to tyrannize the life of the Palestinian and to make them leave that's the wet dream of of Israel that's the way dream of the right-wingers in Israel and anything is permitted in this anything is legitimate to reach this goal i I don't see any alternative to UNRA and you know what let's say that Israel has its own thoughts about UNRA and they think that UNRA is destructive in the middle of the war after destroying Gaza that's the time to close UNRA this shows the real intentions and the real intentions is to starve Gaza to death not less than this how how domestic political dynamics Gideon uh within Israel shape its approach to to international rulings and and to these humanitarian criticism that it's facing right now as the late Kissinger Henry Kissinger once said &quot;Israel does not have foreign policy it has only domestic politics.&quot; And it's being quoted in the recent months again and again many of Israel's steps in Gaza have their sources and their rationalization in domestic politics and this is this makes it just much more outrageous because there is no strategic goal right now in continuing the war it's all about satisfying the right-wingers in all and the fascists in order to keep the government in power because otherwise it falls apart but we have to remember that it didn't start now it is part of the thought of Israel and be it right or wrong you'll ask any Israeli he will tell you the whole world is against us no matter what we do the world is against us and if he is against us it's his blame not our blame and therefore we can do whatever we want not to speak about the fact that we are the chosen people and nobody is going to tell us what to do that's the mindset all right thank you for explaining that to us so clearly Michael so then given that the ICJ is an advisory body and that Israel as we're hearing from Gideon there is unlikely to comply with with any ruling what do you think are some of the mechanisms or international pressure even that could be helpful here to to pressure to enforce any ICJ guidance that will come about as a result of of this latest hearing well you're absolutely right i mean the ICJ can issue advisory opinions as you've said these are non-binding but they are a very authoritative statement on international law by the most respected international court that we that we have um and the the ability of ICJ uh advisory opinions or rulings depends upon the political will of the security council to fulfill them and that's not going to happen as long as the Americans have a veto so I then I think we shift our attention to the other international court that's in the HEG the international criminal court where which actually does have teeth 125 states in the world are members of the uh of the international criminal court when arrest warrants are issued all 125 states are obliged under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court to arrest those but as we saw I mean the ICC issued arrest warrants against uh the Israeli prime minister Netanyahu and the former defense minister but that hasn't led to anything no and you're right with the the one trip that um Benjamin Netanyahu has made to an ICC member has been to Hungary um and not ironically enough Hungary is one of the two states along with the United States that is appearing before the International Court of Justice this week on this advisory opinion request likely to argue in in protection and in favor of um uh of Israel but don't underestimate the uh the scope of the of the ICC's power uh with respect to this most just to clarify just to clarify Michael could the the IC ICJ's findings contribute to further action at the International Criminal Court and other courts yes of course i mean what the ICJ does is paid attention to by the ICC and vice versa if and when the ICJ decides on the separate advisor advisory matter with respect to the application by South Africa under the genocide convention that is going to be paid by close attention to by the ICC with respect to the prosecutor's decision to perhaps expand the number of arrest warrants and perhaps to expand the number of grounds for which uh these Israeli officials will be charged with all right Sam let me come to you now and you know ask you about what next i mean the legal ramifications of this case are profound but there's also a real human cost here um how do we ensure that the people on the ground in Gaza in the occupied West Bank are not forgotten in these legal debates especially when international aid and resources as we've been seeing for the past two months are being blocked by Israel i mean it's a very good question i mean this is a conflict that has received unparalleled levels of of attention the the the pictures the images that we'll never forget said into our minds in terms of what's happening to the people we are committed as ENRA and the rest of the humanitarian community inside Gaza inside the West Bank to continue pushing those messages out to make sure that the needs the suffering the rights of the population aren't forgotten the civilian population and that there is accountability for wrongdoing on on on on all sides but look this will only be addressed through political will if there's political will to open the borders now to ensure an orderly and respectful immediate release of of hostages but to put this conflict on the path to to to a solution so that Palestinians can enjoy the same rights and freedoms as their neighbors in in Israel without that uh we'll just repeat this again and again every few years and if this conflict and it's shocking to say after 18 months is not yet a wakeup call to the world on this then I then I I dread to think what what will be Gideon Levy in Tel Aviv will that political will that Sam talked about there will it ever come in Israel no it will not come in Israel but the challenge the real challenge is for the international community There's a member state of the UN which banned which is banning a very important UN agency there must be some kind of consequences to this there is a member state of the UN which violates the international law on a daily basis there must be some consequences to it and the challenge is not Israel the churches of the international community which is hugging Israel again and again and preventing any kind of accountability and if this will continue there will be no solution the solution will not come from within Israel israelis will not wake up one shining morning and say &quot;Oh what's going on in Gaza is not so nice let's put an end to it.&quot; No it will only be when they will be taken accountable and will also pay a price for it by the international community so the challenge is on the shoulders of the international community michael Link where do you think the solution will come from and what will we get at the end of this latest ICJ hearing and could could also the states that provide military support and political support to Israel uh ultimately be held complicit uh under international law if the ICJ were to determine that Israel's blockade uh constitutes a serious violation yes look um well international law doesn't have its own judges and it doesn't have its own armies that depends upon the political will of the UN uh and its leading members in order to be able to enforce there is a huge amount of legitimacy attached to decisions by the international court of justice and uh the international criminal court so with this number of decisions that Israel has been defined from the security council the general assembly the uh previous advisory opinions coming from the international court of justice and obviously as well these arrest warrants that have been issued by the international criminal court israel's legitimacy as a fair-minded uh player in the international system is taking yet more hits uh with respect to this but it only will we will only end the occupation we'll only have uh the realization of the Palestinian right of self-determination uh when the international community becomes mobilized enough to u finally impose a cost upon Israel israel has had an occupation now for 57 almost 58 years with virtually no cost at all uh politically or economically for this only when Israelis wake up and realize gee now I need a visa to go to Europe gee the prices uh of our goods are now becoming much more expensive because of the increasing blockades or the divestment coming from the international community only then I think will you see a significant change in Israeli public opinion and perhaps then the path to Palestinian self-determination thank you very much gentlemen for

          <attvalue for="7" value="the 7th of October did not come out of the blue sky it came after 18 or 17 years of Gaza as a cage Gaza is the biggest open prison in the world and what did we expect will will grow there under this conditions if not terrible mutations no other way to to describe it of of people who came to murder to kill to to rape to to do terrible things now the killing of Gaza reports on a catastrophe is a new book from the award-winning Israeli journalist Gideon Levy who writes for the liberal newspaper has aretes in Israel he is one of the most outspoken and controversial critics of his country's war in Gaza and of its approach to Gaza over decades what he calls Israel's aparte policies against the Palestinian people in this book he brings together his on theeg ground perspectives of the events leading up to the 7th of October and the ensuing Devastation of Gaza Gideon Levy welcome to radio thank you for having me oh thank you so much for being here now Gideon you are a controversial figure in Israel and an Israeli because of the strength of your opinions against your own government's treatment of Gaza even after it started to become clear what had happened in Israel on the October 27th 2023 sorry October the 7th 2023 you wrote behind all this lies Israeli arrogance the idea that we can do whatever we like that we'll never pay the price and never be punished for it we carry on undisturbed the Gaza Palestinians have decided they're willing to pay any price for a moment of freedom is there any hope in that no will Israel learn its lesson no now not many Israelis or people in the media held or able to hold positions like that Gideon what makes you able to do so first of all it's very unfortunate that not many people in the media can hold those positions but for sure in Israel it is problematic because I covered the Israeli occupation for the last 35 years and I guess I saw things that no other Israeli was exposed to and you know my my positions developed throughout my my research my witnessing my permanent visits to Gaza and to the West Bank and what you see there you don't see in Israel and it's not shown in Israel so I think that much of my positions are due to to my trips to the occupied territories and witnessing the crimes and witnessing the brutality which is avoided for most of Israelis so you say this you say this in your book that that most Israelis don't see this you say that Gaza is hidden hidden from the view of the Israeli public and that anybody watching television in Nebraska or any news newspaper reader in Scotland is witnessed to more of what is happening in the Gaza Strip than the average Israeli viewer is that true does Israel really not know what's going on I invite you to watch Israeli channels and to read Israeli newspapers and you will judge by yourself it's weeks and weeks that Israel gets weeks it's now one year that Israel gets only a one-sided picture with information only about our brave soldiers and our casualties and the hostages all very important um facts obviously but there is also another people and there is also another suffer and in the last year the other suffer is so much worse than our suffer that it should be at least covered should be told many Israelis might might justify it many Israelis might blame the Palestinians for the OWN Destiny that's fair enough but not knowing is not a privilege of any intelligent person in a democracy and unfortunately most of the Israelis choose this option and the Israeli media is collaborating with this and I guess as a result of this uh you say that nearly all Israelis are united around this aspiration to punish Gaza um in its entirety and there's almost a lack of opposition completely to carrying on with the war and and list I imizing these extreme reactions yes Israel has a very devoted opposition to the Netanyahu government to Netanyahu in person Israel has a very vocal protest for releasing the hostages which is quite REM remarkable but there is no opposition whatsoever to the war and its cries this is hardly seen in Israel except of some very devoted groups but very marginal ones unfortunately Israel supports this war basically and Israel is not troubled by the crimes and the crimes are on a daily basis by the time we are talking now more and more suffer more and more crimes in Gaza in the West Bank and very little of it is reported to the israelies but I think Gideon certainly judging from the reaction that I'm already getting from listeners the idea that there is a context an explanation for what happens on October the 7th um you know from people in and outside of Israel who who've read and heard and seen what Hamas did on that day you is Unthinkable especially when we have families who have no idea what happened to their loved ones or or still where they are everything has a context and to deny the context means not to want to solve anything because without understanding the context nothing will ever be sto by saying that there is a context it doesn't mean that all the means were justified by all means not but the context must be understood the 7th of October did not come out of the blue sky it came after 18 or 17 years of Gaza as a cage Gaza is the biggest open prison in the world and what did we expect will will grow there under these conditions if not terrible mutations no other way to to describe it of of people who came to murder to kill to to rape to to do terrible things but you have to understand that this had a context and the context is the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and also Gaza in different ways and if you want ever to solve it you have to realize that there is a context yes there is a context but what would what would a proportionate response by Israel have looked like to you I mean some would say that the US responded in a not totally dissimilar way after 9/11 how do you respond to the biggest terrorist attack on your people within living memory so first of all I would offer to listen to President Biden who told Israel learn from our disproportional way or for our mistakes when we reacted on the N9 911 the American reaction after 911 what was tot out of proportion and at least the current president is regretting it same for Israel now the question is not the justification the question is first of all did Israel gain anything out of this one year of brutal attack on Gaza killing and destructing and punishing without any borders is Israel in a better place now is Israel a more secure place today than one year ago is Israel more beloved in the world than one year ago those questions should be asked by the Israelis and then should be also come the questions of legitimacy you know the fact that you are a victim of an attack does not permit you to do whatever you want there are limits there are legal limits and above all moral limits and killing 17,000 children is far beyond any limit and any justification so I to talk about the international reaction because you do say one thing needs to be clear without International involvement there will never be a solution Israel is not going to wake up one morning and say to itself or to anyone else the occupation The Siege and the aparte are not good let's bring them to an end so Gideon what should the International Community be doing and who if anyone do you see any signs of doing so so first of all the biggest leverage in is obviously in the hands of the United States the United States applied in this this year Israel with all the arms and the ammunition and the Diplomatic support that it needed in other words the United States told Israel go for this war be brutal as you want we will supply all you need all your needs for this and this must be clear because the rhetoric of the American Administration was the opposite one but rhetoric is one thing and policy and measures is another thing and Israel learned that the United States is behind this war and we have to realize that the United States is part of this war and part of the crimes of this of this war now what could the International Community do everything just let take a lesson from what the the International Community did Visa V the aparte system in South Africa look how just the voted and effective was the International Community when it dealt with the first first apartheid state now you deal with the second apartheid state and the world is doing nothing about it and this is not only a crime against the victims this is also very bad for Israel because Israel needs someone to to to repair it and it will not come as I wrote it will not come from within Israel Gideon leevy thank you so much for your time this morning the killing of Gaza by Gideon Levy is available now at the Times book shop. co.uk where times plus members can enjoy a 20% discount on that and thousands of other titles" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="well welcome to the 700 Club israeli fighter jets bombed Hezbollah drone factories in Beirut yesterday and Gaza has become even more complicated israel is turning to an unlikely source for help in defeating Hamas in Gaza julie Stall brings us the latest developments from Jerusalem israel has been arming a family clan sometimes called the militia in Gaza in order to strengthen opposition to Hamas israeli opposition leader Avidor Lieberman leaked that information to Israeli media and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not deny the report on the advice of security officials we activated clients in Gaza that oppose kamas what's wrong with this this is only good and saves the lives of IDF soldiers the publication of this only benefits kamas but Lieberman doesn't care the group led by Yaser Abu Shabbab has been documented operating in an area near the Kum Shalom border crossing that is under Israeli military control and where aid trucks enter Gaza it has about 300 members which Hamas sees as a thorn in its flesh that report comes as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has closed all of its aid distribution sites in Gaza for now saying they will be reopened later the sites were closed after shootings near the aid locations earlier this week meanwhile Israel has assured the US it will not strike Iran's nuclear facilities unless President Trump makes it clear that negotiations with Iran have failed according to Axios but in another sign that Iran is building up its military program the Wall Street Journal reports Iran has ordered material from China for hundreds of ballistic missiles president Trump says he cautioned Netanyahu not to launch an attack on Iran while talks are ongoing but Trump also said his stand could change with a phone call if talks with Iran aren't making progress in another show of US support for Israel Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced sanctions against four judges on the International Criminal Court saying they are directly involved in the Hague's efforts to prosecute Israeli and US nationals for alleged war crimes in Gaza the decision follows Hungary's earlier move to withdraw from the IC rather than arrest Netanyahu when he came to visit if you check the uh the voting records at the UN General Assembly you will find a few countries just a few countries from Europe opposing every and each anti-Israeli anti-Zionist resolution hungary is among those countries and in Lebanon Israel warned Lebanese civilians to leave specific areas before it struck Hezbollah drone production sites and storage facilities in Beirut and southern Lebanon used by the Hezbollah aerial unit the IDF says Hezbollah has launched more than a thousand explosive and reconnaissance UAVs at Israel since the beginning of the war the IDF says Hezbollah is working to produce thousands of drones under the direction and funding of Iranian terrorists as part of Iran's efforts to harm the state of Israel julie Stall CBN News Jerusalem well I'm sorry to report that the food distribution in Gaza has been shut down because of uh these Palestinian groups that have been armed and whether it's Hamas or this other group that was apparently cooperating with the IDF uh what they're doing is they're shooting Palestinians who are trying to get to the humanitarian aid and so the uh all the aid had to be shut down for the safety of the people you don't want to have a choice of you're going to be shot to death or you're going to get food it just it it just it's incredible to me that Israel would uh cooperate with some kind of militia gang in in Gaza on the theory that well the enemy of my enemy is is my friend and and we need some kind of counterbalancing force against Hamas this isn't the first time in Israel's history that this has happened as Israel withdrew from uh southern Lebanon back in the 1980s uh they had a similar alliance with militias in southern Lebanon that didn't work out and it's not going to work out in Gaza today there's a biblical precedent as well a king of Judah uh tried to hire other soldiers uh from Israel and in that a prophet of God came and warned them and this is the warning from 2 Chronicles 25:8 if you let them go with your troops into battle you will be defeated by the enemy no matter how well you fight God will overthrow you for he has the power to help you or to trip you up israel needs to be clean from this kind of activity not arming other militias in Gaza in some vain hope that it'll counterbalance Hamas the key for peace in Gaza is disarmament you that's not allowed to have weapons inside of Israel you have to be either part of the police or part of the IDF and that same standard should be the standard for Gaza we're seeing the aftermath of it where the humanitarian aid the food that was needed by the citizens of Gaza is now stopped because of this alliance let's not continue it i hope they shut it down and shut it down very quickly in other news one of the largest pro-Israel events in the US has been postponed indefinitely because of growing terror threats john Jessup has that story and more from our CBN news bureau in Washington john thanks Gordon the event called the Israel Summit was expected to draw more than a thousand people from across the United States and by live stream organizers had already uh had to move the event once because of threats israel Summit organizer Luke Hilton told CBN News what happened there were groups of jihadi Americans i mean honestly there's nothing else to call them because this is now uh spreading all across America calling to target quote target the Israel Summit and to target the venue and the organization that was hosting us and unfortunately because of this there was just no other option except to uh indefinitely postpone next week's Israel Summit um what it feels like is that Jews and Christians can no longer gather publicly in support of Israel and America despite postponing Hilton promises there will be a bigger better Israel summit in the US where people won't be afraid to come together to support Israel for more on this story and the full interview you can go to cbnnews.com well possible signs of a break in the war of words between President Trump and Elon Musk politico is reporting White House aid scheduled a phone call today to possibly broker peace between the two other political allies are also supporting a truce with Musk signaling his potential willingness to go along cbn's Charlene Aaron brings us this look at how the verbal battle escalated after months of solidarity and mutual praise between the two leaders the rift began with Musk's criticism of President Trump's big beautiful bill with both men engaging in a war of words on social media this massive outrageous pork filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination Musk posted on X Tuesday trump responding by saying Musk knew what was in the package i'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here better than you people he knew everything about it he had no problem with it all of a sudden he had a problem and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV minted but Musk says he was never shown the bill after the president said he knew what was in it musk who reportedly spent at least $250 million to help reelect Trump went on to claim &quot;Without me Trump would have lost the election.&quot; Something the president denies i think I would have won susie would say I would have won Pennsylvania easily anyway the president also posting &quot;Elon was wearing thin i asked him to leave i took away his EV mandate that forced everybody to buy electric cars that nobody else wanted that he knew I was going to do and he just went crazy trump also threatening to terminate Musk's government subsidies and contracts a move that could devastate the billionaire's bottom line tesla's stock sank Thursday on news of Musk and Trump's falling out in response Musk said he would decommission the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft a capsule used to take astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station but he later backed away from the idea musk also dropped what he called the really big bomb claiming that President Trump has ties to Jeffrey Epstein who was accused of sex trafficking musk didn't offer any proof but said the truth would come out when asked about the issue the president did not respond mr president the former head of Doge also suggested support for a new third party &quot;it's time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle,&quot; Musk wrote in a post on X meanwhile political observers expected a likely breakup between two such powerful personalities but maybe not in such a public fashion now many Republicans and conservatives are hoping that a reconciliation might be possible charlene Aaron CBN News thank you Charlene well right here in Washington the Supreme Court ruled nine to nothing Thursday that a Catholic charity in Wisconsin cannot be forced to pay unemployment taxes when other religious groups are exempt state officials argued the organization did not qualify for an exemption because its day-to-day work doesn't involve religious teachings the high court sided with a Catholic charities group after the organization argued the state violated its First Amendment guarantee of freedom of religion well locals say a move of God is stirring in upstate South Carolina and they're calling it the beginning of a revival it's bringing churches from across the state together for a big crusade this weekend cbn's Wendy Griffith has the story i believe you died for me evangelist Jacob Eversoul of World Harvest Ministry says something special is happening in upstate South Carolina what's happening right now is something that we couldn't even dream or imagine uh we give all glory to God uh people from all the way to from Greenville Spartanberg Anderson Gaffne honestly all the way to Myrtle Beach and even into other states North Carolina are getting word of this uh crusade that is coming June 6th 7th and 8th for 2 years Eversol has been holding events to inspire and equip the local church for this 3-day gospel outreach that he says is stoking the fires of revival people are getting saved in the highways in the byways in the prisons but not only getting saved um going on mission um getting plane tickets to some of our crusades overseas you know there's been prophetic words that the upstate of South Carolina would be a light unto the nations and uh we are starting to step into that now eversol an international evangelist who's preached all over the world said it was time to shine the light of Christ in his hometown the event starts that night June 6th at 7 but every night uh starting at 5:30 we're going to feed the city we're trying to feed you know 3 to 4,000 people per night it's something that the churches have come together to pull off it's a massive undertaking if you want to be a part of the gospel choir come early every night before 7 and we're going to worship together and what's so unique about this event is the unity congregations big and small crossing racial and denominational lines to preach the gospel literally churches from from Spartanber County the inner city uh where the crusade's going to happen have come together all different backgrounds denominations uh breaking down racial barriers it's the Lord doing it but it's it's it's it's definitely been something that we've worked very hard for their main goal to see as many people come to Jesus as possible and Jacob you're not finished after Spartanberg what happens after that so after Spartanberg we're heading to the capital of South Carolina uh and after that we we're you know we plan on hitting the 12 major cities all

          <attvalue for="3" value="A look into how and why international laws and principles are being applied and ignored in the Israel-Gaza conflict.&#10;&#10;The events of October 7 sent shockwaves across the world and brought to the forefront once again a conflict that has been ongoing for 75 years. The Israeli government’s response to Hamas’s attack was prompt – it embarked on a war of magnitude in Gaza, claiming it needed to take out Hamas and rescue the captives. At first, the consensus of Western powers seemed solid: Israel has the right to fight back against Hamas. But more than five months later, Israel’s military was facing criticism worldwide, including allegations that it is committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and even genocide.&#10;&#10;This documentary will explore whether Israel is breaking international law and, if so, why are Western powers, in particular the United States, silent.&#10;&#10;Edited by: Jameel Hodzic&#10;&#10;Subscribe to our channel http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe&#10;Follow us on Twitter   / ajenglish  &#10;Find us on Facebook   / aljazeera  &#10;Check our website:  https://www.aljazeera.com/&#10;Check out our Instagram page:   / aljazeeraenglish  &#10;Download AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile&#10;&#10;#aljazeeraenglish #palestine #documentary" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] it's an extremely cynical moment for international law it's an extremely devastating moment for the Palestinian [Music] people there are rules under international law and no matter which way you look at this Israel is in violation of those rules as of the 7th of October there is not one Norm of international humanitarian law that has not been violated I never imagined that in my lifetime I would see a genocide taking place in real time before my eyes the fact that it is being protected by most western governments takes it to a level that I just never imagined would be possible I come to Israel with a single message you're not alone you are not alone Canada will always be a friend of Israel and defend its rights including its right to [Applause] exist and Israel has a right to defend itself in fact it has the duty to defend its people as your friend we will stand with you in solidarity we will stand with your people and we also want you to win if one looks at our political leaders today and all of our mainstream politicians they are the most mendacious the most mediocre the least talented group of politicians that I can remember during my almost 60 years on this Earth it it is astonishing just How Deeply corrupt materially and morally they are because many of them be through donations to their political parties donations to them personally donations to their organizations like the labor friends of Israel the conservative friends of Israel the Democratic friends of Israel the Republican friends of Israel and the multiple and Myriad other organizations like that they provide an extremely good living for that person and for those political parties thank you for having me and uh I'm looking forward to having a thorough discussion about where everybody goes from here every day in the depth and bread of cooperation the West is intimately involved in Israel's genocidal campaign in Gaza for months we have seen us officials affirm time and again that there are no red lines for Israel using exactly that language uh when of course we know that international law draws many red lines and yet the US has come out in Stark opposition granting Israel full authority to proceed and to create As Much Death and destruction as it sees fit battle it's America's battle I'm shocked by the lack of action of the International Community I'm shocked by the hands raised by the US ambassador in the security Council voting against Asis fire vetoing Asis fire I'm shocked by the lack of action of principled States who need to take again a principled concrete stand against this aberration and start thinking of [Music] sanctions what we've seen is that the laws of war are used against weaker parties but if your ally is the United States and if your ally can veto any Security Council resolution and if your allies are the European States then the chances that the IC will bring you to Justice are very very slim the international court of justice is a court that renders guilty the losers in a conflict it is a court of the victors and a court that has double standards for the allies of the powerful and for those that it thinks of as its enemies The View that South Africa's submission to the international court of justice is some sort of anti anti-semitic screed and blood liel this is nonsense that you couldn't make up and the nonsense that is being enunciated constantly not just by the Israelis but that is then parroted by the US government the UK government the German government the French government Etc and this is being done to defend the indefensible to defend the slaughter of tens of thousands of innocent civilians to to defend attacks on Health Facilities on residential homes on places of worship on places of work we are seeing a genocide taking place in Gaza well truth the matter is if there weren't an Israel we'd have to invent one the truth of the matter is that I believe that you as I went home and said got in trouble it's the time but it's true you know you don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist you don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist it's the International Community and it's powerful member states like particularly the the us but in general Western countries which is still pilot and it's evident in The veto power that some member states can exercise within the UN three of those member states are from the West it tells us something no African countries has a VTO power in the United Nations system it's the entire system which is not fully representative of where the world is today but I would like to see this changing we need to think of better mechanisms not only inside the law but how the law is applied to ensure that there is no double standards so it's both a changing of the laws to so so that they uh address the current circumstances but also the institutions the judicial institutions that apply the law so that they don't apply it with double standards and we will continue to actively engage in the hard work of direct diplomacy on the ground until we reach a final solution the destruction of over 70% of Gaza the killing of over 30,000 Palestinians including 13,000 Palestinian babies and children the injuring of uh around now 70,000 Palestinians and the destruction of almost all of the civilian infrastructure in Gaza international law prohibits this completely we have to remind the world that there are at least in theory rules which Israel must abide by and which it is violating the IDF is doing anything they can in order to minimize the uh culties when it targets the the military targets but again we are in a war in a war civilians got H you will never see the IDF Target shoots down a civilian you will never see a group of children walking on the beach of Gaza and Israel Target them specifically or an old lady crossing the street and Israel shoots the old lady Israel does not Target civilians Israel targets military targets Israel targets terrorists and when these terrorists surround themselves with civilians with this little children with this old lady with this old people these civilians might get hurt but it's not on the fault of Israel it's on the fault of the one who surrounded himself with these civilians the one that use them as human Shields [Music] the argument of the human Shields of Palestinians in general being uh eager to sacrifice their own children as human Shields has been used and dismissed over and over the first one to dismiss this argument was Richard uh Goldstone the the head of the first Commission of inquiry over the first war in Gaza and it has been disproven over and over where is the evidence [Music] Israel's instruction to the Palestinians first to move South and then to move west and then to move north but basically that instruction which has displaced 1.8 million people tells the Israelis that any civilians that remains in that area or Israel assumes that any civilian that remains at that in that area is either a participant in hostilities and therefore can be killed or a human shield namely someone that is being used to Shield a legitimate military Target and that allows Israel to relax the repertoar of Le lethal violence that it uses against these people and in a court of law that can be used to justify the wholesale killing of civilians Israel does more than even it's required it drops fly uh over Gaza to tell the people to vacate the area it makes phone calls to residential um civilians to vacate the area uh Israel calls to vacate the area once Israel took this precautions it's allowed to take down the building [Music] if civilians prefer to stay they take the uh their own [Applause] responsibility this is a complete Distortion of international law if you consider also the fact that Israel is an occupier which I think is the relevant legal framing here Israel has obligations under occupation law um not only to end the occupation which has now been ongoing for 56 years but also to protect the occupied people and we also know that Israel has no right to claim self-defense in accordance with article 51 of the UN Charter with respect to attacks emanating from a territory that it occupies and this notion was upheld by the international court of justice in its 2004 ruling on the legality of the wall and so regardless of which way you look at this there is absolutely no legal defense to committing a [Music] genocide andal and Mazon and [Music] M we have the president of the state saying there's no innocent civilian or there's no uninvolved civilian in the Gaza Strip so these kind of remarks do point at it intent and the if if it gets to a court of law then these kinds of remarks become very important in terms of the genocidal aspect of this war a lot of people in Israel will not feel bad for the Palestinians but yet the leadership in Israel feels for the Palestinian people and they allow whatever the minimal uh humanitarian Aid to be provided to the population in Gaza [Music] [Music] [Music] the law does create a vision of a certain kind of justice that we want to Aspire for we want to Aspire towards a world where human rights for all are protected the immense scale of suffering in Gaza there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks which is what is currently on the table does human rights law give us the tools to achieve human rights I'm not sure because of the interests of powerful states because of the double standards that are applied in the international Arena and therefore if it gets to court often the human rights do not win the day and so we need to think of other mechanisms to achieve these human rights [Music] the problem is not the law the problem is with the enforcement of the law and in in the Middle East and in the global South I would say uh the problem is that law is closer to political convenience than to Justice as a European I'm very sorry to say 500 years of colonization has left a huge imprint in our DNA in general Western people are not able to assess objectively what is what is being done through the non-application of international law or through the discretionary application of international law it's terrible to see the dismantlement of international order premised upon international law piece by piece [Music] manen it's unclear absolute Victory will look like when you've destroyed already 70% of Gaza when the overwhelming majority close to 2 million Palestinians are displaced um it seems to me that absolute victory means the the total decimation of Gaza to the point that it's completely uninhabitable and the depopulation of Gaza which Israel has told us time and again uh in this current moment that that is their goal that their goal is the depopulation of Gaza and um the settlement of Gaza by Israeli settlers of course in total violation of international law Israel does not Bridge the international law Israel keeps strictly very very strictly all the rules of law according to the international law why a country should be above scrutiny I mean no one should be the international law is there to be applied universally and not just for cherry picking because this this forms as I often say human rights protection into protectionism and this is unacceptable for me the the idea that the law will lead to Liberation or emancipation or Palestinian self-determination is a fiction human rights is not necessarily the the tool I think the tool needs to be more political in the sense of divestments in the sense of sanctions in the sense of boycotts to use this kind of Arenal of nonviolent weapons to pressure Israel to bring about changee freeee [Applause] [Music] Israel about 12 or so years ago realized having been so close to apartate South Africa the very real threat that BDS posed to the existence of the Israeli State as a racist occupying State and they created a ministerial Department called the department for strategic Affairs specifically to counter the BDS movement and what was the strategy that they hit upon it was to ensure that any criticism of Israel any criticism of its occupation any criticism of its behavior in the occupied territories was made equivalent to anti-Semitism and they have been remarkably successful at doing that there is no other argument than accusing us of anti-Semitism so as to deflect the attention from what matters the most from what our analysis insists upon for decades now I'm not surprised that Israel recurs to any strategies it can to uphold its goals to reach its objectives but I'm surprised that International Community joins this action because today you are not just attacked by Israel for being an anti-semitic if you just ask for the application of international law to Israel Israeli actions it's many many Western countries who do so and they betray also what anti-Semitism has really been The Surge of anti-Semitism in the United States of America and around the world is sickening you know we see it across our communities in schools and colleges and social media they surface painful scars from Millennia to hate of hate to genocide of the Jewish people every time I get accused falsely accused of anti-Semitism I respond I don't stay quiet I don't get intimidated I become louder and louder and by doing so I think I also Inspire other people to do the same I'm Jewish my mother was one of 20 odd survivors of the Holocaust so to describe me as anti-semitic given my history of anti-racism and my work on genocide prevention my invoking of the Holocaust of which my mother's family were victims it's simply an absurdity the so-call Western world is prepared to sacrifice the entire architecture of international law that has been put in place post World War II specifically to prevent there being another genocide like the Holocaust we are prepared to rent all of that aunder so that Israel can continue to murder 247 Palestinians on an average day 48 of whom will be women and 117 of whom will be children we're prepared to throw it all out that's the point of Crisis that our politics are at now and it is up to all of us who recognize that to actually create a counternarrative to the nonsense that is spewed by our politicians to maintain their own place in this appallingly corrupt and malfunctioning political system we have we continue every single day to wake up and insist on freedom and life in the face of genocide and there's simply nothing more dignified that anybody can do in such a hopeless and desperate moment I don't believe it's going to be sustainable to continue to prevent Palestinians from their right to Freedom [Laughter] [Music]

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] at this point in time all of you at least most of you have heard the statement Gaza is the biggest open prison in the world so today we're going deep into that story the story of the Gaza Strip its history its people its borders and who benefits from you thinking that it's the biggest prison in the world the Gaza Strip is a small piece of land on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea a borders Egypt on the Southwest and Israel on the East and the north people have lived in Gaza for Millennia but for for today's purposes were focusing on the history starting in 1947 in 1947 the entire land is inhabited both by Arabs and Jews and controlled by the British Empire it's already riddled with violence fueled by competing National aspirations then the UN proposes the partition plan a two-state solution with Jerusalem as its International City the Palestinians were to receive the Western Galilee the Samarian Highlands and the coastal plains south of jof including the Gaza Strip Jewish leaders accepted this plan reluctantly of course and the Palestinians along with the Arab countries around them opposed any partition leading to a Jewish State igniting the 1948 War following Egypt into war were Iraq Jordan that back then was known as trans Jordan Lebanon and Syria the Egyptians attack from within Egypt and this is important to note from Egypt they washed through the Gaza Strip and then up the coastal plains toward Wards Tel Aviv and with much effort this wasn't at all an easy battle the young state of the time pushes them back to the Gaza Strip establishing that first sliver as we know it today at the end of the war Gaza was occupied by Egypt what's interesting is they never annexed the Gaza Strip it forever remained even under Egyptian control an area controlled by military governance but not fully citizens or people with full rights Egypt maintained control over for Gaza for 19 years and in that 19-year period it's not like everything is peaceful in the Gaza Strip there's a ton of refugees that have sort of come in the Gaza Strip there's a lot of violence and they're under military control but not only that there wasn't no fence back then so those communities in the Gaza Strip continuously throughout the period go out and murder Jewish communities that border them in 1967 the 19-year control of the Egyptians in the Gaza Strip ends with a Six-Day War what was that war a quick reminder it's this incredibly Swift six day battle where Israel quadruples its landmass in a strategic attempt to push hostile forces further away from its borders and to gain some strategic depth this is when Gaza first came under Israeli control over the years tension between Gaza and Israel continued to rise but in 1993 things seemed like they could change for the best with the start of the Oslo Accords finally the time is approaching when there will be safety in Israel's house when the Palestinian people will write their own destiny so sidebar what are the Oslo Accords the Oslo Accords were a series of agreements starting in the early '90s that were supposed to gradually bring together the Israelis on the one side the Palestinians on the other side with the ultimate goal of having two states one Jewish State called Israel one Palestinian State called Palestine the Gaza Strip was part of that agreement the first Sao Accords is basically this general statement of we accept your existence as a people which sounds basic to us today but back then there was a lot the next set of Accords was 1995 and they go way farther into detail of where the borders are going to be what the future Palestinian state is going to look like and again all of this encompasses also the Gaza Strip at the same time as Israel government and the Palestinian leadership are negotiating there are extremists on both sides who are strongly opposed to these Accords in Israel an extremist murders are then prime minister isin in the Palestinian side you have the Hamas and the Islamic Jihad Palestinian terrorist organizations who do everything they can to stop the Accords and what does everything they can mean it means they're murdering Israeli civilians in the streets of our country in 2000 we have this big attempt to jump start the oso Accords in which the US of course the Israelis and the Palestinians come together in Camp David in the US to try and rekindle this ongoing discussion UD Bak is our prime minister at the time he shows up with whatever mandate he had from the government and Y Al Palestinian leader shows up and for whatever reason he can't or will not move on with the Accords if you look at the big picture timeline of history that last Camp David meeting is sort of the last ditch attempt attempt to restart the oso Accords after that we really never have an effective one in fact the Palestinians start what we now call the second intifada in late 2000 which is a 5year ongoing terrorist attack on the heart of Israel it was suicide bombers blowing up on buses in cafes in malls across Israel that is the reality I grew up to as a teenager the Palestinians did everything they could to sabotage the peace Accords and on the Israeli side our population strongly lost faith that there's a chance to really reach meaningful peace of the Palestinians many years down the line we find out that arafat's second in that was marketed as this Grassroots movement wasn't as spontaneous as it was pegged to be in fact it was meticulously planned by the PLO by the Palestinian Authority to sabotage the peace with Israel so how is all of this related to the god of strip and today's topic let's go back to the Gaza Strip so from the 9s through the early 2000s Gaza has a mix of Palestinian cities which are the vast majority of the population in Israeli communities that are spread out on the coast on the Eastern side and in the north of the Gaza STP in the absence of Peace negotiations with the Palestinians and in response to the ongoing threat of terrorism in 2005 the Israeli government led by Ariel Shon does something that no one has ever done in history we decided to pull out of the Gaza Strip with no agreement with no preconditions with nothing just with a point to stop the violence to stop the terrorism every Israeli Citizen and Soldier are pulled out of the Gaza Strip till the last one it's important to know that this was not easy for the Israeli people in fact till this day the 2005 disengagement from the Gaza Strip is considered to be one of the most divisive events in Israeli history till this day people talk back to that event as one of the causes for our current political conflict no more Israelis inside the strip no Israeli military presence the Israeli Gaza border crossings were to be used only for the passage of goods Aid and individuals with permits from within Gaza into Israel or Goods into Gaza control of the Gaza Egypt border was handed over to Egypt and the expectation was that this move on our end would allow the Palestinian in the Gaza Strip to finally have the peace to have the freedom that they wanted to have the control of their own land and to finally move away from violence so Israel withdraws from the Gaza Strip in 2005 leaves behind the Palestinians who a year later 2006 have national elections the Hamas wins they don't win all the votes but they win enough to overthrow the fat the PLO and they don't do this in the Democratic way they violently and murderously throw them out of the Gaza Strip there have been no other election since in Gaza so the Gaza Strip was now under Hamas control which openly called and still calls for the destruction of the entire state of Israel we continue to give them water we continue to give them electricity we continue to have tens of thousands of Palestinians work inside of Israel and the violence continues from the Gaza STP again and again and again the Israeli Gaza border has been the crossing point of numerous terrorist attacks abusing Israel's permits coming into the country to kill soldiers and civilians alike and the communities along the Israeli side of the Border have become so accustomed to the rocket attacks from the Gaz inside that everywhere you look you'll see bomb shelters with a hostile entity along its border Israel resorted to tightening the Border points between Israel and Gaza saying if you want open passage at least recognize our country's right to exist since 2006 that has not not yet happened I think if there was anyone who had any doubts about how much of a necessity having a strong border with the Gaza Strip is those doubts disappeared on October 7th with a vicious attack of the Hamas against the innocent civilians of Israel there's this claim that's constantly made that Israel is the one that controls all the entry and exit of the Gaza Strip but that's of course not true Israel controls the Eastern side and the northern side bordering with Israel but they have a whole big border that borders with the Egyptians and that border is controlled by the Egyptians since 2005 so who benefits the misleading statement that Gaza is a prison controlled by Israel there are ulterior motives at play here Hamas are a terrorist group that is part of Iran's Network it's Iran fighting through Hamas attacking Israel the biggest victims of the Hamas actions and the Iranian government behind them are the Palestinian people living in the Gaza Strip if you've seen any of the footage coming out of the Gaza Strip lately it's impossible not to feel empathy and compassion for the people of that strip the Hamas took the water pipes that were donated and they used it for Rockets they took the fertilizer meant for building the land and used it for explosives they took the construction materials continuously brought in to build tunnels to attack Israel because the Hamas policy has been destructive and devastating to the people of the Gaza Strip that is the reality of what's happening on the ground so where does this all leave us what do we do with all this information we have to understand how important it is to have a strong border between Israel and the Hamas in the Gaza STP the people of Gaza deserve a peaceful life they deserve Prosperity they deserve quiet as do the people of Israel and with Hamas control of the Gaza Strip that's simply never going to happen if Gaza is a prison then Hamas are the prison guards" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="israel has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians since October 2023 Gaza's infrastructure has been decimated Famine persists and yet the bombardment and destruction continue with no end in sight despite countless attempts at reaching a ceasefire deal With a besieged enclave now incapacitated and in ruins why hasn't Tel Aviv ended its assault israel's stated goal of eliminating Hamas may not be the driving force behind the war For Netanyahu it may well be about staying in power and possibly even staying out of prison Before October 7th 2023 Netanyahu's popularity among Israelis was beginning to wne and he was set to stand trial Since 2019 the Israeli prime minister has been facing three separate corruption cases including charges of bribery fraud and breach of trust These aren't minor scandals They go to the heart of democratic integrity in a country that touts itself as the only democracy in the Middle East A conviction could end his political career His war has however been a lifeline for his survival as it has allowed him to not only delay hearings related to a trial that could put him behind bars but also distract public attention away from his scandals including what many Israelis see as an unforgivable failure in preventing the Hamas attack on October 7 Can we say that Netanyahu is using this war as a shield against his internal crisis including her corruption trials absolutely uh there are two main reasons why Netanyahu is trying to prolong this war One of them is to uh prolong his own political career to save himself from the consequences of the failure on October 7th Um but that is a secondary reason The main reason is Nitnya who's trying to create his legacy as the Israeli leader who expanded the boundaries of Israel who finished the job in Gaza once and for all who managed to accomplish what Bengory failed to do in in 1948 drive all Palestinians out from their homeland And that is what concerns Netanyahu more Netanyahu isn't alone in his genocidal quest to flatten Gaza He's supported by the most far-right government in Israel's history His national security minister Itamar Bengavir leads Odsma Yehudit a far-right ultraist party that calls for harsh crackdowns on Palestinians and full Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank His finance minister Bezal Smatri heads the Religious Zionism Party which also advocates for the annexation of the occupied West Bank and rejects the creation of any Palestinian state However Netanyahu's liquid party is losing support from within As internal divisions deepen continuing the war may be the only way for Netanyahu to keep his fragile coalition from falling apart and for his notorious ministers to stay in power Furthermore in a Channel 12 poll conducted in March 70% of Israelis indicated they didn't trust the Netanyahu government with 68% saying Smotridge was doing a poor job while both ministers have gained a certain amount of notoriety among Israel's allies over their inflammatory statements Is Netanyahu a hostage to his coalition as he sometimes claims to be or is he willingly and willfully embracing the rhetoric of his extremist ministers um I think the idea of Smutri and Beng pushing Netanyahu to the far right is inaccurate Netanyahu is the far right um he hides behind those two ministers as a convenient cover as a fig leaf to tell his European enablers his enablers in Washington to say &quot;Look I'm I'm I'm hostage to those two crazy ministers [Music] Netanyahu might have victory set as his main objective but when it comes to a post-war plan for Gaza he's got nothing but destruction on his agenda with proposals that don't take Palestinian rights or rebuilding the ruined enclave into consideration Netanyahu and his coalition partners they have a crystal clear plan for postwar Gaza Uh basically Gaza becoming completely uninhabitable So people would have to leave or would be forced to leave and the rest that are staying will perish to death It's always changing There's no one single plan here But the best plan for them would be the you know sending the guns away because of the you know demography issues and uh this is important I [Music] think Netanyahu may have hoped that the war on Gaza would be a useful distraction to steer attention away from his scandals and boost his image as a strong leader and it seems to be working so far But the March Channel 12 poll shows that he's losing the support of the Israeli public with 72.5% believing he should take responsibility for October 7th and resign and others frustrated that he hasn't led Israel to a clear victory A lot of Israelis are feeling sort of fatigued about the war that it's not accomplishing it its objectives that they were promised a decisive victory and that never came As the war fails to conclude without any progress is Israel's closest ally also starting to lose patience in a surprise move the US held direct talks with Hamas in early March and Israel wasn't invited And on May 19th the United Kingdom France and Canada warned for the first time since Israel launched this devastating onslaught that they may take concrete actions including sanctions or formally recognizing the state of Palestine if Israel doesn't halt for war and the lift is blockade of aid right now He lost Trump's support He lost United States support Uh he's not you know he cannot and he could not end the war He could not bring back the hostages and the economy is worsening Uh even if it's enduring and resistant uh there are a lot of problems for you know the situation Netanyahu's ongoing war on Gaza doesn't seem to solely be about defeating Hamas or even returning the Israeli hostages to safety Many critics agree that it's largely motivated by political survival That of Netanyahu and his coalition and of Israel's expansionist goals and extremist ideology also projects of Netanyahu and his cohorts Bengavir and Smotrich The cost of a prime minister's political gamble has already been devastating not just for the more than 2 million Palestinians trapped in Gaza but also for the Israeli hostages still in captivity As the war drags on with no clear end in sight the question remains how many more Palestinian lives will be taken for Netanyahu and his far-right coalition to stay in power [Applause]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] you know the conflict in Gaza is a conflict that has generated uh different reactions and this is to be understood we saw this in the early years of the nakba in 1948 we saw this in 1967 in yum kipur we saw this in 1973 we saw these kinds of reactions in the intifada and uh I note that there have been quite a number of reactions since I made my position known on the ongoing conflict in Gaza first of all is always good to preface a response to reactions with the caveat that nobody has a monopoly of knowledge nobody has a monopoly of wisdom that what one does is to share one's perspective with the others in the hope that that enriches the debate I see uh a number of comments about the Bala declaration and it must be remembered that the Bala declarations was a series of uh events uh culminate beginning as it were in 1917 and there were also similar declarations in 1948 that uh were an offsho of that declaration and I can't agree more with those who say that because of the disease at that time in 1917 initially and 1948 culminating in the creation of what was fundamentally a Jewish State and the failure of the world at that time to create a Palestinian state that that in many ways has been the Genesis of the conflict so that the Israelis have always been seen by the Palestinians and the Arab neighbors as an occupying force and many of the wars that have been fought have been on the basis that we are dealing with Israel which is a Zionist regime which is an occupying force and it is in that context that all these attempts that have been made through successive administrations whether it's yakin whether it's manim be and a little earlier even during the reign of of of the administration of game and of course during the Netanyahu periods and we saw that all these particular problems have gained the attention of the world culminating much more prominently in the oso Accords and the oso Accords were designed to resolve the problem for all times by creating two states but that was never to be we ended up with a Palestinian Authority and that Palestinian Authority also had its own problems leading in the bitter fight between the Hamas and and fata and with Hamas occupying Gaza so when we say that the conflict has brought about many nonstate actors such as Hamas Hezbollah and all these others we are actually admitting that this is the time that the world should come and say with no equivocation that if we are to resolve the problem in the Middle East we must have a two-state solution a two-state solution whose fundamental anchor is that Israel exists and is recognized as such that Palestine is recognize as such and they exist side by side subject to international law as to whether that will immunize the region from the conflicts that we continue to see and including the Gaza war is one that is out for debate but what has happened and continues to happen in Gaza is creating enmity which will be difficult to eliminate for Generations to come the other concern that I've seen or response is the question of what has been described as white supremacy you know there are those who argue that those who occupy and control Israel are not Jews in the strict sense that these are white supremacists who are hiding behind the cloak of jewishness in order to visit pain upon the Palestinians in fact I've heard even in the continent of Africa some arguing that the Israelis who are of Caucasian origin are racists and they have given the example of how they treat the ethiop Ian Jews who are brought to Israel under the operation Moses there is Merit in that but I think that the question that we ought to preoccupy ourselves with at this time is how to eliminate conflict in the long run and the way to eliminate conflict as we have said times without number is to find a lasting solution the danger is is that we now see a world that is divided particularly at the political level uh in the western world everybody almost to a man that is to mean politician is reluctant to condemn the Israeli response to the activities on the 7th day of October the year 20203 and those who argue therefore because of the European support the Israelis are thus encouraged and there are those who on the other side are saying that it is important that the organizations such as Hamas Hezbollah and we have now seen the hes ought to be reigned in as a condition precedent to any lasting peace it is an egg and chicken kind of situation what do you deal with the International Community through the un have now said that there is need for a pose or a ceasefire which will enable the world to look at these issues squarely in the face and find a long-term solution whether that is going to happen is another debate we now see within Israel herself that there are centrifugal forces which say that President prime minister Netanyahu must find a different approach to the war in Gaza because the Israeli military thought that it would be a quick fix but is now appearing that it is for the long ha so my own view is The Sooner Europe and America encourage the Israelis to seize fire with a reciprocal understanding that hamash and other non-state actors such as Hezbollah and the Hues will also seize fire so that the world can engage in a constructive way the safer it is because the whole world is affected by this War I see here for example of a comment from my friend Douglas moama and Douglas says unfortunately the Hamas has used all his time and energy to radicalize all gazans to hate their longtime neighbors Israel completely true in fact it is now argued uh that every other person in Gaza is being told you have a perent enemy in Israel and and this is bound to happen when somebody loses their family in a bombardment then the only reason why they continue to leave is for revenge and and this is one of the reasons why the sooner this war is brought to a halt the safer everybody is and and and can't agree more with Douglas moama who takes this view that there is radicalization and it's not only within Gaza you can see it even in in Lebanon by heah you can see it even from the rhetoric that one sees coming out of yeni through the huis so we are living in quite difficult times particularly as regard this war and one must comment that is a war that affects all of us because when you interfere with shipping in uh in the Gulf of Aiden and in the Red Sea then everybody suffers Joseph also Joseph hudo have you asked why Israel has blocked two State solution if stateless Palestine can hurch October 7th then what could happen with the State security is Israel's prime fear they are an existential threat secondly how do you expect Israel to defend itself against rockets launched from hostiles un facilities presidential homes please give an example of how to make the war proportionate a very very valid question from Joseph there because it is very easy to say that this war is not proportionate the response is not proportionate and we have had I'm answering this question by Joseph at a time when the icj has pronounced itself on the representation made by the South Africans asking Israel to ensure that genocidal acts are not carried out effectively just stopping short of saying we need a ceasefire but I hold the view which view is capable of inter being interrogated that you are safer dealing with a state which is recognized under international law which is obligated to act in a responsible manner if you don't have a state and is not a state within the understanding of or within the meaning of international law then it allows organizations such as Hamas to exist it allows organizations such as alasan Brigade it allows organizations such as Hezbollah it allows other organization to operate outside of international law and when they operate outside of international law in my view they are greater threat to Israel because the weapons that they acquire are acquired in an irregular Manner and you do not know but if it was a Palestinian state which is recognized as such which acquires arms in a regular way then they would be under obligation to behave properly then they would not use human beings are shield they would not use civilian facilities for purposes of military reaction So to that extent you are safer with a state which is recognized as such which exists and which is obligated to respect international law that is not to say that a state within the meaning of international law does not occas does not threaten Israel but then it is easier to deal with it because you and me know that states are involved D in Conflict not withstanding that they are obligated to act otherwise internationally once again we are not engaged or involved in any mathematics so as to know that this is proportionate and this is not proportionate but if you look at the rhetoric of the military officers in Israel or the politicians in Israel they have said we are going to fight a war like no other War so that Hamas will never operate we are going to ensure that Gaza is not habitable and that is not proportionality not easy to argue in favor of and it's easy from the comfort of our armchairs to argue the way we are arguing but is not easy for those who are actually in the theater and the arena of War you and me can afford the luxury of intellectual and cool analysis but yet the realities on the ground do not lend themselves to the kind of cool analysis in which we are engaged a man who calls himself Curious George and and and let me speak to your curiosity super Curious George most of these mistakes makes sense but the point about non-state actors going after civilian Target is scar make me question the logic why can a state actor deem a Target necessary for its own political gain but a non-state actor which in some of these places and be acting on behalf of their people cannot go after targets it deems threat either countries abide by international law or they don't you know the world has known pain and let us understand after 1945 war the so-called World War II the very reason why the genocide uh genocide became the focus of International Community and we had a treaty on on genocide in 1948 with Israel being the first signatory was out of what was visited upon the Israelis by the German Administration is now accepted the nearly 6 billion Jews were targeted because of their race they were targeted because of their religion and then the world said we must never allow this to happen again no more genocide and we even said in Geneva in 1949 we even said even when we conduct War as human beings somehow accept that war will always exist we then obligated combatants that even in circumstances when Wars are being persecuted there are certain things that must not be done this is the basis of the for Geneva conventions of 1949 but even after that we have seen genocide or genocidal activity activities we've seen that in Sabia we have seen that in in places like Rwanda which tells you that both state and non-state actors tend to conduct themselves in a manner that is inimical to the prescriptions and the injunctions that are placed upon them by law and this in itself is is a sad thing and that is why we have international institutions which punish such individuals we've SE we saw that with slobot and milosovic after the Bosnia war and we have seen that the very reason why you created the international court of justice and international criminal court is to ensure that those who do not conduct themselves in a manner that is in keeping with the law will be punished in accordance with the law and we have these permanent institutions because prior to that you had ad hoc trials such as the nurenberg trials such as the Tokyo tribunals such as sier Leon such as Rwanda but we now know better that these institutions to the extent that is humanly possible are going to do that once again always easy to argue in the manner that we do but yet the reality is that it is not easy I I see here this is a very interesting argument by Samuel Zion was made by the Ashkenazi which are from Russia Ukraine Romania Hungary Czech and Australia there is in this that the ashkanazi actually are the dominant but the sheerin those who came from Morocco and Northern Africa really Israel became a home for all Jews it is very easy to try and divide the state of Israel as it is now but the reality is that we are dealing with a state that is recognized as such and which is under existential threat in that part of the world but what we are telling the Israeli that there is a solution to this that solution is to State you cannot in the nature of things having suffered in the manner that you did under the Holocaust having been dispersed all over the world deny another population a right that you yourself are benefiting from this is what we are saying and the world will be safer that way and and and that I think is what the world is telling Israel yeah Julie oo I am very happy uh you support My Views and and I and I think there is a reason why uh there is Merit in holding the views that we do because all that we desire is to live in a peaceful environment all that we have appetite for for the continent of uh Asia and the Middle East and Africa and indeed is to ensure that we live in an environment that is favorable to all and this must be understood in the context of the reality in the world that if there is a war anywhere it affects all of us who for example knew that because there is war in the Gaza there would emerge a h threat that would entail the disruption of Maritime activity in the Red Sea in the Gulf of Aiden in the Gulf of Oman and and therefore affect the supply of oil in the world so all of us really have a duty to ensure that there is Security in the world somebody is saying a very interesting I have an idea to end all wars how about we elect an international president who all leaders of the world have to answer to the world is now you know I believe that we have contri utions to make there was a time when I believed and I still haven't abandoned this belief that the occupation of political office gives one a platform to really put into practice what one is saying but we must remember that we live in a world where the best intention of men are and women are not necessarily the ones that appeal to the electorate the electorate is moved by different consideration particularly in Africa the electorate is moved by money the electorate is moved by ethnicity and in as much as one would want to be in such a position one finds oneself in a position where what one can do is to contribute informally and it is never lost on me personally that some of the people that are most attracted to were never occupants of any political office I'm attracted to the IDE years of mandas Karam Chand Gandhi known as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr and they became moral forces in the world because it is much more difficult to become a person who is a moral Warrior than to be a person who is a political Warrior who is beholden to many interests but never say never you never know which Voice May call and which voice one may answer answer to in order to play a much more visible role in the Affairs of the world that is Hilo who only hides behind the mask 09 a z but the mask is peeled you know the question of the war in Gaza is one that is alive and well it continues to generate reactions and questions and in reaction to my sentiment my sentiment there are hundreds of questions that have come about raising pertinent issues is two State solution the solution how do we deal with non-state actors what is the nature of the state of Israel what is the nature of Palestine what is the role of the international Community what should the international court of justice do in the face of the representation by South Africa too many questions to answer but it sends the clear message that the world is concerned that people are concerned and that people want a solution to the problem we will not answer all questions but we must continue the debate we must continue to talk about these issues because the day we stop talking about them that is when danger comes in and solutions die so thank you very much for your comments those which are interrogative those which are commendatory and those which outrightly disagree the beauty of any debate is that when we disagree even then we disagree in an agreeable manner thank [Music] you" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="Benjamin Netanyahu is doubling down. Despite growing international anger, in the last hour he has declared that all of Gaza will be under Israel's control by the end of its offensive. &#10;&#10;It's now two days since Israel partially lifted its 11-week blockade, allowing some aid trucks back into Gaza. But the UN says it still hasn't been given access to even that small amount of aid, to distribute it. And Israel has continued to pound the Strip, killing at least 82 people.&#10;&#10;Since Israel ended the two-month ceasefire on 18 March, more than 3,500 people have been killed and almost 10,000 injured. That's according to medical sources in Gaza. &#10;&#10;More than 700 of those people were killed and more than 2,000 injured in just the last week, as Israel ramped up its offensive against Hamas, launching a new ground operation at the weekend. &#10;&#10;A warning, some images in this report are distressing.&#10;&#10;(Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe) &#10;&#10;-----------------------  &#10;&#10;Follow us:&#10;Facebook -   / channel4news  &#10;Twitter -   / channel4news  &#10;TikTok -   / c4news  &#10;Instagram -   / channel4news  " />

          <attvalue for="7" value="bread is life but life turns to death so quickly in Gaza it was midm morning when the drone struck the people in the bakery queue now people were gathering not for sustenance but to try to save the injured a daily occurrence in Gaza as common as eating bread in most parts of the world we were waiting for bread and they suddenly attacked us with two missiles what happened and why I don't know this is injustice find a solution for us or kill us all at once at Jabalia Hospital they were receiving the dead and injured for an Israeli attack on a house a few hours earlier day after day scenes like these have finally provoked some of Israel's allies to say enough but that it seems has done nothing to dampen the Israeli government's determination to continue their attacks we started a structured plan for the next phase hamas will pay the price for its defiance and face overwhelming firepower we will expand our maneuvers capture more territory and destroy terrorist infrastructure until Hamas is defeated the international community is especially concerned about the prospect of starvation soup kitchens have run out of everything and after six weeks of all aid being blocked the tiny amount the Israeli government is now allowing in hasn't yet reached the hungry my daughter wakes up and tells me &quot;I'm hungry i want to eat i don't know what I can do for her i came to the soup kitchen to fill my pot there were crowds of people all hungry they need to eat all we want is food we're really hungry there's no bread and she says she wants some we now crave a simple loaf of bread at the KM Shalom crossing point into Gaza Israelis who would send aid in and those who would stop it were shouting at each other i'm here as part of the T Savesa movement and we're here to block the aid that's going in directly to Hamas in Gaza the military arrested a few of the anti- aid protesters such passion to stop even a grain of wheat from getting to Israel's enemies and no pity for those who suffer as a result well earlier I spoke to Simcha Rothman he's a member of the Knesset for the National Religious Party that's part of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition now this is an extreme right-wing party their leader has called basically for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza and they are very reluctant to allow in any aid israel until now has more uh protection of human life and children in Gaza come on these children are dying of hunger because you have not been allowing aid in this is extreme they are not dying of hunger and in any conflict that that England was involved in the past in this kind of environment were more innocent civilians killed and suffering hunger and everything else mr smudri your leader has said that the people of Gaza should leave that the aim is to get them to leave it's a combat zone when there is a combat zone when there is a terrorist organization who is hiding behind civilians you should let them run away and if you are blocking them you're aiding and abading a terrorist organization using them as human shields that's not a moral thing to do and if if the United Kingdom want to be a humanitarian country that cares about human rights and human lives they would help the Gazans who wants to leave the area leave and not aid kamas to use them as human shields i've got an idea why don't you let them come over the border into Israel why don't they flee into our enemies because they are the children are your enemies they are they are our enemies and according to international treaties about about uh refugees in the time of war you don't let them uh uh um conquer your country with refugees well that is the kind of voice Benjamin Netanyahu is hearing from within his own coalition parties without whom his coalition would collapse and on the other hand these increasing cries from his European allies to say that there is no military purpose to this new onslaught and not allowing in enough aid will create an absolute humanitarian crisis worse than we have seen so far so everyone now is waiting for the Americans for President Trump he has said he wants this war to come to an end will he now put more pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu and say like the Europeans this really can't go on any longer lindsay thanks very much well aid agencies have warned that the extremely limited supply of aid allowed in via the Keram Shalom crossing this week is a drop in the ocean following Israel's 78-day blockade the total of 98 trucks which Israel says it allowed through on Monday and Tuesday is just a fraction of the 500 a day that were going in before October 2023 which the UN says is the bare minimum needed i spoke to Cla Monira emergency coordinator for the medical organization Doctors Without Borders who's in dear Albala in central Gaza i asked her to describe the humanitarian situation there well it was a humanitarian catastrophe when I arrived and that was more than three weeks ago now and it's been getting worse and worse every day the last few days have been um beyond words because thousands of people are forced to leave their homes and they're literally just living on the streets where they're not safe either so give us some examples if you can of the kind of desperate situations you're seeing in terms of children in terms of food just give us some examples it's already a desperate situation for this hospital trying to operate but the people inside um are suffering from the most horrific thirdderee burns that you can imagine as a result of air strikes and this is children i'm talking about children that lost their limbs as well so they're um they're in agony israel says it has these 93 trucks that entered Gaza yesterday what is your understanding of where those trucks are now we know that some trucks have entered but these trucks cannot be delivering aid to the people because we're being forced into doing this in a way that's not safe so we're not having access to unhindered aid to supply it impartially to the population we're being told where to provide this aid we're having to use roads that are not safe and the population are being drawn to this they're being pushed out of their homes and then their homes are destroyed and it's just another tool in the ethnic cleansing that's been going on here for now 19 months you believe that's what it is ethnic cleansing yes we can see that the Israeli authorities they are not providing the conditions for life that is needed for the Palestinian people the destruction of homes and infrastructure the blockade of aid that just continues and then even the targeting of hospitals which is against uh international humanitarian law um all of these conditions israel denies that's what's happening and they're saying that this aid plan that they've got with the US so private contractors transporting the aid but then aid groups distributing it that's what they say is happening um they say they're trying to prevent Hamas looting the aid do you see any justification to that argument we can't see any evidence of that on the ground what we know is when we can bring the aid in we monitor that very carefully and it goes to the people that need it we I see in our hospitals are women and children um that are absolutely desperate and that are coming to us for help so we can see when we have control of this aid we can give it to people in the way that it's meant to be done according to humanitarian principles do you feel angry do you feel um desparing how would you characterize your your feelings about what you're seeing on the ground i I just can't believe that the world is standing by watching this and yes it's an outrage um it's beyond belief and beyond words and the fact that I'm here seeing the suffering of people at a scale I've never seen before and the world is doing nothing then yes it's very hard to process and to believe that um it could be stopped cla Monira thank you very much for joining us thank you you're welcome well joining me now is the Labour MP Dame Emily Thornbury who's chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee do you think there has been a change in the government's position and how much is it because of pressure from people like you i think there is a change in the government position and I think it's right that they have changed it so they have now talked about no longer negotiating a trade agreement with the Israelis um there is talk of uh of sanctioning Bengavir and Smatri which has got to be a good thing um they're the two far right even more far right than the rest of the farright government in Israel ministers who are really I think driving some of the worst things that are happening um so things like that are definitely a change and I think the unequivocal condemnation from the prime minister in conjunction with the president of France and the new prime minister of Canada was very powerful um not powerful enough it hasn't stopped it i think the only thing that will stop it in the end is President Trump has to pick up the phone and has to tell the prime minister of of uh Israel Netanyahu that this is enough stop this is what the Israeli I mean the Israeli people wanted 70% of the Israeli people want the war to stop you Netanyahu was on his own and it needs to be clear to him that he has no friends in this is it regrettable that starvation has finally drawn a response that the bombing by their tens of thousands to death didn't I think that it had to stop a long time ago i mean if you remember when there was the ceasefire that started at the beginning of the year the previous president made it quite clear that that was an agreement that was ready to go last summer and there was no excuse really for it to continue from last summer until January you know there was a there was a there was a there was a peace agreement both sides had agreed to it and then Netanyahu was the one who said &quot;No we're not going to sign it and wanted to continue with the war.&quot; And the trouble is is that we have a leader in Israel who just wants a perpetual war as far as we can see there's no down ramp for him he just wants to keep going and and the side effect for him obviously is that he remains in power whilst that happens and do you think Britain should and will recognize a state of Palestine in the coming months i think it's about time it really is high time that we recognize the state of Palestine i think that what should happen is that there's going to be a conference in New York in June it's uh it's being held by the Saudi Arabians and the French we're going and I think that what we should do is with the French we're both we're both the signatures to the Sykes Pico agreement which 100 years ago set out the boundaries of the Middle East as we see it today and so for the two countries who essentially were involved in that founding document of current Middle East to to recognize Palestine would be powerful it's not enough by itself but I think it would be the beginning of we recognize Palestine and then we we work with um you know many international allies and we put together a piece and we say to the Israelis with the Americans absolutely crucially with the Americans have to sign up to this too this is the way forward there is no other way forward this is what the international community says you have no alternative Netanyahu and your government you don't have any other idea nothing that you're prepared to tell us nothing that is by any stretch of the imagination acceptable so this is what we have to do and for the Israeli people to be safe and secure you have to have you have to be at peace with your neighbors and you will not be at peace with your neighbors without there being a Palestinian state if Britain recognizes a Palestinian state in the coming months it will be doing what Hamas wants it to do what will be the answer from Netanyahu and others who say you're on the side of Hamas well I don't really care what what what what what Netanyahu says what what I care about is doing the right thing what I care about is doing the right thing and what I care about is trying to get us a peace we have to get a peace and we have to get a peace that lasts and and I' and as far as I'm concerned this is the only way forward that I can see you know we have to make sure that there is now a ceasefire that aid is allowed in we cannot allow anyone else to die this is just completely and totally unacceptable and then once we get the pause we need to push on we need to push on with a peace that will last a peace which is fair which means a Palestinian state and an Israeli state and that is the only way forward and frankly I have never I've listened to many many people on this issue my select committee is doing an inquiry into it and we have yet to hear a coherent case for anything other than that and it is about time it happened emily

We take a look at the mood within Israel, where Levy characterizes the Israeli public as &quot;sour&quot; about what is seen as a premature deal. &quot;They would like to see more blood, more destruction in Lebanon,&quot; says Levy. &quot;Israel wants wars.&quot; This retributive stance is still being felt in Lebanon, adds writer Lina Mounzer, who says Lebanese people are &quot;very terrified of the day after&quot; and do not feel that they have been awarded peace, despite the terms of the ceasefire. Meanwhile, the Israeli government has unanimously voted to sanction the Israeli newspaper Haaretz_, claiming that its editorials &quot;have hurt the legitimacy of the state of Israel and its right to self defense.&quot; _Haaretz has criticized the move, which comes just months after Israel banned the international media outlet Al Jazeera, as anti-democratic. Levy, a columnist for _Haaretz_, says the sanction makes it clear that Israelis cannot take the freedom of speech &quot;for granted anymore.&quot;&#10;&#10;Democracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on over 1,500 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

          <attvalue for="7" value="I want to bring giddon Levy into this conversation in Tel Aviv um giddon if you could start off by responding to there was a um latest text from the Israeli negotiator Gan Basin um who wrote the ceasefire agreement which went into effect today is good news the agreement is between Israel and the government of Lebanon not between Israel and Hezbollah it seems that Hezbollah has been weakened enough um it says uh it seems that it's been weakened enough um that let's see if I can find this that it's been weakened enough to end the war in Lebanon before the war in Gaza has ended your response to this and also the response in Israel right now to I think it was about 4 a.m. that the ceasefire or this cessation in hostilities went into effect yes I wish I could tell you that Israel is happy about the ceasefire I wish I could tell you that there is even a relief in Israel but unfortunately in Israel everyone almost everyone is critical about this agreement I guess many Israelis did not have enough for sure the right Wingers for sure the most of the inhabitants of the north they would like to see more blood and more destruction Lebanon and therefore they are so sour today and the other Camp as usual is saying nothing and even one of the opposition leaders Benny gun even criticized the ceas he saw the war should go on in other words Israel wants Wars that's the inevitable conclusion when you see reactions to a ceas fire which puts an end at least partial end to suffer in both sides suffer which didn't lead to anywhere Israel didn't achieve anything in this war it will not achieve anything in the war in Gaza 10 times or 1,000 times worse and here I must emphasize that nobody should have any Illusions has no intention to put an end to the war in Gaza what happened in Lebanon will not happen soon in Gaza because if he goes for an agreement in Gaza he loses his government and that's his top priority and Israel at least part of Israel has very serious intentions to resettle Gaza don't underestimate those settlers the sky the limit for them they just wait for Donald Trump to get into the office and I will not be surprised if we very soon later see settlements in Gaza in other words nothing was solved yesterday accept of the the the punishment of of Lebanon which came to its end but also this is for a very limited time I mean when the prime minister speaks about the agreement and all he has to say are threats about Lebanon and kbal that if any violation will take place immediately Israel will attack again so we are going from one war to the other and from one viol confrontation to the other without even suggesting any other alternative nothing nobody speaks about diplomacy nobody speaks about touching the core issues both in the north and in the South our friend from from Lebanon our Lebanese friend just mentioned violations of the of the sovereignity of Lebanon anyone speaks about the fact that Israel I'm sure will continue to fly over Lebanon known for intelligence this will be kosher this will be legitimate and only the violation of of of Israeli sovereignity is never forgiven and get Lev I wanted to ask you in terms of the the the toll on the the IDF now over 800 soldiers have been killed in Gaza about the estimates are about 70 73 or 74 uh in in Lebanon on and those are the only ones the ones publicly acknowledged uh the what is the impact on Israel of continuing this war on the economy of Israel on migration on tourism and the other aspects of economic life in Israel the price is enormous but somehow Israeli accepted this is this unbelievable phenomena in which people are ready to sacrifice the dearest ones I mean who is more than your son without seeing a real purpose I mean they all tell themselves that they were killed sacrificed for the for the defense of Israel what what kind of defense is it if you bomb camp in Gaza what what does Israel benefit out of it the economical price is one thing I mean you mentioned tourism there's no tourism whatsoever there are hardly any International Airlines to fly in here but there is a much heavier price namely turning Israel into a par State you know it very well from the United States but everywhere else it's not only that netan and and the Gallant are now wanted all over the world every Israeli will feel it when he will go abroad now every Israelis everywhere will feel at least discomfort in presenting himself identifying himself as an Israeli and still Israelis are ready to take this only because they were told that we have to live from war to war to live on our sword and there is no other option which is a total lie because Israel never tried an alternative but brainwash like brainwash gon and I don't know if you can respond to this but the Israeli cabinet has unanimously voted to sanction your paper harat saying its editorials quote have hurt the legitimacy of the state of Israel and its right to self-defense unquote under the move the Israeli government will stop advertising in the paper cut off all Communications with haret haret has slammed the decision saying it quote is another step in netanyahu's Journey to dismantle Israeli democracy like his friends Putin eruan Orban Netanyahu is trying to silence a critical Independent Newspaper haratz will not bulk and will not morph into a government pamphlet that publishes messages approved by the government and its leader unquote this all comes 6 months after Israel banned Al jazer from operating in Israel and as the president-elect here in the United States uh Donald Trump threatens to go after major US broadcasters and Publications calling the media the enemy of the people get on you serve on the editorial board of harats I know you can't speak specifically about the sanctions against your paper but can you talk broader about these threats to the Press sure it's not that I can't but we decided that this this message that you just read now is is our reaction as a newspaper but I think that those sanctions tell much more about Israel and Israel's government than about the arids and here I think especially in the United States who always speaks about the shared vales about the only democracy in the Middle East so first of all it's questionable if if a state which rules in such a brutal way in five million people can it all be defined as a democracy but let's put the occupation the part they side even for us Jews in Israel who used to live in a quite liberal democracy things are changing right now from day to day from week to week legislations against freedom of speech against the legal system against any kind of Human Rights against any minority are being ruled and and nobody says a word I mean nobody can stop it at least as long as this government is there so what I would like to stress here Amy is that you have to also look at what's going on within the Jewish Israel it is Chang changing while we are speaking and the war in Gaza and Lebanon has a lot to do with it because the those two Wars with all their lack of legitimacy and brutality also influence the domestic structure and the domestic system of Israel and you see the outcome I don't take my freedom of speech and I have of speech total freedom of speech but I can't take for granted anymore well I want to thank you both for being with us and I want to give Lena munza just we have 30 seconds but the last word on what you expect to happen from here as you watch what has happened to your country uh at least for this moment from afar uh look we're very terrified of the day after Mr Levy talked about the effect on internal Israeli politics we're also very afraid uh Lebanon is a very fragile you know pluralist state but at the same time the Israelis also have known very much how to uh work on that so they've been specifically bombing where the refugees have gathered we've seen over the last few months that people have been Turning Away refugees these refugees are largely Shia from South Lebanon uh and from uh the southern suburbs of of Beirut so there's been a lot of hostility that has incurred uh so we're really really afraid of the day after in terms of you know the internal stability of the country and what's going to happen to it and I just want to say you know to go back to this idea of collateral damage this is something that the United States normalized you know in our region in Iraq the way to punish an entire country in order to change some sort of internal mechanism which then devastates the country because of course they have no idea what they're doing and this is not you bring about change so we're all also very afraid of now what's going to happen to Lebanon internally as we go on and as the pieces are picked up and a lot of anger and recrimination is going to start coming to the surface among the population so you know as we say in Arabic Al like we have no idea what's going to happen Lena muner we want to thank you for being with us lean's writer and Senior editor of the Arts and literature magazine the maraz and gon Levy award-winning Israeli journalist at harat's author of the new book The Killing of Gaza reports on a catastrophe we thank you so much both for joining us from Montreal and from Tel Aviv" />

so Secretary Gnome what is habius corpus well habius corpus is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country suspend their right let me let me stop the habius corpus excuse me that's that's incorrect corpus excuse me habius corpus is the legal principle that requires that the government provide a public reason for detaining and imprisoning people if not for that protection the government could simply arrest people including American citizens and hold them indefinitely for no reason habius corpus is the foundational right that separates free

Amy Goodman with Nurmine Sh we end today's show in Gaza where Israel's brutal assault continues as Palestinians are commemorating the 77th anniversary of the Nakba which means catastrophe in Arabic when some 700,000 Palestinians fled or were violently expelled from their homes by Israel's founders officials in Gaza say Israeli strikes have killed over a 100 people over the past day the majority of them children and women earlier today at a state dinner in Qatar President Trump said he wants the US to take Gaza and turn it into a freedom zone well we're working very hard on Gaza and Gaza has been a territory of death and destruction united States get involved and make it just a freedom zone have a real freedom zone a freedom zone this comes amidst mounting warnings of starvation in Gaza which is the headline of our next guest's new piece in the London Review of Books alex Dval executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tus University author of the book Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine welcome back to Democracy Now uh congratulations on the efforts of so many at TUS and also outside of TUS to have uh Romesa released um the uh Turkish student uh who was a Fulbright scholar and was taken by masked ICE agents on the streets of Somerville uh Ramesa Oturk now out of an ICE jail alex if you can start off by laying out um what you found in your new piece for the London Review of Books Starvation in Gaza so just a couple of days ago the United Nations integrated food security phase classification which is a real mouthful um it's a it's a system it's a collaboration of different humanitarian agencies um and they undertook a survey it's the fifth such survey since the beginning of the war in in in the most recent war in Gaza some 19 months ago they undertook a survey of food security and malnutrition and what they found was yet again that uh the majority of people in Gaza are facing emergency or catastrophic levels of food insecurity and levels of malnutrition are rising fast and this is directly related to the total blockade imposed upon the Gaza Strip at the beginning of March and normally um in situations of famine there are many complex factors that uh work in between the level of food availability and and children getting hungry and beginning to die in large numbers in the case of Gaza it's actually sadly a lot more straightforward there's really the only food that is available is that that is permitted to enter by Israel and those food stocks are running out russians are getting low and the poorest and most vulnerable are beginning to starve and die well you write in in your piece uh Alex Cival uh that quote &quot;Gaza is an anomaly a laboratory in which we will discover how much nutritional stress a population can withstand before succumbing on mass so if you could uh elaborate on that and whether that is indeed the conclusion that was reached in the IPC report so a a normal healthy adult will uh last somewhere between 60 and 80 days deprived of all nutrition now we haven't got to that stage but children perish much more quickly and there are a significant numbers of children who need specialized feeding need food that cannot be readily prepared with just the food that is available with the uh with the lack of clean water the lack of electricity supplies so we are seeing the most vulnerable um already succumbing and there are two scenarios that were laid out in this report one is a situation in which the status quo continues the level of blockade and the level of destruction continue unimpeded in which case um mass starvation famine is inevitable it is a question of weeks before that unfolds the second scenario is if the Israeli US plan for setting up a an an alternative humanitarian system comes into play now the background to this is that Israel um wants to debar the UNRA and the United Nations and um other international humanitarian organizations from being present on the ground in Gaza and to to put humanitarian provision in the hands of a new system uh a new method a new scheme the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and not many details are available about this but what is known is that the plan is to have just four distribution centers in a small part of Gaza supplying at most 60% of the population with minimum rations and the food would be brought and distributed by uh members of this uh new foundation including uh US private military contractors protected by the IDF and it would simply be those rations and and and basic hygiene and medical kits there would be no reconstruction of infrastructure no specialized feeding um for malnourished children etc now even if this were to work the conclusion of the IPC it doesn't spell it out in quite so many words but it's pretty clear the conclusion is mass starvation would still unfold just somewhat more slowly so uh Alex could you also um talk about the fact of this this concept of yours of surveillance humanitarianism how does the aid scheme that you've just been talking about uh that is proposed by the Israelis and backed by the Americans fit into that uh how precisely would it work you've also said the plan is quote an individualized version of late colonial counterinsurgency back in the 1950s the British government mounted a a a anti-communist counterinsurgency in Malaya and they explicitly called it operation starvation and the idea was that every individual who was in a protected village would and and and was properly accredited with the authorities would receive enough food and every item of food was counted going into those protected villages and outside the protected villages where the communist gerillas were able to roam no food would be available they would be forced to starve now what we're seeing is a version of this um a much more sophisticated version being uh uh being implemented by Israel today so clearly their intent is that no food should get into the hands of Hamas and they have details about every individual in Gats so the the plan as a by inference is that they would screen every individual and they would put accredited individuals who have no link to Hamas on the distribution list those individuals would be notified by text message to come to pick up the uh the rations that they are allocated at a certain time in a certain place and their identities would be verified by face recognition and other technologies and then they would go they would take those rations those rations would presumably be just enough for a few days perhaps a week so that they would um there would be very little chance of them falling into the hands of anybody else and then they would have to um come back so it is um the the the welfare indeed the survival of every Palestinian family in Gaza would be dependent upon on a week-to-eek basis on this type of surveillance and and accreditation system in a you can look at it as the the sort of the counterpart of the uh the surveillance and AI algorithms the the the lavender system that is being used by Israel to identify by um members of Hamas whom they are targeting for u assassination so they would have a counterpart for feeding the people whom they um are prepared to keep alive meanwhile Alex Dval the New York Times is reporting some Israeli officials are privately admitting Gaza is on the brink of starvation and warn of the effects if the blockade is not lifted since it takes a while there are thousands of trucks waiting outside to get in to increase the humanitarian aid and you have President Trump today in Qatar uh talking about um uh is Gaza being a freedom zone controlled by the United States your response i'm not quite sure what President Trump means by a a freedom zone but I think it is it is clear across the board um with the information that we have and I have no doubt Israel has pretty much the same information and they may just dispute some of the details but the the overall um picture is is completely clear that something dramatic is going to have to be done to prevent mass starvation and and and and famine unfolding in the very near future in in Gaza the situation cannot be allowed to to get to the brink and then just pull back slightly from the brink has been as has been happening when the Israelis um opened u supply routes and and food distribution a year ago and and again with the the ceasefire a few months ago the population simply cannot withstand um this type of pressure for uh really any longer without the the utmost catastrophe unfolding well Alex you conclude your piece by saying that Israel may quote do just enough to keep most Palestinians alive but whether this prevents the destruction of Palestinians in Gaza as a group is another matter if you could say what you mean by that what do you imagine Israel will do so the um what we see in this process of if if it unfolds this sort of individually targeted surveillance humanitarianism is keeping individuals and and families alive but dismantling the entire structure of society now clearly the uh the dismantling of Hamas is the political and military goal of of Israel but if it goes further towards the dismantling of society as a whole which is one of the things that we often see during famines it's not just that individualized biological suffering it is the tearing apart of social bonds the collective humiliation the degradation of society that is the the the deep trauma the profound experience of famine if that is allowed to proceed then Palestinian society as it has existed will be in irrevocably changed torn apart traumatized and if Israel knowingly does this then it will be culpable not just of the the war crime of starvation but of the destruction of of of the Palestinian people of Gaza alex Dval thank you so much for being with us executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tus University author of the book Mass Starvation: The History and Future

          <attvalue for="7" value="this is day 66 in the Kamas Israel war and the IDF has completed its takeover of Palestine Square in the Gaza Strip I'm Pinto reporting to you from Israel the IDF spokesperson's unit announced that AIA forces have completed the Takeover of Palestine Square in the Gaza Strip This Square includes governmental buildings of Hamas and a vast underground tear tunnel that reached all the way to the shifa medical center the IDF is focusing its attention in the southern part of the Gaza Strip in the area of kadel bad and kanun and the Israeli Air Force is investing efforts to locate and Target Hamas terrorists and installations in these areas it appears as if these locations have a strategic value for Hamas because its terrorists are fighting hard against these ready troops in and trying to hold their grounds after 24 hours of intense fightings the IDF was able to knock down a main communication route of Hamas this caused hamas's terrorists to give up on multiple locations and surrender to the Israeli troops it appears as if Hamas is concerned about the morale of its terrorists in the Gaza Strip because it sees so many of them surrendering to Israel and for the first time since the 23rd of November Abu abeda a Hamas official issued the statement praising the Hamas Organization for its military achievements against the IDF in the past 65 days since the war started he also stated that Israel failed in its attempts to release the Israeli hostages and failed in the ceasefire he made it clear that this statement was made in recent Days by stating the day of the war and mentioning the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas this is another lie that Hamas is telling this time to its own terrorists it's a pathetic attempt to twart the reality on the ground Israel is controlling the majority of the northern part of Gaza and more and more Hamas terrorists are surrendering every day the remaining terrorists are hiding in underground Terror complex without any ability to connect to the outside world and this is the future for the southern part of Gaza and for Hamas there the fighting against Hamas terrorists in Bia which is another huge Terr Hub of this organization is close to an end as Hamas terrorists are running out of ammunitions and weapons and many of them are surrendering but the IDF still is on high alert because Hamas terrorists can still pop out of underground Terror locations and hiding positions in the neighborhood of Kube south of Gaza the YF is engaged in Fierce battles against Hamas terrorists that are fresh because the IDF has not conducted operations in that area until now the IDF has been working hard in dividing the Gaza Strip into strips of land separating the terrorists from each other after the IDF is defeating Hamas in one area it is mobilizing his troops to carry out an attack against Hamas terrorists in another location that's why in the battle against the area of jabalia the IDF was able to bring additional forces from the area of beia in order to conduct a joint operation to neutralize Hamas terrorist s in that location as Hamas is withdrawing its forces from areas it cannot hold anymore it is always encountered by other IDF units in jabalia Hamas terrorists retre and were quickly engaged by Tank units from the coast of Gaza the IDF is stationed throughout the entire Gaza Strip and any attempt by Hamas terrorists to escape to the South is met by additional AA forces in the southern part of Gaza according to reports thousands of hamash terrorists are still hiding underground in underground Terror positions and pop out in order to carry out attacks against the IDF troops the battle in the south is going to be hard and it already is Taking Lives on the Israeli sides as more and more IDF troops are losing their lives in this war against Hamas and the majority of them are between the ages of 18 to 21 but the IDF is not giving up and their sacrifice is not for vain because we are not stopping until we will destroy Hamas and return our hostages in Israel's northern border in the battle against kisala the Israeli Air Force according to reports conducted aerial strikes that targeted kisala positions in Syria the Syrian defense Ministry stated that its aerial defense systems were able to neutralize the attacks but that severe damage was caused to the infrastructure the report further stated that the strikes targeted kisala and Iranian militias that were located next to the Damascus International Airport in Syria according to Lebanese reports unifil delivered a message on behalf of Israel to kisala stating that Israel sees any Target 3 kilometers from its border with Lebanon as a legitimate Target kisala responded by stating that if Israel will implement this new directive kisala will do the same on the Israeli side the situation on Israel's Northern front is very fragile and kisala and the IDF are on high alert because it appears as if both sides do not want to escalate into a fullon war but any wrong move can lead to another escalation the IDF spokesperson's unit released a recording of Yu elmi hamas's Communications minister in the Gaza Strip during his investigation in Israel he stated that Hamas is destroying the Gaza Strip and taking it back 200 years he also said that the people in Hamas are crazy and that they are following y Yousef stated that people in the Gaza Strip do not like y sin and that Hamas is responsible for the destruction of 60% of the infrastructure and buildings in the Gaza Strip when asked about Yas War hamas's leader he stated that nobody in Gaza likes him and that he only likes himself and takes actions without consulting with anyone Hamas is a terror organization that does not care about the well-being of its own people or the future of the Gaza Strip This is the truth I know that if you're not here in Israel it's very hard to understand the reality mainly because the international media is not telling the truth about what's going on and does not share a full picture and that's why I need your help I need your help in Sharing what is happening in Israel and if you have questions please research ask people I'm not afraid of the truth because I know that I am fighting a righteous war against the terror organization and I stand by the Army and the values that I grew up on in Israel so please join me in prayer and happy hanuka from Island" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="good afternoon everyone it's your host Danny Hiong back for another live stream just 14 hours later it is good to see all of you please hit that like button as we get started we have a very big panel today that I'm going to introduce to you in just a minute but first to just introduce what we are going to speak about today uh there's been stunning blows to the IDF from the resistance in Gaza we've seen Yemen exhausting the Iron Dome on a daily basis and of course the cruel and unusual weaponization of aid by the Israeli regime USbacked its fragility has never been more apparent now Netanyahu is facing even more internal opposition as the genocide drags on with no end in sight and with no notable achievements beyond the complete devastation of Israel's global reputation at a historic rate what is the state of the resistance as we enter month number 20 of this gruesome genocide in Gaza and the proliferation of regional war and regional resistance to discuss all of this I have three of my most trusted and of course uh just prolific voices journalists uh on these matters first let me introduce Professor Muhammad Mandi of the University of Tan geopolitical analyst professor Mandi good to see you again thank you and then we have Loki he is a hip-hop artist a journalist an activist you can find his tour tickets in the video description below he's going on tour this fall loki good to see you good to see you Danny thanks for having me and then we have Ali Abuima he's chief editor over at the Electronic Antifa uh a publication you all need to follow uh Ali good to see you again thanks Danny hi everyone all right well let's get started well I actually wanted to begin with there is this very uh it's it's making the rounds and we've been talking about here on this show and and we've spoken about it before the uh state of this forever war and genocide in Gaza now it's taking a very strange turn where it's been revealed that Israel has been arming and funding uh groups that some former Israeli officials are saying are are affiliated with ISIS this is what uh Benjamin Netanyahu had to say in response to that it's the first time Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly admitted to Israel aiding armed Palestinian groups in Gaza on the advice of security officials we activated clans in Gaza that oppose Hamas what's wrong with that this is only good and saves the lives of IDF soldiers so maybe I can turn to you Loki about this what do you know about this development because as we've talked about we have these reserveists these settlers not wanting to fight there's been desertions there's very strict and repressive laws about this but what exactly is going on here why is Israel and Netanyahu why are they so uh joyful and jovial about what they're doing with regard to these so-called Some are calling them gangs some are calling them ISIS what's your assessment well it's important also to contextualize this in a trajectory of Israel's support for this essential inversion of Zionism a sort of mirror inversion of Zionism in the region we know for example that when uh you had a sort of appearance of dashes in the Sinai and they actually kidnapped and executed some Egyptian soldiers on camera the exact thing that the dash um individuals said is they said this person is guilty of smuggling weapons to the apostates in Hamas this was the exact words which were uttered by a dash individual in the Sinai before this Egyptian soldier was executed now the fascinating thing to me which struck me as strange is that ISIS would be using this way of discussing uh a Palestinian resistance group and that the reason for execution would be that alone and so to me it seemed as if Israel was perhaps pushing a button in Egypt to uh maybe warn the Egyptian regime or the Egyptian military more specifically when you look at the development of ISIS and Jebet Nusra which is kind of a sister organization in Syria it is a known fact Elizabeth Ciro the uh Israeli spy who is currently in Iraq published an article in Foreign Policy in which she stated clearly that 12 groups within Syria were being funded by the Israelis and were being paid a wage actually and one of those groups was Jabetusra we know for example and you know what were the rest of those 12 groups um you also have to take into account that when Pretty Patel the uh British home secretary who had to resign um because before that she'd been in charge of uh Britain's international aid and she met with had 13 meetings with Israeli government officials without informing the British government including with Netanyahu but one of those meetings was about the siphoning of funds to um groups like Jebad Nusra in Syria um in a way for Israel to cover up the uh movement of uh funds towards these people and the amazing thing about both this and the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation debacle which has developed is that the information about the funding of these organizations has come from the Israeli political elite so you've had in the case of the Gaza Humanitarian um foundation it was Ya Laid who comes out and says they've set up shell companies and this is Mossad money now we've known for a long time that the way the Israel lobby has functioned is the setting up of shell companies the the pager attack in Lebanon is also another example of the setting up of shell companies it's what Israel does and uses the western world as a playground for this and is able to launder money in different directions to achieve specific objectives so now both this and this uh funding of Abu Shab and his gang um of of you know Dlan is somebody that is famous for collaborating with the Israelis against the Palestinians in Gaza but I I always felt that there are many dans it comes in in in many different guises and many different masks and and one of them will be a a a more dash type of orientation as we've seen across uh the region but so this funding came out because Avidor Lieberman um actually had said that this is what the Israeli government is doing so actually now when these political figures are going to war with each other secrets are falling out which actually have a lot of benefit for the rest of us to know and form an idea of of what is happening here but you know this is not new israel has been doing it across the region for a long time it's important to also understand what is the function of a Golani in Syria it's not that he might normalize it's not that he um uh he might stand up to them no it's a simple fact that he was cultivated by the very same British external intelligence which cultivates the Palestinian Authority so that is the model government for the region which Israel Britain and the United States deems acceptable it's either a Palestinian authoritarian um a Palestinian authoritarian um authority uh type model perhaps with a dash flavor so there's always the chance of sewing internal chaos and there's always the opportunity to push sectarianism against the only forces in the region who are actively stopping Israel that's basically the option that people in the region have and Israel rules Syria today let's be clear israel rules Syria it bombs wherever it wants why is it that even BBC journalists can be stopped stripped handcuffed by the Israeli soldiers in southern Syria golani rules nothing and he is bending over backwards to try to be allowed to have some form of briefcase independence but it seems that even that is not going to be um possible within the the Zionist imagination this is in a state of constant expansion and and as I say this information that's come out about the funding of this particular um group of thugs in Gaza is interesting um not new more uh kind more kinds of leaks like this are going to come out from the Israeli political elite and I think that's ultimately a good thing yeah Professor Mandi what does this what does this tell you about the state of things because you know uh as Loki was talking uh he said that one of the reasons that this is happening is because Israel wants to get rid of all the forces that are fighting for Palestinians well one of those is Palestinians themselves and in Kunist there's been heavy fighting jabalia there's been heavy fighting actually in Kunis the reports are 17 dead are wounded in just a day of Israeli soldiers i mean I I mean what does this say to you that Israel is going to these lengths to what they claim to be is uh to get rid of Hamas and the resistance uh what's your assessment of this the the regime has been using uh such groups for a very long time and uh Loki is absolutely correct uh when we look at Syria uh the u from the very beginning of the uh dirty war in Syria we saw that uh al-Qaeda was cooperating with the United States they were on the same side of the battlefield and the famous uh tweet or sorry the famous email uh that I and others have tweeted so many times of Jake Sullivan to Hillary Clinton jake Sullivan the previous uh US uh national security adviser where he said in Syria al-Qaeda is on our side that email was on February the 12th 2012 so that is how the United States works that's how the Israeli regime works the Israeli regime actually in its Hebrew press it's much more open about its uh sinister uh views and its sinister activities than it is in its English press so uh if people go to the translations there's a lot more material out there but they have openly in the previous decade spoken about how they've been supporting ISIS al-Qaeda and other extremist groups in Syria to undermine the previous Syrian government and alongside the occupied Golan Heights the Syrian Golan the the Israelis were supporting al-Qaeda and ISIS both of these groups had bases alongside the Golan Heights and uh whenever the Syrian army would try to advance they would strike them with artillery or with tank fire or other means to drive them back and they would treat the injured ISIS and al-Qaeda militants terrorists uh in their own hospitals they would give them weapons they'd give them food they give them uh they'd also be funding all all other terrorists and in Syria we had a host of different groups and now we see how the infighting in Syria's uh beginning again uh but uh in in the case of the Gaza Strip I think it's going to be more difficult for the Israelis this is not new as uh again Loki pointed out the the murder of those uh Egyptian soldiers goes back quite a while and the their their uh crime was for their because of their support for Hamas hamas I believe is too strong in Gaza to be able for them to for the Israelis to undermine them through Palestinians uh their allies are uh very close to them the Palestinian Islamic Jihad which is the second largest resistance group they will stick with them till the very end and hopefully we won't we will never see such a situation but they will stick with them and the other Palestinian groups they too are with Hamas there have been some protests obviously the Israelis uh Mossad and others have been behind it but those are small groups of people who many of them were just it's they they small groups but many participated in in because of the desperation the desperate desperate situ situation they're in and that's a policy that the Israelis and the Americans have always pursued what that's like what the Americans have done in Cuba in Cuba the American Americans are strangling the people of Cuba and uh their hope is that people will turn against the Cuban government out of desperation they do the same in Venezuela they I just returned from Venezuela uh that the sanctions there are are hurting people and the objective is to hurt people so that the the population would turn against the government the same is was true of course with Syria but Syria ultimately collapsed the same is true with Iran and any other it's a war it's a form of war the Israelis do the same thing in Gaza they're slaughtering people they are starving people and they the they and Western intelligence agency that the Israeli intelligence agency agencies as well as Western intelligence agencies work together to turn people against the resistance but I don't think that's going to work i don't think uh ISIS is going to be able to undermine Hamas in any way or form and we saw as you pointed out today that the resistance has been able to score uh successes against the this uh the Zionist regime and inflict significant casualties i I I also believe that um we're going to see further attempts to to turn both the local population against Hamas to try to encourage people to protest simultaneously you're going to see uh these terror groups uh being deployed against Israelis this will this will continue but uh I think to to the credit of the resistance uh after 20 months of genocide uh and to the credit of the people of Gaza uh people have remained steadfast across uh the Gaza Strip and they've tried to separate the people put them in different in boxes in different parts of the Gaza Strip separate them make it impossible to manage they would bomb police officers uh they bomb people who who would guard and do bomb people who guard just a few days ago they did it again people who are guarding uh food and uh that for or aid that was being brought to the people they bombed them they kill them in order and use these terror groups in order to create further chaos but so far we've seen that Hamas and the resistance has been able to maintain control because the population remains loyal they may not be and I cannot say uh I cannot speak on behalf of Palestinians in in in Gaza they may not they may have their own grievances but they know who the enemy is they know what the enemy is trying to do so someone may not be a supporter of Hamas someone may be a supporter of a different group someone may not be a part of any group but they know that the Palestinian cause is just they know that the Israeli regime and the Americans and the Europeans and this and regional regimes are doing nothing for them at at best uh but they still know that they have to stand with the resistance and that the other side is only trying to undermine all of them through division through through supporting ISIS and uh through trying to create unrest in in Gaza Ali please Stephan yeah um I think with respect to what's been revealed in the last couple of days in Gaza I'm somewhat skeptical that there is really an ISIS link uh you know and what is ISIS really it's a brand that is used by Western intelligence services so you know it it they can use it for for anything they want to use it for i think the key point here is not whether or not this group is ISIS affiliated but that it is Israel affiliated that's the important thing and I think the context in terms of the history of the struggle in Palestine is that Israel has always sought Palestinian collaborators and for that matter Lebanese collaborators and as Loki pointed out Syrian collaborators and this model goes back decades and it's a classical colonial model you find local native collaborators to help you fight the resistance against you know your own people's resistance against the occupier and there's a history of this in Palestine going back many decades but we can start in the 1970s with the so-called village leagues which Israel tried to set up in the occupied West Bank uh following the occupation of 1967 and then of course the Oslo Accords turned the Palestine Liberation Organization from a liberation movement into essentially a collaborative force with Israel and yes Arafat who was the head of the Palestine Liberation Organization was murdered when he refused to collaborate enough as far as Israel was concerned and so they replaced him with Mahmud Abbas who has been much more willing to collaborate with Israel and is is completely an Israeli asset as is his newly appointed deputy Hussein which Israeli leaders called and this is a quote our man in Ramallah so this is the model that they're trying to establish in Gaza and this uh Abu Shabbab this this local collaborator who may be a thug who may be a criminal who may be an opportunist uh a local warlord that Israel wants to build up into an asset or a client actually claims to be operating under what he calls Palestinian legitimacy and therefore suggesting a link with the Palestinian Authority and last month uh the resistance had uh put out a report uh a field report and a video saying that they had carried out an ambush of what they thought were were what called Mustav or Mustin these are Israelis who uh disguised themselves as Palestinians in order to infiltrate and carry out assassinations and terrorist attacks for example in the West Bank these mistim uh often uh have have often gone into hospitals and murdered people in hospital beds descri uh while these these killers these gunmen are dis disguised as Palestinians so the resistance thought they were attacking a force of uh Mr and it turned out that they were actually Palestinian collaborators coordinating with and being directed by Israel and so uh as Loki pointed out it was the Israeli right-wing politician Avagdor Lieberman who blew the whistle and confirmed what has actually been known or suspected for a while you know to the extent that there's been any looting of aid even Cindy McCain the wife of uh ultra neocon pro-Israel uh John McCain the late US senator who who never saw a war he wasn't thoroughly enthusiastic about now she's head of the UN's World Food Program which traditionally that's a role that's given to an American and even Cindy McCain is denying and saying there's no evidence that Hamas steals any aid to the extent that aid has been looted and stolen and this has been reported and documented for months and months it has been by these Israel affiliated mercenaries and gangs and what has happened in the last couple of days is essentially this has now been officially confirmed by Israel and it's very interesting what Netanyahu said when he said that you know what's wrong with this i think on the one hand he's acknowledging that Israel does this that this is standard Israeli uh modus operandi but he also said this will save Israeli soldiers lives so again the they want a proxy force just like in South Lebanon between 1978 and 2000 when Israel had the so-called South Lebanon Army militia a traitor militia of Lebanese uh Lebanese collaborators under Sad Hadad and um Antoan Lah uh to fight on behalf of Israel because the casualties uh inflicted by the Lebanese resistance were so die they wanted local people to pay that price in blood similar again to how the West wants uh Ukrainians to die for its proxy war against Russia they want uh um Syrians Syrian proxies to die uh in their regime change war in Syria and Israel wants Palestinians to die killing other Palestinians on its behalf but this is an acknowledgment from Netanyahu that Israel cannot sustain the level of losses that it is sustaining in Gaza that's why they need local collaborators because the losses are so high and the operation today this morning in Kunes which killed Israel has acknowledged so far four of its soldiers and it severely injured five is only the latest of this drip drip drip drip drip of daily uh casualties which is why Israel is unable after 2 years to achieve any of its goals in Gaza yes we know they're the world champions at murdering babies at starving children at bombing hospitals no one will ever be in Israel's league when it comes to that but in terms of gaining operational control they do not have operational control over any part of Gaza and remember a couple of weeks ago they were blustering about how we're going to send in you know if if if Hamas doesn't agree to whatever ceasefire terms Israel was trying to dictate through its American uh lawyer Steve Witkov that we're going to carry out a huge massive invasion we're massing for what was it 450,000 troops they cannot fill the the brigades that are in Gaza most of them are missing uh uh whole units and uh the when they call for reserves only a fraction is showing up and this is even acknowledged within the Israeli media even if we don't know the full story because of the you know military censorship and fudging and so on so they need these proxy militias but this strategy has consistently failed and I think it will fail in Gaza it will sow chaos yes they're sewing chaos they have been trying we talked about this last time we were all together on this stream with those astroturfed protests in northern Gaza they're trying to generate some kind of popular uprising against the resistance in Gaza as Dr mandi said Palestinians may have different political opinions they may hate Hamas some of them may hate Hamas politically speaking but the idea of a mass uprising against the resistance is a a a fantasy for the Israelis that will never come true people will differ politically but they will not turn against the resistance and if they haven't done that after 20 months of genocide they're not going to do it now or in the future or ever and they haven't surrendered and they haven't kneelled despite the unbearable suffering Israel and its Western backers the United States Canada uh the European Union and others and the complicit Arab dictatorships and vassels in the region who are also uh effectively on board with this throwing promises of trillions at Donald Trump without even saying end the genocide end the starvation in Gaza if none of that has brought Palestinians to their knees and brought them to the point of surrender there is nothing Israel can do that will oh no that's a powerful powerful take Ali because and I I definitely agree and I wanted to uh bring it back to you low key uh you know with everything that Ali just said there's this reality that maybe Israel will need uh proxies uh in order to fight even within Gaza to continue this genocide there was a recent study that said 40% of Israeli settlers are considering leaving and we know how many tens of thousands of Israelis over the past what has it been nearly two years a little under two years since this uh massacre began so uh is this a matter of low-key that Israel is going to need to outsource because it has it is exhausting itself and breaking itself through this forever genocide and war in Gaza or uh what what's your assessment of this well Zionism necessitates genocide and it has always necessitated the institutionalization of a human shield strategy and what has just been laid out by Ali is that the way that that human shield in a collective sense is playing out but I think an important part of the story which has not really received that much attention in terms of um the media has been the very duplicitous role of regional actors so on one side we would expect those in the UAE for example or those in Saudi those especially in Qatar to have given some form of requirement when uh prostrating before Donald Trump for this this protection money that he claimed at least a mentioning of of the Palestinians but it is the simple fact in terms of infrastructure that you've had weapons going from the Alade base in Katar to uh Neatim base in uh the Zionist entity that's happened several times throughout the war you've had the same with US bases in Kuwait and weapons going directly there in the case of the UAE and Turkey though for example it's really extreme what has happened during this time so last time I mentioned the way that there's an Israeli company called Highlander which manages quote unquote Israel's airspace that is partially owned by the Edge Group which was which is a UAE state-owned company but it gets actually worse than that israel has something company called Third Eye Systems which operates um around Gaza and works on uh target acquisition and other things that is 30% owned by Edge Group which is a UAE state-owned company you have for example all of the money that's been poured in through the UAE and Saudi into Jared Kushner's affinity partners which from the beginning Kushner said this is a corridor for Gulf investment in Israel and one of the stipulations of the Abraham Accords is that each country had to invest 10 billion over the coming years in Israel 10 billion dollars and so through for example affinity partners that you've got Saudi and UAE money in Phoenix holdings phoenix Holdings is one of the biggest shareholders in Elbert Systems it has a role in expanding settlements in the West Bank you look at channels like Hadith and Arabia in the case of Arabia they have directly worked with the Israeli military throughout this war these are Saudi owned channels you have for example the Israeli spy Gad I think is his name he's a Lebanese origin Israeli spy who has gone on record saying that he smuggled weapons for Israeli intelligence recently had an interview on Arabia English in which he was trying to discredit the idea of empathy from afar now this is quite complicated psychological warfare that's being waged through a channel owned by the Saudi government how many people have you seen detained and told they cannot have any semblance of anything Palestinian around the Kaa how how many times have you seen people detained for wearing kufi okay for us to say the Saudi government uses Israeli company Celbrite to hack people's phones it was hacking Jamaal Kha Shakji's phone with Pegasus spyware normalization happened the the Gulf region and the rulers there have been essential to the war on Raza netanyahu went on record and he said &quot;We give we give these states some wiggle room in their public pronouncements.&quot; meaning they'll allow Saudi to call it a genocide when sitting at the absolutely useless Arab League which actually in and of itself where do you think the Palestinian Authority gets its money from it gets its training from the British government it gets its funding from the Arab League from the EU who are they giving that funding for they're giving it because it's a condition that the United States and Israel puts on them fund our proxy in the West Bank which is priming the population for at best dispossession ethnic cleansing at worst mass murder that's what the Palestinian Why is it that when the British are training the Palestinian Authority agents they are not allowed to train them in the use of sniper rifles they are not allowed to train them in the use of sniper rifles that specifically because they fear the chance of those weapons being turned on the Israelis and and it has happened there has been um cases of that of course and Turkey you know we really have to get into Turkey and more needs to be said about Turkey because you have this uh Turkish journalist Metin Shian who has actually gone on record and publicly made the claim that Borak Odan the son of Oduran has been trading with Israel throughout the Gaza genocide and the data that he used was from the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce and this was something he tweeted on the 7th of December 2024 he said &quot;While the attack on Gaza was continuing we sent 400 ships to Israel we sent 4 million tons we provided fuel for the Israeli planes clothing for its soldiers parts for its weapons.&quot; He said &quot;Thank God we sent our prayers to the Palestinians do not forget um Palestine.&quot; What you also have the case of is several business figures close to Odan actually owning shipping companies that have been involved in uh sending uh shipments to the Israelis you of course have 40% of the oil that Israel uses flowing on the pipeline from Azabaijan um to uh to Turkey and then on to the Israelis really there's there's so many examples of uh the way that this is happening so for example there's an Israeli company by the name of DAD Energy which supplies electricity to Israeli military bases now the second largest shareholder in this Israeli company is Zulu Holding which is headed by Odugan's close friend Ahmed Zulu so what are we talking about here we are talking about betrayal on a grand scale by the very same people especially odan especially odan who they in Arabic they say he he he is the biggest propagator of prayers for Palestine we don't need your prayers in fact your prayers are probably harmful In this case Odan is guilty is guilty is guilty is guilty and these are the rulers in the region there needs to be a reckoning where we are able to um clearly have clarity about what has been done during this period and by whom israel couldn't have kept going without of this this this support from um its allies but specifically those in the region who are actually financially benefiting off it that's that's what we're talking about here we're talking about financial benefits from the infrastructure built up around genocide and I think also there needs to be more clarity from um if if you are if you are involved in arms struggle against the Israelis and I completely understand there is a necessity to have diplomatic relations with all sides and there is help given in a limited way how can you trust the safety of of of of information exchange there or any of that when when this level of uh integration between these forces is so extreme you know the British for example have excelled at portraying themselves as sort of bumbling noble intentioned incompetent actors but all of that's propaganda and rubbish this is Britain is the most sly actor in uh in the region you've seen complete integration of the British and the Israeli security services britain for example the British police are using the Sandcat armored vehicle that Israel has been using in Gaza they've literally purchased it off the back of Israeli activity in Gaza and they're rolling it out on the streets of Britain the British police hack phones with an Israeli company there is an integration that has taken place and Israel is in the process of integrating itself with the regional security services also so it's uh yeah absolutely in order to to to carry out this uh maximalist project of Zionism it is needing all the help it can get from those in the region yeah and uh Professor Morandi I wanted to you know Loki laid out this picture of of the region and uh it is indeed a stark one and and certainly there's been so much enabling of uh the Zionist regime of Israel but there was a recent article I want you to actually react to uh I'll just how the how Ansarala rattled the US Navy and transformed maritime war and I think this is incredible given this regional situation that uh Loki just laid out uh just what has happened here on the opposite side with uh the resistance outside of Gaza uh here you have uh the Wall Street Journal acknowledging that Ansarala engaged the US Navy in the fiercest battles it's fought since World War II despite being one of the world's poorest countries and uh then it said here some 30 vessels participated in combat operations against Ansarala in the Red Sea from late 2023 up until this year and rain down 1.5 billion worth of munitions on Ansarala uh and while they claim that they destroyed much of the arsenal that's uh very very much under question given that Ensurala continues what it is doing it says that the US Navy was not able to achieve the strategic goal of restoring shipping through the Red Sea so uh FA Mandi uh your your reaction to this uh given that you have Israel kind of in this uh very unhinged state it's bombing Lebanon of course it's continuing its onslaught in Gaza and uh yet it seems to be mired in many fronts and Yemen happens to be one of the biggest ones right now yes and uh I think if we go back to um when Trump began this genocidal onslaught against Yemen which is the only Arab state that has been supporting the Palestinian cause in a meaningful way ansarah is a part of the government they are the government that rules in San the cap the capital of Yemen and they are the legitimate power in Yemen even though the UN security council does not recognize them at the behest of Saudi Arabia and the Emirates but they have been in power for uh a decade now over a decade uh the United we you recall that when this attack began and it was all done to support the Israeli regime the Wall Street Journal after a period of time I think it was the Wall Street Journal yes and they admitted that the United States was unable to destroy the underground facilities of Ansaro and we saw from the leaked signal uh chats that were carried out between American officials that they're targeting uh they were targeting civilians in their air strikes if you recall they said the the head of the the guy who was the head of the missile force they never named the person they just said that he entered a building and we brought down the whole the the whole building all the people living in that apartment building were slaughtered because of some person that they claimed was the head of the missile command and a person who they couldn't name and Ansar ultimately stated that by the end of the conflict none of their commanders were martyed the Americans had failed across the board and the Wall Street Journal back then admitted that the US failed to destroy their underground facilities and they were only able to damage the entrance points which were immediately rebuilt then the New York Times later on admitted that I I never read the article because it was behind the payw wall but they said it was said that they spent they wasted $7 billion in this monthlong campaign and I don't think that included the F-18s that were uh that fell into the Red Sea or the drone so the real cost could have been a lot more the United States failed against Yemen and they had to capitulate trump said Yemen capitulated but when we saw what really happened it was clear even the Americans admitted that it was the United States that capitulated and I I think that this uh is an this this was a major victory the the West likes to say that the resistance has been defeated on all fronts and that the Israeli regime has has been able to expand its power but I think that's propaganda and wishful thinking what happened in Yemen I think was the the the greatest defeat for the United States uh really since uh Vietnam uh it was brief but it was uh humiliating the United States went to war against Yemen they engaged in war trump prom and Trump and his secretary of defense promised to crush what they called the Houthis or Ansarah and the Yemen armed forces and the Yemen government and all they did basically was slaughter civilians in different cities they failed completely to deter Yemen if they had had any if they had success they would have continued with the onslaught they would have continued with it for two three four months until they until they finished the job but it was clear that uh they had they were they had failed completely and also I think what we saw yesterday in Lebanon is significant that uh the Israeli regime while it's carried out a new wave of bombings on civilian targets and it was clear that was they were all civilian targets they were just apartment blocks the bombing was carried out out of spite and hatred for uh for human life and using Hezbollah as an excuse and we saw how the Western media basically repeated whatever the Israelis said that they were striking Hezbollah targets i know those neighborhoods those are all people's homes they destroyed between 100 to 200 apartments two 100 to 200 families are now permanently displaced kids who have who are in the middle of their exams near the end of the school year during the Eid uh vacation where family people came from abroad to visit they they created chaos across southern Beirut simply out of spite but that it it shows that the Israelis have not succeeded in Lebanon and uh in Lebanon by the way another victory for the resistance were the local elections the in the local elections Hezbollah and its allies won across the board after this devastating war after this genocidal war the fact that the resistance is so popular in Lebanon despite what the Americans and the Europeans and the Israelis and their local partners their genocidal fascist partners in in Lebanon tried they failed so in Yemen the resistance won the war in uh Lebanon the resistance is alive and well and in Syria it is a sad state of affairs but at least the reality is being exposed to many who for whatever reason failed to see the reality and that is that what happened in SP in Syria was a conspiracy regardless of the nature of the previous government the Iran was never a fan of the Ba'ist party whether in Syria and obviously in Iraq we fought Saddam Hussein and and the Ba'ist party in Iraq invaded Iran so Iran was never in love with the batheism but Iran saw what the Americans and NATO were doing how they were conspiring to bring down uh Lebanon how they were conspiring to bring down the resistance in Lebanon and to bring to destroy the bridge to the resistance in Lebanon as well as the bridge to the resistance in the West Bank so this black hole that is now that sir which is now a black hole uh sadly and where people are suffering I think that in the long run this is going to be more costly what uh for the Israeli regime they are overstretched in Syria and for the collaborators who brought about this horrific state of affairs it's going to be very costly as well and they have vindicated the resistance they vindicated and its allies that people now see what happened in Syria was exactly what Hassan was saying would happen yeah Ali I definitely want to bring you in here and also there have been reports over the last uh recent period of a a new possibly a new resistance emerging in Syria as well uh I know firing rockets uh into the uh or you know Syrian territory uh Golan but Israeli occupied Syrian territory uh but your your reaction to any of this yeah just to say that I think when there is occupation and colonialism resistance in is inevitable and you know the in the US and Israeli view of the world or at least what they claim to believe the reason there is conflict and bloodshed and there is no peace is because Hamas and Hezbollah evil organizations that exist just to hate Jews and kill and cause chaos for the sake of causing chaos but the reality of course as most people will know is that Hezbala was created as a reaction to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon the murder of tens of thousands of people and it it was an indigenous resistance group that grew up and that's exactly the same with Hamas hamas emerged in the late 1980s in Gaza in opposition and resistance to decades of brutal Israeli occupation and the PLO the Palestine Liberation Organization also and its different factions uh emerged as a resistance to uh Israel uh at an earlier phase when the PLO essentially became subcontractors of the Israeli occupation resistance didn't disappear resistance reemerged in the form of other organizations so suppose a genie comes out of a bottle and uh you know Benjamin Netanyahu rubs the bottle and says and the genie comes out and says what's your wish and Netanyahu says my wish is that Hezbollah and Hamas disappear and poof they're gone well maybe Israel will get calm for a very short period of time until new resistance groups emerge and so that's what will happen in Syria that's what will happen in Lebanon for political reasons Hezbollah has decided not to respond militarily to Israel's constant aggressions it's not that Hezbollah can't respond that can respond but as part of the uh ceasefire deal the one-sided ceasefire deal uh that uh the Lebanese government s signed and agreed with Israel as sponsored by the United States and and France and whoever else agreed to step back and say to the Lebanese state to the government okay you're in charge uh you get our land back because of course Israel still occupies uh Lebanese territory uh along the border and continues to attack Lebanon and violate its airspace daily including the massive barbaric terror attacks carried out by Israel last night in the southern suburbs of Beirut so Hezbollah said to the Lebanese state &quot;Go ahead to the Lebanese state go ahead it's all yours.&quot; Now I can imagine a point where uh if the Israeli aggression continues to escalate where Hezbollah will may decide that that position is untenable but uh if they sit it out too long other people in Lebanon will start to resist and to say we can't tolerate the attacks on our territory so the root cause of all violence is the aggression is the colonial occupation is the attack from Zionism against the people of this region uh and their land and as long as that attack as long as that original aggression continues and persists and is backed by uh of course when people in the region are resisting against Israel they're resisting against the might of the entire West uh and so as long as that attack continues then there will be resistance and that's just a reality and and in the past in Palestine it was called the Palestine Liberation Organization that's no longer a resistance movement in any form uh and uh today it's called Hamas or Islamic Jihad or uh you know the the other smaller factions that are involved in the resistance today in Lebanon it's Hezbollah but if Hezbollah uh doesn't return to military resistance for any reason I suspect that other military resistance organizations will emerge and and so the same is true in Syria uh you can have a Golani a British American intelligence asset Abu Muhammad Galani aka Ahmed Shah who has been crowned as king of Syria by the western intelligence services uh and he can pledge as he has been doing repeatedly that we don't want any trouble with Israel we don't want anyone to attack Israel please please please just leave us alone but there are Syrians who will uh rise up and say this is our land and we cannot tolerate this aggression this occupation this humiliation and and so we are going to resist even if the American installed monarch in Syria the king of Syria decid or the king of Damascus uh decides he doesn't want to um to resist yeah uh low key I I definitely want to uh uh bring you back in here to uh react to you know what Ali said but also uh you know Yemen has recently fired one of its Palestine hypersonic 2 missiles at Bengurian airport of course there was the moment not too long ago where one struck and pierced the Iron Dome but they keep firing the ballistic missiles and the hypersonic missiles and they keep having an effect of shutting down the airport and of course uh causing economic uh you know dislocation and disarray and then you have I don't know if you saw the reports too of a new Islamic resistance front in Syria that had recently fired rockets um into Israeli occupied Golan uh is this all for not because I think a lot of people are very pessimistic about the situation when you have Israel raising Gaza the genocide the you know the massive infrastructure destruction the aid weaponization what the you know the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation debacle uh luring people Palestinians into essentially um uh uh to their to their deaths um shooting them down as they were receiving these this pitiful amount amount of aid uh your take on this because I think a lot of people are very pessimistic about the situation despite the presence of resistance as Ali said uh continuing well I think it's important also to clarify that what the resistance in Lebanon is protecting is the entire region why is Israel so obsessed with getting to the Lethani River because it wants to control the water sources of the region now what did Golani facilitate by allowing Israel to occupy Syria the way it has this king of Damascus he has facilitated Israel controlling 40% of Syria's water israel controlling ala dam which supplies water to Jordan now let's not forget that Jordan is actually one of the poorest countries in the world water-wise so now through the occupation of Syria Israel has a further control on this poodle in Amman that they that they control now in terms of the case of um the the other aspect you have to remember that Israel occupied the highest the highest point in the entire region in Syria um and so therefore has this strategic um full spectrum visibility of the region it's always wanted to get to that mountaintop and it did now uh in response to uh some of what you said yes you have the development of this in Syria who have shot these uh weapons from the Jolan Heights you also have to remember that the Yemenes said to the former Syrian government &quot;Let us come and open the front.&quot; This is following the alaka flood they said &quot;Let us come and open the front.&quot; And they were prevented from doing so at least that is my understanding of what happened from some in Yemen but also one other thing that I've noticed is there is a coordination playing out across the axis of assistance in the region and they are trying to astroturf anti-resistance feeling why is it that on the same day you had Mahmud Abbas come out this Israeli spy this filthy killer and torturer to death of Palestinians Mahmud Abbas came out with the statement he said he said &quot;Give up the hostages you sons of dogs.&quot; This is what Mahmud Abbas said on the very same day El Jolani arrests the leadership of Islamic Jihad in Syria not long after that he arrestal Naji from the PFLP the same period the Jordanian government outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood which is essentially about targeting Hamas so all of that happens on the same day or within days of each other so this is the axis of assistance which in the region is pushing to astroturf these anti-resistance ideas who remembers the reports that Arabia the Saudi channel were putting out about the leadership of Palestinian resistance factions and then the reaction from the Iraqis when they went down and they and they shut down Arabia they are trying as much as they can to warp people's perceptions of this entire situation they are trying to give the mood music for Israel to carry out this uh genocide on the Palestinians and and and look at Yemen look at what Yemen has contributed to humanity when you even look at the um the um the the the convention on genocide you have very clearly laid out the basis at which an intervention should take place yemen has launched the most humanitarian of humanity the mo the most humane of humanitarian interventions that we've ever seen when the resistance in Lebanon was um directly engaging the Israeli en enemy what were they striking they were striking military targets they were striking military targets there was a point when they struck a house of Benjamin Netanyahu yeah frankly as somebody who has a uh a an arrest war well who is who is believed by the International Criminal Court and wanted for um for the crime of genocide that is a legitimate target yeah so really what you've seen is the resistance forces in the region carry out their engagement in this with far greater respect for international humanitarian law than any of the other actors that we're talking about we're talking about high techch savagery and barbarism visited upon poor starving people and actually this Gaza Humanitarian Foundation these aid sites they are disappearing Palestinians on a daily basis they are baiting them so they can be massacred on mass and I'm certain I am certain they are being used to try and bully and and uh intimidate and torture Palestinians into some form of collaboration and it's the direct use of food for political uh purposes that's certainly what's happening at these at these uh sites and and I do believe there's greater Gulf involvement even in terms of the mercenary groups that are manning some of the checkpoints videos have come out of some of them some of the individuals have been Egyptian some of the individuals have been speaking in in in Gulf Arabic there's a video I've seen of one speaking the with an Iraqi accent where are these people coming from what's happening here exactly um and so you know all of that will come out um as time goes on uh the extent of collaboration that all of this has uh has entailed yeah vers Randi your your final comments on this before moving on i understand why some people are pessimistic and uh people raise these issues often but I I I don't feel that that is really u a valid belief i think that uh the resistance obviously is always going to face great difficulty you have an alliance behind Israel that uh is has been controlling world affairs for centuries and uh since the second world war the United States has had uh an empire that after the collapse of the Soviet Union literally became universal and as both Ali and uh Loki have pointed out you have regional countries that uh have been collaborating they've been cooperating in in one form or another so in Lebanon for instance many people think that Hezbollah is the government hezbollah has never been the government lebanon is a is a country where the United States and the Europeans and these collab regimes that collaborate with the west either as part of NATO or as a part of their regional uh alliances uh they have they have huge uh influence and they have uh NOS's and spies and embassies that have always been working against the resistance unlike in Yemen where Ansarah is in control of much of or most of the uh country which is has a a significant population and unlike in Gaza where Hamas is in control of the has always been in control of that territory lebanon is not like that lebanon is a deeply divided country and uh the United States has fascist allies in Lebanon which uh are always stabbing the resistance in the back the Hezbollah accepted the ceasefire because Lebanon was divided and there are strong elements there are people in parliament in Lebanon who support Israel there are people in parliament and in government who want to see Hezbollah bombed that's how divided the country is the majority is with the resistance according to polls according to election results but it's still deeply divided in the West we know where they stand we know where the oil and gas rich countries in the Persian Gulf stand don't be fooled by some television outlet that supports the Palestinians in Gaza in the broader picture they are in the American camp all of these countries are in the American camp so it's very difficult for Hezbollah it's very difficult for Ans to do more than what it is doing it's under siege it's being starved and of course Hamas is in a terribly difficult position along with its allies like Islamic Jihad but I agree with what Ali is saying resistance is not going to go away what the Israeli regime is actually doing in Lebanon is that it's strengthening Hezbollah because it is showing that those who put forward the argument to fool the population that the Lebanese state in cooperation with the United States will end Zionist aggression the ceasefires prove that that's nonsense even now we're seeing for the first time last night the president and even the prime minister who's the prime minister of Lebanon who's more than pro-American even they have had to take a stand so the country the population those who were sort of in the middle are seeing that the issue is not Hezbollah the issue is that Zionism is an ideology which does not accept peace it does not accept borders it only believes in domination and supremacism so what Netanyahu is doing is he's ultimately strengthening Hezbollah hezbollah is preparing itself there's no doubt and the same is true in Syria they've occupied key areas in Syria but people in Syria are not going to accept that if the the new regime that's come to power this regime that's been installed by the West and its regional clients if this regime fails to retake Syrian territory all of those territories take that have been occupied by the Israeli regime then it will lose its legitimacy in the eyes of those who saw it to be legitimate or those who want it to be legitimate or those who are willing to wait and see if they're going to take back or that territory is going to be taken back these areas now occupied by the Israeli regime in Syria are are the most important parts of Syria they are the most important parts of Syria and of course it's also it adds to the threat against Hezbollah because Hezbollah is now surrounded on its uh eastern flank as well they'll manage but in any case it's this land is very ter it's very very very important so this situation in Syria is not going to be sustainable and all these terrorist groups that are under this umbrella organization controlled by Golani they're going to turn against one another for a host of different reasons and people are going to see how fanaticism and these groups many of them foreigners from Central Asia and China and elsewhere that uh they are going to be they are more busy suppressing Syrians rather than taking back territory taken by the Israeli regime so in the short term the Israelis may have success in Syria but in the long term I think actually they are proving to everyone that they are the problem and what they are doing is actually in the long run I think going to take away the tools that the West and regional oil and gas rich dictatorships use to divide the region sectarianism racial hatred and other means through which they keep the region divided remember these all of these countries are in the American camp all of them whatever you know whether it's the Emirates or the Qataris which despise each other they're still in the American camp whether it's Turkey or Saudi Arabia which despise each other or dislike each other they're still in the American camp the American camp is the problem it is the United States that's the problem but I think it's becoming clear to everyone that the region cannot live with Zionism and the not only is this true about the people in the region but it's true about people across the world the Israeli regime has exhausted itself the resistance continues in Palestine the resistance is fighting back in Yemen the resistance in Lebanon is rebuilding itself the American Israeli NATO project in Syria is bound to fail hatred towards the regime is overwhelming across the region one of the things that I find so fascinating so extraordinary is that none of these despotic regimes or none of these regimes that are facilitating the genocide or that are accommodating the genocide none of them are they if they took a stand against the regime the Israeli regime they would become they would be the most it would create popularity for them among their populations imagine if Turkey took a stand imagine if Egypt took a stand imagine if any other country in the region took a stand if if the Emirates took a stand the leaders in these countries regardless of the nature of their their regimes they would have the the overwhelming majority of the people behind them because this is a cause that now everyone believes in beyond the region everyone believes in so I think that in the long run this is like it's working against the Israeli regime and it's working against the collaborators who cooperate with the regime it's working against the West it's working it the Israeli regime has lost its legitimacy across the world people look down at Zionism people look with disgust at what they do whether it's in China or in Central Asia or in Latin America the new polls that have come out that I think Ali has done an article on they show they indicate how badly things are going for the Israeli regime so I think we should remain optimistic the axis of resistance is very much active the axis of resistance will continue to grow and the broader resistance that goes beyond the axis of resistance the global resistance is on the rise i'm I'm very confident about the future that these are dark days what we're seeing on the ground is very painful but I think that ultimately the Israeli regime has has sealed its fate it is not going to last yeah well I think it's is a good transition uh to our final uh story uh Ali this one centers on you so you can definitely begin i wanted to pull up your uh I think very important coverage of the new polls that have come out um that have shown that revulsion for Israel as you said is surging worldwide according to the survey here the Pew survey i mean it's absolutely stunning um and then you just look at the west or I mean some of these countries like you say Hungaria you could argue it's not the west Poland but just the very unfavorable in Netherlands Spain this is of Israel itself the opinion of Israel 75% Spain 75% Sweden even the United States 53% 60% Canada I mean this is this is a I think a stunning development Ali so talk about this research what it reveals and uh why why it's significant uh given uh all that uh you've been covering yeah it is significant you know I mean the the thing is this this is a survey done in 24 countries by the Pew Research Center which is sort of one of the most respectable mainstream US institutions so this is really an establishment think tank that did this survey in 24 countries and really it it's stunning evidence of just how unpopular Israel is around the world and they actually say in 20 of the 24 countries surveyed around half of adults or more have an unfavorable view of Israel around 3/4 or more hold this view in Australia Greece Indonesia Japan the Netherlands Spain Sweden and Turkey and it's notable that say in Europe among the countries surveyed in Europe the Netherlands had the highest uh negative views of Israel at 78% which is remarkable given that historically the ne the Netherlands is one of the most pro-Israel countries in Europe um and then look look at Germany 64% uh which is also remarkable given the solid support across German political elites for the genocide you know whether you talk about the Green Party or the Christian uh Democrats or the Social Democrats or whoever they are that's not reflected that you know the public opinion in Germany is disgusted twothirds of German the German public are disgusted with Israel and you mentioned Hungary even Hungary you have a majority of the population that has a negative view of Israel and that's remarkable too because Victor Oban the Hungarian prime minister is the only leader in Europe who openly welcomed uh Netanyahu to visit Budapest a couple of months ago vi uh you know flagrantly violating Hungary 's uh legal obligation to arrest him on that international criminal court arrest warrant and then if you take um the United States I mean there are some things that are not surprising here uh and and then again in light of Loki's comments about Turkey 93% of the Turkish Turkish public have very negative views of Israel they didn't survey Jordan Lebanon Saudi Arabia Egypt because I think it would have been redundant to do such a survey it would have you know been 98 or 99% yes you have a small elite that is pro- Israel but the public are certainly not um or if not if not pro- Israel certainly not willing to to do anything real to oppose it but um remarkably I think it's very notable that in the United States there have been for many years now polls showing you know if you go back a decade or more there have been polls showing that the support among uh certain subgroups of Americans for Israel has eroded steadily so for example among Democrats among younger people among people of color for a while now there have been majorities who view Israel negatively or who support Palestinian rights what's new in this survey is that for the first time that I've ever seen and I've been looking at this stuff for 30 years for the first time I've ever seen you have a sort of a credible respectable polling organization finding a majority of Americans overall turning against Israel that is unprecedented and there's if you dig deeper into it it's even more interesting because Pew observes that in general in many of the countries that it surveyed people who place themselves on the political left have a more negative view of Israel than those on the right but that ideolog ide ideological gap is more pronounced in the US where 74% of liberals have a negative view of Israel compared with 30% of conservatives so it's been true for a while that Israel has more and more become a right-wing conservative cause but but even that is breaking down now because Pew did another survey in April focusing on the United States and they found a sharp rise in the number of Republican voters who view Israel favorably rising from 27% to 37% since 2022 indicating that Israel is losing support across the political spectrum and we've seen that um reflected also in the emergence of a relatively new phenomenon of really prominent right right-wing commentators like Tucker Carlson Candace Owens Judge Npalitano voicing skepticism about US support for or ties with Israel and sometimes really harsh criticism and denunciation of Israel's genocide side so that really is a new phenomenon in the US this breakdown in support not just on the left or the liberal sphere but even on the right i've never seen that before so and again the the the the reason the Israel lobby has worried about this for so long particularly the erosion among younger Americans is because that's where the future is the future of the US support for Israel when this generation of young Americans grows up they're not going to want to keep spending billions to finance genocide and that's why US politicians have been in such a panic it's why they're they're focusing their crackdown on college campuses it's why they want to ban Tik Tok because they're hoping uh like King Canute that they can turn back the tide and I don't think they can there's nothing nothing no multi-billion dollar PR campaigns that are going to counteract the horrific reality of this genocide that is streamed in high definition to our phones every day there's nothing you can say about that there's nothing that that Israel can say that can justify what it's doing there's nothing that Hamas did or could have done or that Israel claims it falsely that it did on October 7th that is going to convince anyone that mass murdering people at uh so-called aid distribution hubs is justified that um blowing the limbs off thousands of children is justified that attacking hospitals is justified that starving two million people to death is justified the good news is we don't live in a world where ordinary people see that as normal or acceptable yes our lead our so-called leaders are willing to accept it are willing to be silent about it in order to keep their uh seats or or their privileges or whatever but the world is turning against it israel is done low key I know your time is short for you so I definitely want to get you in here absolutely and you know what's fascinating is in the UK context you had the Israel lobby have such a free run in the Corbin years literally almost every single prominent journalist was singing from the very same himsh sheet with talking points that came directly from Israel lobby groups 247 corbinism was something I have never seen you are talking about the uh confection of a supposed crisis for Israel's foreign policy gain in Britain but also the British establishment murdering a uh someone seemed to be a a radical um in Corbinism and so literally reproducing these things now all of those same journalists that during those that time did such a service to the lobby are now essentially trying to save their souls this is about their own redemption and this is about saving their own legacy and so they're making quite a big song and dance of the fact that now they sort of can recognize at least partially Palestinian h humanity but what I worry about in all of this is that you know Zionism has always been a topheavy movement and so what I mean by that is you have many of these supposedly right-wing some actually right-wing um podcast hosts actually ranging from you know Joe Rogan to even you know someone on the more liberal end like Piers Morgan all of these individuals have their podcast sponsored by ExpressVPN now ExpressVPN is a subsidiary of Cape Technologies kate Technologies was founded by Teddy Sagi who's given $3 million to the Israeli military during the genocide uh the company was headed it had CEO Ido Erlikman who was from the Duvdean unit unit 217 the Mustin um it was also founded with alumni of unit 8200 in the Israeli military um this Teddy Saggy has made very clear his political um orientations in this equation and so what you then have to think of is if ExpressVPN is being used by people all over the world also and if these now critical of Zionism um right-wingish uh podcast hosts are now um directing their users towards ExpressVPN how has Israel engineered the infrastructure of this entire system to work in its uh in its advantage you know you also have to look at for example the whether it's the Leavon affair in Egypt where you had the Abdas government and uh the Israelis the defense minister at the time uh Leavonne they sought ways to literally plant bombs at sites of both American and uh Jewish um uh use in Egypt you have the same thing play out in Iraq with the amazing book the law of Zion he really shows how Tofi passed the law the denaturalization law which would allow Iraqis to become Israelis no one took them up on the offer no one took them up on the offer so what did the very new Israeli external intelligence agency MOSAD do it literally placed bombs at synagogues and so I guess my fear in all of this is the type of tricks that Israel will resort to in in uh in trying to turn back this tide and also the extent to which it has been able to entrench itself within the infrastructure and the the big tech aspect um of this of all of these states you look at the Netherlands for example um you know there's huge pro Palestinian feeling when you had the Makabe uh hooligans there running riot their repulsion was largely supported by people across the Netherlands but what is the case of the Netherlands you've had literally since the '9s their uh hacking carried out for the Dutch government by Verin which is an Israeli company and then after that now cyber intelligence an Elvis system subsidiary has the right to hack phones for the Netherlands um internal uh intelligence operations so it literally means that states across the world in Europe and in the Middle East are outsourcing their internal and external intelligence functions which key part of their sovereignity to the Israelis so I wonder about how entrenched that is and what kind of leverage that can potentially give the Israelis to try and bully um particularly political elites and others within these within these societies but certainly on a popular level Zionism has never been more naked than it is today indeed indeed uh I want to get Professor Mandi in here though but uh low key uh this might be the final comment uh do you want to do you need to go now or later i definitely want to promote i just say keep up the absolutely amazing work i'm so happy for example that the electronic interfer exists in the world all of our understandings of all of this not only during this period during the Corbyn years and long prior to the Corbyn years all of our understandings would be far poorer were it not for the electronic interfa so may you continue and keep strong and thank you Danny and Professor Miranda it's great to see you all as uh as as always and hope to see you again soon thank you well everybody everybody go to the video description and find uh Loki's link to all his tour dates if you happen to be in the area uh out west uh out in the UK I believe but uh Professor Morandi your comments on what we've been discussing here i I don't think um there's much that I can add to what Ali and Loki have already said uh I think that uh the tide has turned i I I've believed this for a very long time now and I think actually if Pew had been more representative in its u choices uh it would have looked a lot worse for the Israeli regime uh I I took a very brief look at the art at uh the piece in electronic inifat which everyone should be uh constantly uh studying at electronic inifat in general uh Argentina which is an extremely white right-wing government the if I'm not mistaken the the the the amount of disgust towards the Israeli regime is very high even though the president has converted to Zionism uh or in the case of India which has always been an exception to the rule it doesn't look too good for Zionism they're not uh they don't have this strong majority they have a minority of support uh in China my understanding through my different trips there and through my uh communications and the meetings with Chinese scholars and students the population is overwhelming overwhelmingly critical of the Israeli regime the same is true in Russia in our region it would be almost 100% as Ali mentioned earlier in Iran the only people who would support Israel are some young liberals who really may support the Israeli regime out of spite and whenever I have conversations with them on campus their arguments quickly fall apart in Iran it's uh almost universal the hatred for the regime again as except for a certain class of people who I think out of out of uh spite they may take a different position but I think deep down they all know where the truth stands so uh I see this is the death of Zionism it is when when it is despised across the world it cannot sustain itself and when it is despised universally across the region by uh the population regardless of what some of these elites do uh I don't see a future for it it is tired it is not doing well after almost after 20 months of genocide we saw today them take losses they are overstretched their economy is falling apart and their supporters in the west are the west itself is in terrible shape they have the the Israeli regime is dependent on the west for its existence the west is no longer the empire that governs the world it is the empire is collapsing before our eyes the what we saw between Trump and uh yesterday and and and how Musk was attacking him i think is just reflective of a broader problem in the United States and in the west at large that the west no longer has that unity it no longer has that authority it no longer has that aura of strength and power that it had before and without that without the overwhelming uh power of the west and the US empire how how is the regime going to sustain itself it is completely dependent on it those who in the west who like to say that the Israelis are uh the supreme power in the region or they're the superpower in the region the Israeli regime is is a puny tiny vulnerable weak regime that is completely dependent on the West for everything it does all of this whole genocide is being carried out with Western wealth with Western money with Western support if the United States or even the Europeans if they withheld their support for the Israeli regime for a few weeks it would be over the regime would be over right now the Germans the the British and the French at the UN Security Council they voted for a ceasefire it was only the Americans that vetoed it but will the British and the French really do anything against the Israelis they will continue to support the Israelis the Germans will continue to support the Israelis and they'll even purchase Israeli weapons in order to help fund the genocide but they are on the decline so this com this regime that is completely dependent which had the benefit of Western media Western soft power that was able to to in the past create a favorable environment for the Israeli regime and and Zionists across the world that media has failed western soft power has failed western economies the Western Empire is failing it they they no longer have it no longer has the power and authority that it had before so Israel's support is weakening on all fronts it is failing at home people despise it this is not this is not good news at all and I personally think that Netanyahu is destroying the Israeli regime he is the person who's he is destroying it because he's not even fighting for the interests of Zionism he's fighting for the interests of Netanyahu and Netanyahu's allies and he's allied with these people for the sake of Netanyahu so ultimately I you know again as I said a few minutes ago 10 15 minutes ago I'm optimistic about the future i think the resistance and the access of resistance will continue to degrade the regime's capability and the United States which has overextended itself in trade wars in in uh in Ukraine where Trump foolishly foolishly was unable to bring an end to the war he he could have ended the war and he didn't and now this war is going to continue to degrade the capabilities of of of the West so they've overextended themselves on multiple fronts they've destroyed their image because of their support for the Holocaust things I'm I'm optimistic i'm optimistic about the future of Palestine the suffering that we see day and night is intolerable but uh I I definitely see light at the end of the tunnel yeah uh Ali it was your article so I maybe I'll give you the final word actually because um after hearing what person and and Loki before he left said uh what immediately came to mind was you know all successful resistance movements had this element where the outside world or the world perhaps around uh the resistance wherever it is uh really came to its support i'm curious if you think that is what has been happening and and whether it will accelerate but any final thoughts you have on your uh piece here yeah I I think I want to make a general point that I hope everyone who's watching and listening to this whether they're watching it live now or later on YouTube or any other medium should know is that the voices of people around the world actually matter and the reason we're seeing now some things starting to shift the governments in the West particularly where Israel's base of support is will resist till the very end any change they will hold on to their beloved Israel as long as they can and I'm on an old I'm old enough to remember that that's how it was with apartheid South Africa now in hindsight everyone likes to pretend that they were against apartheid in South Africa when Nelson Mandela died Barack Obama and all those Western leaders went to his funeral and they were taking selfies and pretending like they thought he was a hero at the time when most of those governments treated him and the African National Congress as terrorists and they supported the apartheid regime and every western university resisted and refused divestment and uh the governments the western governments particularly West Germany the same Germany that supports the genocide now in Palestine West Germany was opposed to sanctions on apartheid South Africa Margaret Thatcher the British prime minister was opposed to sanctions on apartheid South Africa Ronald Reagan the US president was opposed to sanctions on the genocidal white supremacist regime in apartheid South Africa why did it change it changed because of people power it changed because the public made that politically untenable yes there were also ge geopolitical factors as well just as there are now by the way you know this was coming towards the end of the Cold War and the West didn't need South Africa as an asset as an anti-communist uh anti- colon an anti-communist pro-colonial pro- empire asset in southern Africa the same way there are geopolitical shifts now and Israel is lo losing its relevance as the US empire declines so I want to emphasize that people power is essential the voices the protests uh showing visible solidarity in any way you can it's all so important speaking out on social media they haven't shut us down yet they you know with all the manipulation of algorithms and all of this kind of thing they still can't make Israel's crimes disappear from people's screens and consciences and so people have to keep it up your voices matter this is why they're cracking down with such heavy-handed and crude censorship in the West uh arresting journalists arresting college students smearing people all these tactics are because they know they're losing and we are winning humanity is winning so keep it up don't despair yes our hearts break yes we're sad yes it's okay it's okay when you see and hear the suffering that's going on in Gaza it's okay to cry it's okay to mourn we need to do that because what we're seeing is horrible but don't despair because we are winning globally we're winning humanity is winning justice is winning things are they we will see i believe I believe it visualize it it will happen that when Netanyahu falls when Israel uh when Israel um uh you know unravels even more than it is now the way these western corrupt regimes are going to um redeem themselves is just the way some of the western pro- genocide journalists are now now they're saying &quot;Oh you know Pierce Morgan uh Dr mirand's friend Pierce Morgan uh of course I'm being sarcastic there but uh you know now Pierce Morgan is trying to rescue his reputation by being critical of Israel western leaders and governments will do that too and I believe we will see Benjamin Netanyahu uh arrested and brought to trial and that of course will only be the beginning of accountability for this genocide could I just add a couple of very quick points one I agree with everything Patty said uh even if even if if even in my opinion if the situation was hopeless we all have a responsibility nevertheless we have to support what is right and oppose what is wrong but the regime is losing the regime is lo the Zionist regime is losing on all fronts and therefore we all have to push harder and young people have done a fantastic job young Jews young Christians young Muslims young Hindus we saw the young lady uh at MIT take such a heroic stance and people across the world saw saw it we have to all of us collectively continue pushing hard everyone doesn't matter how much influence we have what it's our intentions that they count so now is the time the regime and uh I think Loki may or maybe it was Ali alluded to this that they they're desperate they may go for false flag operations they will do whatever they can to turn the tide but I think it's too late and I think people are too too much awake but we have to continue pushing harder and harder and when Netanyahu falls and he will fall whether he's uh he will be I agree I think he will probably be arrested not for necessarily the right reasons but he will probably be arrested by the regime itself for other reasons but the regime post Netanyahu is going to be in a far more in a far worse situation than it is today and today it's in a very very bad situation well I think this is a great place to end the conversation um by the way sorry correct myself when I say he will he may be arrested for the fall wrong reasons I don't mean that he isn't corrupt i mean the real reason why he should be arrested and put on trial is for the Holocaust but the Zionists themselves corrupt as they are they will they will probably arrest him for corruption yeah that's uh I don't know if there are truer words spoken there Professor Mandi it seems very likely that's going to be the case without further ado though this was a a great conversation we really covered a lot of ground i want to thank Loki of course you had to run uh a little earlier uh I want to of course thank you Ali thank you Professor Morandi uh we can find your work in the video description both of you uh your Twitter uh Pro Randi is in the video description electronic Inifada is in the video description where you can follow all of Ali and his colleagues's work you really do have to support and follow electronic andifada

final uh words Ali personandi for the audience before we head out just go and see Joe i promote Loki as well i think he's he's on a tour right yeah in the fall in the fall if you uh if you happen to be in the UK area uh go to the UK and uh you know sign up for one of his concerts i would I would highly recommend i think it's all throughout the month of September I believe but you can find the

          <attvalue for="7" value="let's talk about why Palestinians in East Jerusalem are losing their [Applause] homes Jerusalem is a place unlike anywhere else in the world an ancient city that's considered holy in Islam Judaism and Christianity it's also home to Israelis and Palestinians who both claim the city as their Capital although Jerusalem's status has never been settled nor has the issue of a Palestinian State you have both Israelis and Palestinians that live within the a shared City but that city is not necessarily shared to the fullest extent East Jerusalem is the S side of the city that's considered Palestinian territory under international law but it's under Israeli military occupation and for years we've been seeing things like this Palestinian families being evicted from their homes their houses are getting BN down at the same time Israeli settlements are expanding with every eviction every demolition the space for Palestinians in East Jerusalem is steadily shrinking the Israeli government has often said these are just real estate disputes but when you speak to the people involved it's clearly so much more than [Music] that the Arabs that they say this is Palestine they lie the Bible says this land belong to the Jewish people there are so many layers to what's going on so we've come to East Jerusalem to help you get a sense of what's actually happening and why [Music] nura gate sublaban is taking us to the apartment where she was born and had lived her whole life until she was evicted in July 2023 she fought a long legal battle that went all the way to the Israeli Supreme Court eviction cases like noras are mostly being driven by Israeli settler organizations these are well-funded groups that promote Jewish settlement in Palestinian neighborhoods in nura's case a settler group obtained ownership of the proper and then built a case to kick Noah out even though she had what's called protected tency we'll explain that later to understand what's going on in case's like noras we need to take things back to 1948 after Israel proclaimed itself a state on land that had previously been Palestine under British control five Arab countries went to war with Israel and there was a massive displacement of people including more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes this was also a period when hundreds hundreds of thousands of Jews were being expelled from Arab countries the war ended with a set of agreements that divided the land between Israel and Arab controlled territories separated by what's called The Green Line Jordan controlled the West Bank Egypt controlled Gaza and Jerusalem was split in two Israel controlled West Jerusalem Jordan controlled East Jerusalem which includes the old city a waloff area where the main Rel religious sites are in 1967 there was another war and Israel seized and occupied more land including East Jerusalem and the West Bank but the 1949 green line still represents the internationally recognized borders of Israel so technically the green line runs through here dividing West Jerusalem and East Jerusalem but in practice you can see there's no actual separation here and Israel applies its own set of laws on both sides even though according to inter international law East Jerusalem is Palestinian territory under occupation so it's not considered sovereign Israeli territory and under international law the occupier is supposed to stick to certain rules thank you an occupying power is not allowed to apply its own legal system in the occupied territory un occupying power is not allowed to transfer civilian populations from their homes or to deport them Israel still continues to do that the wrong law is being applied and the wrong courts are being applied and it's through the Israeli court system that evictions are being enforced in East Jerusalem since 1970 it's estimated that more than 160 families have been evicted right now another 200 families around a thousand people are at risk the eviction process usually starts with settler groups obtaining ownership of a property where Palestinians live and there's one Israeli law that's really important here the legal and administrative matters law and essentially what it does is it affords land restitution rights to Jews who allegedly owned properties in East Jerusalem prior to 1948 what does that mean it essentially grants them the right to reclaim assets that they lost in the 1948 War now it is extremely discriminatory because there is no parallel legal mechanism for Palestinians who lost properties in the same War so if we go back to Norah's case an Israeli settler group was able to claim ownership of the apartment based on that law but Norah still had a right to live there because she had that protected tency we mentioned earlier it's a type of long-term lease that Jordan granted to Palestinian refugees while it was in charge of East Jerusalem after Israel took over in 1967 Palestinians like Norah's family were allowed to keep those leases but under strict conditions once settlers got the rights to no's apartment they spent decades trying to convince the Israeli courts that she'd broken those tency conditions and they finally managed to evict her in 2023 what we've seen is that over the years you have settler organizations or groups that have exploited and continue to exploit this 1970 law to acquire the rights or alleged rights to these properties and remove the protected tency from the Palestinian family they are radical settler groups that have a particular aim and goal which is to judaize or Israel eyesee Jerusalem it's not just these Fringe settler groups that are working individually and working by themselves they are aided and embedded by the state on all levels the Ministries the municipality and laws and courts are all instrumentalized in order to displace Palestinians as much as possible and H increase the number the Jewish population in Jerusalem this is a stated goal for Israel they are not shy about it especially in recent years as Israel's government has become increasingly right-wing and pro-settler politicians have been given senior positions people like itamar benir who became national security minister in 2022 he's a settler himself a member of the parliament and leader of a far-right party called Jewish power before he became a minister benir often came to the neighborhood of sh Shar to show his support for settlers he even set up a makeshift office right outside this house where the solemn family live recently a settler activist bought the rights to the solemn family's house and is trying to revive an eviction order from the 1980s that was never enforced and while Fatima and her family are fighting to stay in their home they also face harassment from settlers [Music] fore [Applause] [Music] most weeks there are rival protests in Shar between Palestinians and activists who support their cause and settlers Fatima is one of the regulars so is the settler trying to evict her yonatan ysf who's a member of the Jerusalem city council your house it's my house I because I buy from the people that they have documents that the this house belong to them I buy it and I have laws and according to the law this is my house I'm here because the Bible says this area all the land of Israel belonged to the Jewish people but today Jerusalem is important to Muslims to Christians to so many millions of people very important but it's belong to the Jewish so you've got settler groups pursuing evictions of Palestinians through Israeli courts that's one pattern playing out another is the way Palestinians are getting squeezed out of East Jerusalem through restrictions on construction and the demolition of homes that the Israeli authorities classify as illegal it comes down to the rules that Israel imposed after 1967 about how land is allocated and who can build what and where only 13% was zoned for Palestinian construction and residential development but those areas were already built up so there's no real space for new houses and building anything like an extension for a growing family requires a permit from the Jerusalem municipality the process can take years it's expensive and applications are very often rejected so many Palestinians build anyway without permits at least a third of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem don't have the right permits and are therefore considered illegal by Israel which puts all those Homes at risk of demolition Arya King is a prominent settler activist who's now a deputy mayor of of Jerusalem Arab are not above the law Arabs if they want to build legally they can build legally so one thing is having the option to build another thing is being granted the building permits and you know several organizations say that just doesn't happen for Palestinians Arabs should not come and cry why our house is being demolished when they choose to build illegally but they choose not to build with a permission because because they save time they save money and they don't pay tax it's not as if Palestinian families want to go and build illegally or unlawfully according to Israeli law it's that there is a near complete inability to obtain these these building permits the rate of approval is very very low compared to what is being built and what is being approved for Jewish Israelis you can see just the Stark the Stark disparity between that so just to give you an idea of where everything is up there is the old City this entire area is a Palestinian neighborhood of silwan you can see just how close everything is over on this side are several ongoing eviction cases and then down here this entire section is subject to an Israeli demolition plan it's called al-bustan and the Jerusalem municipality wants to redevelop the area and create a Biblical themed Garden that would link up to other religious and archae ological sites nearby there are more than a 100 houses here and most of them are considered illegal because they don't have the right permits even though Palestinians own the land like nidal Al rajabi who's got a demolition order on his house he sees the garden plan and all the technicalities around building permits as a pretext for something [Music] bigger [Music] fore so across East Jerusalem Palestinians are fighting to hold on to their homes and neighborhoods at the same time there's more money and more land being allocated for Israeli Jews to settle here 12 Israeli settlements have been built in East Jerusalem since 1967 over the years they've expanded and become established residential areas with lots of amenities like parks and schools it's been a while since any new Israeli settlements were built but that's now changing we are along the southern perimeter of East Jerusalem what we're seeing right now we're seeing a lot of the construction of the foundation and infrastructure on the area in Gat Matos Gatos is slated to be the first new settlement in East Jerusalem to be built in the past 20 years we're talking about thousands of housing units that are designated for Jewish Israelis um even though it is is surrounded by Palestinian neighborhoods you actually have basically a spotting a series of different settlement plans that are along the southern perimeter you see if you kind of connect the dots how it creates this entire wedge of Israeli settlement building you cut off East Jerusalem from the southern West Bank there is then no territorial contiguity necessary for a viable Palestinian state with a capital in in East Jerusalem that idea is Central to the so-called two-state solution that was agreed 30 years ago as the basis for Peace So a Palestinian State alongside Israel with East and West Jerusalem becoming their respective capitals global leaders still cling to the idea but in practice any kind of peace process has been dead for years and what's happening in East Jerusalem helps to confirm that so what's written here [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] this is what Gaza looks like after more than a year of Israeli bombardment in 15 months this densely populated strip of land has been totally devastated the UN says more than 2/3 of all the buildings in Gaza have been damaged or [Music] destroyed the scale of Destruction is almost incomprehensible there's nothing really prepares you for what you see a landscape that uh really was evocative of images of Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the atomic bombs had dropped the sheer Devastation is such that that most people simply cannot conceive that this has been allowed to happen there was just Rubble in every direction as far as you could see uh complete devastation it is the most barbaric dystopian situation that I have ever seen in my life all days all nights you live in fear you move in fear you sleep in fear you wake up in fear you are not sure that you will be safe in the coming uh few minutes uh every morning when we meet everybody we say thanks God you are still alive in summer 2023 I came here to make a film asking if Israel was using water as a weapon in Palestine I had no idea these images would become one of the last records of a place that's been decimated beyond recognition we're sitting on a Titanic ship everyone is going to hit the iceberg this war didn't spare anything in the city didn't spare a building it didn't spare a tree it didn't spare a person the destruction uh was for all sources all aspects of life [Music] [Music] after 15 months of bombs drone attacks and a ground Invasion killing more than 60,000 people a fragile ceasefire has come into Force and the tens of thousands of gazin who had been trapped for months in the south of the strip can finally return to their homes as they emerge from their shelters and head north to see what remains of their old lives our team in Gaza went to search for the people who shared their daily struggle with us just a few weeks before the war started [Music] among the thousands of people walking North is farmer Muhammad Cel he abandoned his family farm in B laa more than a year ago when staying became too dangerous today he returns to see what remains of the home he once knew the reality hits him there's almost nothing left when we met him in 2023 times were hard and water was scarce but his farm was getting by growing fruits and vegetables to sell at the local market that's all gone now fore most of gaza's Farmland has been destroyed by the Israeli bombardment the once fertile region of B lahia in gaza's North is now a Barren desert south of Gaza City is zun the Olive District famous for its Olive crops now now almost completely destroyed the Orchards and Farms of can Yunis once again decimated by Israeli forces unable to produce their own food garans are now almost completely dependent on the food trucked in by Aid organizations and safe water is even harder to come by Gaza until before the war 40% of the population were receiving uh high quality of water after more than 15 years of the Israeli blockade the water situation was already critical and when Israel started its full-on war in Gaza following the Hamas attacks on October 7th 2023 it quickly got much worse signs pointing to war crimes and genocide started to emerge including water war crimes is Amnesty International concludes that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza to deprive the population of Gaza of access to water amount to acts of genocide taking for survival in the Gaza Strip we saw Israeli leaders saying in public we will cut off water we will cut off other essential supplies to the population this was to the whole population it wasn't targeting the military combatants of Hamas it was cutting off water for everyone in Gaza the Israeli even beside uh targeting building streets and killing people they were using uh uh the water as an additional uh an additional weapon against the Palestinians the more it went on the more that appeared to be deliberate like this Israeli soldiers filmed themselves blowing up a water facility in Rafa and posted it on social media and this the aftermath of an attack on civilians waiting in line at a water filling station in the alhatti refugee camp [Music] 10 people were killed rights groups say this is clear evidence of genocide so genocide is the intent to destroy and holler in part a population it does not limit just to killings or similar acts it can also be the creation of condition of life that can make living impossible Israel rejects all accusations of war crimes and genocide in Gaza prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu who alongside his former Defense Minister yav galand is wanted by the international criminal court says the claims are false and outrageous when we visited gaza's water Distribution Center in 2023 this man rationed the water supply to different neighborhoods by spinning these wheels since then the situation has gone from inadequate to desperate this facility has been completely destroyed the new pipelines installed by the International Community are now a ruin of Twisted Metal and rubble and all the households who received water through these pipes are cut off more than 80% of water networks have been totally destroyed uh 300 30,000 of meters of water networks have been totally demolished as well more than 600,000 M of sea networks have been also uh demolished destroying Water Supplies attacking water workers um preventing the Reconstruction of um Water Supplies this all adds up to the evidence showing this was a deliberate policy a deliberate policy to deprive the population of essential water they are war crimes because they targeting facilities essential to the population to the surviv of the population but they're also a crime against humanity a crime whose impact will be felt long after the guns full silent there is no justification for a war crime war crimes are war crimes The Taking of hostages by Hamas is a war crime that does not justify Israel then committing 14 months of war crimes in Gaza in 2023 Muhammad Ahmed was selling water from a private company in Gaza City to residents of the Shati refugee camp back then the public water supply was only available for a few hours a day and it was mixed with seawater to boost Supply Gaza residents spent around a third of their income on water paying people like Muhammad to fill the tanks in their houses after the ceasefire we tried to contact him for some time without success the shy refugee camp where he lives was hit by multiple air strikes and there is evidence Israeli forces have been actively targeting water workers with phone service often cut off our our team went to look for him in the camp and were relieved to find him alive and well his truck was bombed by an Israeli drone but he's still delivering water to his customers as gaza's water system was left in ruins the Taps dried up and it was up to people like Muhammad to step in with no running water today these trucks are the only way to get water in Gaza so we were transferred into a very primary way of of uh providing service by tankering water so we were obliged only to use water tankers in order to transport and dispute uh water to the displaced people 59% of casualties in Gaza are women children and elderly population so these aren't combatants and to read reports then if women who are mixing contaminated water with formula simply to try to feed their babies that these women unable to feed their children themselves doing everything they can and they're then risking the lives of their babies at that point Sorry in extended War children are around three times more more likely to die from diseases caused by unsafe water than from direct violence in 2024 studies showed that 90% of gaza's children under five were suffering from an infectious disease 70% of children were found to have diarrhea compared to just 3.4% in 2022 while 40,000 cases of hepatitis were reported in 2024 compared to just 85 cases in in pre-war Gaza the destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure in hospitals and healthc Care Facilities has led to an unprecedented risk of infection and death it was highly dangerous and not safe for the doctors and other healthc care providers to deliver Healthcare Services due to the systematic you know destruction of healthcare facilities we have witness the killing of thousands of healthcare providers in addition to the deliberate Detention of other providers who have been detained and tortured till death Israel claims the hospitals were used for military purposes the UN reports 136 attacks on hospitals in the first 9 months of the war pushing gaza's healthc care system to the brink of total collapse and unable to cope with an explosion in water bone diseases you know the water it's the essence of life and it's not that there is no life without water we have seen hundreds of thousands of cases diagnosed with infectious disease like diarrhea like gasis like gastroenteritis like JIS for example and those people they were mainly children and you know vulnerable population today people in Gaza are living off as little as 2 L of water per day seven times less than the minimum required by the World Health Organization and every day they have to spend hours trying to find it many families delegate the task to their children finding a water source and waiting in line is just the first step carrying these cans is heavy work for small hands some use makeshift trolleys to lighten the load but much of this water is contaminated and unsafe every sip carries the risk of illness or even death yet there is no alternative the water in Gaza has been horrifically bad for a very long time very high levels of contamination very high levels of salination that situ situation has only deteriorated precipitously we're never going to know the scale of this what are we going to see for the next years for these children the amputees growing up without hydration without food and without medical care the death and the disease and the impacts we're going to see for Generations as they are finally able to return to their homes Garin face a difficult question what do you do when your entire life your home everything you knew before has been utterly destroyed the answer for many Garin is we endure at Gaza

completely destroyed water power and Food Supplies but yet amid the ruins and the grief there are flickers of joy and the hope of people who refuse to surrender to despair farmer Muhammad khel water

          <attvalue for="7" value="panic chaos a young girl tries desperately to shake her brother back to life an Israeli drone has just struck a busy street in Gaza City israel insists it only targets Hamas but so many it kills the civilians when grief is so raw how do you put it in words can I get rid of it may God take revenge on you this woman screams her child one of more than 54,000 victims of Israel's assault death is constant in Gaza but that doesn't make it any easier to bear for everyone here Israel is guilty of genocide but some direct their anger at Hamas too may God punish you this distraught man says of one Hamas leader i pray you are killed too back at the scene of the attack a man is collecting pieces of human flesh in a plastic bag all he can do to give the victims a dignified burial this part of Gaza City is crammed with families who've been forced to flee from elsewhere since breaking the ceasefire in March the Israeli military has displaced more than 600,000 Palestinians un data shows that 82% of the Gaza Strip is now a declared militarized zone or under evacuation orders the entire population is somehow meant to live in less than a fifth of the territory that's supposedly safer israeli officials have suggested their aim now is to push Gazans towards the south where three of the new Israeli backed aid distribution sites have been built this afternoon the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation resumed operations after multiple instances of desperate Palestinians being shot trying to reach their site today's distribution passed off peacefully but the scheme has been widely criticized by the UN major charities and those forced to scrabble for something anything to feed their families we almost died in there we almost died all this to get some food for our children this is all I could get a bit of flour a bit of lentils and two packs of pasta working alongside Israeli forces under this new aid distribution scheme a new armed militia led by an alleged former Gazen criminal Yasa Abu Shabbab has previously been accused of running a looting gang from inside Israeli military controlled territory now his men are openly working with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation he denies wrongdoing and insists he's helping his people today after a political rival accused the Israeli prime minister of arming Abu Shabbab Benjamin Netanyahu released this video admitting to supporting clans in Gaza to rival Hamas all the time Israel's bombing campaign continues targeted this morning a group of journalists in a hospital courtyard their colleagues reporting on their deaths as they mourn the Israeli army said it had killed a member of the militant group Islamic [Music] Jihad but the three victims were all known to have worked in the media prior to the war yet more families torn apart by suffering which shows no sign of ending well joining me now the former Israeli Prime Minister Ehood Almouth and first of all your reaction to this revelation that Benjamin Netanyahu has been supporting a rival militia to Hamas jihadist Israel hating and potentially arming them i don't know what to say in as long as this militia is uh helpful in distributing the uh needs of the population in an effective way in cooperation with the Israelis maybe this is a positive step but I I'm not familiar with the facts to be able to judge it from a distance again I think that it is incumbent upon Israel to make sure that all the humanitarian needs of the population are provided in an effective manner this is very important this is our moral obligation how to do it it's not simple and as you can see I mean in this chaos which is part of Gaza today and as long as the military operations continue it's probably very complic so if the this militia is helpful in providing the needs and actually effectively providing the needs then maybe this is one way of coping with this difficulty now you have argued that Benjamin Netanyahu should now face war crimes charges can you explain why well I'm here using a terminology that I didn't use but yes what I said and I keep on saying is that when a war is uh declared by a majority of Israelis is not a result of any national security interest of the state of Israel when it is obvious and is accepted widely that uh there is not a chance that as a result of these operations we will be able to save the lives of the hostages perhaps on the contrary we may risk them and we may lose them if in this process of a war which is not waged because of national interest but as people say because of the political interest of the prime minister we're losing soldiers we may lose the hostages and quite a few Palestinians not involved are killed this is a crime and now I don't know whether it falls within the legal definitions of a war crime whatever but it doesn't matter it has to stop right now we have to end the war we have to return all the hostages and we have to make the necessary arrangements together with Egypt and Jordan and America and the Emirates and others in order to establish a new government in Gaza that will take over from Hamas this is what we need to do instead of continuing an unnecessary war kama and Emanuel Macron have both said they are considering further sanctions against members of the Israeli government would you support that well you don't want me to give equivalence on something that I'm not familiar with i can say this if uh um Benvir and Smriidge these two outspoken extremist messianic uh fundamentalist uh supporters of terror ministers senior cabinet ministers in Israeli government will continue to be representatives of the spirit of this government that I will not be surprised if uh friendly countries and I consider President Mcron to be a friend of state of Israel i know him i know what he thinks i know that he is committed to the uh best interest of the state of Israel not of the government of Israel but if he will decide to take measures against the specific individuals because of what they say and what they do I will not be surprised ahood Alma thank you very much indeed for joining us well earlier today the Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson Orurin Marmstein offered an interview it was on the basis that our agreation of four minutes couldn't be edited more people have been killed today in Israeli air strikes the British prime minister has described what's going on in Gaza as appalling and intolerable and is considering further sanctions the French are also considering sanctions what's your response hi Christian it's good to be on the show first I want to share with you some of the sentiment in Israel it's a very emotional day in Israel two of our hostages were are back they are back in a military operation they are dead this is Gadi and Judy 73 years old and 70 year old those are two cup two people grandpa and grandmother went for a morning walk and they were slaughtered and I I will ask you about this but I'd be grateful if you question i will answer i will answer i just want to share with you something that I heard before coming to this show this is the last phone call of Judy crying calling the emergency in a line saying &quot;My husband is just been shot i've been shot my h my husband brain is spilled o over come and help me.&quot; Unfortunately no one helped her she was slaughtered gadi was slaughtered and 56 more hostages are still in the hell nightmare called Hamas we want to see them back and every day that passes by just makes it more urgent to have our hostages released yes but your response to the international condemnation of what you're doing is what we're trying to share the situation as is with international comm community and international organization and the the situation is the following unfortunately kamas is still a threat an immediate threat to the people of Israel we are not in a situation in which we cannot vouch that we won't have another October 7 and this is why this war is still going on so you carry on i mean you the former defense minister Avdor Lieberman has said that Israel has been supplying weapons to a jihadist rival militia uh operating in Gaza under areas of Israeli control how is that happening so first I think the one making those statements needs to be asked but it hasn't been denied by the prime minister's office i think what the prime minister office published is that Israel is doing everything possible to fight Hamas including arming other militia i don't think they had it in in their statement so I think this is the the word are you not denying it no I'm I'm saying that we are doing everything possible to fight this evil what kind of person killed a 70-year-old grandma in her morning walk what kind of person takes Ariel and Kir Bibbas two babies and kidnap him if you can explain this to me which kind of what kind of of cause justify taking babies as hostages I I would be astonished and it's the lesson of what has happened in bringing back these two bodies that armed conflict is the way to get the hostages back because many of the hostage families fear that more of those who are still alive will be killed if this war carries on i think first we should listen and respect the hostages families i would say almost in a sacred way they are going through living hell i can't imagine having my my daughter my my my mother in captivity in Kamas but the war carries on because we're very tight for time i can't imagine so we we should listen to them but on the same time we should also judge what what proved to be very effective it's the combination of military operation and diplomatic means and if you allow me I can explain about the diplomatic means i'm afraid our time is up uh so Orura Masne thank you very much thank you thank you" />

Shalev, the current executive director of the group, connects the Israeli military’s targeting of healthcare workers and infrastructure in Gaza with its silencing of the great number of Palestinians who make up the medical workforce in Israel. The authors call for an international boycott of Israeli medical institutions, until “Israel stops its colonial project, [and] after the Palestinians receive liberation and self-determination.”&#10;&#10;Democracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on over 1,500 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

Sh earlier today Israel attacked the Ali Baptist Hospital in Gaza City it marked the eighth time the hospital has been attacked over the past 600 days three Palestinian journalists were killed at the hospital a fourth journalist was seriously wounded we turn now to look at how the Israeli medical establishment has responded to Israel's systematic attacks on Gaza's health system we're joined now by the co-authors of a new article headlined The Shame of Israeli Medicine published in the New York Review of Books joining us in Tel Aviv in Israel is the medical anthropologist Guy Shalv who serves as executive director of Physicians for Human Rights Israel and in London the Israeli political scientist Neve Gordon who is the first director of Physicians for Human Rights Israel he's a professor of international law and human rights at Queen Mary University of London we welcome you both to Democracy Now um Professor Ne Gordon let's begin with you uh talk about what you found what we found is that the support for Israel's assault on Gaza the genocidal assault including the decimation of its medical system including the killing of 1,400 health workers including the detention and disappearance of 400 uh medical doctors and health care workers including the torture of uh detainees has been supported by the Israeli medical establishment and through and through whether it's from the top the Israeli medical association that represents 95% of Israeli doctors the other health care associations including the nursing association and the psych ological associations and their ethical committees we found that that hospitals did not accept Palestinian detainees who were wounded and and and needed medical care we found that doctors inside hospitals were unwilling to treat Palestinian detainees or did not demand that the the shackles from their legs and their arms and their blindfold be removed before they were treated we found that doctors did not provide painkillers to Palestinians claiming that they should suffer from the pain we found doctors in Israeli hospitals that sent posted genocidal messages on their private uh social media accounts we found persecution of medical doctors and nurses Palestinian medical doctors and nurses in the Israeli establishment so there's a whole system the whole medical establishment inside Israel has been actually supporting Israel assault on the Palestinian people and particularly on its health care system now uh G Shalev you are joining us from Tel Aviv you are the uh executive director of Physicians for Human Rights Israel it is this organization your organization that gathered testimony from 24 of these Palestinian health workers can you explain how the testimony was collected and you know the key things what most surprised you about what you found right so first of all it was impossible to collect testimonies for many months since the beginning of the war uh in the beginning there was no access to detainees we could not send lawyers to visit them we could not have any kind of uh supervision of their conditions of how they're being held uh after uh approximately 6 months we could have uh starting could started to send lawyers to visit them to collect the testimonies uh and then what we heard was just uh impossible to hear uh doctors that were detained while they were doing their work in hospitals other doctors who were uh detained while crossing checkpoints across Gaza uh after they the the soldiers found out that they are doctors and then uh being taken to facilities in Israel most uh famous pro probably infamous is the man facility uh being subjected to torture medical neglect violence uh starvation um four doctor three doctors and one paramedic died in Israeli facilities uh these are four out of the 90 Palestinian detainees who died in the past 20 months um and we tried to figure out what was the the the reason why doctors were targeted in such a way uh and we realized that in their investigations they were asked uh to provide information or uh kind of reveal the structure of hospitals uh and what they know which is a violation of the international law and protection of medical workers you cannot detain a medical worker for the purpose of collecting information if you don't have any evidence that they violated any law uh and in fact these people most of these people were held without a trial without uh charges uh many of them are still held approximately 150 medical personnel are still held in Israeli detention facilities and Gala you also point to an extraordinary statistic uh regarding the number of Palestinians who work in the Israeli medical establishment you say Palestinians comprise 25% of all doctors and almost 50% of all new doctors and nurses in Israel so can you explain uh how they have been treated uh in the month since October 7th these Palestinians who work in Israeli hospitals right and yes first of all these are amazing numbers and this is the outcome of a long process of many years of Palestinians uh studying medicine both in Israel and abroad and choosing medicine as their kind of profession for the reasons that many people in the world choose that profession but also for the reason that many minorities and uh uh people of uh marginal communities cho choose medicine because they see that as an opportunity for social mobility an opportunity to be accepted as equal and that is why we see a lot of doctors in the Israeli medical system and unfortunately this ideal of a system that is uh that considers them as equal uh was was never a reality and definitely not not after October 7 when there was basically a witch hunt of Palestinian medical workers in the Israeli system uh social media profiles were scanned to see whatever they're posting there and then uh a very large number of uh doctors and medical workers were uh uh subjected to to hearings uh and other kind of uh processes uh including firing doctors and medical workers for just mo the most basic uh social media posts such as supporting uh children in Gaza or just feeling compassion for the people of Gaza um and it created this atmosphere that basically silenced and censored an entire group of uh doctors and medical workers in the Israeli system we're speaking with two of the three authors of the piece the shame of Israeli medicine published in the New York Review of Books we're speaking with the medical anthropologist Shalev in Tel Aviv and with Ne Gordon professor speaking to us from London the third author is Dr osama Tanus a pediatrician board member of Physicians for Human Rights Israel he was advised by his lawyers not to do the interview um Ghalev can you explain why yes this is exactly what we we just talked about uh it is just too risky for a Palestinian citizen of Israel to be publicly uh kind of resisting the war publicly criticizing the Israeli establishment and we've seen uh cases for example professor Nad Shalhub a very famous professor in the Hebrew university who participated in was interviewed in a podcast and was later uh had to resign from the university for very basic kind of critical opinions professional critical opinions she had over the Israeli policies in Gaza um so the the risk is unfortunately high and we are we're sorry that his voice is silenced once more once again because Nev and I are here and Osama is not and Professor Neve Gordon if you could say what exactly are you calling for well I think what we managed to show in the article is the complicity of the Israeli medical establishment with Israel's egregious violations of international law including uh the genocide convention and what we also know uh from past experience and from what we detail in the article is that change will not emerge from within without pressure from without and so what we think or at least I think is that the international medical establishment and medical community needs to put pressure on their counterparts in Israel in order that they raise their voice against Israel's policies the Israeli medical establishment in general identifies with Israel's colonial project and puts the colonial project over the most basic ethical principles of their profession and that we think needs to change so one very practical uh idea is that students and staff in uh research institutions in the United States Canada in the UK in Europe map the kinds of partnerships their institutions have with Israeli medical institutions with Israeli research teams with Israeli medical corporations ations and demand from their own institutions to cut these partnership to cut ties with these partnerships to to end the contracts with Israeli medical corporations not as a principle but as a strategy saying to the is their Israeli counterparts we'll be happy to carry out these partnerships again will hap be happy to do business but only after Israel stops its colonial project after the Palestinians receive liberation and self-determination it is time we think that the international community boycott the Israeli establishment in order to bring about change and to stop this genocide we're witnessing ne Gordon want to thank you for being with us israeli political scientist the first director of physicians for human rights Israel he's professor of international law and human rights at Queen Mary University of London speaking to us from London and Ghalev executive director of Physicians for Human Rights Israel speaking to us from Tel Aviv we'll link to your new article The Shame of Israeli
