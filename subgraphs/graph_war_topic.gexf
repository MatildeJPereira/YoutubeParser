          <attvalue for="3" value="Is Syria stabilizing? Six months after the dramatic fall of the Assad regime, Syria finds itself at a critical crossroads. While the collapse of the long-standing dictatorship shocked the Middle East, hopes for a swift transition to peace and stability remain uncertain. The new administration, led by Ahmed al-Sharaa and backed by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), has made tentative moves towards governance and reform—including an interim constitution and a new cabinet—but deep concerns persist. With HTS's jihadist roots, questions about future democratic development and sectarian tensions loom large, particularly after revenge attacks against minorities and fears of rising Islamist influence. Despite these risks, many Syrians and international observers cautiously await signs of lasting stability.&#10;&#10;Internationally, the new Syrian government has made surprising diplomatic gains. Turkey has emerged as a strong ally, and even Western nations have shown a willingness to engage—highlighted by Sharaa’s meeting with US President Trump. Sanctions have been lifted, and Gulf states are offering economic aid, raising hopes for reconstruction. But serious obstacles remain: destroyed infrastructure, widespread poverty, and a fragile internal security environment. With the threat of insurgency, Israeli military action, and the risk of Syria becoming a proxy battleground, the country’s long-term future is far from secure.

          <attvalue for="7" value="Is Syria finally stabilizing? It's now been 6 months since the 50-year-old  Assad regime was toppled in the country. But while this sent shockwaves  throughout the Middle East and   the broader international community, many  were concerned about the implications it   would have for a country that's long been  regarded as a pivotal actor in the region. So half a year on, how is Syria now doing? Hello and welcome. If you're new to the channel,  my name is James Ker-Lindsay and   here I take an informed look at international  relations, conflict, security and statethood. We often tend to think that  when a side wins a civil war,   the conflict is over and the country  enters a new phase of peace and stability. But of course, this is usually far from the case. The new regime often faces  a multitude of problems. As well as the challenge of  establishing a new government,   they're also faced with stabilizing the economy. And in many cases, the internal security  situation remains precarious as other factions,   including elements loyal to the previous  regime, often continue to fight on. To add to all this, external parties can often  complicate efforts to ease the situation. An excellent example of this is Syria. Since overthrowing the Assad regime, the new   administration has faced numerous  internal and external challenges. But 6 months on, is the country  finally on the path to stability? Syria, more officially known as the Syrian  Arab Republic, is situated in the Middle East. To its north lies Turkey. To its east is Iraq. And to its south is Jordan. To its west, it shares borders with Israel  and Lebanon and has a Mediterranean coastline. While its population is estimated to  be around 21 million, exact figures are   unavailable as many millions fled  the country during the civil war. And while most Syrians are Arab, there are  also Kurdish, Skassian and Turk communities. As for religion, while three quarters  of the population are Sunni Muslims,   the country also has Christians and other Muslim  minorities, including Shia, Druze, and Alawites. While Syria has a long history that  stretches back to ancient times,   after centuries of Ottoman rule, it came under  French control following the First World War. This lasted until 1945, when  it gained its independence and   became a founding member of the United Nations. However, following independence, the  country soon fell into political turmoil. Following its unsuccessful attack on the new  state of Israel in 1948, the country experienced   prolonged unrest, as well as a succession  of military coups between 1949 and 1961. It also entered a brief political union with  Egypt, becoming the United Arab Republic. But in the end, things began to change in  1966, when a young Alawite Air Force general,   Hafez al-Assad, became Minister of  Defence, thus beginning his rise to power. Although Syria suffered another defeat in the 1967  war against Israel, Assad held on to his position. And in 1970, he led another coup,  becoming president the following year. Assad's presidency marked  a turning point for Syria. Imposing an authoritarian and highly  repressive regime that elevated Alawites   to key government roles, he focused  Syrian foreign policy against the West. As well as becoming a major opponent  of Israel and the United States,   earning Syria the label of a  state sponsor of terrorism,   Assad expanded the country's regional influence  by intervening in Lebanon and aligning with Iran. But after 30 years in power, Hafez al-Assad died  in 2000 and was succeeded by his son Bashar. Although the younger Assad was  initially seen as a potential reformer,   he in fact continued his father's dictatorship. However, in 2011, everything changed  with the start of the Arab Spring. As mass protests erupted in Syria,  Assad launched a brutal crackdown,   and from there the country  quickly descended into civil war. At first, the opposition appeared to be  gaining the upper hand, especially as   much of the Arab world and the international  community lined up against the Assad regime. However, despite widespread calls for US   and Western direct intervention to  help the rebels, Washington refused. But I have resisted calls for military action   because we cannot resolve someone  else's civil war through force. With Russian military intervention,  combined with continuing support from Iran,   government forces began to regain lost territory. And by 2020, the situation  had been largely reversed. Although rebel and Kurdish groups still  held areas in the north and northeast,   and various Islamist groups  continued to operate in the east,   Assad had effectively reasserted  control over most of the country. Indeed, having now seemingly won the war,   Syria began to regain international acceptance,  including full membership in the Arab League. But although the Syrian war now seemed to be  over, things weren't quite as they appeared. Within the country, opposition forces   were regrouping and strengthening  their control over the Northwest. Likewise, the international  context was also changing. With Russia focused on Ukraine and Iran  weakened following Israel's war against   Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon,  the chance came to strike against Assad. In late November 2024, the civil war reignited. Led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham,  an offshoot of al-Qaeda that   allied with Turkish-backed forces, the  rebels launched a surprise offensive. With Assad's forces offering little resistance  and no external support from traditional allies,   they rapidly closed in on the  country's capital Damascus. On 7 December 2024, Assad fled to Moscow, marking  the end of half a century of his family's rule. In his place, a new HTS government was formed  under the group's leader Ahmed Al-Sharaa,   who became the new president of Syria. I hope you're finding this useful. If so, please do give it a like and perhaps  subscribe to the channel if you haven't already. Thanks so much, and now back to the video. While the end of the Assad regime certainly marked   a landmark moment for Syria, how  has the country fared since then? In truth, it's been a mixed picture. First of all, there's the question of governance. While many may have cheered Assad's demise,  many also feared the incoming administration,   especially given HTS's links to  al-Qaeda and al-Shara's militant past. But so far, things appear  more positive than expected. At least on the surface, HTS has transitioned  from Islamism to Syrian nationalism,   and from a militant insurgent  group to a national government. In January 2025, an interim  constitution was introduced. And in March, a cabinet was  established under al-Sharaa. However, hopes that this will eventually lead  to an inclusive democracy seem premature. Alshara has already suggested that it could  take up to five years before elections are held,   although many suspect that these  may never in fact even happen. Furthermore, the government remains  relatively unrepresentative. For instance, Hind Kabawat is the sole  female and only Christian minister. Yet, lurking behind this is a more profound fear. Despite the administration's  relatively moderate tone,   there are concerns that it may revert to its  Islamist roots at some point in the future. As for international relations, the new government  has had a better start than many expected. In marked contrast to the Taliban in Afghanistan,   which remains shunned by the international  community, many countries have given the   new Syrian government the benefit  of the doubt, at least for now. Aside from the strong support from Turkey,  which has become a key international ally   of the new government, many Arab states  are working with the new administration. Likewise, many Western countries have also shown  a willingness to engage with the new government. This was graphically highlighted when al-Sharaa   met with US President Donald  Trump in Saudi Arabia in mid-May. However, there are still grounds for concern. While the Syrian government has  severed the country's ties with Iran,   the government seems to be engaging with Russia,   with reports suggesting that al-Sharaa may permit  Moscow to maintain its military bases in Syria. This will no doubt worry Western observers. Furthermore, the relationship with Turkey  may not be as firm as it outwardly appears. Scepticism towards Turkey is deeply  rooted in much of the Arab world,   particularly in the regions that  were once under Ottoman control. This could eventually lead to  tensions between the two neighbours. However, the most pressing issue is Israel. As the Assad regime collapsed, Israeli  troops advanced further into the country,   establishing a security zone and  targeting critical military sites. While the Israeli government insists that this  is temporary, many fear another land grab. In addition to the Galan Heights, which  Israel seized in 1967 and annexed in 1981,   this will further complicate peace  talks between the two countries,   something the US is now actively calling for. All the while, there are also  fears that Syria may well   become a proxy battleground for Israel and Turkey. An issue I covered in another recent video. Thirdly, the country also faces  enormous economic challenges. The impact of the civil war has been immense. Much of the country's infrastructure  has been destroyed, and estimates   suggest that over 16 million people  are still in need of humanitarian aid. In addition, the country faces a possible  influx of returnees as many countries try   to persuade refugees to return now  that the war appears to be over. But again, there are signs of hope. Both the United States and the European Union  have now lifted sanctions on the country. Meanwhile, Gulf Arab nations,  including Saudi Arabia and Qatar,   have stepped in to provide crucial support,  including funds to pay government salaries. But while this should hopefully begin to  alleviate the immediate economic problems,   the longerterm picture is less certain. Syria requires enormous funds  to rebuild, and without these,   the overall situation may start to deteriorate. And this brings us to the fourth and most pressing  immediate issue: the internal security situation. So far, the new government has consolidated  its control over large parts of the country. Crucially, the prospect of a  significant new conflict in   the Kurdish held northeast seems to have receded. Although the Kurds established considerable  self-ruule throughout the civil war,   they've seemingly accepted the government's broad  authority and the unity of the Syrian state. However, there are questions about  how deeply rooted all this is,   especially since the Kurdish areas will want  formal autonomy under any new constitution. Meanwhile, there are still serious  concerns in many other areas. For instance, there have been  disturbing attacks against the   minorities in the country, as  was highlighted in March 2025,   when Alawites were killed in what many saw  as revenge attacks against the community. Likewise, tensions have also been  growing with the country's DRS community. To add to all this, several armed groups  continue to pose a major challenge. These include the Syrian popular resistance,  made up of Assad loyalists, and Islamic State,   which continues to operate in parts of the East. All the while, questions about the government's   ideological agenda continue  to worry many observers. For instance, the decision  to integrate 3500 foreign   jihadists into the National Army has  raised fears about radicalization. That said, the plan has been  backed by the United States,   which sees it as a way to  keep the fighters in check. And it's for all these reasons that  Syria's path to lasting peace and   stability remains fraught with serious challenges. The complex mixture of governance,  security and economic problems will   pose significant challenges for the  new government in the period ahead. But even if there may be doubts  about the government's direction,   there seems to be little choice but to press  on and support al-Sharaa, at least for now. Whatever doubts may exist is also balanced  by the realization that there's no credible   alternative and that Syria still faces  numerous internal and external threats. If the administration falls, Syria could  well be plunged into even deeper chaos. While Assad may now be gone, Syria  still faces a precarious future. I hope you found that useful. If so, here are some more videos on Syria and  the Middle East that you might find useful." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="the talk of a ceasefire in Gaza is it real or just political theater if it's the latter why do news organizations keep falling for it we get the Hamas perspective on the negotiations the pitfalls and the patterns ukraine Russia drone strikes on both sides of the border and peace talks there that have gone nowhere plus the logging off club young people checking out of social media for their own good it is a recurring pattern in the ceasefire negotiations the ones aimed at ending the carnage Israel continues to inflict on Palestinians in Gaza proposals surface hopes rise then the talks collapse and the responsibility for that along with the eyes of international news outlets all land in the same place on Hamas israel agreed Hamas rejected it is a framing that is so familiar it rarely gets questioned but behind that characterization lies a deeper imbalance and it goes beyond military power it's about the narrative one that casts the Palestinian side as irrational obstructive inherently violent while somehow portraying Israel even at its most brutal its most genocidal as credible reporting the story that way has a suffocating effect on what news consumers are looking for the truth and it happens over and over again international news organizations should have it figured out by now but it's not as though they're being played by Israeli propaganda it's more like they're playing along when ceasefire talks fail as they did in the latest round of negotiations involving Israel Hamas and the United States the question that news consumers want answered is a basic one why and there is a journalistic urge to assign blame point fingers hamas has rejected a US proposed ceasefire deal for the Middle East conflict now it's Hamas uh that has uh issues uh with the plan uh when examining the headlines coming out of the international media the sound bites produced in various news studios the answer couldn't be simpler there's multiple articles and headlines that speak of how Hamas failed in the negotiating table where Hamas's position and the Palestinian position more broadly is discarded and Israel's position is basically advanced and trying to always blame the victims blame the Palestinians for their own undoing this is this is a a a trajectory of a policy that has been uh going on since the outset of the war and continues on all major news media in the west specifically when in fact by Israel's own admission by the Israeli media's own admission it's Israel that has often torpedoed a lot of these processes to obstruct even coming close to something of a ceasefire agreement israeli media had themselves disclosed that is that Netanyahui himself had torpedoed nine different attempts where Hamas were asking for something as basic as handing all hostages over in exchange for just preventing a ground invasion but it has been very convenient for both the US and Israel to blame the resistance when things have gone wrong when Israel has tried to torpedo any process of serious talks hamas had image problems internationally long before October 7th 20123 often framed as a barbaric terrorist organization the resistance movement reinforced that reputation through the brutality of its attacks on Israeli civilians that day and Hamas's strategy of capturing those atrocities on video for the world to see that imagery also had an eradicating effect on the context of the larger story in Gaza decade after decade of Israel's illegal occupation more monstrous and often misleading labels were then attached to Hamas terms that are seldom applied to Israel and the genocide it is inflicting on Gaza war crimes on a scale that dwarfs what Hamas did on October 7th it is a moral disparity a colonial mentality that taints the international news coverage of the ceasefire negotiations including the most recent talks where the third party at the table was Israel's closest and most important ally the US in this latest round I think the fingerpointing was mostly on Hamas largely because of the spokespeople that we heard speaking to it steve Wickoff the main negotiator from the US who essentially framed it that way saying Israel agreed to this hamas said no and changed the terms it is true that Hamas said no to the deal because it was a deal that made more on Israel's terms than through a process that would lead to an end of the war hamas's demands within um these ceasefire agreements are not outside the remmits of international law the full withdrawal of Israeli forces allowing for the uninhibited entry of of aid into Gaza and a permanent sessation of hostilities yet for some reason Western media insists on presenting these as unreasonable illegitimate demands how this narrative has been able to persist as long as it has is completely unfathomable as a spokesperson for Hamas Basam Naim has appeared on multiple media outlets albeit less often than Israeli spokespeople do naim has been privy to the ceasefire negotiations including the latest round of talks involving the Trump administration and Steve Witoff although Hamas's side of the story is usually given less credence and less airtime than the Israeli version it is one that news consumers could use considerably more of especially those who depend on American and international media platforms to understand what is happening in Gaza witkoff certainly contributed to reinforcing this negative portrayal we spoke to him in the last round of these negotiations and agreed on a plan to end this war he said our talks were positive and constructive but when he spoke to the Israeli side he came back with another proposal saying it was the only one available so this is the second time or even third that Witoff agrees with us on something and then makes a U-turn this prejudice towards Hames and the Palestinians is reflected in the American and international media because his voice carries weight within Gaza Hamas has been out to control the narrative it has suppressed journalists at times and even abducted some the movement was voted into office in 2006 and polls taken since the October 7th attacks have persistently shown that only 20 to 30% of the population supports Hamas censorship is common however during times of war and Gaza is no exception so Palestinians expressing dissent and those reporting on it don't have it easy many people in Gaza are very reluctant to openly speak out against Hamas many said that October 7th whatever anyone thinks about a right to resistance that Hamas had not prepared the population for it they had no plan for how the population was going to be impacted but there's also a lot of musling within Gaza by Hamas of journalists critiquing Hamas for those who are outside there's an idea that uh criticizing Hamas is somehow counter to being in solidarity with Palestinians many people off the record will be very critical but are very hesitant to be on the record as criticizing uh Hamas at least while the war is still ongoing there's no free flow of information necessarily hamas did crack down on some of the journalists and pressured them sometimes through imprisonment these oppressions that happen against journalists which are a problem in their own right are overblown to actually legitimize the daily violence and massacres that are happening in the Gaza Strip we should not overblow these violations as a as a means to completely discredit Hamas or exclude it from the political space uh more broadly Hamas is far from the biggest threat to journalism in the Gaza Strip unlike the Israelis it has not banned the international media from entering the war zone to bear witness document a genocide nor has it targeted journalists the way Israeli forces have killing more than 200 of them one would think that the casualty figures alone the slaughtering of so many reporters would generate more empathy among Western journalists and the news outlets that provide their paychecks the fact that it doesn't is a story in itself another measure of what Palestinians in Gaza are up against there is an enormous global media machine that's run by the Americans and the Zionists they pump out large amounts of media material to lie distort and fabricate we keep trying to present our position but journalists don't really engage and even if they do our statements will be at the bottom of their report the mainstream media is not impartial on the contrary it's been directly involved in this war and the negotiations in favor of the Israeli enemy and since the beginning of the war the mainstream media have adopted the Israeli narrative even though it was false hamas is not under represented hamas is over represented but as a profane barbaric actor that is irrational completely out of the realm of human possibility this is the dominant representation of Hamas this goes to tell us that this mainstream western media is is completely complicit in the ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip backing the government's policies in their countries in the UK in the US in Canada and other places of complete backing and political cover for Israel as it conducts in the war therefore the media is basically reframing what is happening in negotiations in a way that serves the continuation of American UK European policy of diplomatic cover and of course of material support for this genocide that is going on in the Gaza Strip moving further east now where negotiations to end the war between Russia and Ukraine have also come up short an audacious Ukrainian drone attack on multiple Russian airfields has revived the spectre of a possible nuclear confrontation tarak Nafa has been tracking the messaging around this story as a second round of direct peace talks between Moscow and Kiev ended this week without a major breakthrough Ukraine's security service posted and heavily publicized footage of a huge drone attack on its neighbor called Operation Spiderweb the coordinated drone strikes took place deep inside Russian territory reportedly damaging or destroying more than 40 military aircraft including bombers capable of dropping nuclear weapons that provided Ukrainian officials with a shot in the arm for their war narrative domestically and globally news outlets in the country have been running wall-to-wall coverage of what they called an historic operation ai generated videos paying tribute to the head of Ukraine's security services Vasel Maluk have since gone viral he's being hailed as a national hero operation Spiderweb has also boosted President Vladimir Zilinsk's image in international news outlets which had taken a serious beating as his popularity in Ukraine has tanked over in Russia the muted media coverage of the drone attacks tells a story of its own initial reporting featured short official statements from regional officials who failed to explain how Ukraine was able to pull off such an extensive attack since then the story has vanished from Russian news broadcasts president Vladimir Putin hasn't directly addressed the drone strikes but did accuse Ukraine of terrorist acts putin made no mention of Russia's own drone attacks on Ukraine the largest of which took place last month including on civilian areas thanks TK there is a trend emerging in mobile phone and social media use it's

now acknowledge how harmful that can be social media platforms plead not guilty they argue they have safety measures built into their systems like content monitoring and screen time limiters some governments have even proposed restrictions on young people signing up to social media however to combat loneliness mental health pressures and what seems to be an inability to function IRL in real

their phones in a bucket with us and just get talking to each other and get involved in the activities usually people feel lighter when they hand out the phone as if some sort of responsibility or obligation was put away and I think that comes from that sense of hyperconivity but of course there's other people that have a more difficult time and might experience some anxiety at first so this is why we provide some gentle guidance and usually through time they all reach that joy of being offline we felt like we were living our lives on super speed never really taking the time to stand still reflect and be off of our phones and actually be present with ourselves but also with the people around us we always say we want to become the third space for people to come relax and also translate it into different ways of enjoying being offline a third space is an environment in which people meet each other in person they can be churches they could be cafes they could be shopping centers gyms swimming pools libraries is a big one as well one of the things that younger generations have probably recognized is that these spaces are less accessible sometimes they've been shut down sometimes uh they don't operate in ways that are necessarily conducive for social interaction and as a result the attempt to start third space adjacent groups logging off clubs running clubs and dinner clubs but the whole point is that they're trying to kind of create social experiences that older generations may have taken for granted around the world screen time is skyrocketing modern urban life is packed full of screens but the The most addictive one fits right in the palm of your hand the bright display the notifications your email messaging apps and fitness trackers all in one device and most alluringly the possibilities of endless scrolling on social media phone addiction affects people of all generations but it's a particular scourge for Gen Z it is eroded attention spans anxiety over body image has spiraled and loneliness has become something of an epidemic it's paradoxical because the social media platforms that a majority of experts blame for Gen Z's isolation make big claims of creating social connection while most other tech companies focus on how people interact with technology we focus on building technology so people can interact with each other snapchat was built to enhance relationships between friends family and the world without Tik Tok I personally would lose that sense of community that I found within the app increasingly governments are responding to this crisis starting in December this year Australia will be implementing a ban on social media for children under the age of 16 many other countries have similar legislation under consideration governments need to recognize that social media addiction and technology addiction is a real phenomena and they should treat it more like a public health issue they need to also recognize that social media platforms and technology interact with every aspect of our society they are utilities and in the same way that governments regulate water electricity other types of utilities we use dayto-day these types of social technologies should be considered to be regulated in a similar way i definitely understand where the policy of regulating the use of social media comes from however it is rather a more sustainable approach where we educate people and provide them with tools to become more aware of what they need the technology for and have alternatives to scrolling by having offline habits reading a book and and experiencing the the benefits of that legislation like social media bans is definitely more of a reactive and band-aid solution to a bigger systemic problem that we have i mean I totally understand why governments and parents might feel like that is the solution to the immediate risk of many of the harms that we face online but what would actually be impactful is banning addictive algorithms because that is the problem here and that is why so many of us experience these types of harms while some governments grapple with the impact of phone addiction on young people older generations especially those with money aren't waiting around don't you want to take a break from emails notifications noise in the past few years a market has opened up for luxury getaways retreats to green resorts where people can put away their phones and immerse themselves in a wellness routine at Unplugged we help busy city folk like you get away from your devices so that you can recharge our off-grid cabins are nestled in nature i think it's important that when we talk about digital detoxing we recognize that there is a class divide and on one side there are very rich people CEOs or company executives who can afford to spend thousands and thousands of dollars going on these retreats and outsourcing their digital activity to people so that they can have um device free experiences but on the other side the people who often work for them are zero hour contract workers or gig economy workers for whom being online determines whether they get to eat that night or not i think it's definitely a privilege to to be able to log off and be offline uh especially because our lives are built around technology these days if you're working with a laptop or studying online course you do need to log in every day you cannot just put the laptop or phone away and live off grit and same if you're living away from your loved ones it is your only way to to keep connected to them so this is why they they call it the luxury like being offline is the new luxury because most of us I would say cannot really afford that tech companies can see there's a problem the lucrative young users they're all chasing want to live at least some part of their lives offline everyone has that one annoying app that they're most addicted to you know that one i hate these notifications how do you monetize someone's need to get away from you you say you are part of the solution but great technology should improve life not distract from it we came up with a range of ideas to help people find a balance that's right for them i do think that there is this irony in tech companies trying to use technology to solve the problems that they themselves have caused and so with these apps that are designed to reduce the amount of time that people spend on social media it doesn't solve the underlying problem what it says is that there are bad apps and there are good apps and if you subscribe to the good app then we can give you a better online experience rather than tackling the underlying problem which is that a user is spending too much time on their phones and not enough time in their social lives and it's really interesting to see now that AI is being sold to us as the solution to that very loneliness that has come as a result of this type of technology we're building this meta AI um it's our we call it personal AI that should like get to know you and like what you think is funny and like what you ate right so that way you know it can like or you know what your hobbies are so that way it can kind of relate to you there is this real push back and awareness among all of us that these are not true and that technology is not the solution and finally a revelation from one of Washington's former frontmen as the State Department spokesperson under the Biden administration Matthew Miller was the face of its diplomatic messaging operation miller made a name for himself and not in a good way good afternoon everyone day after day he defended the US's support of Israel by either dodging questions about all of the evidence coming out of Gaza or flatout denying that Israel was committing war crimes we continue to support uh Israel's right to defend itself when it comes to um uh potential violations of international humanitarian law we have our ongoing assessments um and they have not concluded recently Miller went on a podcast produced for the UK broadcaster Sky News where he admitted without hesitation or a trace of shame that he had been lying that the war crimes were and are real do you think what's going on in Gaza now is a genocide i don't I don't think it's a genocide but I think the um I think it is without a doubt true that Israel has committed war crimes you wouldn't have said that at the podium yeah look because I when you're at the podium you're not expressing your personal opinion you're expressing the conclusions of the United States government this is not the first such Maya moment politicians public figures even news outlets are now repositioning themselves in most cases it has more to do with protecting reputations than seeing the light people complicit in this genocide pretending they were always against it" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="The Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990) stands as one of the most complex and devastating conflicts of the modern era, driven by deep-rooted sectarian tensions, political power struggles, and major foreign interventions. This video explores the origins of the conflict, from Lebanon’s colonial past and demographic imbalances to the fragile National Pact power-sharing system. As the country’s Muslim population grew and Palestinian refugees poured in following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and later the expulsion of the PLO from Jordan, internal divisions deepened. By 1975, religious militias, economic disparity, and competing ideological movements exploded into a full-scale civil war.&#10;&#10;The video also examines how the conflict evolved into a regional crisis, with direct interventions by Syria, Israel, and Iran, and the emergence of Hezbollah. We delve into major turning points such as the Israeli invasion of 1982, the Sabra and Shatila massacre, and the Taif Agreement of 1989 that ended the war but entrenched sectarianism. Despite post-war reconstruction, Lebanon remains plagued by unresolved grievances, weak institutions, and ongoing external interference. With keywords including Middle East conflict, sectarianism, civil war, Hezbollah, and peacebuilding, this documentary provides essential context for understanding one of the most pivotal and enduring crises in international relations.&#10;&#10;VIDEO CHAPTERS&#10;00:00 Introduction and Titles&#10;00:41 Complex Civil Wars and Lebanon&#10;01:13 Lebanon: Location and Population&#10;01:57 A Brief History of Lebanon&#10;02:38 The Emergence of Political Tensions in Lebanon&#10;04:52 The Start of the Lebanese Civil War&#10;06:30 Foreign Intervention in the Lebanese Civil War&#10;08:26 The End of the Lebanese Civil War&#10;10:04 Lebanon Since the Civil War&#10;11:21 The Impact of the Lebanese Civil War&#10;&#10;SUPPORT THE CHANNEL&#10;If you like my videos, please subscribe or become a Channel Member.

          <attvalue for="7" value="The Lebanese Civil War was one of the  most complex conflicts of the modern era. Lasting for 15 years, it claimed at least 150,000  lives and displaced over a million people. And even today, its effects are still being felt. But behind it lay an extraordinarily  complicated web of religious tensions,   political rivalries, and foreign interventions. So what exactly caused the Lebanese civil  war, and just how was it eventually resolved? Hello and welcome. If you're new to the channel,  my name is James Ker-Lindsay,   and here I take an informed look at international  relations, conflict, security, and statehood. When we think of civil wars, we often imagine  two sides battling for control of a country. But whilst some civil wars may indeed  involve a relatively straightforward   struggle between two opposing forces,  many aren't nearly so straightforward. Instead, they can involve a wide array of internal  and external factions, all battling for power. One of the best examples in modern international  relations is the Lebanese civil war. Indeed, it's a testament to the  extraordinary complexity of some conflicts. Lebanon lies at the eastern  end of the Mediterranean Sea,   approximately ten and a half  thousand km or 4,000 square miles. Its immediate neighbors are Syria to the  north and east, and Israel to its south. With a current population of around 5.7  million, at the start of the war in 1975   the number of inhabitants lay around  2.7 million and was highly diverse,   with almost 20 different recognized  ethnic and religious communities. In addition to Maronite Christians and Sunni and  Shia Muslims, these included Druze, Armenians,   Alawites, Jews, Palestinians, and  numerous smaller Christian sects,   including Greek Orthodox, Copts, and Protestants. Lebanon has an exceptionally long and rich  history that spans thousands of years. In ancient times, the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans,   and Arabs all contributed to the country's  diverse cultural and religious heritage. Then in the early 16th century, it  was conquered by the Ottoman Empire,   marking the beginning of  400 years of Turkish rule. This lasted until 1920, when Lebanon  came under French rule following   the disintegration of the Ottoman  Empire after the First World War. However, 20 years later, this also  came to an end as France came under   Nazi occupation during the Second World War. Lebanon declared independence. At the heart of the new  state was the National Pact. This divided power between the dominant  religious groups in the country. Based on the 1932 census, which  showed a slight Christian majority,   it stipulated that the president  would always be a Maronite Christian,   the prime minister a Sunni Muslim, and the  speaker of the parliament a Shia Muslim. But while the pact provided a framework  for cooperation, problems gradually   emerged as the Muslim population increased and  demanded a greater share of political power. Additionally, another crucial factor now emerged. In 1948, Lebanon sided with  the Palestinians and other   Arab nations to attack the new state of Israel. However, when they were defeated, tens of  thousands of predominantly Muslim Palestinians   fled into Lebanon, further destabilizing the  delicate religious balance in the country. The first sign of trouble  came in 1958, when tensions   erupted between pro-Western Christian  factions and pan-Arab Muslim groups. Although the crisis was resolved through  US intervention and a short-lived United   Nations peacekeeping force, it was a crucial  sign of the country's escalating differences. By the 1960s, Lebanon was facing real problems. As the power-sharing system devised 20 years  earlier no longer reflected the country's   population, the Muslim communities,  particularly the Shiite population,   felt increasingly marginalized in a system  that cemented Christian political dominance. At the same time, significant economic  disparities also fed broader social tensions. While the Christians were seen as wealthy,   a substantial part of the Shiite  Muslim population lived in poverty. Meanwhile, the Palestinians  became a significant problem. Although Palestinian militants based in Lebanon  had long staged attacks on northern Israel,   this escalated dramatically in September  1970 when nearby Jordan expelled the   Palestinian Liberation Organization,  the leading Palestinian armed group. As the PLO now moved to Lebanon, this  further destabilized the country. As a result, by the mid-1970s the  situation had become precarious. Aside from the growing demands for  political, economic, and social reform,   the steady erosion of state authority  and the shifting demographic balance   all contributed to a profound  mistrust amongst the communities. As religious factionalism grew  and tensions escalated between   the Christians and Palestinians,  various armed militias now emerged. Ultimately, the turning  point came on 13 April 1975,   when Palestinian militants attempted  to assassinate Pierre Gemayel,   the leader of the Kataeb, or Phalangist  Party, the main Christian militia. In response, militants murdered  27 Palestinians traveling through   a Christian neighborhood in  the country's capital, Beirut. From there, things rapidly escalated as  the Lebanese National Movement, the LNM,   which comprised primarily of leftist  and Muslim factions, allied with the   PLO to oppose the Christian-dominated  Lebanese Front, led by the Phalangists. As the communities put up barricades to  seal themselves off, Beirut was quickly   divided into Christian and Muslim sectors  along the heavily fortified Green Line. In the months that followed,  things rapidly deteriorated. As the government's authority  collapsed and the national army   split into Christian and Muslim  factions, the militias expanded. In addition to the PLO, the  Phalangists, and the LNM,   at least a dozen other Christian groups emerged  alongside Sunni, Shia, and Druze armed groups. But as complex as things were, the situation  was about to become even more complicated. As the civil war intensified, what started as an  internal conflict soon drew in outside actors. In June 1976, Syria invaded, sending  in tens of thousands of troops. But while Damascus insisted that its  intervention was to restore order and   prevent a Palestinian-Muslim victory, which  many feared would prompt an Israeli invasion,   the Palestinian attacks on Israel  continued over the following decade. As a result, on 6 June 1982,  Israel finally invaded,   pushing northwards to the outskirts of Beirut. This prompted one of the worst atrocities  of the war, when Christian Phalangists,   supported by Israeli forces, attacked  two Palestinian refugee camps,   slaughtering up to 3,000 people,  including women and children. But while the Israeli invasion eventually  forced the PLO to withdraw from Lebanon,   it also marked the start of the  involvement of another new actor. Seeing an opportunity to take on its archenemy   and extend its influence over  the country's Shia community,   Iran sent thousands of troops to Lebanon to  arm and train a new Shiite militia, Hezbollah. Meanwhile, broader international efforts  to stop the fighting had little effect. This was graphically highlighted in October  1983, when Shia militants bombed the French   and US military contingents serving with the  so-called Multinational Force, leading to over   300 deaths and eventually forcing the mission  to withdraw from the country the following year.

And now, back to the video. By the end of the 1980s, Lebanon had  become a quagmire of competing forces. Indeed, throughout the war, it's estimated  that over 100 different factions emerged. To make matters even more complicated,  many of these would shift their positions   according to developments on the ground,  often forming alliances with other militias   that had seemingly opposing religious,  political, or ideological leanings. However, amidst the chaos,  things were beginning to change. After nearly a decade and a half of fighting,   it was increasingly clear that none of the  factions could secure an outright victory. More importantly, the Christians—once the  dominant force—were steadily losing influence   as Muslim militias controlled  large swathes of the country. Likewise, the international context was shifting. Against the backdrop of the end of the Cold War,  international pressure for a deal began to grow. In October 1989, the parties signed the National  Reconciliation Accord, commonly referred to as   the Taif Agreement, brokered by Saudi Arabia  and supported by the United States and Syria. This established the foundations  for national reconciliation by   redistributing political authority. In addition to diminishing the  power of the Christian president,   it ensured equal representation for both  Christians and Muslims in parliament,   alongside the gradual dismantling  of political sectarianism. More broadly, while it  affirmed Lebanese independence,   it also permitted Syrian forces to remain  in the country for a transitional period. While the agreement ended the  civil war, like many other   peace deals it encountered significant  challenges in the years that followed. For instance, in March 1991, an amnesty law was   passed pardoning all political  crimes committed during the war. Although supporters claimed that it was  essential for peace and reconciliation,   it meant that those who committed  atrocities would never be held accountable. Then there were also broader  issues regarding implementation. Although the accord called for the militias to  disarm, and most complied, Hezbollah refused,   arguing that it was still fighting  the Israeli occupation of the south. However, even after Israeli troops eventually  withdrew in 2000, Hezbollah continued to oppose   Israel, leading to another brief Israeli  intervention in 2006, and another in 2024. As for the Syrian troops, they remained  in Lebanon until 2005, when they were   forced out by a popular anti-Syrian uprising  that erupted after the assassination of the   former Lebanese Prime Minister, Rafik Hariri,  which many felt was carried out by Damascus. Although it should be pointed out that a later UN   tribunal concluded that there was no  direct evidence to support this claim. All told, the human cost of the  15-year civil war was enormous. Estimates suggest that 150,000 people were killed,   300,000 injured, and over  a million people displaced. All this in a country with a  population of fewer than 5 million. In addition, the physical destruction was immense. By the end of the conflict, large parts  of Beirut were little more than rubble,   especially along the Green Line. But while all this eventually led  to a massive reconstruction effort,   the war's lasting impact on Lebanon's  political landscape has been profound. While ending the immediate conflict,  the Taif Agreement has been criticized   for perpetuating the religious  divisions it was intended to address. Even now, deep distrust remains  between the various communities,   hindering efforts to build  effective state institutions. Likewise, efforts to implement  reforms have repeatedly stalled,   as rival political leaders prioritized  their own interests over national stability. And external forces, including Israel, Iran,   and Syria, have continued to influence  developments within the country. And it's for all these reasons that  the Lebanese civil war remains one of   the most prolonged, devastating, and  complex conflicts of modern times. Of course, Lebanon was just one of many conflicts  that have shaped modern international relations. Here are some videos on other wars  that have also had a profound impact." />

And joining me now is Seth Jones national security expert and president of the center for Strategic and International So, Seth, you have just returned from reviewing frontline drone f You've done that with top military leadership from Ukraine. So so you've seen things that none of us have actually se What stands out to you from that from what you saw, from what you heard about what r happened on those air bases? Well, Aaron, what what is really is how the Ukrainians used the Russian logistics system, including their mobile network, to first to smuggle drones into Russia itself and then to use the mobile syste and the satellite system from Russian territory as they, conducted strikes. So, I mean, it's not just gettin that, that those platforms into Russian territory, but it's also taking advantage of what was available in Russia to strike targets. And it really shows how vulnerable countries can be if those kinds of drones are smu inside of those countries, obviously more than just Russia. Right. Well, and that and that sends a very sobering t you just said there. So when you're with that top military leadership, though, you know, we have those big attacks overni some of the biggest since the war began in Kiev. is that it? I mean, what do they think Putin is going to do? I mean, Trump made it very clear that Putin was going to do somet and that she's fires off and which it was never really on But but you get the point. what does Ukraine think is going to happen Well, Erin, I think there are a few things. One is the, Ukrainian leadership And I talked to the head of the office of the president, while he was in Washington this They they do expect, the Russians to conduct a range missile, ballistic missile and drone strikes agains including Kiev. in large numbers. That's the way the Russians resp I don't think they expect to see any kind of a nuclear res although, Putin routinely threatens those. But I think at the end of the da the problem that the Russians ha is they they are not effectively conducting military operations. They're dying in really historic at least since World War two. And so I think that's what the that's the Ukrainian response is to keep fighting them on the And that's where the Russians re at their biggest weakness. Okay. So on that, you know, we haven't heard that sort of an in a while. In fact, what we've heard is that in a war of attrition, Russia will win because they have more men. And it's just that simple. And that it boils down to number and the numbers are horrible, but they don't favor Ukraine. So the longer this continues, the more it favors Russia, right That has become the narrative right out there. But you've got new reporting and and you're talking about struggles on the front line for Putin's forces to advance. you've got numbers on the equipm that they've lost a lot more equ than Ukraine, that the casualty numbers now approach a million for Russi In fact, you gave us a chart that shows the daily average of casualties since the war began. And it all challenges the narrative that Putin can just continue and afford to go on indefinitely You know, when you went through and looked at all these numbers right now, which do challenge the current narrative, what surprised you the most? Er, there were two things that, surprised me and the and one of them was, was one of the numbers that the president himself remarked out of our report in the Oval Office yesterday. One was just the sheer casualties that the Russians have suffered. nearly a million. They'll hit the 1 million mark by June or July. And and also in a historical per the the Russians have lost now, more than five times the number of soldiers than in all Russian wars combined between the end of Worl and the beginning of their, full scale invasion in February I mean, 77 year period versus a three year period a little over three year period. Still five times the number that they've lost over the last three years. I mean, it's just stunning in its, in its, significance. And also the other thing that wa that was interesting in what we found was how, little territory and how slow the advance of the has been slower than some of the most grinding and grisly offensive during World War one. Wow. And, you know, when we hear abou and just the the sheer death and suffering, in that war, trench warfare, where, of course, it's trench warfare here again. Seth, thank you so much. Thanks, Aaron." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="in June 1989 something incredible and extremely memorable happened in Iran but it barely made news headlines in the west because it happened on the same day as the tianan Square massacre in Beijing but once you see this event you're never going to forget it on the 6th of June 1989 a helicopter was approaching the paradise of Zara Cemetery in the southern suburbs of the Iranian capital Iran on board was the body of the supreme leader of Iran two Iranian people this day is the day of great sadness we have lost a great leader and we are all mourning for such a great man an estimated 10 million Iranians in Black Funeral dress clamored to catch a glimpse of the body of their supreme leader Ayatollah rahah Ki his supporters gathered like tiny insult covering every stretch of ground as far as the eye could see several people were crushed to death in the hysterical crowd which was standing outside in 40° heat the helicopter seemed safer than going by road but then it landed almost on top of the crowd the mobs swamped the helicopter after touchdown hysterical mourners pulled the coffin from the helicopter and began parading it around the site the crowd was in a frenzy the body fell out of the coffin in the melee the body of the spiritual leader of Iran was mauled and appeared to drop to the ground the burial shroud he was wrapped in was torn off and came apart as mourners tried to grab bits of it for themselves in the chaos some people fell into the empty grave officials fired warning shots to get the crowd to move back they stuffed the body back into the helicopter and announced that the burial was cancelled the helicopter took off with people hanging onto the bottom of it and trying to pull the supreme leader back out as the helicopter flew away the body was partially hanging out the door many hours later the helicopter returned the funeral casket was enveloped by soldiers but finally Ayatollah heni was found his resting place to stop people digging up the body the guards used a crane to build a pyramid of shipping containers on top of the grave thousands kissed the containers some passed their children up to the guards so they could kiss the containers closer to the center of the pyramid it was one of the largest Gatherings of human beings in history and probably the most chaotic funeral ever caught on film his son ammed says Ayatollah H is on his way to heaven it's been a rough trip so far this funeral was for a man who had led his country for just 10 years not long for an Iranian leader 10 years in which hundreds of thousands of of young Iranian men had been killed in a war 10 years which had seen a 60% drop in GDP per person 10 years which had seen Iran become a global Pariah virtually friendless in the International Community and yet Millions were hysterically grieving his death mourners beat their heads in distress distraught to see the last glimpse of the man considered almost to be a prophet such is the power of a revolutionary leader or more specifically a revolutionary idea this is our third episode about the history of the escalating conflict between the US and Iran you can go back if you want to hear more but today the story of raahi and how his revolutionary idea changed the course of Middle Eastern history and is still affecting us today I'm Matt bevon and this is if you're listening 1960s Iran was a place that was changing very quickly thanks to the policies of the Sha Iran's King of Kings he has tried to reshape Iran virtually overnight into a modern industrial capitalist State while at the same time preserving the unquestioned authority of the ancient Persian kings the Sha a man installed by the British and kept in power by a CIA Le coup in 1953 was rapidly westernizing his country with American help even so most Iranians were devout followers of a subset of Islam called TWA shiism more than 90% of Iran's population of 35 million belong to the shate branch of Islam they believe that the 12th Iman a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad has been in hiding for 1200 years waiting to return at the end of time and create an Islamic caliphate on Earth for 1200 years most twers believed they should just sit tight wait for the 12th Imam to return and follow the five pillars of Islam that all Muslims learn as children to be a good Muslim you have to believe in Allah and believe that Muhammad was the last prophet and you have to fast in the Ramadan and then you have to pray five times a day and you have to give charity to the poor and um you have to go to Haj in to Mecca so sit back follow the pillars of Islam enjoy a modern westernized Iran and wait for the imam's return but a man named rahah H had other ideas Hai was a religious leader a teacher and a scholar who had gained a big enough following to be given the title of grand Ayatollah by 1964 he was well known across Iran as the instigator of a number of big political protests Iran sheras and the holy city of K were the scenes of the most violent disturbances Street B battling in which 20 were killed and hundreds injured you see heri had a very big very revolutionary idea what if instead of just following the five pillars of Islam and waiting for the imam's return to create the new caliphate we just start creating the caliphate now prioritize political activism even over the traditional Five Pillars don't separate church and state Let the church run the state by the rules set out in the Coran Islam is not only a religion but a total system derived from the Quran and the traditions of the prophet in the Quran a clear guidelines for every aspect of personal social and political life westernizing the country was not his idea of how to build a caliphate the shate leaders known as the mullers believe that the Sha's great plan for a modern western style Nation built on the oil wealth is not only a waste of time but it's also morally wrong the protests continued the Sha sent in in the Army Ki was arrested briefly jailed and then put under house arrest Ayatollah Ki has become a symbol of political opposition in a nation where political opposition has for many years been brutally suppressed now the Prime Minister Hassan Ali manur who was in charge of running the government for the Sha called Ki in to ask him politely to stop he asked to stay out of politics and go back to being like every other cleric focus on the Five Pillars wait for the 12th imam's return hum refused repeatedly the Prime Minister flew into a fit of rage shouting and yelling and finally he marched Up To Hai and smacked him across the face Hai was taken to the Tyran airport and put on a plane to Turkey he had been exiled 2 months later the Prime Minister was assassinated by supporters of Ki don't slap a guy with hundreds of thousands of fanatical followers now the old saying of out of sight out of mind really doesn't apply to revolutionaries plenty of revolutions have been orchestrated by people in Exile Vladimir lenon overthrew the Russian Zars in a revolution and did it all from Switzerland in fact it can be an advantage when someone's in your country you have some kind of control over them you can silence them but if they're outside your country it's much harder so ayat Ed as loud as he could from his bases in Turkey Iraq and France the ayat recorded antisha sermons onto cassette tapes which were smuggled into Iran and played in mosques he did interviews with International TV and radio stations which were then broadcast into Iran in his surprisingly calm tone of voice he railed against the Shar of Iran the king of Saudi Arabia the dictator of Iraq and of course the Zionist state of Israel as we discussed in the last episode the Sha thought that he had a special connection with his people and that just about everyone loved him Thea has conceded that perhaps 1% of the people might oppose him turns out it was a little bit more than that some recent reports have labeled the Sha's opponents as conservative religious Fanatics others have described them as revolutionary extremists the Sha himself has called them Islamic marxists Communists revolutionaries religious conservatives throw in workers students business owners their ultimate aims may be dissimilar but for the moment they have won catch cry the Sha must go but they all agreed they wanted the Sha gone when the demonstrators sh death to the Sha their next cry is usually Long Live Ki in October 1977 K's oldest son Mustafa died in an Iraqi jail humi blamed the death on the savak secret police saying that that they had murdered his son now the Sha has a military government a seriously disrupted economy and a nation at the brink of Revolution Memorial services to Mustafa Ki turned into deadly protests the Iranian Revolution had begun with soldiers firing indiscriminately into crowds of demonstrators leaving hundreds dead and many more wounded it was really only a matter of time before the Sha was forced out the priests have armed the mobs pistols and petrol bombs are the new symbols of power in Iran in February 1979 the Sha fled and a plane arrived in tyan carrying the country's new leader home from 16 years in Exile the holiest of men the Ayatollah Ki The Alliance of Democrats Communists and clerics who got together to oppose the Sha disintegrated and the clerics took charge now K and the Quran rule where once the Sha claimed to be United with his people Iran's 500y old monarchy was Swept Away in favor of a theocracy under the eye of the clerics a unique hybrid constitutional model was created the country would have regular elections a parliament and a president like most democracies around the world but a top that would sit a supreme leader an Islamic cleric who gets to decide who can run for office which of the government's policies can be implemented and how to use the country's resources under Islam oil like all natural resources is god-given and God controlled the supreme leader is appointed for Life by a council of clerics is in charge of the Armed Forces and cannot be disputed the constitution of the new Islamic Republic of Iran was more liberal than many expected women and some religious minorities had far more rights in Iran than they did in Saudi Arabia and other Arab monarchies but despite the appearance of modernity the regime was just as brutal as the Sha Islamic justice as interpreted by Ki will cut off the hands of those who disobey the reported savagery of the secret police has not died with the secret policeman Ki ordered a purge of the top levels of the military justice system and secret police with thousands publicly executed to make way for the new incoming clerical Elite Ki was officially named as the Imam a title previously reserved in Iran for the 12 descendants of Muhammad humi didn't just change the trajectory of Iran's future his vision of Islam had a ripple effect across the Middle East the incredible success of his Revolution triggered copycat actions from people in other countries who wanted to accelerate the rise of a global caliphate an uprising began in Saudi Arabia an American Military Base was bombed in Lebanon the president of Egypt was assassinated and H started encouraging followers living in neighboring Iraq to overthrow the country's dictator now the dictator of Iraq was a cool nice guy with a cool nice mustache who would never ever dare to cause any problems for the West Iraq's president Saddam Hussein Saddam Hussein Saddam Hussein Saddam Hussein it's unclear how much us involvement there was in saddam's decision to invade Iraq but what is clear is that once he did invade the US was all in the Iraqis began the war eagerly and with confidence that they could route an enemy already weaken from the revolution of the ayatollahi and purges within the armed forces the United States government had invested a lot of time and effort in keeping the Sha in power and now the Sha was gone and the Ayatollah had more than 50 American hostages in the US Embassy in tyan they wanted Saddam to topple Ki it was a war in which most outside has predicted a quick Iraqi Victory followed by the destabilization or overthrow of Iran's fundamentalist Islamic regime it backfired spectacularly far from undermining the Iranian Administration the war with Iraq served to strengthen the regime nothing galvanizes a population like an invasion just ask Ukraine Saddam quickly realized that he was fighting an uphill battle and tried to find a way out but humi wouldn't let him Ayatollah Hai declared there was no question of compromise the fighting would go on until the last Iraqi was driven from Iranian soil after 8 years and at least a million deaths heni agreed to end the fighting the Border was unmoved a year later heni was dead and given what may very well be the most extraordinary funeral in history that war is known as the Iran Iraq war but it's not a great name for it it was really just the first phase of a war against followers of K's idea of a global Islamic caliphate being established today rather than at some time in the distant future and extreme islamists have taken up that fight it's not fought in the Iranian mountains it's fought by iran-backed groups like Hamas in Gaza and Israel Hezbollah in Lebanon and the houthis in the waters of the Red Sea the houthi say this latest attack is in response to American British aggression Ayatollah H's Legacy is complex he overthrew the increasingly despotic sha when most thought that was impossible but then he instituted a regime that was just as brutal and corrupt which has been forced to quash multiple uprisings against it from the people it oppresses now Iran is isolated corrupt economically desperate and in a permanent Cold War which is now getting hotter by the day" />

on the city since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion he said dozens of explosions had been reported another official said emergency crews were searching for victims trapped in the rubble he said a residential building had been hit two children including a young baby were among those injured it's the second big attack on Harkiv in the past few days it comes as President Trump said Ukraine gave Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them after Sunday's massive attack on air bases deep inside Russian territory well they gave they gave Putin a reason to go and it bobbed the hell out of him last night that's something I didn't like about it when I saw it I said &quot;Here we go now it's going to be a strike.&quot; Well let's go live now to Kiev and speak to our correspondents there Paul Adams paul what do you make of what the mayor of Harkiv had to say saying that this is the most powerful attack on the region since the start of the fullcale invasion how fair an assessment is that well it's not the most deadly there have been other uh attacks on Khib that have killed more civilians but it does seem to have been one of the most intense our understanding is that this all took place within the space of about 90 minutes uh in the hours before dawn uh and with reports of around 40 explosions including drones glide bombs that the Russians use uh particularly in areas closer to the front lines and also at least one ballistic missile so for that period of time that was clearly a very very intense and terrifying experience for the people of Kharkiv and the pictures that we have seen this morning of apartment blocks and private buildings on fire give you some sense of how grim it must have felt we heard there President Trump saying Ukraine gave President Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them following that spid web attack on Russia how are those comments being received in Kiev there you know Ukrainians are extremely weary of hearing this kind of language that somehow things that they do to attack Russia trigger retaliation i mean after all the night before Operation Spid Russia launched 472 drones over Ukraine you know this has been going on for more than three years what on earth does Donald Trump think that Ukraine has been experiencing night after night for all of this time i think it's clear that when he spoke to Vladimir Putin just a few days ago uh the President Putin bent his ear probably about Operation Spid which was clearly a massive humiliation for the Russian air force uh but also about an alleged attack on a passenger train inside Russia a train that was heading in the direction of Moscow uh that uh that crashed into a bridge that had been blown up killing seven civilians the Russians say that that was an act of terrorism by Ukraine they have yet to provide any evidence for that but clearly that's what uh one of the things that President Putin was telling Donald Trump about paul thank you that's the BBC's Paul Adams in Kiev there well let's bring in Mikolola Biliskov who's a research fellow at Ukraine's National Institute for Strategic Studies which is part of the Department of Defense Policy he's in Kiev as well thank you for joining us on BBC News so we've seen two days of major Russian strikes on Ukraine is this Russia's retaliation for that spiders web attack on its territory well well the way people are putting it as for me is a justification for the Russian acts there is a saying in Ukraine that demonstrates the absurdity of this uh justification that says that if Ukraine stopped fighting there would be no Ukraine and if Russia stop fighting there would be no war so we target everything that is used to terrorize Ukrainian cities Ukrainian infrastructure and it is within the right of self-defense so in that regard what do you make of President Trump's comments that Ukraine had given President Putin a reason to go ahead and bomb the hell out of them and what does that mean in terms of Kiev's relationship with Washington DC well that's incredible and that's a major frustration to equate uh the aggressor and the countries that suffer from aggression again we exercising the right of self-defense it is uh the 51st article of a UN charter and when someone even if it's US president as he think himself as a mediator put it in such a way unfortunately uh he is not creating conditions for the peace and for sure it's not good for US Ukrainian relations which we value so that's incredible and frustration and what do you make of these missile attacks is there a strategic value to them in terms of what's happening on the ground in the war because we keep hearing about a Russian summer offensive what's happening on the front lines at the moment well u these are two separate acts they exist in a parallel so Russia is waging so-called total war with total war you deliberately target civilians civilian infrastructure rare areas to undermine the moral to make life untenable maybe to create uh the situation when Ukrainian citizens would pressure Ukrainian government to negotiate on Russian terms uh but it has nothing to do with the front line and within the front line Russians trying to advance and we try to arrest them and uh these are just two parallel stories and Russian attacks against civilians it's part of the total war approach that thus far is not delivering to them but unfortunately Russians still don't come to the conclusion that it's futile to do this total war and we continue to see images coming in from Ukraine and we hear reports of civilians having to take cover when you have these constant constant missile attacks and of course those alerts for Ukrainians to really go into bunkers how does it affect the life of civilians in the country again that's a part of Russian approach to make life unbearable you know sleep deprivation it's a major problem and it has a cumulative effect when you do not sleep enough your cognitive and physical abilities decline and again it's very vicious intent of the Russians to undermine Ukrainian moral but thus far it proved to be counterproductive thank you very much that's Michiskov there from Ukraine's National Institute for Strategic Studies thank you" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="how then do we end up uh with the Gulf War I and the brutal sanctions which are posed on Iraq afterwards so we got a naughty GCC State doing something they shouldn't have been doing so in the aftermath of the war the Iran Iraq war it's 1989 Iran and Iraq both go to the OPEC States and say look we're dying over here we need to get back on our feet is there any way you can help out and the the answer was and Saudi Arabia was at the at the center of this um what we'll do is every OPEC state will cut their production and then Iran and Iraq can increase their production by that amount so that the supply of oil in the marketplace stays the same so the price doesn't change but it gives Iran and Iraq a larger share of the oil Market that way they can use that extra Revenue to to repair and recover from the Iran Iraq War so everybody's happy Kuwait began flooding the marketplace with oil which caused the price of oil to plunge which meant that any break that Iran and Iraq had gotten from their increased sales was was evaporated um Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of doing this he brought in a un team to examine this and the UN team discovered that what Kuwait was doing was literally stealing Iraqi oil by both there were oil fields on the board they were they were pumping oil at an excessive amount on those oil fields and they were slant drilling into Iraqi fields that were entirely on the Iraqi side of the border and then flooding the market with the Iraq's stolen oil causing the price to collapse Saddam Hussein brought in April glasby the US ambassador Iraq and said I've tried everything the UN I brought the UN in the kuwaitis won't stop doing this I'm G to attack and and he basically told her look we have a historical claim to Iraq to Kuwait Kuwait was carved out of the bus province of the Ottoman Empire and we want to attack it and Annex it and she said what happens between Arab states is of no concern to the United States and so he interpreted that as a green light he attacked George Bush Senior initially says I don't see any issue with this at this moment but I'm going to consult my team he flies to Aspen Margaret Thatcher flies to Aspen they come out of the Aspen meeting and George Bush Senor goes he's a Hitler he's a Hitler thousand points a and the next thing you know uh we're doing Operation Desert Shield and then the next thing you know we're doing Operation Desert Storm so to be clear invading Kuwait is wrong that's not the answer I don't want to sound like I'm a apologist for Saddam Hussein but on the flip side of it blowing Iraq up and and smashing all its bridges blowing up its schools tearing up its government buildings and Wrecking the place probably also isn't the answer in the other direction so you know this this problem that we have in our world is a wrong is committed and then the response to fix the wrong is to do another wrong that doesn't make the world a better place Kuwait could have easily been liberated from Iraq without blowing Iraq up it there was no need to to to do the kind of Destruction that was done we're talking about an international Force the Egyptian arm is there the the the syrians sent troops the Saudis are there the French are there the British are there the Americans are there like there's nothing in the world that could have prevent that Saddam Hussein could have done to prevent the the military capture of Kuwait the bombing campaign that the United States unleashes on Iraq for one month they we bombed the hell out of the country has no reasonable explanation other than we just wanted to test weapon systems and kill as many people as we could and I think the result was kind of shock and horrify the world like what was that for this was so excessive in any case uh that's what we do the second war is even more irrational like at least in the case of the first war you can say well we're liberating Kuwait in the case of the second war there is no explanation for it so in the aftermath of the first war the United States announced George Bush Senor announced that as soon as Iraq got get got rid of its weapons of mass destruction it would be let back into the the community of countries right the Iraqis misund misunderstood what was being said they misinterpreted they took their their chemical weapons out into the desert in multiple sites and blew them up they did this in August of 1991 so the war had ended you know like six months earlier the Iraqis go out in the desert they blow up all these chemical warheads and they think they're done and then the UN weapons inspection regime shows up first of all chemical weapons aren't a weapon of mass destruction they're a terror weapon the number of people killed by them is actually shockingly low it's just a horrific horrible death that's scary weapons of mass destruction are nukes and biological weapons um also you can use Conventional Weapons as a weapon of mass destruction you know we killed 20,000 people when we firebomb the city of Dresden in World War II I think burning 20,000 people alive it constitutes a weapon of mass destruction at that point right obviously we killed a lot more people when we nuked toosa and Nagasaki but you can even turn a conventional weapon into weapon mass destruction in any case we'll use the terminology because that's the terminology everybody uses even though it's wrong and I just want to be clear that it's wrong the UN weapons Inspection Team shows up and they're like where are the warheads and Iraq goes we we don't have any and they whip out the receipts who delivered those VX sarin and gas mustard gas Warheads nerve gas Warheads to the Iraqis it was the United States during the Iran Iraq war so they had the serial numbers for every single rocket we just handed over the receipts so the UN weapons Inspection Team says okay we have to find the serial numbers and the Iraqis go you're kidding we blew that stuff up and the weapons team goes show us where you blew it up we're going to sift the sand to find the little metal serial numbers so we can check them off by 1998 Scott Ritter a US Marine who was the guy leading the the inspection team at that point had confirmed that he found 98% of the serial numbers the life expectancy of those weapons were expired they were past their expiration date but Bill Clinton was in the middle of the Monaco Lewinsky scandal he need to distract the American public so he ordered the UN weapons Inspection Team out so he could bomb Iraq he does it and then Saddam husin goes that's it I we were clean you knew we were clean you're playing dirty I'm not letting the weapons Inspection Team back in in 2002 George Bush Jr threatens to go to war Saddam Hussein lets the weapons Inspection Team back in because he doesn't want to get bombed he gets bombed anyway and we go to war a second round for weapons we knew they never had because Scott Ritter had identified 98% you got to figure when you're blowing up Warheads some of those serial numbers are going to melt or be shredded 98% shocks me I can't believe they found 98% you at that point I would have treated that as a clean bill of health but obviously Bill Clinton didn't care about that he was right Wag the Dog kind of situation created a distraction for the public why George Bush Jr did the second war may be explained by a thing called the project for The New American Century I what happened was a group of conservatives in the United States had actually written a series of letters to Bill Clinton beginning in 1998 and then they ended up part of the George Bush Senior or George Bush Junior government and those letters said that what the United States ought to do is invade Iraq conquer it create it turn it into a base of operations and then either invade Syria or Iran next conquer those two because whichever only didn't do second you'll do third then the United States is going to invade and Conquer Saudi Arabia So the plan was to backstab Saudi Arabia and then invade and Conquer Egypt and in the process encircle Israel secure Israel make it safe and then change the borders of the region to create even more divisions and and like I I've seen the map it's it's crazy they were going to split the hzz off of nudged and and make it so that there were at least two states where Saudi Arabia was um they were going to carve Iraq up into three states they were going to carve Syria up and the goal was to just make it so that the United States would would now have an imperial foothold in the Middle East the United States military named the Middle East centcom as in Central Command so the United States is in central command the United States is northcom it's north command the center of the United States is the Middle East and that that was the mentality that they brought into that war of course it turned into a disaster and the and the Iraqi people you know Vietnam the United States and and the United States left humiliated and and in disgrace um the United States got Vietnam by by Afghanistan as well so it was it ended up being completely catastrophic for the United States Empire in the end but the loss in life and the loss to the global economy is also catastrophic" />

We take a look at the mood within Israel, where Levy characterizes the Israeli public as &quot;sour&quot; about what is seen as a premature deal. &quot;They would like to see more blood, more destruction in Lebanon,&quot; says Levy. &quot;Israel wants wars.&quot; This retributive stance is still being felt in Lebanon, adds writer Lina Mounzer, who says Lebanese people are &quot;very terrified of the day after&quot; and do not feel that they have been awarded peace, despite the terms of the ceasefire. Meanwhile, the Israeli government has unanimously voted to sanction the Israeli newspaper Haaretz_, claiming that its editorials &quot;have hurt the legitimacy of the state of Israel and its right to self defense.&quot; _Haaretz has criticized the move, which comes just months after Israel banned the international media outlet Al Jazeera, as anti-democratic. Levy, a columnist for _Haaretz_, says the sanction makes it clear that Israelis cannot take the freedom of speech &quot;for granted anymore.&quot;&#10;&#10;Democracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on over 1,500 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

          <attvalue for="7" value="I want to bring giddon Levy into this conversation in Tel Aviv um giddon if you could start off by responding to there was a um latest text from the Israeli negotiator Gan Basin um who wrote the ceasefire agreement which went into effect today is good news the agreement is between Israel and the government of Lebanon not between Israel and Hezbollah it seems that Hezbollah has been weakened enough um it says uh it seems that it's been weakened enough um that let's see if I can find this that it's been weakened enough to end the war in Lebanon before the war in Gaza has ended your response to this and also the response in Israel right now to I think it was about 4 a.m. that the ceasefire or this cessation in hostilities went into effect yes I wish I could tell you that Israel is happy about the ceasefire I wish I could tell you that there is even a relief in Israel but unfortunately in Israel everyone almost everyone is critical about this agreement I guess many Israelis did not have enough for sure the right Wingers for sure the most of the inhabitants of the north they would like to see more blood and more destruction Lebanon and therefore they are so sour today and the other Camp as usual is saying nothing and even one of the opposition leaders Benny gun even criticized the ceas he saw the war should go on in other words Israel wants Wars that's the inevitable conclusion when you see reactions to a ceas fire which puts an end at least partial end to suffer in both sides suffer which didn't lead to anywhere Israel didn't achieve anything in this war it will not achieve anything in the war in Gaza 10 times or 1,000 times worse and here I must emphasize that nobody should have any Illusions has no intention to put an end to the war in Gaza what happened in Lebanon will not happen soon in Gaza because if he goes for an agreement in Gaza he loses his government and that's his top priority and Israel at least part of Israel has very serious intentions to resettle Gaza don't underestimate those settlers the sky the limit for them they just wait for Donald Trump to get into the office and I will not be surprised if we very soon later see settlements in Gaza in other words nothing was solved yesterday accept of the the the punishment of of Lebanon which came to its end but also this is for a very limited time I mean when the prime minister speaks about the agreement and all he has to say are threats about Lebanon and kbal that if any violation will take place immediately Israel will attack again so we are going from one war to the other and from one viol confrontation to the other without even suggesting any other alternative nothing nobody speaks about diplomacy nobody speaks about touching the core issues both in the north and in the South our friend from from Lebanon our Lebanese friend just mentioned violations of the of the sovereignity of Lebanon anyone speaks about the fact that Israel I'm sure will continue to fly over Lebanon known for intelligence this will be kosher this will be legitimate and only the violation of of of Israeli sovereignity is never forgiven and get Lev I wanted to ask you in terms of the the the toll on the the IDF now over 800 soldiers have been killed in Gaza about the estimates are about 70 73 or 74 uh in in Lebanon on and those are the only ones the ones publicly acknowledged uh the what is the impact on Israel of continuing this war on the economy of Israel on migration on tourism and the other aspects of economic life in Israel the price is enormous but somehow Israeli accepted this is this unbelievable phenomena in which people are ready to sacrifice the dearest ones I mean who is more than your son without seeing a real purpose I mean they all tell themselves that they were killed sacrificed for the for the defense of Israel what what kind of defense is it if you bomb camp in Gaza what what does Israel benefit out of it the economical price is one thing I mean you mentioned tourism there's no tourism whatsoever there are hardly any International Airlines to fly in here but there is a much heavier price namely turning Israel into a par State you know it very well from the United States but everywhere else it's not only that netan and and the Gallant are now wanted all over the world every Israeli will feel it when he will go abroad now every Israelis everywhere will feel at least discomfort in presenting himself identifying himself as an Israeli and still Israelis are ready to take this only because they were told that we have to live from war to war to live on our sword and there is no other option which is a total lie because Israel never tried an alternative but brainwash like brainwash gon and I don't know if you can respond to this but the Israeli cabinet has unanimously voted to sanction your paper harat saying its editorials quote have hurt the legitimacy of the state of Israel and its right to self-defense unquote under the move the Israeli government will stop advertising in the paper cut off all Communications with haret haret has slammed the decision saying it quote is another step in netanyahu's Journey to dismantle Israeli democracy like his friends Putin eruan Orban Netanyahu is trying to silence a critical Independent Newspaper haratz will not bulk and will not morph into a government pamphlet that publishes messages approved by the government and its leader unquote this all comes 6 months after Israel banned Al jazer from operating in Israel and as the president-elect here in the United States uh Donald Trump threatens to go after major US broadcasters and Publications calling the media the enemy of the people get on you serve on the editorial board of harats I know you can't speak specifically about the sanctions against your paper but can you talk broader about these threats to the Press sure it's not that I can't but we decided that this this message that you just read now is is our reaction as a newspaper but I think that those sanctions tell much more about Israel and Israel's government than about the arids and here I think especially in the United States who always speaks about the shared vales about the only democracy in the Middle East so first of all it's questionable if if a state which rules in such a brutal way in five million people can it all be defined as a democracy but let's put the occupation the part they side even for us Jews in Israel who used to live in a quite liberal democracy things are changing right now from day to day from week to week legislations against freedom of speech against the legal system against any kind of Human Rights against any minority are being ruled and and nobody says a word I mean nobody can stop it at least as long as this government is there so what I would like to stress here Amy is that you have to also look at what's going on within the Jewish Israel it is Chang changing while we are speaking and the war in Gaza and Lebanon has a lot to do with it because the those two Wars with all their lack of legitimacy and brutality also influence the domestic structure and the domestic system of Israel and you see the outcome I don't take my freedom of speech and I have of speech total freedom of speech but I can't take for granted anymore well I want to thank you both for being with us and I want to give Lena munza just we have 30 seconds but the last word on what you expect to happen from here as you watch what has happened to your country uh at least for this moment from afar uh look we're very terrified of the day after Mr Levy talked about the effect on internal Israeli politics we're also very afraid uh Lebanon is a very fragile you know pluralist state but at the same time the Israelis also have known very much how to uh work on that so they've been specifically bombing where the refugees have gathered we've seen over the last few months that people have been Turning Away refugees these refugees are largely Shia from South Lebanon uh and from uh the southern suburbs of of Beirut so there's been a lot of hostility that has incurred uh so we're really really afraid of the day after in terms of you know the internal stability of the country and what's going to happen to it and I just want to say you know to go back to this idea of collateral damage this is something that the United States normalized you know in our region in Iraq the way to punish an entire country in order to change some sort of internal mechanism which then devastates the country because of course they have no idea what they're doing and this is not you bring about change so we're all also very afraid of now what's going to happen to Lebanon internally as we go on and as the pieces are picked up and a lot of anger and recrimination is going to start coming to the surface among the population so you know as we say in Arabic Al like we have no idea what's going to happen Lena muner we want to thank you for being with us lean's writer and Senior editor of the Arts and literature magazine the maraz and gon Levy award-winning Israeli journalist at harat's author of the new book The Killing of Gaza reports on a catastrophe we thank you so much both for joining us from Montreal and from Tel Aviv" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] you know the conflict in Gaza is a conflict that has generated uh different reactions and this is to be understood we saw this in the early years of the nakba in 1948 we saw this in 1967 in yum kipur we saw this in 1973 we saw these kinds of reactions in the intifada and uh I note that there have been quite a number of reactions since I made my position known on the ongoing conflict in Gaza first of all is always good to preface a response to reactions with the caveat that nobody has a monopoly of knowledge nobody has a monopoly of wisdom that what one does is to share one's perspective with the others in the hope that that enriches the debate I see uh a number of comments about the Bala declaration and it must be remembered that the Bala declarations was a series of uh events uh culminate beginning as it were in 1917 and there were also similar declarations in 1948 that uh were an offsho of that declaration and I can't agree more with those who say that because of the disease at that time in 1917 initially and 1948 culminating in the creation of what was fundamentally a Jewish State and the failure of the world at that time to create a Palestinian state that that in many ways has been the Genesis of the conflict so that the Israelis have always been seen by the Palestinians and the Arab neighbors as an occupying force and many of the wars that have been fought have been on the basis that we are dealing with Israel which is a Zionist regime which is an occupying force and it is in that context that all these attempts that have been made through successive administrations whether it's yakin whether it's manim be and a little earlier even during the reign of of of the administration of game and of course during the Netanyahu periods and we saw that all these particular problems have gained the attention of the world culminating much more prominently in the oso Accords and the oso Accords were designed to resolve the problem for all times by creating two states but that was never to be we ended up with a Palestinian Authority and that Palestinian Authority also had its own problems leading in the bitter fight between the Hamas and and fata and with Hamas occupying Gaza so when we say that the conflict has brought about many nonstate actors such as Hamas Hezbollah and all these others we are actually admitting that this is the time that the world should come and say with no equivocation that if we are to resolve the problem in the Middle East we must have a two-state solution a two-state solution whose fundamental anchor is that Israel exists and is recognized as such that Palestine is recognize as such and they exist side by side subject to international law as to whether that will immunize the region from the conflicts that we continue to see and including the Gaza war is one that is out for debate but what has happened and continues to happen in Gaza is creating enmity which will be difficult to eliminate for Generations to come the other concern that I've seen or response is the question of what has been described as white supremacy you know there are those who argue that those who occupy and control Israel are not Jews in the strict sense that these are white supremacists who are hiding behind the cloak of jewishness in order to visit pain upon the Palestinians in fact I've heard even in the continent of Africa some arguing that the Israelis who are of Caucasian origin are racists and they have given the example of how they treat the ethiop Ian Jews who are brought to Israel under the operation Moses there is Merit in that but I think that the question that we ought to preoccupy ourselves with at this time is how to eliminate conflict in the long run and the way to eliminate conflict as we have said times without number is to find a lasting solution the danger is is that we now see a world that is divided particularly at the political level uh in the western world everybody almost to a man that is to mean politician is reluctant to condemn the Israeli response to the activities on the 7th day of October the year 20203 and those who argue therefore because of the European support the Israelis are thus encouraged and there are those who on the other side are saying that it is important that the organizations such as Hamas Hezbollah and we have now seen the hes ought to be reigned in as a condition precedent to any lasting peace it is an egg and chicken kind of situation what do you deal with the International Community through the un have now said that there is need for a pose or a ceasefire which will enable the world to look at these issues squarely in the face and find a long-term solution whether that is going to happen is another debate we now see within Israel herself that there are centrifugal forces which say that President prime minister Netanyahu must find a different approach to the war in Gaza because the Israeli military thought that it would be a quick fix but is now appearing that it is for the long ha so my own view is The Sooner Europe and America encourage the Israelis to seize fire with a reciprocal understanding that hamash and other non-state actors such as Hezbollah and the Hues will also seize fire so that the world can engage in a constructive way the safer it is because the whole world is affected by this War I see here for example of a comment from my friend Douglas moama and Douglas says unfortunately the Hamas has used all his time and energy to radicalize all gazans to hate their longtime neighbors Israel completely true in fact it is now argued uh that every other person in Gaza is being told you have a perent enemy in Israel and and this is bound to happen when somebody loses their family in a bombardment then the only reason why they continue to leave is for revenge and and this is one of the reasons why the sooner this war is brought to a halt the safer everybody is and and and can't agree more with Douglas moama who takes this view that there is radicalization and it's not only within Gaza you can see it even in in Lebanon by heah you can see it even from the rhetoric that one sees coming out of yeni through the huis so we are living in quite difficult times particularly as regard this war and one must comment that is a war that affects all of us because when you interfere with shipping in uh in the Gulf of Aiden and in the Red Sea then everybody suffers Joseph also Joseph hudo have you asked why Israel has blocked two State solution if stateless Palestine can hurch October 7th then what could happen with the State security is Israel's prime fear they are an existential threat secondly how do you expect Israel to defend itself against rockets launched from hostiles un facilities presidential homes please give an example of how to make the war proportionate a very very valid question from Joseph there because it is very easy to say that this war is not proportionate the response is not proportionate and we have had I'm answering this question by Joseph at a time when the icj has pronounced itself on the representation made by the South Africans asking Israel to ensure that genocidal acts are not carried out effectively just stopping short of saying we need a ceasefire but I hold the view which view is capable of inter being interrogated that you are safer dealing with a state which is recognized under international law which is obligated to act in a responsible manner if you don't have a state and is not a state within the understanding of or within the meaning of international law then it allows organizations such as Hamas to exist it allows organizations such as alasan Brigade it allows organizations such as Hezbollah it allows other organization to operate outside of international law and when they operate outside of international law in my view they are greater threat to Israel because the weapons that they acquire are acquired in an irregular Manner and you do not know but if it was a Palestinian state which is recognized as such which acquires arms in a regular way then they would be under obligation to behave properly then they would not use human beings are shield they would not use civilian facilities for purposes of military reaction So to that extent you are safer with a state which is recognized as such which exists and which is obligated to respect international law that is not to say that a state within the meaning of international law does not occas does not threaten Israel but then it is easier to deal with it because you and me know that states are involved D in Conflict not withstanding that they are obligated to act otherwise internationally once again we are not engaged or involved in any mathematics so as to know that this is proportionate and this is not proportionate but if you look at the rhetoric of the military officers in Israel or the politicians in Israel they have said we are going to fight a war like no other War so that Hamas will never operate we are going to ensure that Gaza is not habitable and that is not proportionality not easy to argue in favor of and it's easy from the comfort of our armchairs to argue the way we are arguing but is not easy for those who are actually in the theater and the arena of War you and me can afford the luxury of intellectual and cool analysis but yet the realities on the ground do not lend themselves to the kind of cool analysis in which we are engaged a man who calls himself Curious George and and and let me speak to your curiosity super Curious George most of these mistakes makes sense but the point about non-state actors going after civilian Target is scar make me question the logic why can a state actor deem a Target necessary for its own political gain but a non-state actor which in some of these places and be acting on behalf of their people cannot go after targets it deems threat either countries abide by international law or they don't you know the world has known pain and let us understand after 1945 war the so-called World War II the very reason why the genocide uh genocide became the focus of International Community and we had a treaty on on genocide in 1948 with Israel being the first signatory was out of what was visited upon the Israelis by the German Administration is now accepted the nearly 6 billion Jews were targeted because of their race they were targeted because of their religion and then the world said we must never allow this to happen again no more genocide and we even said in Geneva in 1949 we even said even when we conduct War as human beings somehow accept that war will always exist we then obligated combatants that even in circumstances when Wars are being persecuted there are certain things that must not be done this is the basis of the for Geneva conventions of 1949 but even after that we have seen genocide or genocidal activity activities we've seen that in Sabia we have seen that in in places like Rwanda which tells you that both state and non-state actors tend to conduct themselves in a manner that is inimical to the prescriptions and the injunctions that are placed upon them by law and this in itself is is a sad thing and that is why we have international institutions which punish such individuals we've SE we saw that with slobot and milosovic after the Bosnia war and we have seen that the very reason why you created the international court of justice and international criminal court is to ensure that those who do not conduct themselves in a manner that is in keeping with the law will be punished in accordance with the law and we have these permanent institutions because prior to that you had ad hoc trials such as the nurenberg trials such as the Tokyo tribunals such as sier Leon such as Rwanda but we now know better that these institutions to the extent that is humanly possible are going to do that once again always easy to argue in the manner that we do but yet the reality is that it is not easy I I see here this is a very interesting argument by Samuel Zion was made by the Ashkenazi which are from Russia Ukraine Romania Hungary Czech and Australia there is in this that the ashkanazi actually are the dominant but the sheerin those who came from Morocco and Northern Africa really Israel became a home for all Jews it is very easy to try and divide the state of Israel as it is now but the reality is that we are dealing with a state that is recognized as such and which is under existential threat in that part of the world but what we are telling the Israeli that there is a solution to this that solution is to State you cannot in the nature of things having suffered in the manner that you did under the Holocaust having been dispersed all over the world deny another population a right that you yourself are benefiting from this is what we are saying and the world will be safer that way and and and that I think is what the world is telling Israel yeah Julie oo I am very happy uh you support My Views and and I and I think there is a reason why uh there is Merit in holding the views that we do because all that we desire is to live in a peaceful environment all that we have appetite for for the continent of uh Asia and the Middle East and Africa and indeed is to ensure that we live in an environment that is favorable to all and this must be understood in the context of the reality in the world that if there is a war anywhere it affects all of us who for example knew that because there is war in the Gaza there would emerge a h threat that would entail the disruption of Maritime activity in the Red Sea in the Gulf of Aiden in the Gulf of Oman and and therefore affect the supply of oil in the world so all of us really have a duty to ensure that there is Security in the world somebody is saying a very interesting I have an idea to end all wars how about we elect an international president who all leaders of the world have to answer to the world is now you know I believe that we have contri utions to make there was a time when I believed and I still haven't abandoned this belief that the occupation of political office gives one a platform to really put into practice what one is saying but we must remember that we live in a world where the best intention of men are and women are not necessarily the ones that appeal to the electorate the electorate is moved by different consideration particularly in Africa the electorate is moved by money the electorate is moved by ethnicity and in as much as one would want to be in such a position one finds oneself in a position where what one can do is to contribute informally and it is never lost on me personally that some of the people that are most attracted to were never occupants of any political office I'm attracted to the IDE years of mandas Karam Chand Gandhi known as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr and they became moral forces in the world because it is much more difficult to become a person who is a moral Warrior than to be a person who is a political Warrior who is beholden to many interests but never say never you never know which Voice May call and which voice one may answer answer to in order to play a much more visible role in the Affairs of the world that is Hilo who only hides behind the mask 09 a z but the mask is peeled you know the question of the war in Gaza is one that is alive and well it continues to generate reactions and questions and in reaction to my sentiment my sentiment there are hundreds of questions that have come about raising pertinent issues is two State solution the solution how do we deal with non-state actors what is the nature of the state of Israel what is the nature of Palestine what is the role of the international Community what should the international court of justice do in the face of the representation by South Africa too many questions to answer but it sends the clear message that the world is concerned that people are concerned and that people want a solution to the problem we will not answer all questions but we must continue the debate we must continue to talk about these issues because the day we stop talking about them that is when danger comes in and solutions die so thank you very much for your comments those which are interrogative those which are commendatory and those which outrightly disagree the beauty of any debate is that when we disagree even then we disagree in an agreeable manner thank [Music] you" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="the 7th of October did not come out of the blue sky it came after 18 or 17 years of Gaza as a cage Gaza is the biggest open prison in the world and what did we expect will will grow there under this conditions if not terrible mutations no other way to to describe it of of people who came to murder to kill to to rape to to do terrible things now the killing of Gaza reports on a catastrophe is a new book from the award-winning Israeli journalist Gideon Levy who writes for the liberal newspaper has aretes in Israel he is one of the most outspoken and controversial critics of his country's war in Gaza and of its approach to Gaza over decades what he calls Israel's aparte policies against the Palestinian people in this book he brings together his on theeg ground perspectives of the events leading up to the 7th of October and the ensuing Devastation of Gaza Gideon Levy welcome to radio thank you for having me oh thank you so much for being here now Gideon you are a controversial figure in Israel and an Israeli because of the strength of your opinions against your own government's treatment of Gaza even after it started to become clear what had happened in Israel on the October 27th 2023 sorry October the 7th 2023 you wrote behind all this lies Israeli arrogance the idea that we can do whatever we like that we'll never pay the price and never be punished for it we carry on undisturbed the Gaza Palestinians have decided they're willing to pay any price for a moment of freedom is there any hope in that no will Israel learn its lesson no now not many Israelis or people in the media held or able to hold positions like that Gideon what makes you able to do so first of all it's very unfortunate that not many people in the media can hold those positions but for sure in Israel it is problematic because I covered the Israeli occupation for the last 35 years and I guess I saw things that no other Israeli was exposed to and you know my my positions developed throughout my my research my witnessing my permanent visits to Gaza and to the West Bank and what you see there you don't see in Israel and it's not shown in Israel so I think that much of my positions are due to to my trips to the occupied territories and witnessing the crimes and witnessing the brutality which is avoided for most of Israelis so you say this you say this in your book that that most Israelis don't see this you say that Gaza is hidden hidden from the view of the Israeli public and that anybody watching television in Nebraska or any news newspaper reader in Scotland is witnessed to more of what is happening in the Gaza Strip than the average Israeli viewer is that true does Israel really not know what's going on I invite you to watch Israeli channels and to read Israeli newspapers and you will judge by yourself it's weeks and weeks that Israel gets weeks it's now one year that Israel gets only a one-sided picture with information only about our brave soldiers and our casualties and the hostages all very important um facts obviously but there is also another people and there is also another suffer and in the last year the other suffer is so much worse than our suffer that it should be at least covered should be told many Israelis might might justify it many Israelis might blame the Palestinians for the OWN Destiny that's fair enough but not knowing is not a privilege of any intelligent person in a democracy and unfortunately most of the Israelis choose this option and the Israeli media is collaborating with this and I guess as a result of this uh you say that nearly all Israelis are united around this aspiration to punish Gaza um in its entirety and there's almost a lack of opposition completely to carrying on with the war and and list I imizing these extreme reactions yes Israel has a very devoted opposition to the Netanyahu government to Netanyahu in person Israel has a very vocal protest for releasing the hostages which is quite REM remarkable but there is no opposition whatsoever to the war and its cries this is hardly seen in Israel except of some very devoted groups but very marginal ones unfortunately Israel supports this war basically and Israel is not troubled by the crimes and the crimes are on a daily basis by the time we are talking now more and more suffer more and more crimes in Gaza in the West Bank and very little of it is reported to the israelies but I think Gideon certainly judging from the reaction that I'm already getting from listeners the idea that there is a context an explanation for what happens on October the 7th um you know from people in and outside of Israel who who've read and heard and seen what Hamas did on that day you is Unthinkable especially when we have families who have no idea what happened to their loved ones or or still where they are everything has a context and to deny the context means not to want to solve anything because without understanding the context nothing will ever be sto by saying that there is a context it doesn't mean that all the means were justified by all means not but the context must be understood the 7th of October did not come out of the blue sky it came after 18 or 17 years of Gaza as a cage Gaza is the biggest open prison in the world and what did we expect will will grow there under these conditions if not terrible mutations no other way to to describe it of of people who came to murder to kill to to rape to to do terrible things but you have to understand that this had a context and the context is the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and also Gaza in different ways and if you want ever to solve it you have to realize that there is a context yes there is a context but what would what would a proportionate response by Israel have looked like to you I mean some would say that the US responded in a not totally dissimilar way after 9/11 how do you respond to the biggest terrorist attack on your people within living memory so first of all I would offer to listen to President Biden who told Israel learn from our disproportional way or for our mistakes when we reacted on the N9 911 the American reaction after 911 what was tot out of proportion and at least the current president is regretting it same for Israel now the question is not the justification the question is first of all did Israel gain anything out of this one year of brutal attack on Gaza killing and destructing and punishing without any borders is Israel in a better place now is Israel a more secure place today than one year ago is Israel more beloved in the world than one year ago those questions should be asked by the Israelis and then should be also come the questions of legitimacy you know the fact that you are a victim of an attack does not permit you to do whatever you want there are limits there are legal limits and above all moral limits and killing 17,000 children is far beyond any limit and any justification so I to talk about the international reaction because you do say one thing needs to be clear without International involvement there will never be a solution Israel is not going to wake up one morning and say to itself or to anyone else the occupation The Siege and the aparte are not good let's bring them to an end so Gideon what should the International Community be doing and who if anyone do you see any signs of doing so so first of all the biggest leverage in is obviously in the hands of the United States the United States applied in this this year Israel with all the arms and the ammunition and the Diplomatic support that it needed in other words the United States told Israel go for this war be brutal as you want we will supply all you need all your needs for this and this must be clear because the rhetoric of the American Administration was the opposite one but rhetoric is one thing and policy and measures is another thing and Israel learned that the United States is behind this war and we have to realize that the United States is part of this war and part of the crimes of this of this war now what could the International Community do everything just let take a lesson from what the the International Community did Visa V the aparte system in South Africa look how just the voted and effective was the International Community when it dealt with the first first apartheid state now you deal with the second apartheid state and the world is doing nothing about it and this is not only a crime against the victims this is also very bad for Israel because Israel needs someone to to to repair it and it will not come as I wrote it will not come from within Israel Gideon leevy thank you so much for your time this morning the killing of Gaza by Gideon Levy is

          <attvalue for="7" value="israel has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians since October 2023 Gaza's infrastructure has been decimated Famine persists and yet the bombardment and destruction continue with no end in sight despite countless attempts at reaching a ceasefire deal With a besieged enclave now incapacitated and in ruins why hasn't Tel Aviv ended its assault israel's stated goal of eliminating Hamas may not be the driving force behind the war For Netanyahu it may well be about staying in power and possibly even staying out of prison Before October 7th 2023 Netanyahu's popularity among Israelis was beginning to wne and he was set to stand trial Since 2019 the Israeli prime minister has been facing three separate corruption cases including charges of bribery fraud and breach of trust These aren't minor scandals They go to the heart of democratic integrity in a country that touts itself as the only democracy in the Middle East A conviction could end his political career His war has however been a lifeline for his survival as it has allowed him to not only delay hearings related to a trial that could put him behind bars but also distract public attention away from his scandals including what many Israelis see as an unforgivable failure in preventing the Hamas attack on October 7 Can we say that Netanyahu is using this war as a shield against his internal crisis including her corruption trials absolutely uh there are two main reasons why Netanyahu is trying to prolong this war One of them is to uh prolong his own political career to save himself from the consequences of the failure on October 7th Um but that is a secondary reason The main reason is Nitnya who's trying to create his legacy as the Israeli leader who expanded the boundaries of Israel who finished the job in Gaza once and for all who managed to accomplish what Bengory failed to do in in 1948 drive all Palestinians out from their homeland And that is what concerns Netanyahu more Netanyahu isn't alone in his genocidal quest to flatten Gaza He's supported by the most far-right government in Israel's history His national security minister Itamar Bengavir leads Odsma Yehudit a far-right ultraist party that calls for harsh crackdowns on Palestinians and full Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank His finance minister Bezal Smatri heads the Religious Zionism Party which also advocates for the annexation of the occupied West Bank and rejects the creation of any Palestinian state However Netanyahu's liquid party is losing support from within As internal divisions deepen continuing the war may be the only way for Netanyahu to keep his fragile coalition from falling apart and for his notorious ministers to stay in power Furthermore in a Channel 12 poll conducted in March 70% of Israelis indicated they didn't trust the Netanyahu government with 68% saying Smotridge was doing a poor job while both ministers have gained a certain amount of notoriety among Israel's allies over their inflammatory statements Is Netanyahu a hostage to his coalition as he sometimes claims to be or is he willingly and willfully embracing the rhetoric of his extremist ministers um I think the idea of Smutri and Beng pushing Netanyahu to the far right is inaccurate Netanyahu is the far right um he hides behind those two ministers as a convenient cover as a fig leaf to tell his European enablers his enablers in Washington to say &quot;Look I'm I'm I'm hostage to those two crazy ministers [Music] Netanyahu might have victory set as his main objective but when it comes to a post-war plan for Gaza he's got nothing but destruction on his agenda with proposals that don't take Palestinian rights or rebuilding the ruined enclave into consideration Netanyahu and his coalition partners they have a crystal clear plan for postwar Gaza Uh basically Gaza becoming completely uninhabitable So people would have to leave or would be forced to leave and the rest that are staying will perish to death It's always changing There's no one single plan here But the best plan for them would be the you know sending the guns away because of the you know demography issues and uh this is important I [Music] think Netanyahu may have hoped that the war on Gaza would be a useful distraction to steer attention away from his scandals and boost his image as a strong leader and it seems to be working so far But the March Channel 12 poll shows that he's losing the support of the Israeli public with 72.5% believing he should take responsibility for October 7th and resign and others frustrated that he hasn't led Israel to a clear victory A lot of Israelis are feeling sort of fatigued about the war that it's not accomplishing it its objectives that they were promised a decisive victory and that never came As the war fails to conclude without any progress is Israel's closest ally also starting to lose patience in a surprise move the US held direct talks with Hamas in early March and Israel wasn't invited And on May 19th the United Kingdom France and Canada warned for the first time since Israel launched this devastating onslaught that they may take concrete actions including sanctions or formally recognizing the state of Palestine if Israel doesn't halt for war and the lift is blockade of aid right now He lost Trump's support He lost United States support Uh he's not you know he cannot and he could not end the war He could not bring back the hostages and the economy is worsening Uh even if it's enduring and resistant uh there are a lot of problems for you know the situation Netanyahu's ongoing war on Gaza doesn't seem to solely be about defeating Hamas or even returning the Israeli hostages to safety Many critics agree that it's largely motivated by political survival That of Netanyahu and his coalition and of Israel's expansionist goals and extremist ideology also projects of Netanyahu and his cohorts Bengavir and Smotrich The cost of a prime minister's political gamble has already been devastating not just for the more than 2 million Palestinians trapped in Gaza but also for the Israeli hostages still in captivity As the war drags on with no clear end in sight the question remains how many more Palestinian lives will be taken for Netanyahu and his far-right coalition to stay in power [Applause]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="panic chaos a young girl tries desperately to shake her brother back to life an Israeli drone has just struck a busy street in Gaza City israel insists it only targets Hamas but so many it kills the civilians when grief is so raw how do you put it in words can I get rid of it may God take revenge on you this woman screams her child one of more than 54,000 victims of Israel's assault death is constant in Gaza but that doesn't make it any easier to bear for everyone here Israel is guilty of genocide but some direct their anger at Hamas too may God punish you this distraught man says of one Hamas leader i pray you are killed too back at the scene of the attack a man is collecting pieces of human flesh in a plastic bag all he can do to give the victims a dignified burial this part of Gaza City is crammed with families who've been forced to flee from elsewhere since breaking the ceasefire in March the Israeli military has displaced more than 600,000 Palestinians un data shows that 82% of the Gaza Strip is now a declared militarized zone or under evacuation orders the entire population is somehow meant to live in less than a fifth of the territory that's supposedly safer israeli officials have suggested their aim now is to push Gazans towards the south where three of the new Israeli backed aid distribution sites have been built this afternoon the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation resumed operations after multiple instances of desperate Palestinians being shot trying to reach their site today's distribution passed off peacefully but the scheme has been widely criticized by the UN major charities and those forced to scrabble for something anything to feed their families we almost died in there we almost died all this to get some food for our children this is all I could get a bit of flour a bit of lentils and two packs of pasta working alongside Israeli forces under this new aid distribution scheme a new armed militia led by an alleged former Gazen criminal Yasa Abu Shabbab has previously been accused of running a looting gang from inside Israeli military controlled territory now his men are openly working with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation he denies wrongdoing and insists he's helping his people today after a political rival accused the Israeli prime minister of arming Abu Shabbab Benjamin Netanyahu released this video admitting to supporting clans in Gaza to rival Hamas all the time Israel's bombing campaign continues targeted this morning a group of journalists in a hospital courtyard their colleagues reporting on their deaths as they mourn the Israeli army said it had killed a member of the militant group Islamic [Music] Jihad but the three victims were all known to have worked in the media prior to the war yet more families torn apart by suffering which shows no sign of ending well joining me now the former Israeli Prime Minister Ehood Almouth and first of all your reaction to this revelation that Benjamin Netanyahu has been supporting a rival militia to Hamas jihadist Israel hating and potentially arming them i don't know what to say in as long as this militia is uh helpful in distributing the uh needs of the population in an effective way in cooperation with the Israelis maybe this is a positive step but I I'm not familiar with the facts to be able to judge it from a distance again I think that it is incumbent upon Israel to make sure that all the humanitarian needs of the population are provided in an effective manner this is very important this is our moral obligation how to do it it's not simple and as you can see I mean in this chaos which is part of Gaza today and as long as the military operations continue it's probably very complic so if the this militia is helpful in providing the needs and actually effectively providing the needs then maybe this is one way of coping with this difficulty now you have argued that Benjamin Netanyahu should now face war crimes charges can you explain why well I'm here using a terminology that I didn't use but yes what I said and I keep on saying is that when a war is uh declared by a majority of Israelis is not a result of any national security interest of the state of Israel when it is obvious and is accepted widely that uh there is not a chance that as a result of these operations we will be able to save the lives of the hostages perhaps on the contrary we may risk them and we may lose them if in this process of a war which is not waged because of national interest but as people say because of the political interest of the prime minister we're losing soldiers we may lose the hostages and quite a few Palestinians not involved are killed this is a crime and now I don't know whether it falls within the legal definitions of a war crime whatever but it doesn't matter it has to stop right now we have to end the war we have to return all the hostages and we have to make the necessary arrangements together with Egypt and Jordan and America and the Emirates and others in order to establish a new government in Gaza that will take over from Hamas this is what we need to do instead of continuing an unnecessary war kama and Emanuel Macron have both said they are considering further sanctions against members of the Israeli government would you support that well you don't want me to give equivalence on something that I'm not familiar with i can say this if uh um Benvir and Smriidge these two outspoken extremist messianic uh fundamentalist uh supporters of terror ministers senior cabinet ministers in Israeli government will continue to be representatives of the spirit of this government that I will not be surprised if uh friendly countries and I consider President Mcron to be a friend of state of Israel i know him i know what he thinks i know that he is committed to the uh best interest of the state of Israel not of the government of Israel but if he will decide to take measures against the specific individuals because of what they say and what they do I will not be surprised ahood Alma thank you very much indeed for joining us well earlier today the Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson Orurin Marmstein offered an interview it was on the basis that our agreation of four minutes couldn't be edited more people have been killed today in Israeli air strikes the British prime minister has described what's going on in Gaza as appalling and intolerable and is considering further sanctions the French are also considering sanctions what's your response hi Christian it's good to be on the show first I want to share with you some of the sentiment in Israel it's a very emotional day in Israel two of our hostages were are back they are back in a military operation they are dead this is Gadi and Judy 73 years old and 70 year old those are two cup two people grandpa and grandmother went for a morning walk and they were slaughtered and I I will ask you about this but I'd be grateful if you question i will answer i will answer i just want to share with you something that I heard before coming to this show this is the last phone call of Judy crying calling the emergency in a line saying &quot;My husband is just been shot i've been shot my h my husband brain is spilled o over come and help me.&quot; Unfortunately no one helped her she was slaughtered gadi was slaughtered and 56 more hostages are still in the hell nightmare called Hamas we want to see them back and every day that passes by just makes it more urgent to have our hostages released yes but your response to the international condemnation of what you're doing is what we're trying to share the situation as is with international comm community and international organization and the the situation is the following unfortunately kamas is still a threat an immediate threat to the people of Israel we are not in a situation in which we cannot vouch that we won't have another October 7 and this is why this war is still going on so you carry on i mean you the former defense minister Avdor Lieberman has said that Israel has been supplying weapons to a jihadist rival militia uh operating in Gaza under areas of Israeli control how is that happening so first I think the one making those statements needs to be asked but it hasn't been denied by the prime minister's office i think what the prime minister office published is that Israel is doing everything possible to fight Hamas including arming other militia i don't think they had it in in their statement so I think this is the the word are you not denying it no I'm I'm saying that we are doing everything possible to fight this evil what kind of person killed a 70-year-old grandma in her morning walk what kind of person takes Ariel and Kir Bibbas two babies and kidnap him if you can explain this to me which kind of what kind of of cause justify taking babies as hostages I I would be astonished and it's the lesson of what has happened in bringing back these two bodies that armed conflict is the way to get the hostages back because many of the hostage families fear that more of those who are still alive will be killed if this war carries on i think first we should listen and respect the hostages families i would say almost in a sacred way they are going through living hell i can't imagine having my my daughter my my my mother in captivity in Kamas but the war carries on because we're very tight for time i can't imagine so we we should listen to them but on the same time we should also judge what what proved to be very effective it's the combination of military operation and diplomatic means and if you allow me I can explain about the diplomatic means i'm afraid our time is up uh so Orura Masne thank you very much thank you thank you" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="joining me now is author Gideon Levy he's a world-renowned columnist at Harets the uh Israeli paper that is famous really it has taken a very critical line against the Netanyahu government particularly over the war in Gaza now but of course Mr levy has been writing about this for a very long time uh thanks so much for speaking to us at Worldview thank you for having me it's always nice to meet you uh you're there in Tel Aviv now in your latest column in the Harets you've asked a question of why even though many Israelis are against the war uh why they don't feel the pain of Palestinians in Gaza and you've made a very strong statement you said even though Israel has now committed a thousand October 7ths uh in just the past few years what is your sense of uh a the situation in Gaza today uh because of course we see a lot of the videos um and what is the support for the war inside Israel as about the situation in Gaza I think that both of us cannot imagine ourselves what does it mean to live now in Gaza those are walking dead people i talked to some of them but very very few of them we we cannot imagine it and we better don't imagine it because I don't I don't think many people went through what they are going through it must remind me from the worst times of history the starvation the children the the destruction you see the images of destruction it's it's really outrageous and the fact that the world is still silent and it is silent is condemning but not taking any measures to stop it is really astonishing astonishing now to your question look something happened in Israel on the 7th of October besides the crimes of the 7th of October israel got to the notion that after the 7th of October Israel has the right to do whatever it wants no limits no borders not legally not morally we have the right to do whatever we want because what they have done to us the second thing that happened after the 7th of October is obviously the feeling that all the embassy told the Palestinian people even by the peace camp was finished no more i mean it's almost illegal and for sure immoral in Israel to pay some kind of empathy some kind of mercy some some kind of humanity toward the people of Gaza it is immediately labeled as treason and those two things together with the unbelievable betrayal of Israeli media which does not show Gaza to the Israelis because they don't want to see Gaza you will be astonished to see how little any Indians saw more of Gaza than any average Israeli and this also enables the Israelis not to know and they choose not to know and to continue to feel good about themselves they still think that everything we do in Gaza is self-defense all together is a very very depressing picture because humanity is finished any kind of solidarity with the real victims and the people of Gaza are the biggest victims right now is off the table and the future looks very dark right well you know you have spoken about of course the suffering inside Gaza what we saw in the last few weeks uh was a statement by uh Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that he was now preparing for military control of Gaza uh first time since Israel pulled out in 2005 that announcement apart from the increase in bombardment of Gaza in the last uh week or so uh seems to have led to a shift on the part of three leaders who have so far been much more supportive of the Israeli position the leaders of United Kingdom France and Canada do you think this uh you know their statement together their uh threat of sanctions against Israel saying we will no longer turn a blind eye to what Israel is doing do you think it uh marks a turning point in the in the kind of idea that Israel still had support uh and do you think it'll make a difference no declaration will make a difference no declaration will change the policy of Israel the only thing that can change the policy of Israel will be measures actions and the world until now is just talking and Israel learned to live with condemnation and to ignore them as long as it is not being followed up by real measures like for example toward Russia a few weeks after the invasion to to Cremier as long as it's only talking it is with very little influence add to this the notion that most of the Israelis believe that the whole world is in any case anti-semitic that the whole world in any case doesn't like us so why would we care they all I mean it's their fault not our fault they are the anti-semites we are the moral people with the most moral people immoral army in the world right netanyahu in fact accused Macron the French president of speaking for Hamas absolutely macron who is really very devoted to find a solution is labeled as as a pro- Hamas anyone who dares to criticize Israel anyone is immediately labeled as anti-semite and uh you know words will not change it the only way to change it is taking actions by this I don't want to undermine those declinations they are showing a new tone in Europe they might be followed up with actions they might it might be a beginning of a new game but we have to see if it will be followed up with actions or it will remain as a hollow lip service right um you make a a fair point that eventually there has been criticism before the declarations don't necessarily translate to action that'll change uh the course inside Israel what about the domestic uh criticism of the war uh in Gaza which seems to be increasing you know so far we had seen most of the columnists apart of course from you and and others in in the haretss itself uh speaking really about the hostages that the hostages must be returned and for that criticizing the Netanyahu government but recent columns we have seen for example by former prime minister Ahoud Olmat um General Yar Golan's comments about the killing of children in Gaza uh I think former prime minister Barak has been critical as Well do you think that changes something internally in Israel because somehow Israeli politics does seem a little more difficult to uh you know is it seems a lot more complex when you're watching it from the outside it is not I I'm sure Indian politics is much more complex than Israeli politics but we will not make the comparison now in any case look there are two camps in Israel one camp will follow Netanyahu blindly and automatically no matter what he does this camp is quite solid the coalition a very fascist coalition is quite solid and it can and might continue until the next elections in two years there's another camp which is vocal which is devoted which is demonstrating day after day week after week but they have only two goals unfortunately so one goal is obviously releasing the hostages the other goal is getting rid of Netanyahu the goal of becoming more moral the goal of saving the children of Gaza the goal of saving the the last remains of Gaza is not one of their flags and therefore I'm so reluctant about them now which camp is bigger hard to say they are both solid and big i guess that if there would be elections today Netanyahu wouldn't win by all means not but you know uh even the alternatives right now you mentioned some names but the alternative is not promising ending the war the alternative is not premise promising ending the occupation of the apartheid so yeah things will be better after Netanyao but not good enough sure um finally the third poll as it were of uh you know international uh support or otherwise of um uh of Israel is always if you look at the world divided over the issue but there's always the US unequivocal support for Israel and yet we see US President Trump making statements uh he's you know almost uh threatening Mr netanyahu when it came to plans to strike Iran because there's a deal going on between the US and Iran uh and negotiations for that do you think the US is in any way withdrawing its support to Israel how is that ran uh over there because we are dealing with Donald Trump so it's very hard to foresee it can be one day can be one day like this and one day like this one day he supports Putin and to and today he's already cursing Putin one day he's insulting Zalinski and tomorrow Zalinski might become back an ally very hard to tell but it is a turning point and this is maybe the most important question right now what will the American administration do because would he like this war to end it will be within days israel is totally depending now on the West on the United States also on Europe but first of all on the United States like never before because of Israel becoming gradually a pariah state the dependence is much stronger in the few allies that Israel still possesses and therefore if there will be a shift in American policy this will be really a new scene a new era because until now for decades as you rightly said Israel had more or less a card blanch to do whatever it wants there were no limits attacking conquering nuclear weapons everything was allowed if America will change now Israel will face a new challenge which it never ch faced before sure you know in in the columns that you spoke about as well and there's a constant question what happens on the day after the day after Israel's bombardment of Gaza ends what is the plan for there and a large part of that is what is going to happen with uh the neighboring countries Egypt other Arab uh neighbors as well do you think uh that is something that Israel is is is working on right now are there contacts that might lead to meaningful uh cooperation in the future after everything we've seen in Gaza you know I ask because in India of course um India has been fairly muted on the issue partly because of India's own connections with Israel historical connection with Palestine but in particular in recent times India's hopes have been pinned on the India Middle East Europe economic corridor that goes through Hifa uh so many have asked is it is there a point in in thinking about such a project if the future of Israel's relations with neighboring Arab countries is never going to be fixed what are your thoughts first of all it's not about my thoughts about Netanyahu's thoughts and he was very clear he's he has a plan and the plan is as he phrased it to destroy Gaza to destroy Hamas which means to destroy Gaza and then to go for the Donald Trump's plan which is transferring 2.3 million people out of Gaza it is a plan it is a plan of crimes against humanity and crimes of war it is a plan which will never work but that's the plan anything else starts and ends with the question who will replace Hamas in Gaza the question that you raise must come only after solution for Gaza the Arab states not only Arab states by the way yesterday the prime minister of Indonesia was very clear about having diplomatic relations with Israel first time in history the biggest Muslim country in the world if only Israel will recognize a Palestinian state so the horizon is there israel is missing all those opportunities and there is no plan because first of all we don't know what to do with Gaza there will be no Gaza without Hamas unfortunately and if it will be a Gaza without Hamas it will be a Gaza of anarchy there's no substitute nobody prepared a substitute to kamas and therefore we are stuck with this war and all those big plans and dreams I must say must be postponed or even cancelled forever you know you spoke in India about uh six months ago and you had said that you are you no longer think that a two-state uh solution is possible explain that explain why you think that's not possible because that's still what everyone including the US including India including the Arab states are insisting upon it the two-state solution is the best solution two peoples are struggling over one piece of land both of them deser deserve self-determination let's share the land and two between the two peoples and create two sovereign independent states there's only one problem and this is the fact that the settlers did anything they could and succeeded to sabotage any potential for this in the West Bank in the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem occupied East Jerusalem there are 700,000 settlers Jewish settlers most of them are very extreme radical right-wingers part of them very violent and above all they represent the strongest political group in Israel without their evacuation there is no room for a Palestinian state their evacuation looks to me like a mission impossible i don't see who is going to do it no Israeli leader will be able to evacuate 700,000 settlers some of them are really powerful and violent it it might bring a total civil war here if someone proves me that the two-state solution is still possible I'll be the first one to sign on it but we have also to prepare ourselves to the scenario in which maybe I'm right and the two-state solution is not achievable anymore because of the settlers we cannot just say okay so the two-state solution doesn't work as it didn't work for the last 55 years yeah it's not that we didn't try the fact is that we are far from it than ever but we have to prepare a plan B and my plan B is obviously the one democracy the one state solution between the river and the sea one person one vote democracy as any other democracy in the world india is one person one vote israel should be one person one vote no matter what is your national or religious background that's the vision time will show all right um and and your sense of where uh IMC will actually go is it even a possibility if Israel remains on the route if Israel remains on the route it's going to a very bad place it will become an apartheite state it is already but a officially aparttheite state with a official apartheite system a pariah state totally isolated some kind of Iran or no Korea with very little embassy from the world and very little support this can end in a very tragic way that's the last chance for Israel really to change the roots but right now there's no one to lead it all right we we do ask uh in India many times about international conflicts of these kind does India have a role according to you does India have a role first of all in the first of all every country in the world has a rule because I believe that only by international pressure things will change israel will not change by itself forget about it israel will not wake up one morning and say the war must end because it's very brutal and barbaric the occupation must end because it is an apartheite system and so forth and so forth it will not happen by itself it will happen only with the intervention of the international community and the international community india has one of the strongest actors players with very good ties with both sides I must say and someone who has such good ties can influence the question is if India like any other country is ready to take measures not only to talk with talking we are fed up i mean everything was said everything was threatened everything was condemned it doesn't change anything does India is India ready to even sacrifice some shortrun interests of India in order to get to a solution and to really try to influence Israel to put an end to this crazy crazy war first of all that's a question that Indians should ask themselves sure uh Gideon Levi you're always so straight direct uh and you have remained in in a sense critical of the government many always ask how does Haretss do it uh if Israel is such a restrictive country and and the government has put so many strictures on people um uh and there is such widespread support for the war in a sense or uh uh you know the the unwillingness to criticize the war how do you do it it's not very pleasant but it is possible first of all I'm privileged to be a Jew would I be in a Palestinian I would be in jail long time ago Secondly I'm privileged to work with Har which is still a very respected platform in Israel and Harets gives us the full freedom of speech the government until now try to touch Har but only through economical measures not through censorship or things like this this is still far away even though it can happen very they just need to change some legislation and they think about it so nothing should be taken for granted but right now I'm very grateful for being free to express myself having the platform having the support and yes most of the Israelis don't like what I say I'm banned on Israeli TV now for many many months ever since the war started that's not a I mean I'm not the victim of this war obviously and yes I'm very grateful but I don't take it for granted it might change as as journalists shouldn't uh but Gideon Levy thanks so much for speaking to us of course Gideon Levy is the author also of the punishment of Gaza that's about a previous uh Israeli uh campaign there um but for the moment that's all we have time for thanks so much for joining us thank you so much for having me" />

buildings tunnels and other sites in Gaza and the occupied West Bank the AP reports the Israeli soldiers said the practice was used in part to spare combat dogs from injury or death one Israeli sergeant admitted to using Palestinians as young as 16 years old as human shields in February the news outlet 972 revealed how Israel used an 80-year-old man as a human shield troops tied an explosive cord around his neck then forced him to search abandoned buildings after he finished the mission he was ordered to flee but then another Israeli unit fatally shot him and his wife haratz and the Red Cross have also documented Israel's use of human shields the AP report is based in part on testimonies collected by Breaking the Silence a group made up of former Israeli soldiers opposed to the Israeli occupation the group's also released photos of Palestinians being used as human shields in Gaza we're joined now by the group's executive director Nadav Vimman he's a former Israeli soldier joining us from Tel Aviv thanks so much for being with us tell us what information you collected the Israeli soldiers you talked to and how exactly they are using Palestinians as human shields so Amy I've got to say that from the beginning of this war we got testimonies from soldiers that told us they they were ordered by senior officers to grab Palestinians next to them and to use them as human shields meaning that they were they were ordered to send Palestinians some of them were dressed up with IDF uniform cameras on their uh head or on their chest and then they were sent into tunnels and houses to check that there isn't any IEDs or explosive over there so the soldier could enter safely or clear the area and um we got testimonies from different units different times and different places in the Gaza Strip which shows as you said that it's widely spread this protocol and Nadav as far as you know how long has this practice been in place now um the first testimony that we have is from December 2023 meaning immediately after the ground invasion started and the last testimony that we had is from the beginning of this year beginning of 2025 just before the ceasefire and and it's something that the IDF is using more and more and more more units and more areas throughout the war and to what extent are you aware of soldiers resisting uh these orders to use Palestinians as human shields yeah so so it's interesting now every almost every soldier in the IDF learned about the fact that we used Palestinians as human shield during the second back then we called it the neighbor procedure when you come to arrest a high-ranking Palestinian or you know that he's armed so you grab the next door neighbor and you told the neighbor you knock on the door not me and maybe he will get shot and if nobody shot him then we told them get inside the house open all of the doors and open all of the lights so we will be more safe and that was banned by the Supreme Court in Israel in the end of the second father so the reserveist in the Israeli army grew up on that history that we did something it was bad but it was banned and that's it and now they got a command that is exactly that but I can say even worse actually right because he's dressing them up in IDF uniform some of the soldiers told us that it's maybe that they will be the target so they will get shot now the the thing is is that our testifier told us there was a debate inside their unit but it's our testifiers right i just read an oped in of an officer that served in Gaza and he said that almost every platoon is using human shields right so our testifiers told us there was a debate they came to their senior officers and told them hey you know that's we were trying to fight not to use human beings as human shields or that dea dehumanization of Palestinians or that's immoral or illegal or I don't know what but I cannot tell you what's going on in the greater IDF at the moment so explain the Dav why this is called the mosquito procedure and also talk about what these Israeli soldiers told you about what happens to the Palestinians many forced into houses buildings tunnels um that are suspected being booby trapped allegedly made to perform tasks like um looking for explosives uh in tunnels yeah so first of all a lot of things that uh the IDF has names for I don't know the reason but I can say that mosquito it's it's like it's a bug that flies in the air and like you can kill it who cares about it and that and that was the relationship a lot of times between the soldiers and those individual that were used and that's the word they were used right we have a testifier that called them a sub army of slaves now the the protocol is quite simple you need that individual with you for a period of time two days three days a week three weeks so it means that only when he's scanning a tunnel or an or a house or an alley so he doesn't have handcuffs or a blindfold the rest of the time when you're he's with you inside the house you need to feed him you need to take him to the bathroom uh but he's also handcuffed and blindfold so you need to help him in some unit there were um the mosquitoes inside the house were used to clean the house where the the soldier um stayed so it's not only you know don't only think about that time in the tunnel when they need to endanger their life think about the rest of the time the majority of the day that they they were living with the soldiers inside the house but again eventually they were supposed to be um released so it's um again I'm quoting that soldier a sub army of slaves and Nadav could you talk about the context in which this news has been coming out where there's mounting uh anger against Netanyahu protests all across the country yesterday uh for refusing to agree to a deal that would uh guarantee the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza if you could explain what the mood is uh in Israel uh the repeated calls for Netanyahu to step down you've said that he's acting like a dictator yeah so from the very beginning of this war we and other human rights organization we called for a deal to release our hostages ceasefire and enter humanitarian aid into Gaza now at the beginning we are we were a minority at the protest but as as this war it's hard for me to call it a war because as a soldier they told me that the war it's two armies fighting one another so is this intensive operation in Gaza went so long and we killed so many civilians and we lost so many of our soldiers and also we also some of our hostages more and more Israelis are resisting this war and if you look at polls in Israel at the moment you can see that the majority of Israelis meaning even BB's voters I believe are against the continuence of this war and pro- hostage deal and pro- ending this war and and you can see the atmosphere on the streets um what happened yesterday it was the 600 day uh of this uh operation or since October 7th and and we saw a lot of anger you know protesters in Tel Aviv took over the headquarters of the Liut party in Tel Aviv for a couple of hours right and they and they put signs they said it's the embassy of Qatar because of the allegation that Qatar paid for the close advisers of BB to support them more than anything else but but but I can say that what changed is in the mid mid-March when we returned fighting in Gaza when we continue bombing in Gaza and we broke the ceasefire and we stopped releasing our hostages the majority of of the audience in Israel understood that this is a war to protect BB's seat and BB's government not to release our hostages not to fight Kamas and not to defend our borders because if that was the case we will go to a hostage deal like um uh like Witkov help us achieve uh the minute Trump step into office now what we saw yesterday is more and more Israelis understanding that we are being lied to that our soldiers are sent to die and to be killed for themselves without any good reason without without releasing our hostages or ending this war i wanted to turn uh for a last example to the occupied West Bank israel admitting to strapping a wounded Palestinian man to the hood of an Israeli military vehicle during a raid on Janine relatives and neighbors of the man Mujahed Azmi said Israeli soldiers used him as a human shield instead of allowing him to get medical care after he'd been shot this is 13-year-old Alme speaking last year we told them we want an ambulance for the wounded person in the room so the army told us to bring him to them we got him outside and for about an hour or half an hour we kept asking for an ambulance then we called one 15 minutes later two jeeps came and they got in here the troops told us to turn around and not to look and they put mujah on the jeep's hood and took him after video of the incident went viral the Israeli military released a statement claiming the action was quote in violation of orders and standard operating procedures um Nadav if you can talk about how Israel is responding now to this latest news of this much more widespread use of exactly this kind of example now first of all I've got to say that IDF spokesperson a lot of times when they are confronted with something bad that soldier did that are against regulation they said it's against regulation we will educate the soldiers a mistake and that's it no investigation no nothing now I've got to say that that now the IDF announced that uh six investigation were opened after the IDF soldiers used Palestinian human shield in Gaza and it's a joke right because we have so many more incidents and even Yaniv Kubovich from Harit's newspapers published a couple of months ago that Helsi then commander-in-chief of the IDF was sitting in the meeting room while the mosquito protocol was discussed meaning that everybody knew now I've got to say that connects to something a lot bigger in the Israeli society and that's demonization of Palestinians right since October 7th it's even on steroids right we have government members that openly talking about genocide right when the head of the Labor Party Golan last week said that the right-wing politician likes to kill Palestinian kids and babies he was called as a traitor by our government you know we have ministers saying there isn't any innocent in Gaza that all of the Palestinians are assisting terror or terrorists by themselves and that sips down into the IDF into command that soldier are getting and if you connect that with the fact that we have more and more soldier officers and commanders in the IDF that comes from the religious rightwing or for the settler movement and believe that maybe it's a holy war uh not a war of defending ourselves you can understand why you have such a huge amount of those kind of incident dehumanization of Palestinians in in Israel uh became something so common that it also leads to this kind of practices inside the IDF nav want to thank you for being with us executive director of breaking the silence a whistleblower group of former Israeli soldiers democracy Now is funded by viewers like you please give today at

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] this is what Gaza looks like after more than a year of Israeli bombardment in 15 months this densely populated strip of land has been totally devastated the UN says more than 2/3 of all the buildings in Gaza have been damaged or [Music] destroyed the scale of Destruction is almost incomprehensible there's nothing really prepares you for what you see a landscape that uh really was evocative of images of Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the atomic bombs had dropped the sheer Devastation is such that that most people simply cannot conceive that this has been allowed to happen there was just Rubble in every direction as far as you could see uh complete devastation it is the most barbaric dystopian situation that I have ever seen in my life all days all nights you live in fear you move in fear you sleep in fear you wake up in fear you are not sure that you will be safe in the coming uh few minutes uh every morning when we meet everybody we say thanks God you are still alive in summer 2023 I came here to make a film asking if Israel was using water as a weapon in Palestine I had no idea these images would become one of the last records of a place that's been decimated beyond recognition we're sitting on a Titanic ship everyone is going to hit the iceberg this war didn't spare anything in the city didn't spare a building it didn't spare a tree it didn't spare a person the destruction uh was for all sources all aspects of life [Music] [Music] after 15 months of bombs drone attacks and a ground Invasion killing more than 60,000 people a fragile ceasefire has come into Force and the tens of thousands of gazin who had been trapped for months in the south of the strip can finally return to their homes as they emerge from their shelters and head north to see what remains of their old lives our team in Gaza went to search for the people who shared their daily struggle with us just a few weeks before the war started [Music] among the thousands of people walking North is farmer Muhammad Cel he abandoned his family farm in B laa more than a year ago when staying became too dangerous today he returns to see what remains of the home he once knew the reality hits him there's almost nothing left when we met him in 2023 times were hard and water was scarce but his farm was getting by growing fruits and vegetables to sell at the local market that's all gone now fore most of gaza's Farmland has been destroyed by the Israeli bombardment the once fertile region of B lahia in gaza's North is now a Barren desert south of Gaza City is zun the Olive District famous for its Olive crops now now almost completely destroyed the Orchards and Farms of can Yunis once again decimated by Israeli forces unable to produce their own food garans are now almost completely dependent on the food trucked in by Aid organizations and safe water is even harder to come by Gaza until before the war 40% of the population were receiving uh high quality of water after more than 15 years of the Israeli blockade the water situation was already critical and when Israel started its full-on war in Gaza following the Hamas attacks on October 7th 2023 it quickly got much worse signs pointing to war crimes and genocide started to emerge including water war crimes is Amnesty International concludes that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza to deprive the population of Gaza of access to water amount to acts of genocide taking for survival in the Gaza Strip we saw Israeli leaders saying in public we will cut off water we will cut off other essential supplies to the population this was to the whole population it wasn't targeting the military combatants of Hamas it was cutting off water for everyone in Gaza the Israeli even beside uh targeting building streets and killing people they were using uh uh the water as an additional uh an additional weapon against the Palestinians the more it went on the more that appeared to be deliberate like this Israeli soldiers filmed themselves blowing up a water facility in Rafa and posted it on social media and this the aftermath of an attack on civilians waiting in line at a water filling station in the alhatti refugee camp [Music] 10 people were killed rights groups say this is clear evidence of genocide so genocide is the intent to destroy and holler in part a population it does not limit just to killings or similar acts it can also be the creation of condition of life that can make living impossible Israel rejects all accusations of war crimes and genocide in Gaza prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu who alongside his former Defense Minister yav galand is wanted by the international criminal court says the claims are false and outrageous when we visited gaza's water Distribution Center in 2023 this man rationed the water supply to different neighborhoods by spinning these wheels since then the situation has gone from inadequate to desperate this facility has been completely destroyed the new pipelines installed by the International Community are now a ruin of Twisted Metal and rubble and all the households who received water through these pipes are cut off more than 80% of water networks have been totally destroyed uh 300 30,000 of meters of water networks have been totally demolished as well more than 600,000 M of sea networks have been also uh demolished destroying Water Supplies attacking water workers um preventing the Reconstruction of um Water Supplies this all adds up to the evidence showing this was a deliberate policy a deliberate policy to deprive the population of essential water they are war crimes because they targeting facilities essential to the population to the surviv of the population but they're also a crime against humanity a crime whose impact will be felt long after the guns full silent there is no justification for a war crime war crimes are war crimes The Taking of hostages by Hamas is a war crime that does not justify Israel then committing 14 months of war crimes in Gaza in 2023 Muhammad Ahmed was selling water from a private company in Gaza City to residents of the Shati refugee camp back then the public water supply was only available for a few hours a day and it was mixed with seawater to boost Supply Gaza residents spent around a third of their income on water paying people like Muhammad to fill the tanks in their houses after the ceasefire we tried to contact him for some time without success the shy refugee camp where he lives was hit by multiple air strikes and there is evidence Israeli forces have been actively targeting water workers with phone service often cut off our our team went to look for him in the camp and were relieved to find him alive and well his truck was bombed by an Israeli drone but he's still delivering water to his customers as gaza's water system was left in ruins the Taps dried up and it was up to people like Muhammad to step in with no running water today these trucks are the only way to get water in Gaza so we were transferred into a very primary way of of uh providing service by tankering water so we were obliged only to use water tankers in order to transport and dispute uh water to the displaced people 59% of casualties in Gaza are women children and elderly population so these aren't combatants and to read reports then if women who are mixing contaminated water with formula simply to try to feed their babies that these women unable to feed their children themselves doing everything they can and they're then risking the lives of their babies at that point Sorry in extended War children are around three times more more likely to die from diseases caused by unsafe water than from direct violence in 2024 studies showed that 90% of gaza's children under five were suffering from an infectious disease 70% of children were found to have diarrhea compared to just 3.4% in 2022 while 40,000 cases of hepatitis were reported in 2024 compared to just 85 cases in in pre-war Gaza the destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure in hospitals and healthc Care Facilities has led to an unprecedented risk of infection and death it was highly dangerous and not safe for the doctors and other healthc care providers to deliver Healthcare Services due to the systematic you know destruction of healthcare facilities we have witness the killing of thousands of healthcare providers in addition to the deliberate Detention of other providers who have been detained and tortured till death Israel claims the hospitals were used for military purposes the UN reports 136 attacks on hospitals in the first 9 months of the war pushing gaza's healthc care system to the brink of total collapse and unable to cope with an explosion in water bone diseases you know the water it's the essence of life and it's not that there is no life without water we have seen hundreds of thousands of cases diagnosed with infectious disease like diarrhea like gasis like gastroenteritis like JIS for example and those people they were mainly children and you know vulnerable population today people in Gaza are living off as little as 2 L of water per day seven times less than the minimum required by the World Health Organization and every day they have to spend hours trying to find it many families delegate the task to their children finding a water source and waiting in line is just the first step carrying these cans is heavy work for small hands some use makeshift trolleys to lighten the load but much of this water is contaminated and unsafe every sip carries the risk of illness or even death yet there is no alternative the water in Gaza has been horrifically bad for a very long time very high levels of contamination very high levels of salination that situ situation has only deteriorated precipitously we're never going to know the scale of this what are we going to see for the next years for these children the amputees growing up without hydration without food and without medical care the death and the disease and the impacts we're going to see for Generations as they are finally able to return to their homes Garin face a difficult question what do you do when your entire life your home everything you knew before has been utterly destroyed the answer for many Garin is we endure at Gaza City's Market Traders are returning to their stalls resuming their old routines every Trader here has a story of their presence in the market is an act of resilience [Music] I meil has been working at the same stool for decades he now has to work his sewing machine by hand but he's still open for business [Music] gaza's fishing port is also trying to to come back to life back in 2023 this was a hub of economic activity one of the few ways to make a living under the Israeli Siege every morning scores of boats would head out to sea in search of a good catch being careful not to go too far from the shore or they'd be fired upon by Israel's Naval [Music] blockade after heavy bombardment the port is now deserted the fishermen we met in 2023 are nowhere to be seen But others are returning to the only life they [Music] knew the few lucky ones whose boats are intact are coming back with their catch this fisherman whose boat was destroyed has learned to improvise with a makeshift raft for [Music] in 2021 Gaza produced around 4,700 tons of fish since October 7th many fishermen have been unable to access the sea While others risk their lives to bring in food he the once thriving Fish Market here is now deserted and these fishermen who used to play a vital role in feeding Gaza are now barely able to find food and water for themselves 15 months of Israeli attacks have almost completely destroyed water power and Food Supplies but yet amid the ruins and the grief there are flickers of joy and the hope of people who refuse to surrender to despair farmer Muhammad khel water seller Muhammad Ahmed and fisherman Abu nafed wake each day to an unrelenting struggle but they are still driven by The Dream to rebuild their land [Music] with the ceasefire in effect Muhammad can do his rounds without fearing for his life he says he's blessed that his family all survived but they face an uncertain future a land that is hardly livable but remains theirs me" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="one of the first things Israel did after Hamas burst out of Gaza killing over 1,400 Israelis and taking around 200 hostages was bomb two Syrian airports Syria said Thursday that Israeli missiles had targeted airports in Damascus and Aleppo confused yeah well it's confusing Syria's a long way from Gaza Hamas doesn't have a base in Syria and Syria isn't really in a position to threaten Israel very much it's barely functioning after more than a decade of Civil War so why bomb these airports it's because they're used to supply the most powerful unofficial military force in the world Hezbollah now Israel's confident that they can defeat Hamas but h esbah is a whole different matter and they're allies of Hamas if Hezbollah joins Hamas it'll be a nightmare for Israel so in our third episode on the Israel Gaza War who is hezb how did they form it turns out it's because of Israel and an eerily similar conflict 40 years ago has Israel learned anything since then I'm Matt beon and this is if you're [Music] [Applause] listening the story of the birth of Hezbollah is one that begins not in Gaza not in Israel not even in Iran but in [Music] Lebanon lebanon's geography is in comparison with other Middle Eastern countries extremely strange in a region dominated by wide open desert expanses 81% of Lebanon is covered by mountains about the same proportion as Switzerland and Nepal but aside from providing good skiing conditions these mountains have had an interesting effect on lebanon's population see mountains keep people apart and over thousands of years the people living in The Valleys of Lebanon have developed incredibly diverse cultures it's the most religiously diverse country in the Middle East by far more or less evenly balanced between Christians and the two major branches of Islam Sunni and Shia most Muslims around the world are Sunni and Shiites are often marginalized only 15% are Shiites and Iran is the only Muslim country led by a Shiite the Ayatollah heni sunnis and Shiites do not always get along historically the division between sunnis and Shiites has led to intense conflict which is at times erupted in war but in Lebanon the mountains have separated these groups you have to be a lot angrier to attack someone over a mountain than across a plane this has maintained a centuries long balance a balance they now attempt to reflect in their Politics the president of Lebanon is always a Christian the prime minister is always a Sunni Muslim the speaker of the house is always a Shia Muslim there are quoters for how many MPS each sect gets it's all based on what the population of each group was the last time they held a census which was in 1932 they're worried that a new census will change the ratios so they just don't do censuses you count can't be wrong if you never count this is how it was for decades there were a few exceptions but mostly there was Harmony in [Music] Lebanon but in the 19 7s something rapidly changed Palestinian refugees pushed out by civil war with Israel and with nowhere else to turn began arriving in enormous numbers in Lebanon Palestinians are a human being and they are living in Lebanon because of Israel and because they have been driven up by force almost all Palestinians are Sunni Muslims and this began to upset the balance On's balance between Christians Shiites and sunnis now began to tip rapidly towards the sunnis before long Lebanon erupted into a horrific Civil War and just to make things worse as Lebanese communities attacked each other a group of Palestinians called the Palestinian Liberation Organization or PLO started using Lebanon as a base for attacks on Israel prime minister ban claims more than 150 Israelis have been assassinated on the country's northern border during the last 12 months by PLO guillas in southern Lebanon by 1982 Israel decided it was time to end it they would go all the way to the Lebanese Capital Beirut and take out the PLO once and for [Music] all it was the beginning of lebanon's hot dry summer when Israel invaded the speed and savagery of this latest Israeli offensive into Lebanon has shocked countries around the world the Israelis swept through southern Lebanon towards the capital Beirut where the PLO leadership was helded up remember there was also a civil war going on and now Israeli tanks were on the city's doorstep people ran for cover every time they heard the Israelis overhead usually crowded streets were deserted the people are terrified the effects of the invasion were horrific Lebanese civilians and Palestinian refugees were killed on mass as Israeli forces swept through the country what started out as a punitive raid into Lebanon four weeks ago has turned into what some are calling the brutal final solution to the Palestinian problem they reached Beirut and put the city under siege blockading food water and electricity and flattening apartment buildings with air strikes and artillery fire at the very center of this Siege was the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organization yasa Arafat Arafat said the Palestinians would fight to the last bullet appearing to relish such a prospect he urged the Israelis to attack saying his men we're ready he knew that he was Israel's Enemy Number One and that his life was at risk Arafat is a man constantly on the move he knows that much of West Beirut is under direct observation by the Israelis oddly enough he didn't seem all that put off by the spies and the air strikes as the city became a war zone Arafat seemed to be in his element you Arafat toured besieged Beirut with a smile on his face kissing babies cracking jokes as he visited the men fighting on his side one of the reasons he's popular with his Fighters is that he makes periodic inspections like this one he even looked like a rockar the Australian women's weekly published an article about how much he resembled Ringo Star as bombs rained down on Beirut and Israeli troops drew the net closer and closer around him he happily gave interviews and talked about how much he was looking forward to becoming an engineer once the nation of palestin was established and he could go home to Jerusalem I would like uh to work as an engineer it is my professional despite Israeli spies on the ground calling in air strikes directly against him and Arafat stayed alive if the Israelis invade West Beirut what will your troops do what do you expect me to do the scene in beut was extremely similar to the one we're seeing today in Gaza Israeli tanks waiting at the gates to a city destroying neighborhoods with air strikes trying to eliminate a Palestinian group today Israeli forces were still poised AR sign Beirut ready to deliver the final death blow to the Palestine Liberation Organization Israel's International allies watched on in horror as The Siege dragged into a second month finally they'd had enough the US President Ronald Reagan sent in Team America to end the siege the government of Lebanon has requested and I have approved the deployment of United States forces to Beirut as part of a mational force Arafat without his headscarf and thousands of PLO Fighters left Beirut on ships having withstood the Israeli seed for 10 weeks he called it a victory heralding a new dawn in the Arab world and left to set up new operations in Tunisia now you might be thinking okay interesting story but what does any of this have to do with Hezbollah and I would agree it is an interesting story and I would tell you that the time that I'll tell you about Hezbollah is now if you know anything about Hezbollah it's probably that they're backed by Iran so let's talk about Iran shall we Iran is a middle eastern superpower with a massive population like Lebanon it's mountainous and has a long history and strong culture but it's the black sheep of the family it's never really fit in the Islamic revolution in Iran Depends for its momentum on regular expressions of unity the leaders of the newly formed Islamic Republic of Iran watched the attack by Israel with interest and they saw an opportunity you see Finding allies is kind of difficult for them they were Shia Muslims Hardline Islamic fundamentalists and Persians and most people in the Middle East and none of those things but there are Shiites in Lebanon and they were Mighty annoyed with the Israelis so Iran's powerful revolutionary guard Corp got to work uniting Shiites who do not like Israel who live in Lebanon into one group and they gave it a name Hezbollah the party of God the most fanatical of Lebanon Shiite Muslims are now firmly openly and successfully established in Beirut ahood Barack a top Israeli military official who went on to become the Israeli Prime Minister later said when we entered Lebanon there was no Hezbollah we were accepted by perfumed rice and flowers by the she in the South it was our presence there that created hisbah hisbah has undergone a massive transformation since the siege of Beirut they started off as a fairly typical terrorist organization for 8 years They carried out bombings kidnappings and hijackings it was hisbah that destroyed the American Marine Barracks in Beirut killing some 240 people and producing scenes of the most awful Carnage they were famous for running through the streets covered in blood after conducting a ritual which involves cutting your head open with a sword and then hitting the wound over and over with your hand unlike most Palestinian terrorists who prefer to get away hisbah welcome death and this makes them more dangerous once the Lebanese Civil War ended in 1990 Hezbollah gave themselves a bit of a makeover the Muslim fundamentalist group Hezbollah has had unexpected success in the country's first general election for 20 years with funding Direct directly from Iran they spent big to build the support of Shia communities the party of God has CED the people lavishly in the runup to lebanon's elections it's built new mosques funded schools and Clinics and handed out cash to the needy since 992 they've won seats at every Lebanese election since 2012 they've had seats in cabinet a hisbah MP has been the sports minister of Lebanon for most of the last decade hisbah also owns a radio and TV station they provide social services and run a tourism operation we like it here very much it's peaceful but one aspect of Hezbollah hasn't changed since the very beginning they've been devoted to the elimination of the state of Israel it's something symbolized in their logo an arm holds a machine gun in the air officials say that is a threat to Israel the machine gun for for Israel and will continue to be M for Israel for this they have a military week and they are a real and terrifying threat to Israel armed by Iran they are said to be the best equipped non-government military force in the world their military Wing is apparently more powerful than the Lebanese Army thanks to lebanon's geography Hezbollah is apparently kind of like an iceberg you only see the very tip this is Hezbollah territory it's covered in deep valleys perfect for waging Guerilla war and deep caves perfect for housing Fighters and arms for four decades now they've been attacking Israel with rockets and raids Israel has struck back against Hezbollah gorillas in the latest round of tit forat attacks in southern Lebanon Hezbollah sits there in its Mountain Fortress Loom in over Israel's northern border like a giant Dam that could burst at any moment and flood into Israel and that's what Israel's worried about that's what Israel's allies and even some of its enemies are worried about if the damn bursts it would significantly escalate the scale of the current War but Israel's prime minister warned Hezbollah and it sponsor Iran not to get involved if Hezbollah decides to enter the War they'll be making the biggest mistake of their lives and hit with unimaginable Force since the Hamas attack in early October skirmishes have begun at the foot of the mountains hez blah has fired Rockets Israel has responded with air strikes Israel bombed the airports in Syria which are known to be part of the supply chain from Iran to Hezbollah so why hasn't Hezbollah launched an attack what what are they waiting for well the thing about a dam bursting is it takes a while for the dam to fill up again for the Iranian backers hesah is most effective as a spectre a threat they do not have the strength to defeat Israel and they may be defeated themselves and then the threat's no longer there but Hezbollah should also serve as a reminder for Israel the current Siege of Gaza is incredibly reminiscent of the failed Siege of Beirut 40 years ago her military armor continues to pound away at the strongholds of the 6,000 strong PLO Force trapped inside the city the group they were trying to eliminate escaped and as an unintended consequence Hezbollah an even more dangerous group arose that unintended consequence is still looming down on Israel from the Lebanese mountains what will the unintended consequence be be this [Music] time" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="The Angolan Civil War was one of the most important, long-running and brutal conflicts of modern African history. Angola’s journey from colonial rule to independence and through decades of civil war is a tragic yet pivotal chapter in international relations. Following its struggle for independence from Portugal, Angola was thrust into a 27-year civil war, which became one of the most brutal Cold War proxy conflicts. The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), backed by the Soviet Union and Cuba, clashed with the United States and South Africa-supported National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). This devastating war left millions dead, displaced countless others, and turned Angola into a battleground for Cold War rivalries. The country’s rich natural resources, including oil and diamonds, were critical in fueling the conflict, further entrenching Angola in the global geopolitical struggle.&#10;&#10;Despite a ceasefire in 2002 and remarkable post-war economic growth driven by its oil industry, Angola continues to grapple with the long-lasting effects of its turbulent history. Generations traumatised by war face ongoing challenges, including widespread poverty, corruption, and underdevelopment. Landmines still scar the landscape, hindering agricultural recovery, while political dominance by the MPLA raises concerns about democracy and governance. Angola’s story exemplifies how Cold War power struggles devastated local populations, shaping the modern history of Africa and global geopolitics.&#10;&#10;MY LATEST BOOK!&#10;Secession and State Creation: What Everyone Needs to Know&#10;Oxford University Press https://global.oup.com/academic/produ...&#10;Amazon https://amzn.to/2MPY3W2&#10;Audiobooks.com https://www.audiobooks.co.uk/audioboo...&#10;&#10;SUPPORT THE CHANNEL&#10;Hello and welcome!

          <attvalue for="7" value="For over 40 years, Angola was locked in  conflict. Following a war for independence,   it was plunged into one of the most  brutal civil wars of modern times. In addition to a fight for control  between local factions, the country   became a centre of superpower rivalries  as the United States, Soviet Union, Cuba,   and South Africa were all drawn into what  became a devastating armed confrontation. But just how did the struggle to end colonization   spiral into decades of warfare that left millions  dead and displaced and profoundly changed Africa? Hello and welcome! If you're new to the  channel, my name is James Ker-Lindsay,   and here I take an informed look at international  relations, conflict, security, and statehood. We tend to think of the Cold War  as a confrontation between the two   superpowers and their allies that never  escalated into direct armed conflict. Indeed, the term &quot;Cold War&quot;   deliberately separates it from the usual  form of hot militarized confrontations. And yet, in truth, the Cold  War was far from peaceful. Over four and a half decades, many wars and  conflicts emerged as local proxies for the   United States and the Soviet Union fought for  control across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. One of the best examples is the Angolan Civil War. Emerging from a decade-long  anti-colonial quest for independence,   it became one of Africa's most  prolonged and brutal conflicts. As local forces fought each other, outside powers,  including the United States and the Soviet Union,   became deeply involved, turning the country's  war into one of the most significant, deadly,   and devastating Cold War proxy conflicts. The Republic of Angola is located in  southwestern Africa at approximately 1   and a quarter million square kilometers,  or around 480,000 square miles. It's the continent's seventh-largest country. Namibia borders it to the  south, Zambia lies to its east,   and the Democratic Republic  of the Congo is to the north. The Atlantic Ocean lies to the country's west. Today, the population is around 36 million and  is divided into three predominant ethnic groups:   the Ovimbundu, the Ambundu, and the Bakongo. The country is also rich in natural resources. In addition to oil and diamonds, which  have long underpinned the economy,   it has significant reserves of other minerals,  including iron ore, copper, and gold. Angola has a long and rich history, once  home to several significant African kingdoms. Our story really starts in the  late 15th century when European   explorers first arrived along  the country's Atlantic coast. By the 16th century, Portugal  had established a foothold. This would have devastating consequences   as Angola became a central hub of the  Portuguese transatlantic slave trade. Over the following centuries, millions of Angolans  were forcibly taken to colonies such as Brazil. Although Portuguese control initially  remained confined to coastal areas,   relying on alliances with local  kingdoms, by the late 19th century,   the slave trade had been abolished,  and Portugal began expanding inland. As the European &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot; unfolded,  Portugal strengthened its authority over the   entire country, and by the start of the 20th  century, it completely controlled Angola. It profited from the country's vast economic   wealth and subjected the local  population to harsh colonial rule. While most European colonial powers  began to decolonize after the end of   the Second World War, Portugal refused  to give up its overseas territories. With its rich natural resources and fertile land,   Angola was simply too vital to  Portugal's economic interests. As a result, in 1956, urban intellectuals  and left-leaning activists founded the   Marxist-oriented Popular Movement for  the Liberation of Angola, the MPLA. This drew its support primarily from the Ambundu,   the country's second-largest ethnic  group, as well as from urban elites. As it pressed for an end to colonial rule,   the group sought international backing from  the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Meanwhile, as anger steadily grew over  continued Portuguese colonial rule,   two uprisings emerged in 1961. The first saw plantation workers  protest about harsh labor practices. Following this, Angolan nationalists attacked  prisons and administrative buildings. As Portuguese forces brutally suppressed  both rebellions, the Angolan War of   Independence began, as widespread opposition  to Portuguese colonial rule now took hold. Two more groups would emerge. The first was the National Front  for the Liberation of Angola,   the FNLA, established in 1962. It was based in the north and drew support from  the Bakongo, Angola's third-largest ethnic group. Meanwhile, in 1966, the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, was formed. Based in central and southern Angola,   this represented the Ovimbundu,  the country's largest ethnic group. As a result, by the late 1960s, the  war had intensified as the three   major nationalist groups fought  to end Portuguese colonial rule. However, despite the escalating human  and economic cost of the conflict,   the military administration then in power in  Portugal refused to give up control of Angola. That was until April 1974. Following a left-wing  military coup that overthrew the regime in what's   known as the Carnation Revolution, Portugal  began a rapid process of decolonisation. Just 18 months later, on 11 November 1975, Angola became independent. I hope you're finding this useful. If so, please do give it a like and  perhaps subscribe if you haven't already. Thanks so much, and now back to the video. While Portugal's departure was hailed as  a significant step forward for Angola,   any hopes that it would lead to a  bright new future were short-lived. From the very start, the  country was deeply divided. In November 1975, the MPLA, led by Agostinho Neto,   declared itself the government of  the People's Republic of Angola. However, its effective control was  limited to the capital, Luanda. Elsewhere, the FNLA and UNITA had seized  effective control of what they respectively   called the Democratic Republic of Angola and  the Social Democratic Republic of Angola. As Moscow backed the MPLA, its Caribbean ally,   Cuba, soon began sending thousands of  troops to support the Luanda government. All this saw the MPLA make rapid  headway across the country. Faced with these advances, the FNLA  and UNITA now received support from the   United States and nearby apartheid South Africa,   both of which were determined to stop the  spread of communism in southern Africa. But despite this international backing, the FNLA  was soon forced to retreat into neighboring Congo,   then known as Zaire, where it ceased  to be an effective military force. Instead, the conflict now became centered on the   Western- and South African-backed UNITA  and the Soviet- and Cuban-supported MPLA. By the start of the 1980s, the MPLA,  now led by José Eduardo dos Santos,   controlled much of Angola. But as intense fighting continued, the first  attempts to resolve the conflict began in 1984. The sides signed the Lusaka Accords. Although this led to a ceasefire  and envisioned the withdrawal of   South African forces, the two sides soon  disagreed over the terms of the deal. As a result, the agreement had collapsed  by May 1985, and fighting resumed. Ultimately, it would be another three years  before things began to change in earnest. In 1988, following a seven-month battle between  the sides and their foreign backers—one of the   largest and most significant confrontations  in modern African history—new talks began. Against the backdrop of thawing superpower  tensions and the gradual end of the Cold War,   the UN was able to broker another deal. The so-called Tripartite Accord saw South  Africa agree to pull out of Angola and end its   colonial control over neighboring Namibia,  which gained independence in March 1990. Cuba also agreed to withdraw  its forces from Angola. While the era of foreign intervention  was now over and the Cold War had come   to an end, the fighting nevertheless  continued between the MPLA and UNITA. But things were beginning to change. After decades of conflict, Angola was devastated. As well as the vast loss of life, millions  had been forced to flee their homes,   and the country's infrastructure  and economy lay in ruins. As a result, in 1991, the sides  signed another peace agreement,   the Bicesse Accords, which paved  the way for national elections. But again, hopes for peace  proved to be short-lived. While the MPLA claimed victory,   UNITA argued that the vote had been  rigged, and fighting again resumed. But while another deal, the Lusaka Protocol,  followed in 1994, this too soon collapsed,   plunging the country back  into full-scale civil war. By the end of the 1990s and  following several peace attempts,   the sides were under growing international  pressure to end their 25-year conflict. This included UN-imposed sanctions on UNITA,   which had turned to mining  diamonds to fund its campaign. Despite this, the organization  vowed to continue the fight. In the end, though, the critical  turning point came in February 2002,   when Jonas Savimbi, the long-standing  leader of UNITA, was killed in battle. From there, things rapidly changed. As the remaining UNITA leaders gave up the  fight, two months later, in April 2002, the   group signed a ceasefire agreement with the MPLA  government, thus ending the Angolan Civil War. The legacy of the fighting was, of course, huge. The 27-year civil war, which  had followed over a decade   and a half of conflict against Portuguese  colonial rule, had devastated the country. Most crucially, it had an  enormous effect on the population. It is estimated that up to a million  people were killed in the fighting. Meanwhile, millions more  were wounded or displaced. Even after the war ended, the  human effects continued to be   felt and are still profoundly shaping the country. Several generations grew  up knowing nothing but war. This left the population highly  traumatized despite reconciliation efforts. Meanwhile, the country is  still littered with landmines. Aside from the continuing threat to life,  this also hinders the development of farming. On top of this, the war affected almost  every other aspect of life in Angola. Nearly three decades of conflict left a  shattered economy and destroyed infrastructure. Yet things have since improved. Since the war's end, Angola  has experienced impressive   economic growth as its oil industry has boomed. However, as many observers point out,  the effects of this have been uneven. While certain areas have profited enormously,  much of the country still remains underdeveloped. Meanwhile, although UNITA became an established   political party after the agreement,  it hasn't been able to gain power. Instead, the MPLA continues  to dominate Angolan politics. Indeed, José Eduardo dos Santos eventually  stood down in 2017 after 38 years in power. He was succeeded as president by João  Lourenço, another senior MPLA official. More to the point, Angola continues to be plagued  by allegations of authoritarianism and corruption. For instance, Freedom House ranks the country   as &quot;not free,&quot; scoring just  28 out of 100 on its index. But looked at more generally, Angola was  one of the best examples of how the Cold   War—a confrontation we often tend to  think of as a non-militarized conflict   between the superpowers—played out as armed  conflicts in many other parts of the world,   often at the cost of hundreds of  thousands, if not millions, of lives. While the decades of war in Angola had a huge  impact on Africa and international relations more   generally, here are some videos on other conflicts  that have shaped the modern global system." />

          <attvalue for="3" value="The International Criminal Court in The Hague wants Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrested for alleged war crimes in Gaza. But international justice works differently to other forms of justice—it relies on everyone opting in. More than 20 years into its existence the court is yet to convict any world leaders of anything. As the first fugitive from the ICC who is also an ally to Western countries like Australia and France, this case is one that could make or break the court itself.

          <attvalue for="7" value="if the prime minister of Israel comes to your country would you arrest him that's the question that dozens of governments around the world are wrestling with at the moment after this announcement last month the international criminal court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister yoav Galant for alleged war crimes in Gaza this technically makes Netanyahu a fugitive from International Justice the icc's prosecutor urging the more than 120 countries who are members of the court to cooperate with the warrants Australia is among them so would you arrest him already multiple Nations have said they will follow their obligations for arrest including the Netherlands Ireland and Canada Australia hasn't gone that far issuing a vague statement saying it respects the independence of the Court a vague statement we love those but there are plenty of countries around the world that absolutely would not arrest him like the United States we fundamentally reject uh the Court's decision to issue arrest warrants for senior uh Israel officials and yet here's the tricky thing would those countries that wouldn't arrest Netanyahu be happy to arrest this guy the international criminal court has accused Vladimir Putin of being responsible for the forced deportations of children following his invasion of Ukraine and has issued a warrant for his arrest for war crimes yeses tricky one huh but well maybe not for you but it's clearly tricky for some France for example says it would absolutely arrest Vladimir Putin if he was to visit Paris but Netanyahu maybe not so what's that about the idea behind the ICC is that the world needs an independent International Court to prosecute war crimes genocide stuff like that crimes so horrific they harm not only their victims but Humanity itself the international Community kind of agrees on this idea but agreeing on a universal approach to justice that could actually address these crimes that part is harder is it really Justice for example if some countries can just opt out why is it that until now anyway the court has failed to convict any world leaders of anything and what does that mean for Netanyahu and his allies I'm Mat B and this if you're listening okay uh I'll I'll come back to war crimes in just a minute I promise but just quickly I have a short survey about the show and it would be really helpful to us if you did it it's not about promoting something we're literally just trying to make the show better next year it's how we know if we're on the right track or if we're doing something that annoys you there's a link below in the video description and on our website thank you okay now war crimes captured at last one of the world's most feared and Elusive dictators in the middle of 1997 an extraordinary event took place at a jungle clearing in Northern Cambodia after 18 years in hiding these first pictures show an aging ill and abandoned despot communist dictator Paul pot orchestrated the genocide of around a quarter of cambodia's population before being overthrown in 1979 he and his supporters retreated into the jungle for 18 years until suddenly after years of diard loyalty his followers seem to have turned against the man who engineered the horror of cambodia's Killing Fields in an extraordinary trial at his jungle base on the Thai Cambodia border whole pot is publicly humiliated and denounced looking for laor and occasionally disinterested popot sat in a wooden chair on a dirt floor as local villagers en chanted denunciations condemned for treason and genocide this court sentences pulpot to life imprisonment the trial wasn't the result of a sudden change of heart but a power shift his supporters wanted to come out of the Jungle but to do that they had to purge their genocidal leader now he's appeared it's hard to see cambodians or the world letting him die peacefully in the jungles of Northern Cambodia and yet that's exactly what happened less than a year later popt died of a heart attack while under house arrest it was more punishment than some dictators get but one afternoon of jungle shouting followed by a few months of house arrest hardly seems like justice being served for genocide that was certainly the opinion of the UN Secretary General at the time Kofi and Anne today a man is more much more likely to appear before a court if he kills one person then if it kills 100,000 the case in example is Cambodia this question of how to achieve anything close to justice for the killing of thousands of people was a question the world had been asking long before Paul pot but it was always solved with an ad hoc solution Reinventing the wheel after each genocide and there's something else that these tribunals had in common they happened after the event when those on trial had lost power take World War II after the war International military tribunals were set up in occupied Germany and Japan officials from both defeated countries were prosecuted convicted jailed and executed for war crimes and crimes against humanity including the genocide of 6 million Jews in the Holocaust but the winners of the war the Allies weren't interested in investigating the war crimes they themselves had committed while every leader wants the other guys to be prosecuted for war crimes very few leaders want to risk being prosecuted themselves and so when the prosecutions of Germans and Japanese were complete the courts were disbanded but in the 50 years that followed crimes against humanity kept on happening at the end of the second world war and following the exterminations of the Holocaust we all said never again this should never happen again but it has in in the 1990s an attempt was made to do something that had never been tried before investigate and prosecute crimes against humanity while they were happeny on uh May 22nd I presented an indictment for confirmation against sladan movich and four others charging them with crimes against humanity this temporary tribunal was set up by the UN Security Council but the big news was that mosovich was the sitting president of Yugoslavia at the time Yugoslavia had previously been a Federation of six Multicultural republics including mosovich homeland of Serbia and the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina throughout the 1990s the Federation had been collapsing and the dominant ethnic groups in several republics had been trying to push other cultures out if you're going to tidy up the map in an ethnic way with the type of intermingling that history is as has created in Europe you can only do it in one way and that is getting rid of people the results were horrific these wars we've seen tend to have a level of atrocity that is quite extraordinary so the tribunal had heard evidence about these atrocities and sent out a lot of arrest warrants including the one for mosovich but it had no power to enter Yugoslavia and capture people it means Mr mosovich faces arrest if he travels outside Yugoslavia the wasn't a lot of optimism at the time that mosovich would ever face Justice ravan kadic and general ratam ladic charged nearly 4 years ago for war crimes in Bosnia have yet to be prosecuted very pessimistic feels very 2020s but let's just jump forward to the night of March 31st 2001 it's quite a wild scene in Bel tonight I think it's chaotic by this time mosovich had lost power but he was still living in the presidential complex millions of yugoslavs still supported him but the International Community was demanding Justice and it was willing to cut off Aid to mosovich successes if they didn't arrest him the Yugoslav government is hoping to secure a billion dollars in reconstruction Aid and without America's support it knows it's unlikely to get it finally the new leaders were turfing him out the police arrived at the presidential residence where Slobodan mosovich is still living at around 7 in the evening they were met by several thousand Pro mosovich demonstrators the police were there to arrest him but he wasn't coming out formal charges have now been laid and police are now trying to remove him from the presidential residence earlier rumors around the house suggested that mosovich was threatening to shoot himself as the police tried to smash their way in through the front windows of the house mosovich called into a radio station on his mobile phone absolutely I'm just sitting in my house drinking coffee with friends with a lot of citizens around has so that is the truth I want to send regards to your audience the eyes of the world on them police demonstrators and mich's bodyguards settled in for a Siege this wasn't just about mosovich this was about the entire idea of international Justice the experiment in Yugoslavia and a similar tribunal in Rwanda were being held up as examples of what was needed after crimes against humanity were committed on a massive scale but the argument went that setting up a new Tribunal for every new genocide was too timec consuming so they were used as models for this the agreement to set up the world's first permanent war crimes tribunal was greeted with cheers and from some delegates tears of relief that agreement led to the creation of the international criminal court oper ating from the hag the court will deal with genocide aggression and crimes against humanity as well as war crimes and yet there was a very serious question about whether or not it would actually work international law relies on countries agreeing to be part of it and the list of countries signing up to be within the Court's Jurisdiction had some very conspicuous absences like China Russia India and the final document was opposed by the us because of fears that its troops in the world's hotspots could become the target for politically motivated charges but these weren't the only Skeptics it seems to me impossible that an Australian government could by a treaty uh subject its own citizens to the jurisdiction of a non-australian court it's already drawing Fierce criticism for being undemocratic and unaccountable the United States has said that the risk is too great to take that's basically what they're saying and I agree with that 100% as the bgrade police Poli tried to push their way into the presidential Villa and mosovich sipped coffee with his friends the founding members of this new court were trying to convince the rest of the world that the whole thing could really work the Americans were supportive of Prosecuting mosovich specifically so if this whole thing went well maybe they would change their mind about the international criminal court well we've always said that Mr mosovich ought to be brought to Justice 26 hours into the standoff after finishing his coffee and threatening to kill himself and his family mosovich surrendered as he did his distraught daughter fired five gunshots into the night sky which I am reliably informed is a very subbian thing to do eventually mosovich was extradited to the icc's headquarters in the ha yes Mr mosovich I consider this tribunal false tribunal and indictments false indictments but the trial dragged on for 4 years and before it was complete it ended very suddenly the first head of state to be put on trial by the world and he died alone in his cell it was a heart attack a predictable one he'd been having heart problems for years back home in Belgrade Bells rang as a mark of respect there were extremely mixed feelings the victims felt robbed of Justice his supporters thought that he'd been murdered the government which had allowed him to be extradited was disappointed with the whole Saga calling it an expensive circus with insignificant Witnesses by the time of mich's death in 2006 around 100 countries had signed up to be part of the international criminal court most of the NATO countries all of the European Union many of the commonwealth countries Great Britain France Germany Canada New Zealand and slightly later than a lot of our friends Australia but Russia India China and America still refuse to be part of it the US's attitude to international law for the last 50 years since the UN was created is that International laws for everybody else and not for us I mean we've got the US Constitution we got the Bill of Rights we don't need international law and that's pretty much what the international criminal court looks like today with a third of UN member states still refusing to sign up the Court's Jurisdiction is extremely weird the court can only prosecute people who are citizens of its members States or who have committed alleged crimes in the member states or if the UN Security Council refers a case to the ICC and it's up to the member states to arrest people who've been indicted by the court of 67 indictments over 19 years nine people have been given prison sentences five trials are ongoing 30 people are fugitives the others are dead or just had the charges dropped there have been ations made that the ICC has a racial bias with most prosecutions focusing on African conflicts despite all of this the existence of the ICC has given at least the illusion of international justice but that has become more complicated recently when two friends of the Pod became International fugitives for only the third time in the history of the international criminal court a serving president has been targeted by an arrest warrant the international criminal court has accused Vladimir Putin of being responsible for the forced deportations of children following his invasion of Ukraine and has issued a warrant for his arrest for war crimes Ukraine had invited the court to investigate crimes that had happened on its territory since 2013 ke estimates that more than 16,000 children have been illegally moved to Russia or Russian occupied territories while there are many allegations of war crimes in Ukraine this is the one that the ICC prosecutor Kim Khan feels is most likely to lead to a conviction it is forbidden by international law for occupied powers to transfer civilians from the territory they live in to other territories children enjoy special protection under the Geneva Convention the ICC can investigate Putin it can issue a warrant for his arrest but then their execution depends on International cooperation Russia obviously won't arrest him and neither will friendly country like China or Belarus who haven't signed on but what if he travels to a country that has as an IC member Mongolia was obliged to arrest Vladimir Putin when he touched down instead he's been given the red carpet treatment there is absolutely no penalty for ignoring an ICC arrest warrant that's not great and there's also no penalty for just bailing out of the agreement altogether that's the move that former Philippines president Rodrigo dette pulled when the ICC started investig ating him for crimes against humanity committed during a drug war president duterte is rejecting the investigator's Authority in the country citing the fact the Philippines had cancelled its membership in 2018 I mean if that's true it seems like a pretty serious loophole you can't investigate me I quit it's now seemingly up to dte's successor as president to decide whether the IC can investigate or prosecute him we've done a whole episode epis on this by the way the story of that relationship is actually wild but now there's also Benjamin Netanyahu Israel is not a member state of the IC but Palestine has been a member since 2015 and last month the ICC accused Netanyahu and the former Israeli defense minister yoav Gallant of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war in Gaza the arrest warrants issued say the pair used starvation as a weapon of War it said they directed attacks against civilians deprived them of basic supplies such as food and water and inflicted great suffering upon people who needed medical treatment Netanyahu reacted angrily what in God's name are they talking about in the H he personally attacked the people who issued the warrant including the ICC prosecutor who's trying to extricate himself from sexual harassment charges and by biased judges were motivated by anti-semitic sentiments against the one and only je estate Netanyahu is the first Western Allied leader to be subject to an ICC arrest warrant Israel's allies around the world are wrestling with what to do if he wants to visit them France nonsensically says that they would arrest Putin but wouldn't arrest Netanyahu this of all the responses really shows you that this is a system that is very broken courts are supposed to be independent and the ICC may be independent at its heart but it's totally powerless to do anything without the cooperation of the rest of the world and the rest of the world isn't independent at all world leaders get to decide if they recognize the Court's Authority they get to decide if they'll arrest people or not the ICC is an idea that a lot of people around the world want to believe in but like so many other well-intentioned International bodies it's hamstrung by politics it's been more than 25 years since Kofi and said this today a man is more much more likely to appear before a court if he kills one person than if he kills 100,000 and since then very little has changed [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="one sure sign that the narrative the tide is turning on Israel's war on Gaza when a former Israeli prime minister describes the war as genocidal enough is enough medics getting the story out the doctors and nurses filling in the vacuum in the news coverage and taking a look under the hood of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the agenda never has been to provide humanitarian aid to the Palestinians an organization that does not do what its name implies more than 600 days into its horrific war on Palestinians in Gaza even Israel's most loyal allies from foreign governments to news organizations have been forced to confront reality from Berlin to London Paris to Ottawa support for Israel is turning into disapproval verging on condemnation over the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in the strip starving Palestinians have been lining up for food aid supplied by an organization that is the brainchild of the American and Israeli governments and looks more like a PR exercise than a humanitarian response the external political pressure along with rising dissent within Israel over the Netanyahu government's waging of this war is having an effect on the media narrative there and fracturing a consensus that goes all the way back to October 7th 2023 try as the Israelis might it will take more than a trickle of humanitarian aid to silence their critics more than propaganda to hide the war crimes it is committing when they talk about Israel and its genocidal ways in Gaza European politicians choose their words carefully particularly German ones like the chancellor Friedrich who went on the state funded broadcaster where he said finally and more than once that Israel has gone too far we have been hearing more and more international criticism germany's is probably the most significant one because of the historical baggage that guilt of the Holocaust that brought Germany to just accept and support whatever crime Israel has been committing so the fact that even Germany can no longer whitewash Israel's crime is extremely significant at the same time the foreign minister said &quot;But you know what we will not ban the weapons to Israel we reject an arms embargo so the European government is saying &quot;We condemn a killing spree but we will give the killer a sharper knife.&quot; Telling Israel &quot;What you're doing is morally wrong and might lead to negative consequences but we're not going to implement those consequences yet.&quot; With the European governments you can see stronger statements at the moment but statements basically bounce off Israel's iron dome of impunity from mers of all people it is truly too little too late and I await to see whether Palestinian solidarity activists students who have been calling out this genocide and facing brutal policing in some cases deportation i look forward to Meltz welcoming all those people back to Germany and telling them that they were right all along chancellor Meritz added Germany's name to a growing list of Western countries including France the UK and Canada that have criticized Israel over this war threatened it with sanctions but have not yet acted that effectively buys the Israelis time which they are using to keep punishing Palestinians cloaking their war crimes under the cover of organizations like the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the GHF after consistently blocking aid from getting into Gaza and attacking the agencies trying to help Palestinians including the UN's the Israelis teamed up with American military contractors mercenaries to create the GHF whose first foray into Gaza proved disastrous crowds of hungry Palestinians were herded like animals into an aid depot in Rafa humiliating scenes worthy of a concentration camp the crowd surged overwhelming those contractors shots were fired at least three Palestinians were killed the government media office in Gaza called it a deliberate massacre a full-fledged war crime committed against civilians suffering siege induced starvation people in Gaza are literally starving especially children because their bodies are not able to to withstand that that level of malnutrition even some of Israel's staunchest allies are now coming out to criticize Israel for its starvation campaign because this war has gone on for far too long we cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve it's not because they're having these big epiphies that that mass slaughter of Palestinians is wrong there's a great liberal centrist tradition of standing on the right side of history only when the relevant moment to do so has significantly passed we are seeing that grand liberal tradition be repeated now by Kama Emanuel Macron Mark Carney and other leaders who are only willing to condemn but indeed not stop Israel's activities at this point i think future proofing of reputation to say &quot;Oh but we did indeed speak up might very much be in play here.&quot; But those of us who have been paying any attention at all for the last year and a half plus are all too aware that these very governments have been funding and ideologically enabling uh Israel's actions throughout its war on Gaza Israeli officials from Benjamin Netanyahu on down have routinely dismissed allegations of war crimes as inherently anti-semitic the anti-semitic decision of the international court in the H is a modern driver that argument is more difficult to make now since more and more of those accusations are coming from Israelis including a former prime minister what is it if not a war crime ehood Ol first made that argument in a liberal Israeli paper Harets before repeating it on CNN golan a former army chief of staff turned opposition leader is another who has strayed from the path there have also been shifts in coverage in the Israeli media although limited and more common in the print sector than the broadcast side they are notable in that they reflect what is occurring politically almer is one of the earliest founders of Netanyahu's party Lioot so he's known left-wing pro Palestinian peace he's the guy that carried out one of Israel's most atrocious wars on Gaza Operation Gas so to see him now condemning what Israel is doing in Gaza as a war of annihilation as genocide it is extraordinary it speaks basically of how far Israel has gone this moment is ripe for the likes of Yer Golan and and other opposition figures in Israel because Netanyahu is facing increased pressure and leaders around the world will be happy to scapegoat Netanyahu as the perpetrator of this genocide in Gaza rather than face the reality that this was a genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian people by the state itself and so this moment presents an opportunity to put all the blame on Netanyahu both internally and internationally israel is now panicking realizing that their strategy of repeated atrocities to exhaust the global attention did not work that's why you had saying our propaganda is collapsing our legitimacy is over and you had Israel Hom saying the world is talking less about us and more about Gaza and their solution is not to end the genocide but to propagandize more to whitewash the genocide even more to double down on the failing strategy that didn't work without a doubt there are media outlets and journalists who are reassessing their position regarding this war and Wet is a good example they're showing more pictures of what's going on in Gaza speaking through the angle of starvation referring to it more and more overall however Israeli media coverage that allows for empathy for Palestinians remains the exception not the rule [Music] [Applause] 600 days into this war there have never been more lives at risk in Gaza where day after day GHF aid depots have produced nightmarish scenes of desperation and violence politicians overseas out to salvage their legacies could be enough to save some of those lives but as Israeli journalists well know there will be no saving of reputations on the Israeli airwaves the moral standing of news channels that too many citizens there still use as their primary source of information if you're only consuming Israeli media in Hebrew you will know less about what the Israeli army is doing in Gaza than probably any given citizen in the rest of the world the Israeli media has been a collaborator with this genocidal mindset and actually promoting it and by concealing the Holocaust of Gaza from the eyes of the Israeli public when the day comes that the criminals responsible for this genocide will stand on trial i think next to them on the bench the Israeli media should be located there's a reason that um experts in genocide studies and humanitarians are using terms like final solution for this stage of the genocide in Gaza we're seeing images of children burnt trapped in schools the reports we're hearing from the imperiled hospitals has prompted certain world leaders to speak up but that shouldn't lead any viewers to think that this is because there's been some sort of uh dramatic aberration by the Israeli military this is a continuation and an escalation in Gaza after so many many months of this kind of genocidal warfare throughout Israel's war on Gaza health care workers have become key voices in the reporting of this story and over the past couple of weeks the dispatches coming out of hospitals there have grown more and more desperate minakshi Ravi has been tracking this story gaza's health care system and the Palestinians who work in it have been systematically targeted by Israel for nearly 20 months now at least 94% of all hospitals in the strip have been damaged or destroyed more than 1,400 healthcare workers have been killed with thousands of doctors and nurses arrested the few who have made it out of prison say their Israeli captives reserved specific brutal torture for medics international doctors who have traveled in with aid groups now say their mission goes beyond medicine the main thing is to come here to bear witness because you're not seeing what I'm seeing because there's been a complete block to all media i am getting very sick and tired of having as as are all my colleagues of having to go onto the the news programs because journalists aren't allowed in etc to to point out what is happening here physicians returning from Gaza have also been outspoken on how dire the situation there has become the starvation the particular nature of the burns and injuries they are seeing and the targeting of Palestinian medics people need to understand that civilians their families uh healthare workers are are being intentionally and deliberately killed and I just want to say that the IDF have said in their statement regarding this uh attack in Kunis they've said that the IDF evacuated civilians from this area you don't ask the perpetrator of of of genocide we have to Dr hassan we have to ask the Israeli government if you also in addition to that response mentioned that Amn A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A amnesty international doctors without borders human rights watch the international court of justice would all beg to differ this past week American trauma surgeon Dr firo Sidwa delivered testimony to the United Nations Security Council i'm not here as a policy maker or a politician i am a physician bearing witness to the deliberate destruction of a health care system the targeting of my own colleagues and the eraser of a people these doctors are not isolated voices they have formed a network of sorts a valuable one to fill the void in reporting on this story caused by Israel's refusal to let journalists into Gaza and its killing of so many Palestinian reporters more than 200 of them thanks Mina in our lead story we touched on the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the GHF formed just months ago it is an American Israeli coalition that includes ex CIA and military personnel it is a shadowy group that started distributing aid in the southern end of the strip this past week there is not a single international aid organization that has endorsed or cooperated with the GHF instead from the UN to Oxfam to Medsan Frontier warnings have been issued that the GHF is militarized privatized and politicized an exercise in quote aidwashing when a pretense of aid is designed to cover up something else entirely one of the news outlets tracking the GHF closely with reporting from Palestinian journalists in Gaza is Drop Site News its co-founder Jeremy Scill joins us now jeremy let's start with the name of this organization now handling aid in the war zone the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the GHF out to do what its name implies not in any way shape or form i mean f first of all let's just get one basic fact straight the amount of so-called aid that it's distributing is is a pittance relative to what is needed in these starvation conditions in Gaza that are being enforced as an act of war by the USbacked Israeli regime it's incredibly cynical to use the term humanitarian in this name because Netanyahu himself has been very clear that this is a scam a scheme that is intended to kind of quiet some of the criticism that Netanyahu has received primarily from Republican senators who have said &quot;We don't like the appearance of starvation in Gaza so if you can create the facade that you're actually doing something then we're going to make sure that the weapons keep flowing and our support for your war of annihilation continues i mean Richard you couldn't get uh a a sort of uh starker symbol of what the agenda is here that you have a circumvention of an existing program that was effective that you have American mercenaries deployed on the ground that you have Israelis opening fire at desperate starving Palestinians and that it's all actually out in the open that the intent of this is to be uh just sort of a facade of humanitarianism to enable a genocide the GHF's aid distribution got off to a bad start this week the images that have come out of this the Palestinians in those caged pens lining up for food when you looked at those images what went through your mind well look I've been speaking to sources on the ground we have reporters inside of Gaza and my understanding is that there was almost no coordination whatsoever with uh local aid organizations to even inform people where they would be able to go to pick up these parcels or what would be inside of the parcels people just heard through text message WhatsApp word of mouth there's going to be aid dropped in this location and so because the population is starving and you have acute malnutrition among thousands of children people started to trek through incredibly dangerous terrain and they arrive at these sites and and it was very chaotic in some cases they were using biometric identification systems or interrogating people in others they forced or almost like cattle Palestinians into barbed wire fencing apparatus um on the first day that they started getting uh this aid distribution underway um we heard from sources inside of Gaza that a man had been kidnapped when he was interrogated by Israeli intelligence they got his family on the phone they were supposedly looking for some relative that the family hadn't been in touch with uh since the start of the war and when he didn't provide information that they were demanding from him they disappeared him that family has no idea where he is we've heard of at least a dozen or so more uh other people that were snatched when they went to go and get aid also the Israelis uh opened fire at one point they say that it was warning shots um but Palestinians were killed you know Israelis compare Palestinians to animals and this is part of what the plan is they want to essentially bait them into a cage shut the door behind them and then they either get killed in this killing cage or the ultimate plan which they call Trump's plan is to take that cage filled with Palestinians of Gaza and ship them to another country what we are witnessing here right now is is a a completely disgusting trap that Palestinians are being forced to as part of what Netanyahu has described as the final stage of his war to conquer Gaza now its backers say that the GHF is specifically designed to bypass the UN its relief agency ENROA why do the Israelis and the Americans involved in this say that that's even necessary the bypassing of established tried and tested systems of aid distribution richard it's because the the agenda never has been to provide humanitarian aid to the Palestinians um UNRA was established uh around the same time as the state of Israel was imposed on Palestine and and the reason that Israel has always stood against UNRA is because it is perhaps the most powerful symbol that uh that makes it clear that Palestinians have a right of return to their land have a right of return to their homes what we saw from the the the the moments after the October 7th operations happened inside of Israel was a very intense campaign to try to demonize the United Nations as a whole but UNRA specifically and the Israelis began planting stories that said that scores of UNRA employees had participated in the October 7th attacks and perhaps the the chief launderer of this narrative in the media was the Wall Street Journal and those stories were actually published with a by line uh of one of the reporters who herself was a uh a former IDF soldier and they they essentially portrayed UNRA as a Hamas front organization the United States and other countries responded to this propaganda and they admitted that they didn't even do their own independent review by moving swiftly to try to defund UNRA when the United States and major US media outlets began serving as conveyor belts for the lies of Israel about UNRA this was a devastating uh series of events and UNRA has been fighting for its life and so by creating an alternative pathway that circumvents international bodies that essentially seeks to to disintegrate UNRA what Israel is doing is saying &quot;We want to always be in control of the calorie intake of Palestinians we want to be able to shut off the water we want to be able to shut off the food we want to be able to block the medicine.&quot; The intent of this is to create the appearance of some alternative that would be viable to UNRA while at the same time ensuring full spectrum domination of Israel over the lives of Palestinians in Gaza you and Dropsite have done extensive reporting on the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation how difficult has it been to do that how transparent is this organization what kind of challenges are you facing in trying to tell this story you know as someone who's done a lot of reporting on mercenary organizations um and CIA front organizations it looked like what we would call a cutout that it's not actually intended to be what the public is being told but that it was set up for an alternative purpose sometimes intelligence agencies or governments set up fake companies uh to try to cover their employees as they do espionage other times they try to set up a company that has some legitimate front to it but the agenda is different i think we can safely say that the fact that there's very little information that's been released that we know the connections to both Israeli and American intelligence that this was intended to be a cutout uh that would serve the purpose of uh allowing Netanyahu to continue his war of annihilation while claiming that they're actually giving aid to people um in Gaza but Israel has been very effective with its propaganda in part because of its allies in the Western media particularly American and British news organizations that have promoted these lies or have not pushed back hard enough in demanding evidence so you know at some point uh all of these governments and officials are going to come out and pretend like they were always against the genocide we're seeing more and more media outlets coming out and taking that position we're seeing more and more academics and scholars taking that position you're seeing former Biden administration officials taking that position well history is full of people who want to be right uh through hindsight courage means speaking out in real time and so this should serve as a very serious lesson for journalists and governments when it comes to Israel you cannot ever believe the first draft of what they say you know Ronald Reagan used to say trust but verify in the case of Israel you have to assume it is lying and then check the facts jeremy Scill Drop Site News always great to have you on the show thanks again for speaking with us

stood up to the War Industry J William Fulbright George McGovern uh Gene McCarthy Mike Gravel William proxmeyer of course Dennis kucinich but that was largely decades ago the new Democrats especially with the presidency of Bill Clinton became shills not only for Corporate America but the arms industry no weapons system is too costly no war no matter how disastrous goes unfunded the massive military budget 858 billion dollars in military spending allocated for fiscal year 2023 is an increase of 45 billion over the Biden administration's budget request and nearly 80 billion dollars more than the amount appropriated by Congress for the current fiscal year it just keeps growing when 30 members of the party's Progressive caucus recently issued a call for Joe Biden to negotiate with Vladimir Putin they were forced by the party leadership in a war monger media to back down and rescind their letter what happened to the Democratic party why has it become impossible to question war in the massive expenditures on arms why is such questioning political suicide why can't a Democrat ask especially at a time of economic hardship and huge deficits how much we are going to divert to the war in Ukraine which has already consumed some 60 billion dollars as much as we spend on the state department and Aid with no end in sight joining me to discuss the extinction of the anti-war Democrat is Dennis kucinich a former presidential candidate who served eight terms in the House of Representatives before the Democratic party Jerry mandered his district to ensure his defeat um Dennis you were consistently one of the very few Democrats who hearkened back to that Great era of those I mentioned McGovern G McCarthy and others proxmeyer who stood up to the War Industry who paid a very heavy political price for that not only being pushed out of Congress but even when you were in Congress I believe you were not allowed to caucus with the Democrats if I have that correct courtesy of Pelosi but let's go back there was a moment in time when the Democratic party had a fierce peace candidates any War candidates of course 1972 McGovern becomes the nominee uh what happened well first of all uh thank you very much for the opportunity to be on your show and I I think uh you know this is the perfect show for me to do because it's not just a matter of uh having a conversation with the choir it's about taking the discussion to a higher level to try to describe for people what's actually happening what can happen uh with respect to democratic caucus though uh I found my way into the meetings [Laughter] shut me out as much as uh it was uh uh you know who who brought this guy in but but really you know I will say this about uh speaker uh Pelosi uh that we may have had a difference of opinion on some of these uh uh spending issues that help to feel Wars but the thing that I always did was I always let the leadership know ahead of time I don't agree with you I'm taking a different approach I'm going to go to the floor this is what I'm going to say you know whether you like it or not and they appreciated the warning didn't appreciate my uh uh speeches they I'm sure didn't appreciate my votes for the most part but um to me what's happened with the uh Democratic party I think as soon as the Democratic party uh many determination could have been 35 40 years ago that they were going to take corporate uh contributions that that wiped out any distinction between the two parties because in Washington uh he or she who pays the piper you know plays the tune and that's what's happened so there isn't that much of a difference in terms of the uh two parties when it comes to war except notably partisan reasons or not there were over 50 Republicans who voted against the last triage of money that went to fuel the war in Ukraine and I I felt that was notable and of course uh the uh potential speaker of the house should the Republicans win uh uh will be um Kevin McCarthy who has made it a point to say that he's going to look at that funding let's talk about the past so uh you had a significant opposition to the Pentagon budget weapon systems were questioned was it in essence corporate money uh that was uh the factor in essentially driving a wellstone driving these figures out of the house and the senate or were there other reasons certainly plays a part I mean let's face it right now the uh arms industry is making money hand over fists with the expansion of War that's how they make their money and of course they can put money into certain campaigns but that's not all it's about uh the uh the request to fund a war goes into the larger heavily mediated environment which supports a war and if you stand against the funding then your constituents who uh who may be great Americans uh look at that and they say well why aren't you supporting America and I think that members of Congress are always concerned about being caught between on what their constituents think as opposed to what they the doubts that they have and so uh with respect to the Democratic caucus uh this event a retraction of the letter uh by a significant caucus within the Democratic party uh is a new benchmark of uh kind of a slavish obesians to the um status quo within the party which then support war and had and a majority of Republicans at this point are supporting War so you have Congress uh supporting War and this is the way it's been Seymour Melman writes about the Distortion of the economy by the War Industry he points out that one of the crucial tactics that the War Industry uses is to diversify where weapons are made uh I believe f-35s are made in Vermont uh and this really ties the hands of House and Senate members because it it it becomes at a constituent level a debate about jobs well it is a factor can can ignore it so what happens is uh when the uh Pentagon budget comes up there are parade of of various uh businesses small and large who will make appointments with the Congress person or staff and lay out how many jobs are in the district and and uh and how important it is to a district business to have this budget passed I mean I mean I had that happen to me and it was uh you know I invariably have to inform my constituent that I didn't support uh the war that was going this was going to be fueling and so I wasn't going to vote for the budget I'll tell you this Chris that I may have once when I first started in Congress uh voted for a budget that went to the Pentagon but it didn't take me long to figure out what the what the racket was I had a hearing I went to as a member of the government oversight Committee in which An Inspector General uh testified that there are over a trillion dollars worth of accounts in the Pentagon that couldn't be reconciled that they had over 1100 different accounting systems deliberately I suppose I suppose constructed so as to make obfuscation a rule the day so from that moment on I just said wait a minute they're not keeping track of how this money spent why in the world should I vote for for for this budget so from that point on right through to the conclusion of a 16-year uh service in the United States Congress I didn't vote for a single budget of the of the Pentagon because or any of the supplemental Appropriations to keep Wars going because I knew it was a racket I knew there would be billions of dollars thrown away and you know I can cite chapter and first inspector General's reports once the money goes out of this country overseas on behalf you know whether it's Iraq or whatever Adventure we were in the money's blowing the thing that I was always concerned about even more than money was the fact that we were committing American servicemen and service women in the case of Iraq to uh Ally and and the constituency that I had in Congress Chris primarily working-class men and women many veterans Halls uh people really believe strongly in America uh serve the country themselves or their fathers and grandfathers served and and they they support the United States of America so I'm in Congress and I'm I'm seeing what actually is going on and I'm going wait a minute you know I'm not a sucker and I'm looking at this and I'm saying No this is wrong and then I have to go home and explain my vote and I had some people were in a happy because they thought I wasn't being patriotic enough and and that's what a congress person is supposed to do but the truth is the members of Congress are always under enormous pressure not you know locally from their constituents from uh contractors within their constituency uh from the the mediated environment and and the party and and so it's a rare individual and I'm not you know doing this to elevate myself but it's a rare individual who will go against that because you risk uh at times you may risk your political career well if if you won't take their money uh there's always someone else who will uh and they will throw a lot of that money at a candidate to take you down well that's true no matter if you're talking about the arms industry the oil companies the health care industry uh there was a Congressional candidate in 1972 who ran against a darling of the AMA and uh and he told the AMA when they came to him as uh look give the other guy the money because I'm not going to help you well they did and this uh young uh Congressional candidate lost a close race that was me by the way so I I understand the price that you might have to pay for not going with the crowd but my feeling is that public office comes and goes I mean if you you know who are we if we want to take a stand who who are any of us if we're not willing to put it all on the line in any given vote and say look this isn't only what I believe and this is who I am and I and I'm someone who I don't feel I know more than anybody else I do my homework Chris I make sure that I any vote that I take is informed and and as I did when I led the effort against uh the war in Iraq and that's not the way it goes in Congress a lot of people are flying by the seat of their pants or they look at the vote board to see how everyone else is voting because Congress is a place of tremendous peer pressure because and the votes go right up on this uh most people don't know us but but the votes aren't imagine a big gym and the votes go up on this big wall okay and people uh the lights go on green light for yes yellow light for I'm not sure and red light for now and everybody can see how everybody else is voting it helps enforce party discipline and it helps uh uh it it helps to feed the hurt Instinct in time inside the Congress it's a lot of pressure there uh let's talk about the effect of unchecked militarism on our civil society and our democracy well we live in a in a time where there's an acceleration of polarized thinking it's uh Us Versus Them whoever they are and uh the government helps to feed that the government generates uh perceptions and uh and people think well you know there must be there must be a reason for for this uh uh for the government's position on this war the truth of the matter is that we're in a heavily militarized Society driven by agreed uh lust for profit and Wars are being created just to keep fueling that and it it it it it it moves right into uh this idea of of of this old idea of a manifest destiny and then you kind of leap into the 21st century where there are still people believe who believe as in the project for a new you know a new American Century that it has to be that America must rule the world that it is our destiny I mean that is such old thinking but that's where we are and we um see we don't always consider that we're inheritors not only of a physical world but we're inheritors of a uh of a Consciousness where inheritors of thought structures and the thought structures that we've inherited no longer serve a practical purpose in this country we are are we move into a false consciousness of fear of of uh of separation from the rest of of the world see I I see the world as one I I think that human Unity is the is the is the truth that surrounds all of us and when we start separating ourselves and we engage in this polarized thinking polarized thinking is a precursor of war and so we need to try to go back to uh it's a really a spiritual principle that says that look uh we're all one we're interconnected we're in a dependent and the world is one uh you know we may have uh uh different races colors Creeds but there's a there's a Oneness and and if you look at the first model of the country e pluribus unum out of many one it it's the Paradox of a unity in multiplicity and many people can't handle that but but that's that's the truth so we're when we go to war we're living a lie we're separating ourselves from from part of humanity it's a belief that we don't have an ability to be able to solve things and somehow uh the power of our weapons is greater than the power of our of our reason or even deeper the power of our heart and so that's where you know I've gone away from the Orthodoxy which is now part of politics that says well keep that war going and for whatever reason we're going to die we're going to beat the Russian we're going to beat the Chinese what we're bidding ourselves to what extent are these conflicts and I would include the expansion of NATO driven by this lust for greed on the part of the War Industry and the arms manufacturers you know when I was in Congress I put in legislation to uh uh forbid the United States to uh to go into any war that NATO was operating because I felt that it was a subversion of the constitutional principle in Article 1 Section 8 which is a Congress of the United States has the power to to take our country from a condition of peace to war that that was in the Constitution NATO has evolved it wasn't it was first a defensive organization then after Clinton had turned into an offensive organization and it has become now a kind of a sock puppet for uh West Western Powers notably my own Deer Country in the United States and as a result uh NATO uh punches above its weight uh makes statements that are uh ridiculous and look I will make a prediction right here that as a result of of NATO and the eu's role in helping to fuel uh this this war in Ukraine give it a couple years but there won't be a NATO and there won't be an EU as a result why well first of all look at what's happened the U.S actually you know I think the way this unfolded uh in Ukraine you know we all know from 2000 um uh 14 how the U.S engineered a coup and and knocked out uh Ukrainian government and put in one that would serve the U.S interest which was to uh nullify the um the power of the constituency in in eastern Ukraine which was a Russian speaking and they they wanted to basically uh by any means necessary uh keep that uh uh out of influencing the policies of the region in which they did I mean 14 000 by some estimates uh russian-speaking ukrainians were killed from 2014 until 2021. uh most Americans have no idea about that but but anyhow once the once the U.S uh once the intelligence started to say hey we can knock Russia out like like that okay we'll Crush Russia economically these sanctions are going to put Russia away and the EU bought into it what's the result well the war goes on but in the meantime the uh the sanctions have created a dramatic uh increase in the cost of energy uh plus the look The Pipeline that another increase in the cost of energy so you've I've heard from people in Europe where they're seeing increases in in Basic Energy costs anywhere from six to nine times of what it used to be businesses can't survive that individuals are under hardship the pressure is going to go back on the government this is going to cause a lot of problems with the EU and NATO is there as you know a cat's paw for war and frankly people are going to say well who's NATO making decisions for me I would imagine that already you're starting to see protests in Europe where people are saying get out of the EU get out of NATO because they're they're paying an economic price right now for the misjudgment of the European officials who were coaxed into it by the U.S and this ends up being a nightmare a night and you know not only for Europe though but we're getting visited with it somewhat here uh you're seeing of increasing in food prices increases in gas prices uh the accelerant knock-on effect on inflation uh interest rates have gone up mortgage rates uh are gone up there's a there's a cycle of economic violence which is visited on the people of this country who really don't have a straight story about what happened in in Ukraine I represented ukrainians in the United States Congress and proudly so I want to Ukraine I met with people I stood in the square in Ukraine in defense of journalists who were who were under attack there one of whom was killed Gonzaga and so I just felt that you know ukrainians have a right to exist they have a right to their own country and uh what's happened is this is being twisted and suddenly Ukraine becomes a a blood bath of a chessboard where these innocent people are just being used as Pawns in a in a game of Nations and I resent that I mean I resent that on behalf of every every decent person who's trying to keep their family together in Ukraine and who doesn't want to be dominated by anybody U.S Russia anybody and they just want to live their lives but because there there's a game of Nations going on and the US was concerned about Russia's pivot to Asia well guess what this whole thing is blowing up in the face of the West Russia's not we we've forced Russia to Pivot to Asia and now you know Brazil uh Russia India uh China South Africa then Saudi Arabia there's a whole new world being formed and the Catalyst of it is the misjudgment that occurred about uh about Ukraine and the effort to try to control you Ukraine uh that began in 2014 that most people aren't aware of I would say let's talk about the Press because you spoke about going back to your constituents as an anti-war candidate and feeling blowback uh but isn't that because essentially we have a press that is locked out and he wore critics well I think it was a librarian of Congress Daniel borsten who wrote a book about the media being spear carriers for the government and that was true Generations ago and it's true today uh and and that's a problem when you don't have um a all when you don't have many Alternatives that present a different point of view you're locked into a a world view that might be based on on a falsity and I'll give you a great example go back to Iraq because I was really involved in that you know and challenging The Narrative right from the beginning and uh you know I did my homework I saw that back in and I gave congress a memo and on October 2nd 2002 that said look there's no proof that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction but moreover Iraq didn't have anything to do with 911 with okators were on 911 didn't have the intention or capability of attacking the United States so what is this about and I talked to hundreds of members of Commerce about it but the drum beat in the media war war from the White House war war no one bought you know and this is what so many people heard it was just drowned out and so you know I saw this I I've seen this Dynamic before and the media we have a heavily mediated Society even more so today than 20 years ago there there's uh there's and and we also know that the government can have Legions of people working computers sending out messages that phrase those who are for the war and attack those who aren't you know we're living in a in a hall of marriage here when it comes to trying to find out what is really going on and so how do you figure it out well you do your homework but you also have to trust your God your intuition too and and when I you know when I looked at what happened and and um in Iraq that led me to understand what was happening in Libya what was happening in Syria and you know and then I do some more homework I'm you know uh William Blom Chalmers Johnson and others who did the studies case after case after case of U.S interventions that were all about uh lies and our country I love this country and it is being uh uh it is being done a disservice by people who in power who have made book with interest groups who are going forward just to cash in on war and uh and I and I think it's horrific and and in this case Chris we're uh we're playing with the flash of world war three uh you know there are sometimes I think that people in the White House are like something out of uh The Sorcerer's Apprentice you know they're playing with their their they've taken this broom and they're moving out chemical forces around that are going beyond that can easily go beyond their control and and you know so I'm also concerned that things could spin out of control with even now with respect to uh to Russia with respect to China uh North Korea um and what a tragedy what an immense human tragedy when the truth of the matter is we we must find a way to live together as John Kennedy said you know we have to you know learn how to live together as brothers and sisters so we perished together as fools I I want to ask about these pimps of War these shills for War I covered the war in El Salvador I had to deal with Elliot Abrams Robert Kagan worked for him they're wrong about everything they were wrong about the interventions in Iraq Afghanistan Syria with a so-called moderate Rebels Libya and now they're beating the drums of course for endless war with Ukraine it doesn't matter how uh mistaken they were in the past they are perpetuated their think tanks are perpetuated they never lose their purchase on uh the cable talk shows you've dealt with these people I know some of them Abrams and others they are truly human mediocrities uh and I would include the generals like Petraeus and others and yet they're like this uh bacteria or anti-resistant bacteria that we can't uh Vanquish uh talk about them well you know Chris I see the way I looked at it is that even people with whom I I strongly disagree and you just named a number uh I I think we we have to continue to find ways of showing people you know they've they've gone um uh astray and that we have to make an effort to bring them back now how do you do that well um if there ever was a country that was in need of a process of Truth and Reconciliation it's America we really need to have people come forward and admit that they were wrong that you know whatever their motivation was so that we can heal this country because we're divided right now in this whole idea about about war and uh you know this misuse of power in some ways a misunderstanding of the material world itself that we think there's only so much and we have to control it uh if you look at physics the material world you know the the universe keeps expanding but you wouldn't know that talking to some people because their their physics is a very confined almost uh uh pre uh uh Galileo view of the world Dennis I just wanna just in the last two minutes I mean you talked about Truth and Reconciliation there was a certain amount of accountability after the Vietnam War I mean we did as a country ask questions about ourselves that we hadn't asked before and there was a brief period of time when I would argue we became a better country now there's no accountability uh I spent seven years in the Middle East I mean millions of people's lives were destroyed not to mention the tens of thousands of families in the United States who are caring for wounded and crippled veterans or lost loved ones but there's no accountability at all you know uh this is uh there we must find a path to accountability or it's it will be our undoing uh you know I I made an attempt to uh follow a procedure which is one way of achieving accountability through the legislative process and that is that I introduce articles with Patron uh of the president and the vice president I was with you at the Canon building when you did that you remember that and yes and uh you know there were at least 48 articles with respect to uh President Bush and a smaller number for uh vice president Cheney uh the Democratic Leadership however sent that to uh uh those those proposals to committee uh never to be discussed see we it's you know when I when I got on the floor of Congress and I did hundreds of speeches opposed to opposed to the war and and after the war started and proposals to get out of Iraq and other features to not go to war against Iran and and each time there was a a a a a kind of a uh Amnesia that took place with gorbid alcohols the United States of Amnesia it just takes place where people forget the the mistakes not mistakes the misdeeds of the past and and unless we have some measure of accountability uh we're always going to be uh wearing the stain of of uh of war waged against innocent people around the globe and there's a point Chris where we have to start asking ourselves what are we about as a nation are we about endless war about being King of the mountain about uh you know telling other nations how they should live or wouldn't it be nice to start focusing on the education of our people put the resources into education and health care and and job creation and and safe cities and a cleaner environment and all those things that we can do within this within the boundaries of what we know as the United States of America I I you know to me politically it never made sense to just go all over the world but with the media it's it's been and I that was the area of study I had University with the media it's always been pounding away at you know America has to be the the Vanguard of freedom for the world and we're losing it here at home yeah well we have to stop there we should also be clear we've lost almost all these wars going back to Vietnam including Afghanistan and Iraq that was

          <attvalue for="3" value="Is South Sudan heading back into full-scale civil war? This video explores the alarming escalation in tensions between President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar that has reignited fears of renewed conflict. After gaining independence in 2011 amid global optimism, South Sudan quickly spiraled into a devastating five-year civil war, largely driven by political rivalry the war took on an ethnic dimension as fighting broke out between the Dinka and Nuer communities. Although a peace agreement was signed in 2018, known as the Revitalised Agreement (R-ARCSS), the uneasy truce is now unraveling. Machar's recent house arrest, ordered by Kiir, has sparked condemnation and violent clashes, including attacks on civilians and aid workers.&#10;&#10;This video traces the origins of South Sudan’s internal strife—from British colonial legacies and post-independence tensions with Sudan, to the oil-fueled conflict that tore the nation apart. We examine how unresolved grievances, political power struggles, and ethnic divisions have created a fragile state teetering on collapse. With over 150,000 people newly displaced and peace talks faltering, many now fear that the country may be on the verge of a second civil war. Can diplomacy prevail? Or is South Sudan once again trapped in a cycle of violence and instability?&#10;&#10;VIDEO CHAPTERS&#10;00:00 Introduction and Titles&#10;00:41 The Return to Civil Wars and the Case of South Sudan&#10;01:58 South Sudan: Location and Population&#10;02:53 The Emergence of Sudan&#10;04:37 The First Sudanese Civil War&#10;05:56 South Sudan Gains Independence&#10;07:45 South Sudan: Independence and Civil War, 2011-2018&#10;09:15 South Sudan’s Post-Civil War Period, 2018-2025&#10;10:17 Is South Sudan Returning to Civil War?&#10;&#10;SUPPORT THE CHANNEL&#10;If you like my videos, please subscribe or become a Channel Member.

          <attvalue for="7" value="Is South Sudan on the brink of a new civil war? In July 2011, South Sudan became  the world's newest nation. But celebrations soon turned to violence as the  country sank into a brutal five-year civil war. But while the sides eventually reached a peace   deal, the uneasy truce has now  collapsed, leading to clashes. So what exactly lies behind this story, and could  South Sudan really be about to return to war? Hello and welcome. If you're new to the channel,  my name is James Ker-Lindsay,   and here I take an informed look at international  relations, conflict, security, and statehood. We tend to think that civil wars end  when the sides reach a peace agreement. The warring parties sign a deal and then begin   the long and arduous process of  reconciliation and reconstruction. However, all too often these  agreements merely pause the fighting. A period of calm is followed by renewed conflict. This can be due to various factors. Sometimes the root cause of the conflict—such  as ethnic or religious tensions,   disputes over resources, or economic  and social exclusion—remain in place. At other times, dissident factions undermine  peace, sparking a return to violence. But sometimes the return to war is caused by   lingering hostility between  the supposedly former foes. A good case in point is South Sudan. Just two years after becoming independent in 2011,   it collapsed into a brutal civil war  as the country's leadership split. However, while an agreement eventually brought the  warring sides together, it's been an uneasy peace. As splits have again opened up between  the country's top leaders, a series of   attacks mark the possible start of what many  now believe could be a renewed civil war. The Republic of South Sudan  is located in East Africa. Landlocked and covering approximately 650,000  square kilometres, or around a quarter of a   million square miles, it's bordered by  Ethiopia to the east, Kenya, Uganda,   and the Democratic Republic of Congo to the south,  and the Central African Republic to the west. To the north lies Sudan. Its population is believed  to be around 12 million. While this comprises over  60 different ethnic groups,   the two dominant communities  are the Dinka and the Nuer. Situated in the northwest of the country, the  Dinka represent around 35% of the population. Meanwhile, the Nuer, representing around  15%, are located mainly in the northeast. Most of the population is Catholic or Anglican  Christian, followed by local religions. While South Sudan has a long and rich  history, our story begins in the first   half of the 19th century, when Ottoman  and Egyptian forces pressed southwards,   establishing control over what is now Sudan. However, after an Islamic uprising broke out  in 1881, raising concerns about the security   of the newly built Suez Canal, Britain sent in  troops and Sudan came under Anglo-Egyptian rule. From the start, it was a complex situation. Although Sudan was formally a single colonial  unit, it consisted of two very distinct parts. The six northern provinces, which made up  around three-quarters of the population,   were predominantly Arab and Muslim. In contrast, the three southern provinces  included various sub-Saharan tribes. While many of these followed local religions,   as missionaries reached into the area,  increasing numbers converted to Christianity. All this would come to a head  after the Second World War. As British decolonisation began, a  debate emerged regarding Sudan's future. While the North wanted independence,   many in the South feared domination  by their northern neighbours. To this end, they called for the new state to be   based on a federal structure that would  provide them with extensive self-rule. And if this wasn't possible, they  demanded their own separate country,   a position resolutely rejected by the North. All of this led to increasing tensions. Fearing that it was losing control,  Britain now swiftly decided to withdraw. Six months later, on 1 January 1956, the  Republic of Sudan gained its independence. From the start, tensions  between the communities grew,   especially after the central government  was overthrown by a military coup in 1958. As the Muslim Arab North attempted  to extend its control over the South,   the South launched an insurgency. While at first this was contained, by the  end of the 1960s the situation was changing. With support from Israel, which was  growing increasingly concerned about   Sudan's close ties to its then-archenemy Egypt,  southern forces began to gain the upper hand. Following international mediation, the  sides reached a peace agreement in 1972. Under the terms of the deal, the  South would gain extensive self-rule. But little changed in the years that followed. The North still dominated. And on top of this, other  significant differences now emerged. Notably, as the northern leadership  became overtly religious, it tried to   impose Islamic Sharia law on the Christian South. At the same time, strains emerged  following the discovery of oil on   the boundary between the North and South. As a result, in September 1983, the  Sudanese government unilaterally   cancelled the peace agreement, plunging  the country back into a new civil war. This time, though, the South  was far better prepared. Under its leader, Dr John Garang,  an agricultural economist and former   colonel in the Sudanese Army,  the Sudan People's Liberation   Army—the SPLA—quickly seized control of  most of the rural areas in the South. But while the war ebbed and  flowed over the next two decades,   by the turn of the millennium,  fatigue was setting in on both sides. Twenty years of fighting had left over two million  dead in what was now Africa's longest civil war. Meanwhile, the broader geopolitical  situation was also changing. Following 9/11, the United  States stepped up pressure   on the Islamist regime of the country's  long-standing dictator, Omar al-Bashir. All this paved the way for new negotiations. And in early 2005, the sides signed  a Comprehensive Peace Agreement,   giving the South considerable autonomy. Crucially, they also agreed that a  referendum would be held after six years. This would provide the South  with a fundamental choice. It could either accept the new power-sharing  arrangement and remain within Sudan. Or it could break away and become independent. In January 2011, almost four million South   Sudanese went to the polls to vote  on whether to keep the arrangement. Unsurprisingly, almost 98% voted for independence. And just six months later, on 9 July 2011,  South Sudan formally declared independence,   becoming the 193rd member of the  United Nations just five days later. I hope you're finding this useful.

While there were initially high hopes for peace   and stability after half a century of  conflict, the euphoria quickly faded. From the start, the new country faced serious  political, economic, and social challenges. In addition, corruption and ethnic favoritism led   to increasing factionalism across the ruling  Sudan People's Liberation Movement—the SPLM. This was highlighted by the deep divisions  between the country's top leaders. On the one hand, there was President  Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka,   who had assumed leadership  after Garang died in 2005. Meanwhile, on the other side was the Vice  President, Riek Machar, an ethnic Nuer. Amidst rumours of an impending coup, in July 2013  Kiir dismissed the government, including Machar. As the ruling party now split into two  factions—the SPLM in Government, led by Kiir,   and the SPLM in Opposition, led by Machar—South  Sudan descended into a bitter civil war. Despite its political roots,   the fighting soon gained an ethnic  dimension, pitting Dinka against Nuer. As a result, an estimated 400,000 people  were killed and millions more displaced in   a conflict that was marked by brutal  atrocities and a widespread famine. Meanwhile, although international efforts to  broker peace led to multiple ceasefires and   temporary agreements, these were  repeatedly broken by the sides. In the end, a new agreement  was reached in September 2018. Under the terms of the deal, Machar was  reinstated as First Vice President under Kiir. At the same time, it also  contained other vital elements. These included a new constitution,   efforts to unite the factional ministers  within the army, and promises of elections. However, despite the promises,  little of this took place. Meanwhile, critics argued that the  agreement neglected deeper issues,   such as the serious ethnic  divisions that had emerged. In addition, the country continued to be plagued  by economic instability and humanitarian crises. As a result of all this, the relationship between   Kiir and Machar and their respective factions  remained tense, leading to occasional clashes. All this came to a head in March 2025. Accusing Machar of inciting rebellion,   Kiir ordered that the Vice President  be placed under house arrest. While many international observers—including the   United States and the United Nations—strongly  condemned Machar's detention, seeing it as a   dangerous escalation of the situation,  the government refused to back down. As a result, the opposition claimed  that the peace deal was finished. As expected, all this saw a dramatic rise in  tensions and further clashes between the groups. The situation further exacerbated with  news that neighbouring Uganda had sent   its forces into South Sudan to  support the Kiir government. All this has, in turn, prompted the  UN's representative, Nicholas Haysom,   to warn that the country is teetering on the  brink of a return to full-scale civil war. Such fears have been most recently  stoked by a deadly bombing of   a hospital run by the international  aid charity Médecins Sans Frontières,   which killed at least seven  people and injured twenty. While it's unclear who carried out the  attack, with the sides blaming each other,   MSF has condemned the attack as a  deliberate violation of international law. So, is South Sudan on the verge of  a return to full-scale civil war? At this stage, the situation is obviously unclear. Efforts to mediate the crisis are still ongoing. For example, Kenya dispatched  its former Prime Minister to   facilitate dialogue between the factions. However, the situation certainly  remains precarious, with the 2018   peace agreement under significant  strain—if not entirely broken. And it's for these reasons that the  international community continues to   urge both leaders to recommit to the peace process  to prevent a return to widespread conflict. But given past experience, hopes are low. With such a long history of  violence and factional fighting,   there are fears that South Sudan may well be  on the brink of another devastating civil war.
