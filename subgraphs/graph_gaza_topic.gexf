Israel would allow limited food supplies into Gaza as the population of more than 2 million faces famine after 11 weeks of a total Israeli blockade But it's not clear exactly when that food will cross

Palestinians is beyond description beyond atrocious and beyond in a policy of siege and starvation makes a mockery of international law NBC News reports the Trump administration's working on a plan to permanently remove 1 million Palestinians from Gaza and transfer them to Libya On Friday UN Human Rights Chief Vocar Turk said Israel's actions in Gaza are quote tantamount to ethnic cleansing Gaza's health ministry confirms Israel's killed at least 53,300 Palestinians in Gaza since October 2023 The death toll does not account for thousands of people believed dead including those trapped under the rubble nor those killed by the indirect effects of Israel's assault on Gaza In fact the number could be more than two times three times higher For more we're joined in Montreal by Muen Rabani Middle East analyst co-editor of Jud Jalia and a non-resident fellow at the Center for Conflict and Humanitarian Studies He's a contributor to the book Deluge Gaza and Israel from crisis to cataclysm Welcome back to Democracy Now Men Thanks so much for being with us um if you can respond to the situation right now the escalation of the attacks on Gaza Well the situation as anyone who's following the news can see is thoroughly apocalyptic Um there is not only an unprecedented siege but also an unprecedented intensification of Israel's genocidal military campaign in the Gaza Strip And judging um by the statements of Israel's most senior leaders it aims towards the complete occupation of the Gaza Strip and the destruction of everything that remains standing in the Gaza Strip and ultimately the mass for forcible expulsion of its entire population And the past few days have have been um particularly cataclysmic At the same time uh negotiations about a potential new agreement are ongoing and um this will be decided neither by Israel uh nor by the Palestinians but by the United States To the extent that Israel continues with this assault it means that it has a US green light for doing so uh to the extent that the situation changes that means that Israel has been instructed by Washington to change course Talk about Israel partially lifting the blockade What exactly does this mean after 11 months of a full blockade on medicine and aid 11 weeks at this stage it doesn't appear to mean very much according to reports um available this morning Um Israel is preparing to permit something on the order of 50 trucks to enter the Gaza Strip And we're talking about a population of between 1 and a half and 2 million people who have been deprived of any um uh goods entering from outside the territory since the very beginning of March So this is clearly um a drop in the bucket Uh I think the more important question is whether this is the beginning of a lifting of the siege under US and international pressure and just as importantly whether Israel and the US are going to move ahead with this hairbrain scheme that has already been denounced by the international aid community of setting up a aid mechanism whose purpose is to force the relocation of the Gaza Strip population to specified locations where they can um uh access limited humanitarian supplies under the watchful eye of US mercenaries acting on behalf of the Israeli military government Can you talk about the US plan that's been reported to move Palestinians to Libya yes it's interesting that this report has now been formally denied um by the US embassy in in Libya um uh I think as a precautionary measure given what happened to that embassy about a decade ago But we do know that um President Trump has repeatedly uh proposed an initiative whereby the entire Palestinian population of the Gaza Strip would be forcibly relocated outside the Gaza Strip Um it would be taken over and rebuilt presumably by US real estate developers um acting in coordination with Israel And there have been persistent reports that the US and Israel have been approaching a variety of countries both within the region and beyond to accept these uh forcibly displaced uh Palestinians And in respect of Libya um the reports are that the US has offered Libya to unfreeze billions of dollars in um Libyan funds that have been uh frozen in international financial institutions since the reign of uh Muhammad Gaddafi who was overthrown and killed over a decade ago If and only if Libya accepts um uh 1 million Palestinians on its territory this would increase the Libyan population by over 10% And it's effectively bri bribing Libya with its own money to participate in this war crime and crime against humanity But it seems to me exceptionally unlikely that Libya will even um seriously consider this proposal for one moment given um the impact it would have on on Libya's uh domestic uh politics which is very strongly pro Palestinian And I think the real issue here is not the extent to which this um initiative can actually be implemented but rather the legitimization it gives to Israel's determination repeatedly expressed to expel the Palestinian population of the Gaza Strip and further down the line from the West Bank as well On Friday President Trump actually said quote &quot;A lot of people are starving in Gaza under the Israeli blockade.&quot; He said the US wanted to help reduce the suffering What can the US do what can the world do you have up to a 100,000 people in the Netherlands protesting outside the H You have a number of Italian parliament members going to the Egyptian side of the Rafa border uh demanding that uh um the world stop arming Israel Can you talk about what the solutions are at this point well you had as you mentioned the 100,000 approximately protesters in the Netherlands um with reports of something in the range of half a million in London um uh the day before And there is um growing opposition and and disgust with Israel's engineered starvation policy and absolutely genocidal military campaign in the Gaza Strip And a number of European governments are now beginning to speak more loudly as well calling for example for a reconsideration of Israel's preferential trade privileges with the European Union But at this stage the decision really will be made not in London or Brussels or Berlin but in Washington because of the extraordinary leverage that the United States exercises over Israel And it will take no more than a phone call from Washington to the Israeli government to effect a complete reversal in Israeli policy within the space of a day Um that's really the only reason we're now seeing this limited very limited resumption of aid And with respect to the statements by um uh President Trump I think we also need to bear in mind we're dealing here with a quite erratic leader who can contradict himself in the space of a day or even an hour So what we really need to focus is not so much on what he says but what the United States does There are ongoing um negotiations for a new agreement and it's difficult to tell exactly what's happening there Of course they're being held um behind uh closed doors but we still need to find out the extent to which Washington is exercising genuine pressure if any on Israel to force it to um accept an agreement that will um uh res that will lift the siege lead to an exchange of captives and ultimately put an end to this genocidal war Uh let me ask you finally Drop Site News is reporting a senior Hamas official received assurances from President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff the US would force Israel to lift the Gaza blockade within two days after releasing the USIsraeli citizen um Edan Alexander Basam Naim a member of Hamas's political bureau said the Trump administration reneged on its promise saying they didn't violate the deal they threw it in the trash your response to the report and if do you think that's why they lifted Israel lifted it partially well these these reports may well form part of the background of today's developments that we've uh been discussing but at the time it was um you know Hamas said it was uh releasing this um Israeli soldier who's also a US uh citizen as a goodwill gesture on the eve of uh Trump's uh visit to the Middle East And the Americans also said they had offered nothing in exchange So um quite clear clearly there were no formal undertakings by the United States But I think it's entirely reasonable to suppose that there were informal assurances given and those once again ended up uh not not being worth um uh the paper they were or in this case were not written on Um but at the same time they could form part of the background of the developments that we're seeing now which is that negotiations seem to have been intensified I think it's very premature to conclude that they will succeed or result in a meaningful agreement but there's quite clearly more going on behind the scenes um than than we are directly aware of Muin Rabani I want to thank you for being with us Middle East analyst co-editor of Jadalia and a non-resident fellow at the Center for Conflict and Humanitarian Studies uh contributor to the book Deluge speaking to us from Montreal Canada Democracy Now is funded by viewers like you Please give

been a territory of death and destruction united States get involved and make it just a freedom zone have a real freedom zone a freedom zone this comes amidst mounting warnings of starvation in Gaza which is the headline of our next guest's new piece in the London Review of Books alex Dval executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tus University author of the book Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine welcome back to Democracy Now uh congratulations on the efforts of so many at TUS and also outside of TUS to have uh Romesa released um the uh Turkish student uh who was a Fulbright scholar and was taken by masked ICE agents on the streets of Somerville uh Ramesa Oturk now out of an ICE jail alex if you can start off by laying out um what you found in your new piece for the London Review of Books Starvation in Gaza so just a couple of days ago the United Nations integrated food security phase classification which is a real mouthful um it's a it's a system it's a collaboration of different humanitarian agencies um and they undertook a survey it's the fifth such survey since the beginning of the war in in in the most recent war in Gaza some 19 months ago they undertook a survey of food security and malnutrition and what they found was yet again that uh the majority of people in Gaza are facing emergency or catastrophic levels of food insecurity and levels of malnutrition are rising fast and this is directly related to the total blockade imposed upon the Gaza Strip at the beginning of March and normally um in situations of famine there are many complex factors that uh work in between the level of food availability and and children getting hungry and beginning to die in large numbers in the case of Gaza it's actually sadly a lot more straightforward there's really the only food that is available is that that is permitted to enter by Israel and those food stocks are running out russians are getting low and the poorest and most vulnerable are beginning to starve and die well you write in in your piece uh Alex Cival uh that quote &quot;Gaza is an anomaly a laboratory in which we will discover how much nutritional stress a population can withstand before succumbing on mass so if you could uh elaborate on that and whether that is indeed the conclusion that was reached in the IPC report so a a normal healthy adult will uh last somewhere between 60 and 80 days deprived of all nutrition now we haven't got to that stage but children perish much more quickly and there are a significant numbers of children who need specialized feeding need food that cannot be readily prepared with just the food that is available with the uh with the lack of clean water the lack of electricity supplies so we are seeing the most vulnerable um already succumbing and there are two scenarios that were laid out in this report one is a situation in which the status quo continues the level of blockade and the level of destruction continue unimpeded in which case um mass starvation famine is inevitable it is a question of weeks before that unfolds the second scenario is if the Israeli US plan for setting up a an an alternative humanitarian system comes into play now the background to this is that Israel um wants to debar the UNRA and the United Nations and um other international humanitarian organizations from being present on the ground in Gaza and to to put humanitarian provision in the hands of a new system uh a new method a new scheme the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and not many details are available about this but what is known is that the plan is to have just four distribution centers in a small part of Gaza supplying at most 60% of the population with minimum rations and the food would be brought and distributed by uh members of this uh new foundation including uh US private military contractors protected by the IDF and it would simply be those rations and and and basic hygiene and medical kits there would be no reconstruction of infrastructure no specialized feeding um for malnourished children etc now even if this were to work the conclusion of the IPC it doesn't spell it out in quite so many words but it's pretty clear the conclusion is mass starvation would still unfold just somewhat more slowly so uh Alex could you also um talk about the fact of this this concept of yours of surveillance humanitarianism how does the aid scheme that you've just been talking about uh that is proposed by the Israelis and backed by the Americans fit into that uh how precisely would it work you've also said the plan is quote an individualized version of late colonial counterinsurgency back in the 1950s the British government mounted a a a anti-communist counterinsurgency in Malaya and they explicitly called it operation starvation and the idea was that every individual who was in a protected village would and and and was properly accredited with the authorities would receive enough food and every item of food was counted going into those protected villages and outside the protected villages where the communist gerillas were able to roam no food would be available they would be forced to starve now what we're seeing is a version of this um a much more sophisticated version being uh uh being implemented by Israel today so clearly their intent is that no food should get into the hands of Hamas and they have details about every individual in Gats so the the plan as a by inference is that they would screen every individual and they would put accredited individuals who have no link to Hamas on the distribution list those individuals would be notified by text message to come to pick up the uh the rations that they are allocated at a certain time in a certain place and their identities would be verified by face recognition and other technologies and then they would go they would take those rations those rations would presumably be just enough for a few days perhaps a week so that they would um there would be very little chance of them falling into the hands of anybody else and then they would have to um come back so it is um the the the welfare indeed the survival of every Palestinian family in Gaza would be dependent upon on a week-to-eek basis on this type of surveillance and and accreditation system in a you can look at it as the the sort of the counterpart of the uh the surveillance and AI algorithms the the the lavender system that is being used by Israel to identify by um members of Hamas whom they are targeting for u assassination so they would have a counterpart for feeding the people whom they um are prepared to keep alive meanwhile Alex Dval the New York Times is reporting some Israeli officials are privately admitting Gaza is on the brink of starvation and warn of the effects if the blockade is not lifted since it takes a while there are thousands of trucks waiting outside to get in to increase the humanitarian aid and you have President Trump today in Qatar uh talking about um uh is Gaza being a freedom zone controlled by the United States your response i'm not quite sure what President Trump means by a a freedom zone but I think it is it is clear across the board um with the information that we have and I have no doubt Israel has pretty much the same information and they may just dispute some of the details but the the overall um picture is is completely clear that something dramatic is going to have to be done to prevent mass starvation and and and and famine unfolding in the very near future in in Gaza the situation cannot be allowed to to get to the brink and then just pull back slightly from the brink has been as has been happening when the Israelis um opened u supply routes and and food distribution a year ago and and again with the the ceasefire a few months ago the population simply cannot withstand um this type of pressure for uh really any longer without the the utmost catastrophe unfolding well Alex you conclude your piece by saying that Israel may quote do just enough to keep most Palestinians alive but whether this prevents the destruction of Palestinians in Gaza as a group is another matter if you could say what you mean by that what do you imagine Israel will do so the um what we see in this process of if if it unfolds this sort of individually targeted surveillance humanitarianism is keeping individuals and and families alive but dismantling the entire structure of society now clearly the uh the dismantling of Hamas is the political and military goal of of Israel but if it goes further towards the dismantling of society as a whole which is one of the things that we often see during famines it's not just that individualized biological suffering it is the tearing apart of social bonds the collective humiliation the degradation of society that is the the the deep trauma the profound experience of famine if that is allowed to proceed then Palestinian society as it has existed will be in irrevocably changed torn apart traumatized and if Israel knowingly does this then it will be culpable not just of the the war crime of starvation but of the destruction of of of the Palestinian people of Gaza alex Dval thank you so much for being with us executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tus University author of the book Mass Starvation: The History and Future

          <attvalue for="3" value="Support our work: https://democracynow.org/donate/sm-de...&#10;&#10;Palestinian writer Mosab Abu Toha has just been awarded the 2025 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for his essays about the Palestinian experience in the face of the U.S.-backed Israeli assault on Gaza. He joins Democracy Now! to discuss his work, the necessity of advocating for Palestinian rights, and the violence of Israeli occupation. Abu Toha, who evacuated Gaza in late 2023 after being arrested, beaten and detained by the Israeli military, now resides in Syracuse, New York. He says that, while grateful for the platform granted by the Pulitzer, he cannot celebrate the achievement while &quot;my sisters, my brothers and my parents in Gaza are starving.&quot; Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip has trapped millions of Palestinians in famine conditions, unable to evacuate and under threat of daily bombings and Israeli troop movements. &quot;The only celebration for me is when there is an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza [and] the West Bank, and when justice and peace are served in Palestine,&quot; says Abu Toha.&#10;&#10;Democracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on over 1,500 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

Amy Goodman with Juan Gonzalez israeli strikes on Gaza have killed at least 11 Palestinians so far today with deadly attacks reported in Kanunis in Bethlia in Gaza City the attacks follow Israeli attacks that killed 54 Palestinians Monday health officials in Gaza say at least 57 Palestinians have already starved to death the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees in reported some 66,000 children in Gaza are suffering severe malnutrition due to Israel's total blockade of food and aid now in its ninth week some Palestinians have resorted to eating turtle meat grass rotten or expired food one displaced grandmother Um Muhammad Al Talka said it took her five hours of standing in a line at a community kitchen in Gaza's Nusadat district to get one meal to feed her hungry children and grandchildren i've been coming here since 8:00 a.m to the Takaya soup kitchen for food to alleviate our hunger and be able to stand up we are suffering from famine real famine i have not eaten anything since this morning i cannot speak because of hunger on Monday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outlined plans for the stepped up offensive on Gaza saying the Palestinian population quote will be moved for its own protection he says the whole population must move south netanyahu did not say how much of Gaza Israel plans to seize reuters reports it could include all of Gaza's territory we're joined now by the acclaimed Palestinian poet Masab Abu Toha on Monday he won a Pulitzer Prize for commentary for his writings in the New Yorker magazine he was praised for his quote essays on the physical and emotional carnage in Gaza that combined deep reporting with the intimacy of memoir to convey the Palestinian experience of more than a year and a half of war with Israel.&quot; At least 31 of MSab's family members have been killed by Israel in Gaza his books include things you may find hidden in my ear poems from Gaza and Forest of Noise first Mosab it's terrible to say in light of what's happening in Gaza to start off by saying congratulations but wow you just won the Pulitzer Prize talk about what this means to you and the statement you put out um as you learned of this huge honor uh first of all I would like to thank you Amy u appreciate your work appreciate Democracy Now thank you so much for your voice um uh this honor has u brought to me tears and joy uh I mean joy because uh this is um um I mean this is a big prize this is something that every every writer um I mean writer and and artist and journalist it dreams of uh winning uh but this is also very sad for me because the pieces for which I I won the prize the the four pieces I mean I wrote about seven or eight pieces for the New Yorker uh this prize was uh awarded to uh four of my pieces uh the four pieces are one for uh one about an article that I wrote about starvation in Gaza the other one was about the difficulty of traveling as a Palestinian the third one was about uh the loss of the refugee camp and the fourth uh was about um the Gaza we leave behind uh and unfortunately as I'm you know looking at the titles of these essays the situation in Gaza is worsening i mean not day after day but minute after minute and people are are dying I mean children are dying of hunger uh people are dying for lack of uh not only food but also medicine uh so this this this prize means a lot to me but it also reminds me that that there's a lot uh to work on not only um uh by writing but also uh encouraging uh people who have the power to take action to stop all of this and Mosab uh I wanted to ask you given the fact of the continuing attacks of the Israelis in Gaza and the complete failure of the world community to be able to do anything to stop Israel uh your sense of uh what you're seeing in terms of the American public uh since you've been in the United States in terms of its response uh to the war i think the American public uh and also people around the world are eager uh to learn uh they I mean the unfortunately the mainstream media is not doing enough uh Israel has been uh preventing uh people from visiting Gaza not only after October 7th but even before but especially after October 7th um uh journalists medics u a few a very very few little number of of of uh doctors have been allowed to go to Gaza i think the American people need to uh uh need to hear more and more voices i mean my voice is I mean is one is only one voice that uh that that is necessary to hear but there are so many other voices that that are there still in Gaza journalists and writers and artists and and and and um and university professors who have so many stories to tell my story is one story my story is other people's stories but we we need to hear more and more people and I think that the American public uh is truly eager and not only eager but I mean they they feel the necessity they they feel the the duty uh to hear and learn uh about more and more stories in Gaza and I'm happy that my power pieces that won these awards are uh stories that I wrote about myself about my people in Gaza about the refugee camp where I was born my family members who were killed my my my students my my my great aunt whose body is still under until today since last October um so there are so many other stories uh that are to be heard and I hope that the American magazines and newspapers and the American channels news channels would open up their spaces to let these writers and people in Gaza share their stories because this is what we should be doing at least i mean I mean killing people in Gaza is one crime but also not not giving them the space to talk about their pain and also demands because all the time we hear you know politicians yesterday we hear President Trump saying that I we want to we want to help the people of Gaza we want to we they have to move we will feed them but I mean come on i mean we are not people who need to be fed we are not hungry because we don't have food we are hungry because we are under occupation we are under siege we are we are under genocide this is not this is not what people in Gaza want it's not that they want only to eat they want freedom this is what they want masab Abu Tawha I want to turn to you speaking at the Jewish Voice for Peace National Meeting this weekend you read If I Must Die by the great Palestinian poet killed in Rafa Rafat Alar if I must die by Al if I must die you must live to tell my story to sell my things to buy a piece of cloth and some strings make it white with a long tail so that a child somewhere in Gaza while looking heaven in the eye awaiting his dad who left in a blaze and bid no one farewell not even his to his flesh not even to himself see the kite my kite you made flying up above and thinks for a moment an angel is there bringing back love if I must die let it bring hope let it be a tail if I must die mosab Abu Toha you referenced Rafat uh in winning uh the Pulitzer Prize yesterday talk about your relationship with him who he was and what he means for the people of Palestine yeah I talked a lot about Rifhat i wrote about him uh Rifat was a university professor uh who was murdered and this is not mentioned a lot he was not only murdered alone he was murdered along with his with two of his siblings and four nephews uh Rifat died while he was holding a pen in his hand while he was wearing his glasses uh reading poetry and writing more poems to us um asking us to continue his message which is the tale of every people in who are oppressed by occupation who are under siege who are dying in a genocide if I must die let it bring hope let it be a tale if he must die we need to tell Rafad's tale we need to I mean as I said before if I must die this is a crime to be to for someone to die to be killed by occupation and we have to remember here that 70% of the population in Gaza are refugees so these refugees they have stories it's not that they were killed by an occupation no they were killed as they have dreamed all their lives to return to their homeland so died with his with two of his siblings and four nephews and in the past he lost another brother in 2014 so Rifatwas was not only a writer he was not only a university professor but he was also a mentor for so many young writers he introduced me to the we are not numbers project in 2014 after the Israeli 51-day attacks on Gaza which claimed the lives of three close friends of mine about whom I wrote uh in my poetry and in my essays so Rifat was was was more than I mean it is a huge loss and this is why we have to honor his memory by continuing to tell the tales not only and when Rifhat said let it be a tale it's not only Rifhat's tale because Rifhat's tale my tale my grandparents tail are the tales of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and our tales are not only Palestinian tales it is a human tale of loss after loss loss after loss while the world is watching us so we refuse to die just like that we will we will fight to live not only to live but also to tell the stories of those who died before us who were who were who were meant to die in blindness to die in darkness no we will live we will fight we will continue to speak up because this loss the loss of Rifhat and so many hundreds of my friends and family members should not uh be a waste they we should tell the stories of these people because we don't want to lose more people when we write a poem it's not because we feel we feel pain for those who we lost but we are trying to stir people into action when they feel what we are feeling and uh Moab you you have been you have been telling the stories of what has been going on there through your poetry and writing but even in the United States it has not been easy there right-wing groups have called for deporting you uh and uh and President Trump is cracking down on non-citizens critical of Israel talk about the problems you've had even being able to speak at many universities um I mean I mean this is this is the tragedy of being a Palestinian or being a pro Palestinian human rights you are not safe living in Palestine for example in my case in Gaza I was wounded at the age of 16 in an airirst strike that killed seven people i lost three close friends of mine in 2014 i was abducted by the Israeli forces in November 2023 i lost my house which is the family my family house in in October 2023 two of my brothersin-laws in brothersin-law were abducted by the forces and we don't know anything about them so and I lost so many members of my family as I said and I survived by the way air strikes I mean air strikes that were just two houses away from me in Jabalia camp or in Betah so it is I mean to live in Gaza is is very dangerous so I didn't feel safe living in Gaza and now when I'm traveling outside of Gaza not only in the United States I don't feel safe because I mean we are not usually welcome anywhere it's not only in the United States but it's it's most of the world and now when when when we come to the United States you know to raise our families and to to share the stories of people who we lost i mean I'm not talking about I'm not talking about another people so this is this is what is different about me as Muslim i'm not talking about other people i'm talking about myself talking about my siblings about my parents about my grandparents i'm talking about the graves of my great my my grandparents who I will never find because Israel destroyed cemeteries i will not take my grandchildren and show them the kindergarten where I which I attended not my my university where where from where I graduated in Gaza i mean to come here and speak about these things is not even welcome so what should what should I do as Palestinian i mean I don't know no I mean uh we we I mean this word doesn't make sense in Gaza you will be you will get killed wounded or abducted when you go out and try to speak about these things you are uh being chased by these hate groups these extremist groups so what what is what do they want to from me and when they talk about deportation I mean I mean someone would deport someone to to to their homeland but my homeland is occupied i wish I could go back to Gaza but before you deport me back to Gaza I need to be in Gaza where Palestine is free i can't go back to a country that is not only under occupation but that is undergoing genocide so I would I would I would love to go back to Gaza i don't I mean it is it is not my my my biggest dream to live in United States my biggest dream is to live in my free homeland in Palestine to to be able to visit uh the the original home city and live in the original home city of my grandparents Yafa which is also the name of my uh 80-year-old daughter this is this is this is why where I would like to be deported i would like to go back and live in a free uh Palestine masab I want to thank you so much for taking this time to talk with us i'm so sorry also that you had to cancel your tour all over the country you apologized to people at all the universities where you were going to be speaking saying how much you looked forward to sharing a Forest of Noise with them i want to congratulate you on your son's birthday this weekend as you were at Jewish Voice for Peace uh speaking and reading your poetry and also ask if it's Syracuse University where you are now if they'll be holding a big celebration you are now a Pulitzer Prize winner as was announced yesterday yeah I mean uh yes I'm looking forward to celebrate but as but but as you understand it is not easy for me to celebrate anything i mean um I mean during the some some of the events people would be dancing on music I mean I I I do not feel fine you know celebrating something i am the only celebration is for me is when there is a an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and also in the West Bank and when justice and peace are served in Palestine this is the only this is the only reason for me to celebrate but I can't celebrate while I'm while I know that my sisters my my brothers and my parents in Gaza are starving you know I'm sending them this this good news telling them that this is my hope that my voice would reach more and more people who have the power to intervene and stop this suffering i can't just dance or eat you know cake or or just you know I mean it is it is not normal for me but what is what is what is good about this is that this recognition I hope would prove uh to be a step towards great under a greater understanding and would uh stir people in power to take action to put an end because I don't want to continue writing essays and poems about these these the these painful uh memories and these painful realities mab Abu Toha thank you so much palestinian poet and author on Monday he won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary for his essays published in the New Yorker

and breach of trust These aren't minor scandals They go to the heart of democratic integrity in a country that touts itself as the only democracy in the Middle East A conviction could end his political career His war has however been a lifeline for his survival as it has allowed him to not only delay hearings related to a trial that could put him behind bars but also distract public attention away from his scandals including what many Israelis see as an unforgivable failure in preventing the Hamas attack on October 7 Can we say that Netanyahu is using this war as a shield against his internal crisis including her corruption trials absolutely uh there are two main reasons why Netanyahu is trying to prolong this war One of them is to uh prolong his own political career to save himself from the consequences of the failure on October 7th Um but that is a secondary reason The main reason is Nitnya who's trying to create his legacy as the Israeli leader who expanded the boundaries of Israel who finished the job in Gaza once and for all who managed to accomplish what Bengory failed to do in in 1948 drive all Palestinians out from their homeland And that is what concerns Netanyahu more Netanyahu isn't alone in his genocidal quest to flatten Gaza He's supported by the most far-right government in Israel's history His national security minister Itamar Bengavir leads Odsma Yehudit a far-right ultraist party that calls for harsh crackdowns on Palestinians and full Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank His finance minister Bezal Smatri heads the Religious Zionism Party which also advocates for the annexation of the occupied West Bank and rejects the creation of any Palestinian state However Netanyahu's liquid party is losing support from within As internal divisions deepen continuing the war may be the only way for Netanyahu to keep his fragile coalition from falling apart and for his notorious ministers to stay in power Furthermore in a Channel 12 poll conducted in March 70% of Israelis indicated they didn't trust the Netanyahu government with 68% saying Smotridge was doing a poor job while both ministers have gained a certain amount of notoriety among Israel's allies over their inflammatory statements Is Netanyahu a hostage to his coalition as he sometimes claims to be or is he willingly and willfully embracing the rhetoric of his extremist ministers um I think the idea of Smutri and Beng pushing Netanyahu to the far right is inaccurate Netanyahu is the far right um he hides behind those two ministers as a convenient cover as a fig leaf to tell his European enablers his enablers in Washington to say &quot;Look I'm I'm I'm hostage to those two crazy ministers [Music] Netanyahu might have victory set as his main objective but when it comes to a post-war plan for Gaza he's got nothing but destruction on his agenda with proposals that don't take Palestinian rights or rebuilding the ruined enclave into consideration Netanyahu and his coalition partners they have a crystal clear plan for postwar Gaza Uh basically Gaza becoming completely uninhabitable So people would have to leave or would be forced to leave and the rest that are staying will perish to death It's always changing There's no one single plan here But the best plan for them would be the you know sending the guns away because of the you know demography issues and uh this is important I [Music] think Netanyahu may have hoped that the war on Gaza would be a useful distraction to steer attention away from his scandals and boost his image as a strong leader and it seems to be working so far But the March Channel 12 poll shows that he's losing the support of the Israeli public with 72.5% believing he should take responsibility for October 7th and resign and others frustrated that he hasn't led Israel to a clear victory A lot of Israelis are feeling sort of fatigued about the war that it's not accomplishing it its objectives that they were promised a decisive victory and that never came As the war fails to conclude without any progress is Israel's closest ally also starting to lose patience in a surprise move the US held direct talks with Hamas in early March and Israel wasn't invited And on May 19th the United Kingdom France and Canada warned for the first time since Israel launched this devastating onslaught that they may take concrete actions including sanctions or formally recognizing the state of Palestine if Israel doesn't halt for war and the lift is blockade of aid right now He lost Trump's support He lost United States support Uh he's not you know he cannot and he could not end the war He could not bring back the hostages and the economy is worsening Uh even if it's enduring and resistant uh there are a lot of problems for you know the situation Netanyahu's ongoing war on Gaza doesn't seem to solely be about defeating Hamas or even returning the Israeli hostages to safety Many critics agree that it's largely motivated by political survival That of Netanyahu and his coalition and of Israel's expansionist goals and extremist ideology also projects of Netanyahu and his cohorts Bengavir and Smotrich The cost of a prime minister's political gamble has already been devastating not just for the more than 2 million Palestinians trapped in Gaza but also for the Israeli hostages still in captivity As the war drags on with no clear end in sight the question remains how many more Palestinian lives will be taken for Netanyahu and his far-right coalition to stay in power [Applause]" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="The Israeli army confirmed the death of one soldier and the serious injury of another in an ambush by Hamas' al-Qassam Brigades in Northern Gaza’s Shujayeah neighbourhood. This follows three other soldiers killed in Jabalia a day earlier, bringing the toll to four in two days. The mounting casualties intensify pressure on Israel’s government, with growing domestic calls to end the war amid concerns for both soldiers and remaining captives in Gaza. Meanwhile, Hamas demands permanent ceasefire guarantees, asking for guarantees that a 60-day truce would result in a permanent ceasefire. Further complicating matters, ultra-Orthodox parties in Netanyahu’s coalition are resisting military conscription, threatening to collapse the government. These developments leave the prime minister in an increasingly precarious position as military losses and political tensions rise.&#10;&#10;Al Jazeera’s Nida Ibrahim joins us in the studio to discuss the latest developments. &#10;&#10;Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe&#10;Follow us on X:   / ajenglish  &#10;Find us on Facebook:   / aljazeera  &#10;Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/&#10;Check out our Instagram page:   / aljazeeraenglish  &#10;Download AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile&#10;&#10;#Israel #IsraeliArmy #IsraelMilitaryCasualities #Palestine #Gaza #GazaWar #IsraelGazaWar #Hamas #GazaUnderAttack #QassamBrigades #GazaGroundRaid #NorthernGaza" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="the Israeli armies confirmed the death of a soldier and the serious wounding of another in the Shuaya neighborhood east of Gaza city on Tuesday they've reportedly been killed in an ambush by Alcasam brigades the armed wing of Hamas it comes a day after the Israeli army said three soldiers were killed in Jabalia well let's speak to our correspondent Nidita Ibrahim who's here in the studio with me so Nidita another Israeli soldier killed that's four in two days i mean how will that be received in Israel given the mounting pressure from many there to end the war and concerns not only for the safety and security of soldiers but also of the captives still in Gaza indeed and that is the fourth soldier as you say in just two days of course tomorrow this morning the Israeli army has made the official announcement about the killing of the soldier but it comes exactly a day after three Israeli soldiers were killed in combat in Gaza as the Israeli forces are pushing into their ground operation inside the Gaza Strip as a way that they say that they're putting pressure on Hamas to kind of accept the uh uh US envoy Steve Wkov's proposal for a ceasefire now Hamas has been saying they want more guarantees that this ceasefire would be permanent and not just a 60-day one that would guarantee basically the continuation of the end of the war but as you see here Israel is not really finding it easy to push forward inside Gaza and four soldiers in two days is also mounting pressure on the government that has already been struggling not only because of the pressures of how many soldiers have been wounded how many have been announced traumatized so basically they cannot be called as reserveist but also because there are families of captives who are saying not only are we losing uh uh time now with captives being subject to danger because of the Israeli military pressure inside Gaza but we are there there are also concerns that they might lose even more captives as these soldiers are uh crossing further into the Gaza territory and regarding pressure on the government there's also pressure coming from within Israel from the ultraorththodox community as well tell us more yes the ultra orthodox community now represented in the kesset the Israeli parliament par parliament in two uh uh uh parties have been saying that they want to draft a law to enshrine a law in the Israeli parliament that prevents the conscription of these Jews the ultraorththodox Jews and this issue comes at a time after the 7th of October where the Israeli prime minister cannot really advance and push for such a law as his army is really in need for so many soldiers especially as we have been talking about the numbers of losses and the numbers of uh people who cannot serve because of injuries so you are talking about a situation where Netanyahu is being really pressured by these ultraorththodox parties that are part of his coalition now they are saying that they will be demanding the uh Knesset to pass legislation to bring the government down now this is something for next week but it's something that is really irking the Israeli prime minister putting him in a very difficult position and these killings of these four Israeli soldiers for in just two days further complicates the scene the Heredi Jews the ultraorthodox Jews are firmly against serving the army because they believe it's against their fundamental beliefs is that right anita many thanks to Anita Ibraim there make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Alazer" />

The Madleen is expected to reach Gaza on Monday, though Israeli officials have said they will not allow it to land. &#10;&#10;Democracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on over 1,500 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

          <attvalue for="7" value="democracy depends on a free press please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org/give this is democracyow democracynow.org i'm Amy Goodman we go to get an update from the Freedom Flotilla boat the Madlin sailing to Gaza with vital humanitarian aid the Freedom Flotilla Coalition initially planned to sail from Malta last month but their ship was damaged after it was bombed by drones in international waters earlier this week the Madlin received a Mayday call directing them to a boat that was rapidly deflating with about 30 to 40 migrants on board for more we go to the Freedom Flotilla where we're joined by Thiago Aila he's a Brazilian activist and steering committee member of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition he's among 12 activists sailing to Gaza the mission also includes the renowned Swedish climate activist Greta Tunbury whom we spoke to earlier this week thiago welcome to Democracy Now israel has threatened to raid your ship we know what happened to the Mauvi Marura more than a decade ago when uh the Israeli military raided the ship and killed nine people on board um how are you where are you now in the sea what's happened with these migrants and um how do you plan to challenge the Israeli blockade of Gaza thank you so much for having the plotilla here on democracy now for us it's an honor you do a very important work we are here somewhere in the Mediterranean actually 500 nautical miles from Gaza if we would go to the north we'll be going to Cit in Greece if we would go to south we would be going to Egypt right now and we are on the sixth day of a a day of a journey that will end on Monday likely on the morning to get to Gaza that's our estimated time of arrival and we are right now with 12 people spirits are high and we are carrying life saving aid food medicine crutches prosthetics for imitated children water filters and we're doing our best here to be useful for the solidarity movement for Palestine we are nonviolent direct action mission that not only wants to break the siege the legal siege that Israel has put Gaza for 18 years but also wants to create a people's humanitarian corridor so that all countries all organizations institutions and the social majorities of the world can help and can be in support of the Palestinian people people cannot stand anymore seeing children starving to death and it's in their hearts the idea of doing something and we're part of this doing something collectively all the demonstrations all the global uprising doc workers blocking the cargo vessels to through to through Israel so many people doing amazing things disrupting arms factories creating breaking the media blockade and spreading true information about the genocide of eight decades so we are part of the same thing and yesterday we received a Mayday call from a boat that was rapidly defiliating and we managed to rescue four four of these people unfortunately the rest has been taken and illegally deported back to Libya from uh li Libyan so-called coast guard but the four of the ones that we managed to rescue they were sent to the coast guard and they we are asking for refugee for them in Greece so this was something that happened that we did not expect we sailed for two and a half hours doing search and rescue operation despite the fact that only a few of our members here are trained in search and rescue operation but life comes first so we changed our course completely yesterday to do and attend to this Mayday call and in the end we did what we could and we were very happy that we managed to rescue four people from the water and the Mediterranean being on the water means death very very fast so we're glad that Thiago we just have another minute but I wanted to ask you about Latin American solidarity with Gaza you're a Brazilian activist why you decided to come from Brazil yes oh I come from a place where imperialism always play always plays a decisive role my country suffered two two military coups and and both of them had the support of the United States and so it's important that we understand that imperialism and Zionism they are the greatest evils of our generation and we need to defeat them wherever we can and Palestine is now the strategic place for all peoples to unite and fight against oppression exploitation and the destruction of nature they have been threatening us for many many years for 17 years any flotilla mission that tried to reach Gaza has been threatened by them but we will not bow to their threats we do not need their permission this is international waters and we're going to Palestinian territorial waters so we're going not with their permission but with the help of millions and billions of people that know that starving pe children to death is wrong that bombing hospitals shelters and schools is wrong and that's what we are counting on we they cannot defeat us by force if they attack us we'll have thousands of people on the next flotilla and they will understand like all oppressive regimes understand in the end that they cannot beat the people's true force that people's power is the ultimate power and love and solidarity can beat any hateful racist and supremacist ideology like Zionism and if Israel raids uh your boat um they have pledged not to allow the ship to dock uh or to even approach Thiago yes they did this before like you mentioned 15 years ago they killed nine executed nine of our participants and and another 10th died six months later and one month ago they just bombed our boats and they've been sending drones every night here for three nights in a row so we can expect violence from them and we do our preparations we train our participants in nonviolent direct action so that even facing extreme violence we remain nonviolent because there's no military victory for us here we're a humble boat 12 people that 18 meters boat so we only can win through solidarity making sure that the whole world knows that Gaza has been under siege for 18 years leaving eight decades of genocide and ethnic cleansing and this is how we also move the structures for a safe passage so spread word of what we're doing guarantee us a safe passage because if they understand that they cannot afford to attack us and that will be even worse for them in the attack we have a chance thiago Avila we want to thank you for being with us all safety to you brazilian activists among 12 activists sailing to Gaza to deliver humanitarian aid on the Madlin ship named for the first Gazen Fisher woman uh the ship launched by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition you can also see our interview with Greta Tunbury also on that vote at democracynow.org democracy Now is funded by viewers like you please give today at

          <attvalue for="7" value="ya they queued all night desperate for food and came under fire more than 60 people reported killed eyewitnesses say by israeli gunfire and weaponized drones in separate deadly incidents during a week of aid chaos in gaza the victims palestinians traveling to depots they were told would provide help aid stations set up by the israelis and backed by the us a system that began under a cloud of controversy and criticism and is now at the center of two mass killings this is how an israeli us aid plan led to tragedy in gaza day one of the gaza humanitarian foundation's operations may 27th this hub in the far south opens its doors it does so after a week where just a trickle of aid has entered gaza following a near 3-month blockade the idea had been for nominated family representatives to collect food from ghf aid sites an idea that evaporated in the face of huge crowds competing for limited supplies in the leadup the plan had been criticized by the un and other bodies as unworkable and politicized the head of the organization jake wood quit before the program had even begun initially people had been reluctant to come here the process included biometric measurement hamas had urged resistance against what it called an israeli intelligence operation israel has denied that and in any case soon enough any idea of control was disappearing [Applause] desperation for food apparent across gaza not just at the sites provided by the ghf just a day after ghf opened its doors a warehouse storing flour operated by the un's world food program is overrun two are killed in the crush two die of gunshot wounds this a gaza market on may 29th armed men steal any food they can find the same location moments later an israeli strike targeting the hamas security forces who've been sent to stop the looting all the while ghf provides limited supplies and the system remains chaotic before the war the un says five to 600 trucks entered gaza every day now it's in the tens ghf claims it distributes thousands of boxes a day but relies on hungry people walking long distances into israeli military zones traditional supply chains continue to struggle with the sheer need and ongoing disorder on may the 31st world food program workers appeal for people to take just a sack of flour each after a convoy of 77 trucks is stopped and looted allah and then the first major incident at a ghf distribution center on sunday before dawn thousands try to get to the site in rafa and come under sustained fire gaza's civil defense says 31 people are killed and scores injured doctors at al-naser hospital back up those claims what we do know is that 28 people have been brought here to nasa dead we have five patients currently who are brain dead and we have over 200 patients here in the emergency department with injuries most of which are gunshot injuries so what happened in the early hours of june the 1st jhf has established four what it calls safe distribution sites inside gaza on sunday morning only one sds1 is due to open at 6:00 a.m but from midnight already thousands of people are gathering at a junction just over a kilometer away many we're told had traveled from the far north of the strip as more locals arrive pressure to get to the front intensifies witnesses tell us the crowd moves slowly southwards a tank near the site fires warning shots quadcopters first broadcast verbal warnings then shoot warning shots at around 3:30 we're told there is chaos crowds running back and forth soldiers tanks and naval boats all firing this is when the first gunshot injuries are reported an hour later the crowd now the biggest since the start of the ghf operations surges for the aid site it's at this point the majority of killings take place even then many still try to reach the site hundreds doing so around 5:00 a.m stripping it bare witnesses say within minutes [Music] the icrc field hospital receives nearly 180 injured the majority with gunshot or shrapnel wounds ghf claims reports of injuries fatalities or incidents during its operations are egregious fabrications and the israeli military tells us that the idf did not fire at civilians while they were near or within the aid site an official instead saying warning shots were fired when troops were advanced upon a kilometer away giving no further comment when asked if civilians had been hit what we have heard is very clear that there was an invitation to attend the food aid location as folk were making their invited way there they were attacked somewhere between the beach and the coast road by drones we heard by naval gunfire you've heard by tanks israeli forces obviously israeli forces not by uh gangs or any other armed groups criticism compounded because nos's including the un had been operating aid delivery in gaza for decades before where we need to go back to is to allow organizations like unra to do what it does best that is mass deliveries of humanitarian supplies opening the borders so that there's basic supplies going into gaza then on the morning of june the 2nd another incident along the same aid corridor this time three people are killed the israeli foreign ministry's response i love you trump good luck to release images of people returning to ghf sites saying they speak louder than hamas propaganda and media lies and then on the morning of june the 3rd a third consecutive shooting at the same location as people try to access the site for aid this time gaza's health ministry reports 27 killed and nearly 200 injured if it seems extraordinary that so many are ready to brave these risks well these are the stakes in gaza right now [Music] [Music] and grief children mourning their mother remided had already tried four times to get aid from the ghf site she died in her fifth attempt to feed her family [Music] for days now the israeli military has been condemning media lies admitting only to firing warning shots on tuesday a change in approach as some of the suspects continued despite these warning shots advancing towards the troops in a threatening manner further fire was directed near these specific individuals but doubling down on the accusation that media were reporting hamas propaganda without verification june 1st hamas claimed israel had killed 31 people at an aid site in rafa the new york times and others ran it ran with it then we've released an israeli drone israeli drone footage showing that hamas gunman opened fire on the crowd now did the media lead with that correction no for good reason as it turns out that footage used in another government briefing is from a different location and time from sunday's incident our colleagues in gaza say the gunman belong not to hamas but an armed gang selling stolen aid we challenge the israeli prime minister's spokesman on our program now these warning shots were fired david twice now twice now desperate people who have been starved for weeks have been shot at while trying to collect aid you are terrifying the population of gaza even more they're too scared now to go to collection points because they know they could be shot at by the idf so that is precisely the hamas rhetoric that they want you to to publish the un is calling for a full investigation into the shootings and maintaining its criticism of the nature of the new aid mechanism and all the while israeli air strikes continue to rain down israeli ground forces expand their operations in the north where three israeli soldiers are confirmed killed on tuesday israel's prime minister talks of the high price for achieving israel's war goals in kanun more neighborhoods are subject to evacuation orders for gaza's civilians the achievements of this war counted in increments of misery" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="this is where the like anti-government uh democracy demonstration takes place People in this demo are also demonstrating against the war Um but mainly in order to bring back the hostages not mentioning what is happening in Gaza This is going to march down that street and we're going to wait for them in one of the intersections with the photos of the children who are massacred in Gaza When Israel broke the ceasefire it killed a few hundred people on the first night and I posted photos of the children who were massacred that night and uh my friend saw it on my profile and she said we should print those photos and bring them out to the demonstration We went out I think a group of 20 women um with these photos and were very surprised when people were coming up to us and asking us questions They were asking who are these kids what happened to them and people were genuinely genuinely shocked by it upset by it [Applause] [Music] And so the next weekend we printed more um more photos and over 100 people joined And then the week after over 200 people joined And the week after over 300 people joined and it just started growing All the children haven't done nothing I myself have a rap mother So I know what they feel their parents or family Pain is pain all over the world Do you think do you think a lot of people in Israel understand what I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure they want to understand Maybe they're still looking for revenge I don't know But children don't have to pay It's horrible Bye-bye The most shame on you Shame on you You know what they're saying starvation is a We should We should fatten the fat them up like [Music] I understand the psychology of what is going on I understand that people are mainly exposed to stories of Jewish grief of Jewish loss since October 7 And that's all around us If you walk down the street there are photos of hostages everywhere And if you open the television you know there are stories still stories coming out from October 7 And the government manipulates that in order to push its own agendas and continue the war Alma Muhammad which means her father name was Muhammad Abu She was here and not anymore and she was killed in Abasan Al in May 7 2025 and then they take the picture from here to the protest So every day I have to collect the data from resources that I trust and write it down organize it and then upload it on our website It's a lot of work There's a lot of dance around denial and people try to shut the the cracks that are already happening in the wall of denial What does it mean for you to print these images out and hold them in the streets of of Tel Aviv honoring their existence I feel that taking responsibility in our deeds is the first step towards change I do feel that there is a change Perhaps people are starting to look beyond their own grief um and realizing the magnitude of what we've done in Gaza and and maybe now things are starting to click for people perhaps like maybe people are connecting the dots I guess I feel something close to hope when I see actions like that growing um and creating ripples But on a large scale when you're looking at the level of destruction in Gaza like how many people have been affected by it it's it's very hard to feel hope" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="and we are also joined in studio by actor Liam Cunningham a very special guest to have in studio this week Thanks very much sir It's a delight to be here Yes you have been in the headlines this week You are lending your voice to a very important uh situation Tell us about that Uh I've just come back from Katana Sicily where we were seeing off uh a small boat called the Madlin uh and its mission is to uh leave with a hold full of humanitarian aid and it's going to head to um Gaza to try and break the blockade Mhm Um and that's what we were doing for the last few days And there was a lot of press there and um and celebrations and and uh flag waving and protests and and these beautiful hum of humanity people who are on this boat are um doing what the international community should be doing What's on board the vessel i mean people will see Greta Tunberg is of course probably the most prominent name on board But in terms of actual aid on board there are uh the stuff that the IDF want to lay in crutches um there are antibiotics baby formula um uh I think there's morphine because a lot of people in extraordinary pain mostly medical and there is also which I find kind of heartbreaking there is a a 3D printed prosthetic baby's arm that they're bringing as well uh um and um and hoping they their voyage won't be impeded Uh you well on that topic of being impeded you mentioned the blockade Um at this point in the abstract what is the likelihood of your colleagues being able to land that flea well we have no idea Uh because you're you're if you're dealing with a sane government um there would be some predictability and there would be some sort of um diplomatic at very least um conversation Um but these uh uh people in power in in Tel Aviv uh we've seen what they can do They've already although they didn't admit it who else could it be they did destroy a boat or ex damage it heavily in Malta and they sent in two uh drones um to take out the the ship So this is a replacement boat uh that unfortunately only takes 12 crew and eight volunteers Um so um basically anything can happen We've there's already been threats There's already been um drones in the air at nighttime Uh so the intimidation has begun But what they will do the closer the guys get to the off the coast of Gaza is is uh is anybody's guess I mean it is a very brave endeavor in terms of the individuals who are traveling on the flutella You mentioned at the start there though it's something that governments should be doing Well 100% according to international law and I've even thrown myself into having a look at what the G Geneva conventions require of a government This is not suggestions if there is a uh a visible genocide and t-sh Martin used the word in in in government and uh to use that word um uh leads you down the path of necessary legal uh obligations And one of them is is that it it's very specific even if it's not in your state You are obliged legally to intervene in in a genocide And this uh legislation came on the back with the International Court of Justice and the ICC on the back of the horrific Holocaust and genocide of uh the Jewish people in World War II So um uh legally and I said this yesterday in an interview we should be sending the navy filled our navy with on a humanitarian mission uh to to deliver this stuff and uh and if we don't do it then it not it it not only brings shame on ourselves it brings um a a sense of destruction on the international rules based order which is we are responsible for We are the caretakers of international law until it's handed on to the next generation and it's falling apart in front of us It's it's appalling It's clear to see that the public here is very much on board with this in terms of support for the Palestinian people All of the polls we've seen in the papers even over the last number of weekends show that the government has said they've done things like they recognize the state of Palestine They said they're pushing forward with the occupied territories bill Now people will dispute how much impact that's going to have particularly because services may not be included in that but it is when you put it like that when you see international law and what it says when you see wrong happening in terms of breaches of international human rights law you have to intervene it almost makes it difficult to understand for people out there why why aren't we doing more why are we only doing this here and that here I mean is that what you think that's where you think the public is at with this is that we're very good at saying that there's a problem there Ireland has been as I described previously one of the least worst countries in terms of speaking out about it But in terms of action do you agree that we don't feel to be or seem to be able to get that next step forward in terms of sticking our necks out the the the words aren't working That's uh obvious because of the damage that we've seen to to the the Palestinian people since we've recognized Palestine since uh since ME Martin has said it's genocide Um it's not enough We we need action in the time But I'm I I'm not sick hearing the words and uh and we're on the side of the oppressed and blah blah blah If you do nothing then the words mean nothing Um so I prefer not to hear them talking about it at all because that just reflects their actions and we really need to do we need to step up We are we're in a wonderful position We're a small country We're not militarily aligned with anybody uh um and we can be an honest broker and especially from a country that suffered occupation for 700 years Um we we feel it we know the game you know we're also a country that it's very easy to look at it that we suffered two genocides here I mean don't forget that you know and these are British establishment figures uh when Oliver Cromwell was here for the 9 months he was here and left his new model army for an additional 3 years the the figures are from the British that 40% of our population was slaughtered that was the first one and you can be in no doubt that we although we give it this magnificent romantic phrase the great hunger that was a genocide I mean they did the same thing in India there was 50 ships a day leaving Ireland filling the shops in in in England while our famine was going on and they had Lass say fair let them get on with it Nothing to do with us They were occupying our country They were in charge of that and we lost the estimates are a million people and a million and a half or two two million went you know left the country For for Ireland not to have sympathy with the plight of the Palestinians would be the bizarest thing on the planet if we weren't sympathetic at the very least Well the government would say that it goes beyond because of the government not here to represent itself I'm going to re relay its view which would be that it's effectively from a European standpoint it's almost bestin-class that it has recognized Palestinian statehood that it has at least taken a cabinet decision to progress with a version of the occupied territories bill that it's one of the first governments to call for an outright suspension and a outright review of the trade association deal there between the European Union and Israel You obviously don't feel that's enough the government would say that it's kind of it's wedded to this kind of multilateral worldwide view of trying to move in concert and trying to bring the rest of the world along with it Uh well the one one provisor that I believe is in the EU is that each country is responsible for its own foreign affairs right it's with trade and stuff like that it's different uh this is very much about foreign affairs uh with a with a country that is committing genocide um when you compare to hold us up as a beacon in in the EU and yesterday and today uh when the French dockers um have impounded or thrown to one side 14 tons tons of uh munitions and machine gun parts whatever they are going going to is supported by the ditch Yeah And Yeah And then today they found more containers So one of the leading lights of the EU is supplying arms to a genocidal regime So to hold us up as a beacon when you've got that standard below us doesn't make us look too good Liam what's your read on what's holding us back then from from doing this what like Well it's fear obviously but I mean the Americans are incredibly powerful and I'm sure there's been a few whispers in the year ears of we'll take this away or we'll repatriate our large businesses or whatever it may be It's been reported I mean the ambassador said that to to the last year wasn't it that you know this will impact a thousand US companies if you go forward with the OTB Yeah So the thing is if you well the OTB is one thing but what about you know as you mentioned there the Navy going out with aid Well that would be a legal obligation It's not a case of you know let's go gung-ho and let's break this thing we if we don't do it we're breaking international law and because everybody else is not doing it doesn't make it all right Um we really I mean look that would be a huge step to to do that but the very least we should stop doing business with a country that's committing genocide I mean this is not a big ask And if you're putting a spreadsheet or or the success of Q4 ahead of the dismemberment of children then then you you're you're morally bankrupt That's it On the aid situation because obviously the flatillaa is going to bring in a small amount of aid That's that's the objective of this While there are thousands and thousands of trucks currently sitting outside Gaza not being permitted to go in One of the things I've seen you be quite critical of over the last number of months has been news coverage of this um the situation in Gaza particularly around aid has been there's been it's been so noticeable to see Western news organizations for example with regards to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation as it's been described Yeah It's just been it's just disbanded hasn't it they've just cut it off They say that they're restoring the aid distribution as they put it to centers this evening there But it's been interesting that there was all these headlines around the world of the blockade has been lifted It's the end of the blockade It certainly hasn't by anyone's measure So I mean do you think that that's actually creating a level of distrust generally in Western media because if we can't call a spade a spade in this country or in Britain or in the states when everybody can see clearly what's happening in their own eyes they can see what's being live streamed from Palestinians there as well Then what are we doing here as journalists uh we're bathing in fear It's not it's not a case of if we do something It it what people are worried about here and specifically in the government is what are the repercussions if we do something It's kicking the can down the road and we've seen it with with many of the difficult decisions that government when they set up the community whatever it is those uh uh those gettogethers to uh deal with the poison chalice Uh and it's one of those uh there's it's it's uh it's dealing with the obfiscation Um and I mean for instance what you were talking about that that MOSAD funded according to drop site news I think they they discovered that that what are they called GFD or something ghf humanitarian foundation Yes Yes So they are somebody some there is a report that they have traced the money back to a MOSAD uh operation and either way it's Israeli sanctioned anyway which goes against the general principles of how a absolutely and if you look at it none of the aid agencies including the UN will have anything to do with it because these people are totally inexperienced there's been what 460 shot at these at these centers and they're calling them in and when they called them in yesterday the Israeli head stated that those centers have now become combat zones So anybody comes into them is going to be shot after beckoning them uh to to get their limited aid there So they can't be on the ground there and communication is difficult Then you don't know which center you're going to which is a target and which one is a safe zone Well they were queuing because they were given the word that the that the centers were going to open up at 7:00 a.m I think it was 8:00 a.m and there was a huge amount of people at 3:00 a.m So as soon as they opened there was a huge rush They panicked and just opened fire on on unarmed people scrambling for food We can't allow that to continue It's the it's the it's shooting fish in a barrel as the Americans used to say about it in Iraq Speaking of the flotilla itself you were telling us on the way in that the original plan was for it to hopefully land on Sunday or at least to make it to the gas and coastline on Sunday Um you were telling us that there's a bit of new development which might at least weigh that timetable Yes So I just had a call just before I came in I was sitting in the car and uh the wonderful Queever Butterly who's a huge part of the flotilla um uh she gave me a ring and uh they got a distress call this morning from a sinking uh inflatable rib uh with uh migrants from Libya on it They were the closest vessel So under international law is their duty as a ship to go and uh to go and rescue them Uh the um rib was uh uh deflating rapidly uh to the extent that uh four or four or five uh of the occupants of the rib craft dived into the sea and had to be rescued by the maline the boat we've just been talking about H and they are now in in in possession of these uh unfortunate sudin who are trying to escape the madness of Libya Uh and they are now in a bit of a quandry about what to do with them They they want them picked up They are also in uh very uh tense about if they do head for Cree to to uh uh deliver these uh unfortunate migrants that they may be impounded The Greeks are have a very very questionable relationship with the Israelis at the moment Um and uh they're worried that the ship might be uh impounded but that's ongoing You can't stop in Libya on the way back because if that's where the Sudin people have come from you can't state they've come from if if we handed them over to cuz the Libyan Coast Guard was there Yeah Uh and they would uh return them to Libya which for people seeking asylum is is highly illegal under Bringing them on their mission an option No I shouldn't I shouldn't think so I'm not sure they have the capability The maximum they could keep on the boat with the amount of humanitarian aid was eight volunteers It's it's quite it's a smallish boat Yeah we we saw some of the overhead pictures People might have actually seen them in our reports earlier in the week Actually some overhead drone footage as it was disembarking from from Sicily It is a relatively small boat Yes it is And we were buzzed Just before they took off a military helicopter came down incredibly low into where people were bathing in the harbor and stuff and and basically buzzed buzzed the boat just before they came in just just to let them know we were being watched I mean how juvenile can you get it's just it's pathetic Just by people like yourself and by Greta Tunberg taking part in this Obviously it does help to get word out about these situations when you do have high-profile people putting themselves forward like this I've seen people have been very critical of Greta Tunberg you know a young woman of course who has you know put herself and put the planet first in many ways before Have you faced any repercussions from your stance on Gaza no You know what's funny and I completely understand the question uh especially uh because I do a fair bit of work with with companies from the states Um it really is the king is only the king as long as the people think he's the king Uh and if anybody has put me on a list because they don't like my humanitarian pro approach to our beautiful species um they're not people I want to work with anyway So uh and I've said this before whatever shadowy list that I might be on or some of my fellow mouthy people uh might be on the list that I have is a hell of a lot longer than the list I might be on Yeah So no I'm no impediment to work at this point There's no there's no The only impediment is to work with people I didn't want to work with in the first place That's fine It's a good position to be in isn't it yeah I think it's good Stand by your principles You got to Yeah Taking this forward I mean because this has been something which is ongoing It's now in a real deep humanitarian crisis this point in time 600 trucks a day need to need to get in I think the last reckoning by the International Red Cross was that 600 boxes at a max we're actually getting into Gaza 2 million people starving And the five trucks put the put the hair up on the back of my neck The five trucks that got in after Israel broke the ceasefire two of those trucks had death shrouds in them That's was all that was delivered of those five trucks the two of them were were I think a Saudi Arabian um gift and they were shrouds for the dead But we're all sitting here and we're all watching this I actually spoke with Mary Robinson about this recently that she worries about the mental health aspect on on on us which is almost a luxury to be in a position where we can worry about that Yes But you look at the situation that is unfolding before our eyes on a daily basis where you're seeing a people being starved on a daily basis kids dying of malnutrition literally starving in the streets at this point in time How do you think we're all going to look back at this period in the world's history when there are there's so much enormous wealth there's so much you know we talk the talk in terms of international human rights and with regards to the West being a leader and we respect international law all of these things And yet here we all are going back to October of 2023 and we we've let this happen Uh yes we haven't We haven't The impunity is well the impunity have been going on forever So the reason they're doing it is because they weren't slapped on the wrist for doing it before with Operation Castled with all all the various um uh batterings that Gaza has had And let's not forget about the West Bank what's going on there And and even in my profession the guy who just won the Oscar Yeah Um his uh his village has been raised to the ground Um and and there's an Irish woman in her 70 years old is in is in detention at the minute Uh I'd like to know what our government is doing about uh getting her Uh and very interesting uh that Israel holds the deportation meetings You know where they hold them at the airport Like you're going to win that case aren't you that's where the that's where the uh the deportation uh um cases are held at the airport Yeah But how do you think this is going to be looked back at this period it's it's a shameful period It's going to be a shameful period And as I've said before uh one of the things that's important I mean my kids are grown up now and they and they are very much um about the haters of injustice I should hope I battered that into them Um but I am not having my grandkids growing up and when they're reading about this saying uh what did you do during there i at least I can throw my social media at them and and stuff like this uh and say look I I I did what I could I roared about it I tried to um get more people to speak Um it's the people who are saying nothing Have you got your answers ready for your kids or your grandkids when they're hitting secondary school and they're reading about this uh and as I said before in World War II you could say we didn't know about the Holocaust We didn't The vast majority of us this genocide is in 4K on your telly Uh and uh your only answer you're going you're not going to be able to say &quot;I didn't know.&quot; The only answer you're going to be able to give to your kids is &quot;I didn't care.&quot; And that is not uh is that something you want your kid to think of you that you did nothing when that was happening right I'm not prepared to to to give that answer to my kids or grandkids For Irish people who have spoken out I just saw a column in the spectator of all places today by Brendan O'Neal Ireland has been consumed by hatred of Israel He says &quot;A new religion blights the Republic of Ireland Catholicism has been supplanted by a far more cultish creed Uh he goes on to say its name is Israel phobia He says he knew Ireland was hostile to Israel but I had no idea how bad things had got Everywhere you go he says you see the swirling animus for the state The political class speaks of little else The media media are ferventishly obsessed Uh the cry goes out that Israel is evil It's inescapable He says it's all over Dublin along a hotbed of leftish activism he says I'm not sure I'd agree with that necessarily but this this targeting of of of Ireland internationally but the point would be by the British media or American media We've seen it on Fox and Friends where they describe Miho Martin as a socialist and very left Um this is something which is you know it's been is being described and it has been thrown around at Irish people for speaking out about humanitarian issues in Gaza I mean what do you make about the way that Ireland has been targeted miho or Michael Higgins excuse me says that it has been a slander effectively on our nation It's absolutely right But listen it's bully boy tactics and most of the people you quote there and the people in in the states you have to remember they're to the right of a tilla the hon they have no credibility at all I mean anybody in the in the states in the political system over there has has completely lost any uh right to speak about a healthy political system I mean it's it's incredible I mean the the uh the J1 visas the students have all been told scrape your social media go in This is like McCarthyism is back in the states So anything any of these people say is not worth the uh the bribery check it's written" />

Carunis since the 15th um as you said it's it's um it's not my first trip so there's some comparisons here but the the main thing that's different really is the state of the population i mean it's it's it's very clear that we're dealing with a completely different patient population now these people haven't had any food in since the 2nd of March they are malnourished the children are particularly taking the brunt of this they are all a lot shorter than they than their uh western counterparts that's that's always been a problem from their chronic mal malnutrition but they are very very thin we are having a lot of problems with wound healing because obviously if you're not getting enough nutrients and vitamins your cells are not turning over in a timely fashion and you can't heal your wounds on top of that we are having dire problems with infection this is related to the malnutrition but also related to the situation that the people are in they are living in tents it's dirty we're running out of clean water israel have stopped the vaccination programs it's the worst it's ever been and Dr rose if you could say you know what kinds of injuries are you seeing most often and particularly on children so they're all blast and bomb injuries and there's a couple of well there's two types of wounds that you see from a a bomb going off or an explosion the first is a burn from the heat of the explosion and we're seeing some huge burns 40 50% burns in children the sort of burns that are very rarely survivable in the UK uh when we have all of our intens intensive care colleagues around us and specialist hospitals we still have problems supporting children with this size burn in the UK so you can imagine what that burn is like over here the other injuries that we're seeing are due to the penetration of the missiles so what happens in a blast is whatever is around you either the local masonry or a car or whatever was blown up with you is ejected at a very high speed and it hits the civilians like a missile this will either penetrate the head chest or abdomen and if it does that you're unlikely to survive if it penetrates a limb you're likely to survive and you'll be brought to the hospital what we're seeing is traumatic amputations of hands fingers feet toes legs arms and what isn't amputated is severely destructed so we are trying to piece together bones patch missing bits of skin nerves are damaged really really severe injuries so Dr rose you're describing these severe injuries uh on a large number of children but you're also working with very little medicine if you could uh you know explain how you're doing this uh surgical work with access to such little such few anesthetics yeah I mean the main thing that we're we're low on at the moment is antibiotics we ran out of um augmentin or coamoxic which is the most standard antibiotic that we use in these type of injuries and we're down to a very weaker substitute kerizone which which we don't actually use in the UK now and that's our real problem is that we're not giving adequate antibiotics to these people we just don't have them and Dr rose uh you know Nasser Hospital is not far uh from the fighting uh could you talk about your concerns about a possible forced evacuation and if such were to occur where the patients at NASA would go yeah we're checking the um the IDF website which is IDF.IL and if you're in Gaza it picks up your location immediately and they've gritted the entirety of the strip we are basically a grid away from the active fighting so about four streets uh about a K and a half from the evacuation zone we had dire problems on Tuesday when that zone was announced in that quite a lot of my team had to leave me to go and evacuate their families my anthetist today on Tuesday walked 20k with his five and six and eight year old to evacuate them from where they lived in East Carunis into Alawasi which is the humanitarian zone so we had a real problem with staff on Tuesday but our our main issue is we are the last standing hospital in the south of Gaza the European Gaza Hospital was taken on Wednesday of LA uh last week and the only other hospitals around us are field hospitals so there's some good field hospitals there's the UK Med ICRC MSF MSF Belgium there's also the Jordanian and the Q8 hospital but but they are all tents these are all tent hospitals that don't have any ICU capacity and they don't have any generated oxygen the only standing hospital around us is the Palestinian uh Red Cross Society but that's part tense and that again doesn't have an ICU and it can't generate its own oxygen so if NASA closes we have a huge issue on our hands because we have a adult ICU and a pediatric ICU and we have nowhere to send these patients anyone here at the moment that's dependent on oxygen is also at risk if NASA closes hundreds of patients will die let me ask you Dr rose if news of what's happening in the outside world is coming to you in a moment we're going to talk to the former labor leader of Britain Jeremy Corbin but the fact that Israel's staunchest allies um well UK your own country where um the prime minister Stormer has said that the suffering of the innocent children being bombed again is utterly intolerable and we're going to speak with an EU representative where the European Union is also um putting pressure on Israel does that make a difference and what are you ultimately calling for it has made a difference it does feel like finally our voices are being heard but it is a shame that it comes so late and I think we need a little bit more action than what we're seeing really what we need is an end to this enforced blockade as I said we haven't had any aid or any food in since the 2nd of March and the nine trucks that came in yesterday are still parked in Israeli territory in Gaza and the Palestinian trucks have not been allowed to pick them up so it's it's really dire i think we need to put the politics aside here it's a humanitarian crisis and Israel has got to open the borders to let food in to let medical aid in and to let aid workers in and then you need to let us work safely i want to thank you Dr victoria Rose for being with us british senior plastic and reconstructive surgeon with the National Health Service has been on three medical missions to Gaza since October 2023 my final question is your colleagues and yourself why do you put yourself in this incredibly dangerous situation where hundreds of health workers doctors nurses have been killed have been imprisoned it's it's difficult to understand unless you come here and see the difference that you make we always worry when we come here that we might not be of any use that we might get all our kit confiscated that we might not have a hospital to go to but what we always say is the main thing is to come here to bear witness because you're not seeing what I'm seeing because there's been a complete block to all media so I'm here number one to bear witness number two I'm here to stand with my colleagues and these are people that I worked with before this war started and every time I come they are so pleased to see me and they need a break and I'm an extra pair of hands and it makes a huge difference and thirdly it's one case at a time but I'm definitely making a difference and I know we've saved some lives

          <attvalue for="7" value="democracy depends on a free press Please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org/g This is democracyow democracynow.org the Warren peace report I'm Amy Goodman with Narin Sh We turn now to look at how criticism of Israel is growing in Europe as the UK pauses trade talks and the EU reviews its relationship with Israel That is this is British Prime Minister Kier Star speaking Tuesday But first Mr Mr Speaker I'd like to say something about the horrific situation in Gaza where the level of suffering innocent children being bombed again is utterly intolerable The recent announcement that Israel will allow a basic quantity of food into Gaza a basic quantity is totally and utterly inadequate So we must coordinate our response because this war has gone on for far too long We cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve Kier Starmer the British Prime Minister long an ally of Israel The British foreign secretary David Lami also condemned Israel's actions in Gaza in a speech to the House of Commons Prime Minister Netanyahu end this blockade now and let the aid in Regrettably Madame Deputy Speaker despite our efforts this Israeli government's egregious actions and rhetoric have continued They are isolating Israel from its friends and partners around the world undermining the interests of the Israeli people and damaging the image of the state of Israel in the eyes of the world Therefore today I'm announcing that we have suspended negotiations with this Israeli government on a new trade free trade agreement The comments of the British Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister came days after as many as 500,000 people took part in a massive march for Palestine in London to mark the 77th anniversary of the Nakba Meanwhile the European Union has announced its re reviewing its relationship with Israel We're joined now by two guests from Brussels Lynn Boland is with us a Irish member of the European Parliament chair of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Palestine And joining us from London British MP former Labor Party leader Jeremy Corbin welcome back to Democracy Now Um MP Corbin if you could start off by responding to the shift We just were in Gaza talking to a British doctor who's there helping uh the children and the people of Gaza saying that what Kier Starmer has done does make a difference Now uh you were certainly opposed to uh the prime minister It's so much of the support of Israel What is causing the shift in the British government's position it's pretty clear that the huge demonstrations in Britain and the outpouring of uh public condemnation of Israel's bombardment of Gaza has eventually forced the British government into a slightly different position in that they've now suspended as you reported the trade talks with Israel They claim to have suspended all arm supplies to Israel but we question that because we believe that parts for the F-35 jets are still being sold to Israel And we're also questioning the amount of arms that have been sold over the last few months But there's no doubt that the uh position of the Palestinian people being starved to death bombed to death in Gaza has forced the British government into a different position We are keeping up all the pressure we can in order to get aid in but also to end the occupation because that is clearly what the ICJ position is end the occupation of Gaza and of the West Bank Well let's bring in uh Lynn Bolan Uh Lynn you're a member of European Parliament Uh could you talk about and also chair of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Palestine if you could talk about the significance of this review Uh the European Union is of course Israel's largest trading partner but what do you think could come of this review given that there is no unanimous position uh within the European uh Union on Israel well I think for first and foremost I' I'd echo what Jeremy is saying is that the the only reason why the EU has announced this review and there isn't even a an overall like there isn't even a majority at the EU council level to review the trading agreement is because of the people power and the pressure that is coming on politicians right across the European Union and I'd encourage people to continue to do that Um but I would say that the time for review is long since passed So what we're calling for is to spend the agreement pending the review The review can take place They can do the the research If they haven't seen what everybody has seen on their phone is that Israel is not upholding uh human rights and article two of the trading agreement it should be suspended But we're calling for them to suspend it then carry out your review and come back with your findings But what we're fearing is that the announcing a review is like kicking it down the road It's I suppose addressing the people pressure but actually not doing anything concrete um to address the situation So we're also calling on MEPs right across Europe uh who are frustrated by the lack of of Europeanwide action to call on their national governments to end trade with Israel For example in Ireland we have what's called the occupied territories bill um which would cease trade obviously just with the occupied territories but it would be a significant uh message sent out that at least Ireland wants to be compliant with international law and we're encouraging MEPs across Europe to do similar initiatives in their countries And so Jeremy Corbin if you could talk about what sanctions the UK has already imposed on Israel and against whom and talk about the new inquiry You've been calling for a new inquiry into Britain's relationship with Israel If you could tell us what that's about Sure On June the 4th I'm introducing a private members bill into the House of Commons calling for an independent inquiry into the whole process of policymaking in relation to Gaza the West Bank and uh Britain's arm supplies to Israel particularly during the period since October uh 2023 This is similar to the inquiry that was headed by Sir John Chilcott eventually to inquire into policym surrounding the Iraq war My purpose in doing this is because the government has obfuscated on many many occasions over the past 18 months over the level of arms supplies over trade over aid over uh credits and so on to Israel and also particularly about the manufacturer of Israeli weapons in Britain particularly in Sheffield and other places where parts with the F-35 are made So a group of us in parliament have been raising this consistently The issue of arm supplies goes something like this Britain was a was and remains to some extent a supplier of arms to Israel David Lammy the foreign secretary suspended 30 arms licenses out of 300 that were in operation without ever specifying what these 30 licenses were And to be honest I still don't know what those 30 arms licenses are He claims they were over supply of weapons that could be used for crimes against humanity But we later discovered that many weapons have continued to be supplied And yesterday we published a report from Progressive International and other groups which is outlining the whole case for suspending arm supplies and pointing out the dishonesty of the British government over the past 18 months on this And that report is being circulated to MPs and will be part of uh the case I'll be making to the British Parliament on June the 4th The question of suspending the trade talks is an interesting one and a very interesting development because to some extent it is running in tandem in parallel rather with what the European Union is doing because Britain is no longer a member of the European Union We welcome that suspension There has always been the legal case against buying settlement goods because of the illegality of the settlements But it has been very hard to trace what are settlement goods and what isn't But actually a consumer boycott is gathering pace The members of the cooperative society a very big retailer in Britain with a huge me membership base across the whole country voted by 70% last week to request their board to suspend all purchases from Israel So no Israeli products would be stopped in co-op stocked in co-op shops And there's a lot of pressure on to the other big wreathers to do the same So there's been an enormous shift in public opinion And it's caused by utter revulsion at seeing emaciated children starve to death or dying on the operating theater where there's no anesthetics or even antiseptics to treat their terrible conditions they're suffering People can stomach no longer the sight of Palestinian children being starved and murdered by the Israeli occupation of Gaza MP Corbin the UK sanctioned violent western uh West Bank settlers but the British foreign minister Lami stopped short of targeting Israeli officials Can you talk about the um significance of those sanctions and uh what you think has to go further the sanctions themselves against individual violent um settlers are important and a good a good step forward So far the only sanctions apply to um Beny Netanyahu and Benny Gance who have um arrest warrants out from the International Criminal Court And Britain as a signary to the Rome Convention is required to carry out those arrest warrants should either of those individuals turn up in UK territory What David Lammy stopped short of doing was what many of us requested which is a wider sanctioning of officials in the Israeli government who've been a party to the decision making on the bombardment of Gaza Their names are well known but also of uh Israeli Defense Force um high command who are also obviously very much part of the decision-making process on which buildings to bomb and which buildings to blow up not that there's many buildings left in Gaza that are still to be blown up And so we are continuing that pressure So there's a big move in parliament on military equipment on demanding aid get in rapidly rapidly rapidly to Gaza um and also sanctions against Israeli officials And so changes are happening but it's desperately slow And already over 60,000 have died in Gaza Can I also ask you about your response to what happened in Washington uh all these young uh embassy and consular uh staffers uh from different uh consulates uh and organizations gathered at the Jewish Museum and uh a young man uh opened fire killing two of those who worked at the Israeli embassy Your response it's absolutely shocking Nobody should be shot Nobody should be killed at any event anywhere around the world That is not the way to solve the issue And so we have to be resolute in demanding peace for all and also recognize that um in the case of Britain and also in the case of the USA the big demonstrations in support of the Palestinian people are of Christian Jewish and Muslim and people of no particular faith And one of the biggest groups on our demonstrations in support of the Palestinian people is actually the Jewish block Uh Lynn Boland finally before we end uh if you could also respond to events here Washington DC the killing of these two uh Israeli embassy staffers and then the fact that within the EU it's France that's leading efforts for the official recognition of Palestine if you could talk about the significance of that France meeting Saudi Arabia next month apparently in uh uh New York Foreign Secretary Lammy has said he's also in talks with Fr France and Saudi Arabia about officially recognizing Palestine Um please Yeah And and just to echo I suppose what Jeremy has said and send my condolences to the family of the two who who were shot dead last night Um nobody should be losing their lives Um what we want to see is peace We want to have a a longstanding peace uh in Gaza in Palestine for the Palestinian people and Jewish people to be able to live in peace Um in regards to President Mcron and leading the the case for the recognition of the state of Palestine look it is very welcome Um Ireland and Spain recognized Palestine I think it was about a year ago You know Sweden some years before It is it is important It's a really significant step and I'm sure it be very much welcomed by the Palestinian people But for me the urgency within the EU now is ending the blockade is demanding the ceasefire And demanding the ceasefire means that EU countries need to stop supplying weapons to Israel So Jeremy was talking about Britain's role in in arming Israel We have countries within the EU who are significant weapons providers to the Israeli state if they wanted this conflict and this war and genocide to end tomorrow then they need to stop supplying weapons to to Israel Um and the F-35s is a critical part of that Um we also need to see the aid getting in and the aid needs to be delivered and and supported through UNRA Um and we're fighting very hard back at any push to to militarize the aid agenda And we're seeing Israel talking about setting up compounds where you know women would have to to to go to areas putting themselves in vulnerable positions people with disabilities children having to go and that Israel would decide who is deserving and who isn't deserving of aid Uh this cannot be tolerated What we need is UNRA to be allowed to do their job lift the blockade let the trucks in and deliver the aid to the people who so desperately need it those children 14,000 children who are at risk of dying from starvation in the next 48 hours That's where our focus should be Absolutely Recognize the state of Palestine But right now the people of Palestine need food They need medicine They need water And they need to stop the bombs dropping on them Democracy Now is funded

          <attvalue for="7" value="joining me now is author Gideon Levy he's a world-renowned columnist at Harets the uh Israeli paper that is famous really it has taken a very critical line against the Netanyahu government particularly over the war in Gaza now but of course Mr levy has been writing about this for a very long time uh thanks so much for speaking to us at Worldview thank you for having me it's always nice to meet you uh you're there in Tel Aviv now in your latest column in the Harets you've asked a question of why even though many Israelis are against the war uh why they don't feel the pain of Palestinians in Gaza and you've made a very strong statement you said even though Israel has now committed a thousand October 7ths uh in just the past few years what is your sense of uh a the situation in Gaza today uh because of course we see a lot of the videos um and what is the support for the war inside Israel as about the situation in Gaza I think that both of us cannot imagine ourselves what does it mean to live now in Gaza those are walking dead people i talked to some of them but very very few of them we we cannot imagine it and we better don't imagine it because I don't I don't think many people went through what they are going through it must remind me from the worst times of history the starvation the children the the destruction you see the images of destruction it's it's really outrageous and the fact that the world is still silent and it is silent is condemning but not taking any measures to stop it is really astonishing astonishing now to your question look something happened in Israel on the 7th of October besides the crimes of the 7th of October israel got to the notion that after the 7th of October Israel has the right to do whatever it wants no limits no borders not legally not morally we have the right to do whatever we want because what they have done to us the second thing that happened after the 7th of October is obviously the feeling that all the embassy told the Palestinian people even by the peace camp was finished no more i mean it's almost illegal and for sure immoral in Israel to pay some kind of empathy some kind of mercy some some kind of humanity toward the people of Gaza it is immediately labeled as treason and those two things together with the unbelievable betrayal of Israeli media which does not show Gaza to the Israelis because they don't want to see Gaza you will be astonished to see how little any Indians saw more of Gaza than any average Israeli and this also enables the Israelis not to know and they choose not to know and to continue to feel good about themselves they still think that everything we do in Gaza is self-defense all together is a very very depressing picture because humanity is finished any kind of solidarity with the real victims and the people of Gaza are the biggest victims right now is off the table and the future looks very dark right well you know you have spoken about of course the suffering inside Gaza what we saw in the last few weeks uh was a statement by uh Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that he was now preparing for military control of Gaza uh first time since Israel pulled out in 2005 that announcement apart from the increase in bombardment of Gaza in the last uh week or so uh seems to have led to a shift on the part of three leaders who have so far been much more supportive of the Israeli position the leaders of United Kingdom France and Canada do you think this uh you know their statement together their uh threat of sanctions against Israel saying we will no longer turn a blind eye to what Israel is doing do you think it uh marks a turning point in the in the kind of idea that Israel still had support uh and do you think it'll make a difference no declaration will make a difference no declaration will change the policy of Israel the only thing that can change the policy of Israel will be measures actions and the world until now is just talking and Israel learned to live with condemnation and to ignore them as long as it is not being followed up by real measures like for example toward Russia a few weeks after the invasion to to Cremier as long as it's only talking it is with very little influence add to this the notion that most of the Israelis believe that the whole world is in any case anti-semitic that the whole world in any case doesn't like us so why would we care they all I mean it's their fault not our fault they are the anti-semites we are the moral people with the most moral people immoral army in the world right netanyahu in fact accused Macron the French president of speaking for Hamas absolutely macron who is really very devoted to find a solution is labeled as as a pro- Hamas anyone who dares to criticize Israel anyone is immediately labeled as anti-semite and uh you know words will not change it the only way to change it is taking actions by this I don't want to undermine those declinations they are showing a new tone in Europe they might be followed up with actions they might it might be a beginning of a new game but we have to see if it will be followed up with actions or it will remain as a hollow lip service right um you make a a fair point that eventually there has been criticism before the declarations don't necessarily translate to action that'll change uh the course inside Israel what about the domestic uh criticism of the war uh in Gaza which seems to be increasing you know so far we had seen most of the columnists apart of course from you and and others in in the haretss itself uh speaking really about the hostages that the hostages must be returned and for that criticizing the Netanyahu government but recent columns we have seen for example by former prime minister Ahoud Olmat um General Yar Golan's comments about the killing of children in Gaza uh I think former prime minister Barak has been critical as Well do you think that changes something internally in Israel because somehow Israeli politics does seem a little more difficult to uh you know is it seems a lot more complex when you're watching it from the outside it is not I I'm sure Indian politics is much more complex than Israeli politics but we will not make the comparison now in any case look there are two camps in Israel one camp will follow Netanyahu blindly and automatically no matter what he does this camp is quite solid the coalition a very fascist coalition is quite solid and it can and might continue until the next elections in two years there's another camp which is vocal which is devoted which is demonstrating day after day week after week but they have only two goals unfortunately so one goal is obviously releasing the hostages the other goal is getting rid of Netanyahu the goal of becoming more moral the goal of saving the children of Gaza the goal of saving the the last remains of Gaza is not one of their flags and therefore I'm so reluctant about them now which camp is bigger hard to say they are both solid and big i guess that if there would be elections today Netanyahu wouldn't win by all means not but you know uh even the alternatives right now you mentioned some names but the alternative is not promising ending the war the alternative is not premise promising ending the occupation of the apartheid so yeah things will be better after Netanyao but not good enough sure um finally the third poll as it were of uh you know international uh support or otherwise of um uh of Israel is always if you look at the world divided over the issue but there's always the US unequivocal support for Israel and yet we see US President Trump making statements uh he's you know almost uh threatening Mr netanyahu when it came to plans to strike Iran because there's a deal going on between the US and Iran uh and negotiations for that do you think the US is in any way withdrawing its support to Israel how is that ran uh over there because we are dealing with Donald Trump so it's very hard to foresee it can be one day can be one day like this and one day like this one day he supports Putin and to and today he's already cursing Putin one day he's insulting Zalinski and tomorrow Zalinski might become back an ally very hard to tell but it is a turning point and this is maybe the most important question right now what will the American administration do because would he like this war to end it will be within days israel is totally depending now on the West on the United States also on Europe but first of all on the United States like never before because of Israel becoming gradually a pariah state the dependence is much stronger in the few allies that Israel still possesses and therefore if there will be a shift in American policy this will be really a new scene a new era because until now for decades as you rightly said Israel had more or less a card blanch to do whatever it wants there were no limits attacking conquering nuclear weapons everything was allowed if America will change now Israel will face a new challenge which it never ch faced before sure you know in in the columns that you spoke about as well and there's a constant question what happens on the day after the day after Israel's bombardment of Gaza ends what is the plan for there and a large part of that is what is going to happen with uh the neighboring countries Egypt other Arab uh neighbors as well do you think uh that is something that Israel is is is working on right now are there contacts that might lead to meaningful uh cooperation in the future after everything we've seen in Gaza you know I ask because in India of course um India has been fairly muted on the issue partly because of India's own connections with Israel historical connection with Palestine but in particular in recent times India's hopes have been pinned on the India Middle East Europe economic corridor that goes through Hifa uh so many have asked is it is there a point in in thinking about such a project if the future of Israel's relations with neighboring Arab countries is never going to be fixed what are your thoughts first of all it's not about my thoughts about Netanyahu's thoughts and he was very clear he's he has a plan and the plan is as he phrased it to destroy Gaza to destroy Hamas which means to destroy Gaza and then to go for the Donald Trump's plan which is transferring 2.3 million people out of Gaza it is a plan it is a plan of crimes against humanity and crimes of war it is a plan which will never work but that's the plan anything else starts and ends with the question who will replace Hamas in Gaza the question that you raise must come only after solution for Gaza the Arab states not only Arab states by the way yesterday the prime minister of Indonesia was very clear about having diplomatic relations with Israel first time in history the biggest Muslim country in the world if only Israel will recognize a Palestinian state so the horizon is there israel is missing all those opportunities and there is no plan because first of all we don't know what to do with Gaza there will be no Gaza without Hamas unfortunately and if it will be a Gaza without Hamas it will be a Gaza of anarchy there's no substitute nobody prepared a substitute to kamas and therefore we are stuck with this war and all those big plans and dreams I must say must be postponed or even cancelled forever you know you spoke in India about uh six months ago and you had said that you are you no longer think that a two-state uh solution is possible explain that explain why you think that's not possible because that's still what everyone including the US including India including the Arab states are insisting upon it the two-state solution is the best solution two peoples are struggling over one piece of land both of them deser deserve self-determination let's share the land and two between the two peoples and create two sovereign independent states there's only one problem and this is the fact that the settlers did anything they could and succeeded to sabotage any potential for this in the West Bank in the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem occupied East Jerusalem there are 700,000 settlers Jewish settlers most of them are very extreme radical right-wingers part of them very violent and above all they represent the strongest political group in Israel without their evacuation there is no room for a Palestinian state their evacuation looks to me like a mission impossible i don't see who is going to do it no Israeli leader will be able to evacuate 700,000 settlers some of them are really powerful and violent it it might bring a total civil war here if someone proves me that the two-state solution is still possible I'll be the first one to sign on it but we have also to prepare ourselves to the scenario in which maybe I'm right and the two-state solution is not achievable anymore because of the settlers we cannot just say okay so the two-state solution doesn't work as it didn't work for the last 55 years yeah it's not that we didn't try the fact is that we are far from it than ever but we have to prepare a plan B and my plan B is obviously the one democracy the one state solution between the river and the sea one person one vote democracy as any other democracy in the world india is one person one vote israel should be one person one vote no matter what is your national or religious background that's the vision time will show all right um and and your sense of where uh IMC will actually go is it even a possibility if Israel remains on the route if Israel remains on the route it's going to a very bad place it will become an apartheite state it is already but a officially aparttheite state with a official apartheite system a pariah state totally isolated some kind of Iran or no Korea with very little embassy from the world and very little support this can end in a very tragic way that's the last chance for Israel really to change the roots but right now there's no one to lead it all right we we do ask uh in India many times about international conflicts of these kind does India have a role according to you does India have a role first of all in the first of all every country in the world has a rule because I believe that only by international pressure things will change israel will not change by itself forget about it israel will not wake up one morning and say the war must end because it's very brutal and barbaric the occupation must end because it is an apartheite system and so forth and so forth it will not happen by itself it will happen only with the intervention of the international community and the international community india has one of the strongest actors players with very good ties with both sides I must say and someone who has such good ties can influence the question is if India like any other country is ready to take measures not only to talk with talking we are fed up i mean everything was said everything was threatened everything was condemned it doesn't change anything does India is India ready to even sacrifice some shortrun interests of India in order to get to a solution and to really try to influence Israel to put an end to this crazy crazy war first of all that's a question that Indians should ask themselves sure uh Gideon Levi you're always so straight direct uh and you have remained in in a sense critical of the government many always ask how does Haretss do it uh if Israel is such a restrictive country and and the government has put so many strictures on people um uh and there is such widespread support for the war in a sense or uh uh you know the the unwillingness to criticize the war how do you do it it's not very pleasant but it is possible first of all I'm privileged to be a Jew would I be in a Palestinian I would be in jail long time ago Secondly I'm privileged to work with Har which is still a very respected platform in Israel and Harets gives us the full freedom of speech the government until now try to touch Har but only through economical measures not through censorship or things like this this is still far away even though it can happen very they just need to change some legislation and they think about it so nothing should be taken for granted but right now I'm very grateful for being free to express myself having the platform having the support and yes most of the Israelis don't like what I say I'm banned on Israeli TV now for many many months ever since the war started that's not a I mean I'm not the victim of this war obviously and yes I'm very grateful but I don't take it for granted it might change as as journalists shouldn't uh but Gideon Levy thanks so much for speaking to us of course Gideon Levy is the author also of the punishment of Gaza that's about a previous uh Israeli uh campaign there um but for the moment that's all we have time for thanks so much for joining us thank you so much for having me" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="panic chaos a young girl tries desperately to shake her brother back to life an Israeli drone has just struck a busy street in Gaza City israel insists it only targets Hamas but so many it kills the civilians when grief is so raw how do you put it in words can I get rid of it may God take revenge on you this woman screams her child one of more than 54,000 victims of Israel's assault death is constant in Gaza but that doesn't make it any easier to bear for everyone here Israel is guilty of genocide but some direct their anger at Hamas too may God punish you this distraught man says of one Hamas leader i pray you are killed too back at the scene of the attack a man is collecting pieces of human flesh in a plastic bag all he can do to give the victims a dignified burial this part of Gaza City is crammed with families who've been forced to flee from elsewhere since breaking the ceasefire in March the Israeli military has displaced more than 600,000 Palestinians un data shows that 82% of the Gaza Strip is now a declared militarized zone or under evacuation orders the entire population is somehow meant to live in less than a fifth of the territory that's supposedly safer israeli officials have suggested their aim now is to push Gazans towards the south where three of the new Israeli backed aid distribution sites have been built this afternoon the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation resumed operations after multiple instances of desperate Palestinians being shot trying to reach their site today's distribution passed off peacefully but the scheme has been widely criticized by the UN major charities and those forced to scrabble for something anything to feed their families we almost died in there we almost died all this to get some food for our children this is all I could get a bit of flour a bit of lentils and two packs of pasta working alongside Israeli forces under this new aid distribution scheme a new armed militia led by an alleged former Gazen criminal Yasa Abu Shabbab has previously been accused of running a looting gang from inside Israeli military controlled territory now his men are openly working with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation he denies wrongdoing and insists he's helping his people today after a political rival accused the Israeli prime minister of arming Abu Shabbab Benjamin Netanyahu released this video admitting to supporting clans in Gaza to rival Hamas all the time Israel's bombing campaign continues targeted this morning a group of journalists in a hospital courtyard their colleagues reporting on their deaths as they mourn the Israeli army said it had killed a member of the militant group Islamic [Music] Jihad but the three victims were all known to have worked in the media prior to the war yet more families torn apart by suffering which shows no sign of ending well joining me now the former Israeli Prime Minister Ehood Almouth and first of all your reaction to this revelation that Benjamin Netanyahu has been supporting a rival militia to Hamas jihadist Israel hating and potentially arming them i don't know what to say in as long as this militia is uh helpful in distributing the uh needs of the population in an effective way in cooperation with the Israelis maybe this is a positive step but I I'm not familiar with the facts to be able to judge it from a distance again I think that it is incumbent upon Israel to make sure that all the humanitarian needs of the population are provided in an effective manner this is very important this is our moral obligation how to do it it's not simple and as you can see I mean in this chaos which is part of Gaza today and as long as the military operations continue it's probably very complic so if the this militia is helpful in providing the needs and actually effectively providing the needs then maybe this is one way of coping with this difficulty now you have argued that Benjamin Netanyahu should now face war crimes charges can you explain why well I'm here using a terminology that I didn't use but yes what I said and I keep on saying is that when a war is uh declared by a majority of Israelis is not a result of any national security interest of the state of Israel when it is obvious and is accepted widely that uh there is not a chance that as a result of these operations we will be able to save the lives of the hostages perhaps on the contrary we may risk them and we may lose them if in this process of a war which is not waged because of national interest but as people say because of the political interest of the prime minister we're losing soldiers we may lose the hostages and quite a few Palestinians not involved are killed this is a crime and now I don't know whether it falls within the legal definitions of a war crime whatever but it doesn't matter it has to stop right now we have to end the war we have to return all the hostages and we have to make the necessary arrangements together with Egypt and Jordan and America and the Emirates and others in order to establish a new government in Gaza that will take over from Hamas this is what we need to do instead of continuing an unnecessary war kama and Emanuel Macron have both said they are considering further sanctions against members of the Israeli government would you support that well you don't want me to give equivalence on something that I'm not familiar with i can say this if uh um Benvir and Smriidge these two outspoken extremist messianic uh fundamentalist uh supporters of terror ministers senior cabinet ministers in Israeli government will continue to be representatives of the spirit of this government that I will not be surprised if uh friendly countries and I consider President Mcron to be a friend of state of Israel i know him i know what he thinks i know that he is committed to the uh best interest of the state of Israel not of the government of Israel but if he will decide to take measures against the specific individuals because of what they say and what they do I will not be surprised ahood Alma thank you very much indeed for joining us well earlier today the Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson Orurin Marmstein offered an interview it was on the basis that our agreation of four minutes couldn't be edited more people have been killed today in Israeli air strikes the British prime minister has described what's going on in Gaza as appalling and intolerable and is considering further sanctions the French are also considering sanctions what's your response hi Christian it's good to be on the show first I want to share with you some of the sentiment in Israel it's a very emotional day in Israel two of our hostages were are back they are back in a military operation they are dead this is Gadi and Judy 73 years old and 70 year old those are two cup two people grandpa and grandmother went for a morning walk and they were slaughtered and I I will ask you about this but I'd be grateful if you question i will answer i will answer i just want to share with you something that I heard before coming to this show this is the last phone call of Judy crying calling the emergency in a line saying &quot;My husband is just been shot i've been shot my h my husband brain is spilled o over come and help me.&quot; Unfortunately no one helped her she was slaughtered gadi was slaughtered and 56 more hostages are still in the hell nightmare called Hamas we want to see them back and every day that passes by just makes it more urgent to have our hostages released yes but your response to the international condemnation of what you're doing is what we're trying to share the situation as is with international comm community and international organization and the the situation is the following unfortunately kamas is still a threat an immediate threat to the people of Israel we are not in a situation in which we cannot vouch that we won't have another October 7 and this is why this war is still going on so you carry on i mean you the former defense minister Avdor Lieberman has said that Israel has been supplying weapons to a jihadist rival militia uh operating in Gaza under areas of Israeli control how is that happening so first I think the one making those statements needs to be asked but it hasn't been denied by the prime minister's office i think what the prime minister office published is that Israel is doing everything possible to fight Hamas including arming other militia i don't think they had it in in their statement so I think this is the the word are you not denying it no I'm I'm saying that we are doing everything possible to fight this evil what kind of person killed a 70-year-old grandma in her morning walk what kind of person takes Ariel and Kir Bibbas two babies and kidnap him if you can explain this to me which kind of what kind of of cause justify taking babies as hostages I I would be astonished and it's the lesson of what has happened in bringing back these two bodies that armed conflict is the way to get the hostages back because many of the hostage families fear that more of those who are still alive will be killed if this war carries on i think first we should listen and respect the hostages families i would say almost in a sacred way they are going through living hell i can't imagine having my my daughter my my my mother in captivity in Kamas but the war carries on because we're very tight for time i can't imagine so we we should listen to them but on the same time we should also judge what what proved to be very effective it's the combination of military operation and diplomatic means and if you allow me I can explain about the diplomatic means i'm afraid our time is up uh so Orura Masne thank you very much thank you thank you" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="well welcome to the 700 Club israeli fighter jets bombed Hezbollah drone factories in Beirut yesterday and Gaza has become even more complicated israel is turning to an unlikely source for help in defeating Hamas in Gaza julie Stall brings us the latest developments from Jerusalem israel has been arming a family clan sometimes called the militia in Gaza in order to strengthen opposition to Hamas israeli opposition leader Avidor Lieberman leaked that information to Israeli media and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not deny the report on the advice of security officials we activated clients in Gaza that oppose kamas what's wrong with this this is only good and saves the lives of IDF soldiers the publication of this only benefits kamas but Lieberman doesn't care the group led by Yaser Abu Shabbab has been documented operating in an area near the Kum Shalom border crossing that is under Israeli military control and where aid trucks enter Gaza it has about 300 members which Hamas sees as a thorn in its flesh that report comes as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has closed all of its aid distribution sites in Gaza for now saying they will be reopened later the sites were closed after shootings near the aid locations earlier this week meanwhile Israel has assured the US it will not strike Iran's nuclear facilities unless President Trump makes it clear that negotiations with Iran have failed according to Axios but in another sign that Iran is building up its military program the Wall Street Journal reports Iran has ordered material from China for hundreds of ballistic missiles president Trump says he cautioned Netanyahu not to launch an attack on Iran while talks are ongoing but Trump also said his stand could change with a phone call if talks with Iran aren't making progress in another show of US support for Israel Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced sanctions against four judges on the International Criminal Court saying they are directly involved in the Hague's efforts to prosecute Israeli and US nationals for alleged war crimes in Gaza the decision follows Hungary's earlier move to withdraw from the IC rather than arrest Netanyahu when he came to visit if you check the uh the voting records at the UN General Assembly you will find a few countries just a few countries from Europe opposing every and each anti-Israeli anti-Zionist resolution hungary is among those countries and in Lebanon Israel warned Lebanese civilians to leave specific areas before it struck Hezbollah drone production sites and storage facilities in Beirut and southern Lebanon used by the Hezbollah aerial unit the IDF says Hezbollah has launched more than a thousand explosive and reconnaissance UAVs at Israel since the beginning of the war the IDF says Hezbollah is working to produce thousands of drones under the direction and funding of Iranian terrorists as part of Iran's efforts to harm the state of Israel julie Stall CBN News Jerusalem well I'm sorry to report that the food distribution in Gaza has been shut down because of uh these Palestinian groups that have been armed and whether it's Hamas or this other group that was apparently cooperating with the IDF uh what they're doing is they're shooting Palestinians who are trying to get to the humanitarian aid and so the uh all the aid had to be shut down for the safety of the people you don't want to have a choice of you're going to be shot to death or you're going to get food it just it it just it's incredible to me that Israel would uh cooperate with some kind of militia gang in in Gaza on the theory that well the enemy of my enemy is is my friend and and we need some kind of counterbalancing force against Hamas this isn't the first time in Israel's history that this has happened as Israel withdrew from uh southern Lebanon back in the 1980s uh they had a similar alliance with militias in southern Lebanon that didn't work out and it's not going to work out in Gaza today there's a biblical precedent as well a king of Judah uh tried to hire other soldiers uh from Israel and in that a prophet of God came and warned them and this is the warning from 2 Chronicles 25:8 if you let them go with your troops into battle you will be defeated by the enemy no matter how well you fight God will overthrow you for he has the power to help you or to trip you up israel needs to be clean from this kind of activity not arming other militias in Gaza in some vain hope that it'll counterbalance Hamas the key for peace in Gaza is disarmament you that's not allowed to have weapons inside of Israel you have to be either part of the police or part of the IDF and that same standard should be the standard for Gaza we're seeing the aftermath of it where the humanitarian aid the food that was needed by the citizens of Gaza is now stopped because of this alliance let's not continue it i hope they shut it down and shut it down very quickly in other news one of the largest pro-Israel events in the US has been postponed indefinitely because of growing terror threats john Jessup has that story and more from our CBN news bureau in Washington john thanks Gordon the event called the Israel Summit was expected to draw more than a thousand people from across the United States and by live stream organizers had already uh had to move the event once because of threats israel Summit organizer Luke Hilton told CBN News what happened there were groups of jihadi Americans i mean honestly there's nothing else to call them because this is now uh spreading all across America calling to target quote target the Israel Summit and to target the venue and the organization that was hosting us and unfortunately because of this there was just no other option except to uh indefinitely postpone next week's Israel Summit um what it feels like is that Jews and Christians can no longer gather publicly in support of Israel and America despite postponing Hilton promises there will be a bigger better Israel summit in the US where people won't be afraid to come together to support Israel for more on this story and the full interview you can go to cbnnews.com well possible signs of a break in the war of words between President Trump and Elon Musk politico is reporting White House aid scheduled a phone call today to possibly broker peace between the two other political allies are also supporting a truce with Musk signaling his potential willingness to go along cbn's Charlene Aaron brings us this look at how the verbal battle escalated after months of solidarity and mutual praise between the two leaders the rift began with Musk's criticism of President Trump's big beautiful bill with both men engaging in a war of words on social media this massive outrageous pork filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination Musk posted on X Tuesday trump responding by saying Musk knew what was in the package i'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here better than you people he knew everything about it he had no problem with it all of a sudden he had a problem and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV minted but Musk says he was never shown the bill after the president said he knew what was in it musk who reportedly spent at least $250 million to help reelect Trump went on to claim &quot;Without me Trump would have lost the election.&quot; Something the president denies i think I would have won susie would say I would have won Pennsylvania easily anyway the president also posting &quot;Elon was wearing thin i asked him to leave i took away his EV mandate that forced everybody to buy electric cars that nobody else wanted that he knew I was going to do and he just went crazy trump also threatening to terminate Musk's government subsidies and contracts a move that could devastate the billionaire's bottom line tesla's stock sank Thursday on news of Musk and Trump's falling out in response Musk said he would decommission the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft a capsule used to take astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station but he later backed away from the idea musk also dropped what he called the really big bomb claiming that President Trump has ties to Jeffrey Epstein who was accused of sex trafficking musk didn't offer any proof but said the truth would come out when asked about the issue the president did not respond mr president the former head of Doge also suggested support for a new third party &quot;it's time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle,&quot; Musk wrote in a post on X meanwhile political observers expected a likely breakup between two such powerful personalities but maybe not in such a public fashion now many Republicans and conservatives are hoping that a reconciliation might be possible charlene Aaron CBN News thank you Charlene well right here in Washington the Supreme Court ruled nine to nothing Thursday that a Catholic charity in Wisconsin cannot be forced to pay unemployment taxes when other religious groups are exempt state officials argued the organization did not qualify for an exemption because its day-to-day work doesn't involve religious teachings the high court sided with a Catholic charities group after the organization argued the state violated its First Amendment guarantee of freedom of religion well locals say a move of God is stirring in upstate South Carolina and they're calling it the beginning of a revival it's bringing churches from across the state together for a big crusade this weekend cbn's Wendy Griffith has the story i believe you died for me evangelist Jacob Eversoul of World Harvest Ministry says something special is happening in upstate South Carolina what's happening right now is something that we couldn't even dream or imagine uh we give all glory to God uh people from all the way to from Greenville Spartanberg Anderson Gaffne honestly all the way to Myrtle Beach and even into other states North Carolina are getting word of this uh crusade that is coming June 6th 7th and 8th for 2 years Eversol has been holding events to inspire and equip the local church for this 3-day gospel outreach that he says is stoking the fires of revival people are getting saved in the highways in the byways in the prisons but not only getting saved um going on mission um getting plane tickets to some of our crusades overseas you know there's been prophetic words that the upstate of South Carolina would be a light unto the nations and uh we are starting to step into that now eversol an international evangelist who's preached all over the world said it was time to shine the light of Christ in his hometown the event starts that night June 6th at 7 but every night uh starting at 5:30 we're going to feed the city we're trying to feed you know 3 to 4,000 people per night it's something that the churches have come together to pull off it's a massive undertaking if you want to be a part of the gospel choir

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] at this point in time all of you at least most of you have heard the statement Gaza is the biggest open prison in the world so today we're going deep into that story the story of the Gaza Strip its history its people its borders and who benefits from you thinking that it's the biggest prison in the world the Gaza Strip is a small piece of land on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea a borders Egypt on the Southwest and Israel on the East and the north people have lived in Gaza for Millennia but for for today's purposes were focusing on the history starting in 1947 in 1947 the entire land is inhabited both by Arabs and Jews and controlled by the British Empire it's already riddled with violence fueled by competing National aspirations then the UN proposes the partition plan a two-state solution with Jerusalem as its International City the Palestinians were to receive the Western Galilee the Samarian Highlands and the coastal plains south of jof including the Gaza Strip Jewish leaders accepted this plan reluctantly of course and the Palestinians along with the Arab countries around them opposed any partition leading to a Jewish State igniting the 1948 War following Egypt into war were Iraq Jordan that back then was known as trans Jordan Lebanon and Syria the Egyptians attack from within Egypt and this is important to note from Egypt they washed through the Gaza Strip and then up the coastal plains toward Wards Tel Aviv and with much effort this wasn't at all an easy battle the young state of the time pushes them back to the Gaza Strip establishing that first sliver as we know it today at the end of the war Gaza was occupied by Egypt what's interesting is they never annexed the Gaza Strip it forever remained even under Egyptian control an area controlled by military governance but not fully citizens or people with full rights Egypt maintained control over for Gaza for 19 years and in that 19-year period it's not like everything is peaceful in the Gaza Strip there's a ton of refugees that have sort of come in the Gaza Strip there's a lot of violence and they're under military control but not only that there wasn't no fence back then so those communities in the Gaza Strip continuously throughout the period go out and murder Jewish communities that border them in 1967 the 19-year control of the Egyptians in the Gaza Strip ends with a Six-Day War what was that war a quick reminder it's this incredibly Swift six day battle where Israel quadruples its landmass in a strategic attempt to push hostile forces further away from its borders and to gain some strategic depth this is when Gaza first came under Israeli control over the years tension between Gaza and Israel continued to rise but in 1993 things seemed like they could change for the best with the start of the Oslo Accords finally the time is approaching when there will be safety in Israel's house when the Palestinian people will write their own destiny so sidebar what are the Oslo Accords the Oslo Accords were a series of agreements starting in the early '90s that were supposed to gradually bring together the Israelis on the one side the Palestinians on the other side with the ultimate goal of having two states one Jewish State called Israel one Palestinian State called Palestine the Gaza Strip was part of that agreement the first Sao Accords is basically this general statement of we accept your existence as a people which sounds basic to us today but back then there was a lot the next set of Accords was 1995 and they go way farther into detail of where the borders are going to be what the future Palestinian state is going to look like and again all of this encompasses also the Gaza Strip at the same time as Israel government and the Palestinian leadership are negotiating there are extremists on both sides who are strongly opposed to these Accords in Israel an extremist murders are then prime minister isin in the Palestinian side you have the Hamas and the Islamic Jihad Palestinian terrorist organizations who do everything they can to stop the Accords and what does everything they can mean it means they're murdering Israeli civilians in the streets of our country in 2000 we have this big attempt to jump start the oso Accords in which the US of course the Israelis and the Palestinians come together in Camp David in the US to try and rekindle this ongoing discussion UD Bak is our prime minister at the time he shows up with whatever mandate he had from the government and Y Al Palestinian leader shows up and for whatever reason he can't or will not move on with the Accords if you look at the big picture timeline of history that last Camp David meeting is sort of the last ditch attempt attempt to restart the oso Accords after that we really never have an effective one in fact the Palestinians start what we now call the second intifada in late 2000 which is a 5year ongoing terrorist attack on the heart of Israel it was suicide bombers blowing up on buses in cafes in malls across Israel that is the reality I grew up to as a teenager the Palestinians did everything they could to sabotage the peace Accords and on the Israeli side our population strongly lost faith that there's a chance to really reach meaningful peace of the Palestinians many years down the line we find out that arafat's second in that was marketed as this Grassroots movement wasn't as spontaneous as it was pegged to be in fact it was meticulously planned by the PLO by the Palestinian Authority to sabotage the peace with Israel so how is all of this related to the god of strip and today's topic let's go back to the Gaza Strip so from the 9s through the early 2000s Gaza has a mix of Palestinian cities which are the vast majority of the population in Israeli communities that are spread out on the coast on the Eastern side and in the north of the Gaza STP in the absence of Peace negotiations with the Palestinians and in response to the ongoing threat of terrorism in 2005 the Israeli government led by Ariel Shon does something that no one has ever done in history we decided to pull out of the Gaza Strip with no agreement with no preconditions with nothing just with a point to stop the violence to stop the terrorism every Israeli Citizen and Soldier are pulled out of the Gaza Strip till the last one it's important to know that this was not easy for the Israeli people in fact till this day the 2005 disengagement from the Gaza Strip is considered to be one of the most divisive events in Israeli history till this day people talk back to that event as one of the causes for our current political conflict no more Israelis inside the strip no Israeli military presence the Israeli Gaza border crossings were to be used only for the passage of goods Aid and individuals with permits from within Gaza into Israel or Goods into Gaza control of the Gaza Egypt border was handed over to Egypt and the expectation was that this move on our end would allow the Palestinian in the Gaza Strip to finally have the peace to have the freedom that they wanted to have the control of their own land and to finally move away from violence so Israel withdraws from the Gaza Strip in 2005 leaves behind the Palestinians who a year later 2006 have national elections the Hamas wins they don't win all the votes but they win enough to overthrow the fat the PLO and they don't do this in the Democratic way they violently and murderously throw them out of the Gaza Strip there have been no other election since in Gaza so the Gaza Strip was now under Hamas control which openly called and still calls for the destruction of the entire state of Israel we continue to give them water we continue to give them electricity we continue to have tens of thousands of Palestinians work inside of Israel and the violence continues from the Gaza STP again and again and again the Israeli Gaza border has been the crossing point of numerous terrorist attacks abusing Israel's permits coming into the country to kill soldiers and civilians alike and the communities along the Israeli side of the Border have become so accustomed to the rocket attacks from the Gaz inside that everywhere you look you'll see bomb shelters with a hostile entity along its border Israel resorted to tightening the Border points between Israel and Gaza saying if you want open passage at least recognize our country's right to exist since 2006 that has not not yet happened I think if there was anyone who had any doubts about how much of a necessity having a strong border with the Gaza Strip is those doubts disappeared on October 7th with a vicious attack of the Hamas against the innocent civilians of Israel there's this claim that's constantly made that Israel is the one that controls all the entry and exit of the Gaza Strip but that's of course not true Israel controls the Eastern side and the northern side bordering with Israel but they have a whole big border that borders with the Egyptians and that border is controlled by the Egyptians since 2005 so who benefits the misleading statement that Gaza is a prison controlled by Israel there are ulterior motives at play here Hamas are a terrorist group that is part of Iran's Network it's Iran fighting through Hamas attacking Israel the biggest victims of the Hamas actions and the Iranian government behind them are the Palestinian people living in the Gaza Strip if you've seen any of the footage coming out of the Gaza Strip lately it's impossible not to feel empathy and compassion for the people of that strip the Hamas took the water pipes that were donated and they used it for Rockets they took the fertilizer meant for building the land and used it for explosives they took the construction materials continuously brought in to build tunnels to attack Israel because the Hamas policy has been destructive and devastating to the people of the Gaza Strip that is the reality of what's happening on the ground so where does this all leave us what do we do with all this information we have to understand how important it is to have a strong border between Israel and the Hamas in the Gaza STP the people of Gaza deserve a peaceful life they deserve Prosperity they deserve quiet as do the people of Israel and with Hamas control of the Gaza Strip that's simply never going to happen if Gaza is a prison then Hamas are the prison guards" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="the Palestinian people are being starved bombed and forcibly displaced by Israel they're unlawful occupier the International Court of Justice here is another case against Israel in what could be a test of Israeli defiance of international law more than 40 nations argue its ban on the UN agency for Palestinian refugees is a breach of the UN charter so can the World Court hold Israel to account this is inside [Music] [Music] story hello and welcome to the program i'm Fib Batibbo on the first of five days of hearings at the International Court of Justice in the HG Palestinian officials have told judges that Israel is using humanitarian aid as a weapon of war more than 40 countries are arguing that Israel's November decision to stop all coordination with the UN agency for Palestinian Refugees or UNRA is a breach of the UN founding charter but however the court rules the result will be an advisory opinion that means it's a suggestion non-binding and Israel has shown in the past it has no issue ignoring international law so can the ICJ make a difference this time and will any decision made in Europe have an impact on the millions of Palestinians in Gaza struggling to find food under an Israeli blockade that's now lasted nearly two months we'll get to our guests in just a moment first this report from Laura Khan children among the huge crowds pushed to fill their empty plates knowing that food is running out in Gaza this desperate situation has been made worse by Israel's heavy bombardment and more than 2 months of its total blockade on food medicine and fuel to the strip the coming days in Gaza are going to be critical uh today people are not surviving in Gaza those that aren't being killed with bombs and bullets are being are slowly dying everyone is suffering from malnutrition especially the children what are the children eating they spend all day standing in the line at the food kitchen to get rice or beans and sometimes there is none in stark contrast to the streets are these empty distribution centers belonging to UNRA the UN agency for Palestinian refugees not only is it facing severe shortages but also Israel's total ban on its operations across the Palestinian territories far beyond the blockaded fences of Gaza israel is facing legal pressure at the International Court of Justice at the Hague monday's hearing goes beyond Israel's blockade of aid and examines whether Israel's ban on UNRA violated the UN's founding charter the court can only offer an advisory opinion but can carry political weight israel has long advocated for the dismantling of the UN agency it accuses some of its members of involvement in the October 7th attacks of its 14,000 members working in Gaza UNRA found nine people may have been involved and no longer work with them now the agency has been forced to shut down schools clinics community centers and Israel has revoked visas for international staff 66 back in the ICJ Palestinian representatives were the first to speak in the hearing this campaign of erasure was a central hallmark of the Nakba that started in 1947 and whose darkest chapter yet unfolding before our eyes and yours on three separate occasions in the past years the court issued provisional measures ordering Israel among other things to ensure and facilitate the unimpeded flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza israel did not comply weaponizing food and humanitarian aid and negating refugee issue and and their rights including by banning onora are prohibiting now the focus will be on the ICJ and UN states decisions as to whether they will defend the UN body or whether the hearing will result in further Israeli defiance of international law laura Insight story Alazer now let's take a closer look at UNRA the United Nations Relief and Works Agency was created in 1949 to provide assistance to Palestinian refugees there were 750,000 back then now 5.9 million Palestinians are eligible for UNRA support the UN agency runs schools healthc care facilities and also women's centers and micro financing unra doesn't just operate in the occupied territories it's also in Lebanon Syria and Jordan but it's in Gaza where the small strip has been bombed besieged and starved that the AY's operations are most needed and most in danger of complete collapse well let's bring in our guests now in Oxford in the UK Sam Rose who's the senior acting director of UNRA affairs in Gaza in the Canadian city of London Michael Link who's a human rights lawyer and professor emeritus f at the faculty of law at Western University and in Tel Aviv Gideon Levy who's a columnist with the Israeli newspaper Harets gentlemen welcome to you all thank you so much for being with us on Inside Story sam Rose if I can start with you um the UN General Assembly first asked the ICJ to weigh on Israel's legal obligations a year ago uh since then we've had tens of thousands of Palestinians killed and for the past two months there's been a total blockade of Gaza what are you hoping this new case is going to achieve what value do proceedings like this one uh have in the immediate thank you and thanks for for having me on look firstly we we hope that that we we welcome the case it's very timely but it's also increasingly and incredibly urgent we have been talking to the media advocating with member states every day several times a day for 18 months now about the plight of the civilian population in Gaza whose misery uh the inhumity and the cruelty and humiliation that they face is just deteriorating on a daily basis right now things are quickly going from very bad to to to worse the colleagues that we speak to on the ground the refugee communities that we speak to on the ground they have they have nothing this is beyond any level of suffering that we've seen in this most dehumanizing of of conflicts uh and conflicts in Gaza and Israeli Palestinian conflicts over the past 75 years so now is the time for the lawyers to deliberate but more than that now is the time for for action because we are running out of time to meet these needs of the population in Gaza which has immediate implications for them but longerterm implications for everyone in the region sam let me ask you what uh has the ban meant for UNRA the ban by the Israeli Nesset which uh came into effect in January last year what have been the real life consequences of that ban for the people who work for UNRA but also for the people who uh depend on on UNRA yeah I mean the ban had two elements to it one was banning UNRA's activities on the sovereign territory of of Israel the other element to it was prohibiting contact between uh UNRA and Israeli officials uh now I work for UNRA and I represent UNRA in in inside of Gaza so in theory of course the laws do not impinge on our activities inside of Gaza the the reality is is though that we have to coordinate and we have to communicate with the Israeli authorities on a daily basis to do our our work to bring the supplies into Gaza we're going through Israeli controlled borders and for our international staff to move in and out that has to be done in liaison with the Israeli authorities who control all the borders right now so I am speaking to you from Oxford because I as the director of UNRA in Gaza i'm not able to enter the Gaza Strip right now we still as as you said at the top have 15,000 colleagues working on on a daily basis but it impacts the ability of international staff to enter it impacts our ability to bring supplies in as well that also have to go through through Israeli controlled borders and of course we can turn to the situation in in the West Bank in a bit but the impact on our services in East Jerusalem for children for patients etc all right Gideon let me bring you into the conversation we we've have yet to hear Israel's defense in this case because it's absent from the proceedings at the Hague but we do already have an idea of what it's saying to try and justify uh terminating the agreement with UNRA and banning the AY's activities how is this new case first of all at the ICJ against Israel being viewed in Israel and does Israel's refusal to cooperate with UNRA uh represent a legitimate uh security concern or is it a part of a broader political strategy first of all Israel is not concerned at all about it because it's even hardly informal the hearing in the Hi it took me some time to find it in Israeli media out israel turned toward the world and this is just one chain in this behavior in this perception that the whole world is anti-semitic and therefore we turn our back to the world we don't participate in the Pope's funeral because he criticized Israel we are expelling an UNRA senior worker who lived here for 17 years married to an Israeli has three Israeli children she came to Israel for a short visit and they expelled her from the airport israel is doing anything possible to turn into a par state even by its own policy not only by the attitude of the world and this hearing now will have no effect on Israelis because for Israelis UNRA like the ICJ like the UN like any other international organization is anti-semitic and therefore we can we can only ignore their advices you know for so many times I asked myself what does Israel want you killed 50 55,000 people you destroyed Gaza what do you want now why not to give human aid to those displaced poor people what is the logic yeah it's an important question you ask Gideon no doubt michael Link let me come to you and and to this ICJ case and these new hearings there uh legally speaking Michael how does international law weigh a state's right to sovereignty against its responsibility to uphold human rights and international humanitarian law in other words does Israel today have any legal basis for blocking UNRA no i guess the short answer is and I think that's going to be heard all week long by most of the states and international organizations who are going to be speaking to the court um there are two legal issues uh both of them related to each other that are before the court first is uh what are the u privileges and immunities of the United Nations and it's very clear in the charter of the United Nations which Israel is bound by and but by the 1946 convention on the privileges and immunities of the United Nations that um the facilities and buildings and work of the United Nations in whatever territory uh of a state that they're in are to be absolutely protected and that includes obviously uh their presence in the occup by territory the West Bank including East Jerusalem and Gaza um so that's one of the issues in front of the court the other is the one that you've uh you've spoken to with with Sam is what are the obligations of an occupying power under the international humanitarian law and particularly the 1949 Geneva Conventions which is the beating heart of uh of IHL and basically you know one of the one of the absolute fundamental obligations any state has particularly in a zone of conflict or a zone of occupation you cannot harm the civilians who are under your control and particularly you cannot starve them we thought that was something that was all done with uh with the end of the second world war the creation of a modern body of international law and here we are 80 years uh after the end of the second world war and we see vast starvation deliberately imposed so what happens uh um Michael before I come back to you Sam what happens if it's found that Israel is indeed in violation of the UN charter what action could could the United Nations take i mean could the UN General Assembly decide to expel Israel as one of its members for example that certainly uh is something that may be on the table let's keep in mind that Israel is in defiance of more than 30 Security Council resolutions over the last five decades it's ini in violation of scores of resolutions coming from the general assembly and the human rights council um much less was needed back in 1974 for the United Nations General Assembly not to recognize the credentials of apartheite South Africa and indeed kept that state out of the organization for the next 20 years if Israel defies this again and proceeds with this man-made famine um then I think you're going to start seeing action by some members of the General Assembly to question whether Israel should continue uh its status as a member uh of the United Nations all right uh Sam uh your thoughts about what is likely to happen here and what you are hoping this uh uh this new hearing is going to achieve some countries like the US uh have said that uh uh perhaps if if aid is not delivered through UNRA that other UN agencies uh could step in uh what do you make of that and and would that undermine uh UNRA's mandate if other UN agencies were to step in and fill uh the void that that is being left by UNRA thanks i mean look we're hoping for immediate action given the urgency of of the situation inside of Gaza we also recognize how polarizing this situation is as as as as Michael alluded to and Gideon as as well uh but ENRA is the provider of key basic services in Gaza and has been for for 75 years as you showed in your in your graphic educating in Gaza alone hundreds upon hundreds millions over a million children have gone through through UNRE schools some of the most literate people in in the region in including girls everything's been reduced to a supply of aid and boxes of aid and and food parcels through a border which is both incredibly dehumanizing but also uh ignorant uh of what people need to to live a dignified life and yes WFP could quite easily bring the aid in to to Gaza they need UNRA's assistance to get it to the people who need it as as quickly as possible what we're talking about here are the the 16,000 people a day who go to UNRA's health clinics the 500,000 people a day who receive uh clean water who receive garbage collection services from UNRA these are systems that we've put in place with the support of the international community over decades and it's those that will not be easily replaced and that's the plight of the civilian population of Gaza if UNRA's services are further constrained gideon UNRA as uh Sam said there is the only UN agency specifically dedicated to uh Palestinian refugees and which explicitly maintains the political definition of Palestinian refugees so are Israel's attacks on on UNRA also part of a broader campaign perhaps to to erase not just the Palestinian suffering but also uh Palestinian uh identity and Palestinian rights altogether that right to return uh that is part of Unoir's mandate no doubt that this step is just as I said before one chain and it has a much broader context namely and above all to tyrannize the life of the Palestinian and to make them leave that's the wet dream of of Israel that's the way dream of the right-wingers in Israel and anything is permitted in this anything is legitimate to reach this goal i I don't see any alternative to UNRA and you know what let's say that Israel has its own thoughts about UNRA and they think that UNRA is destructive in the middle of the war after destroying Gaza that's the time to close UNRA this shows the real intentions and the real intentions is to starve Gaza to death not less than this how how domestic political dynamics Gideon uh within Israel shape its approach to to international rulings and and to these humanitarian criticism that it's facing right now as the late Kissinger Henry Kissinger once said &quot;Israel does not have foreign policy it has only domestic politics.&quot; And it's being quoted in the recent months again and again many of Israel's steps in Gaza have their sources and their rationalization in domestic politics and this is this makes it just much more outrageous because there is no strategic goal right now in continuing the war it's all about satisfying the right-wingers in all and the fascists in order to keep the government in power because otherwise it falls apart but we have to remember that it didn't start now it is part of the thought of Israel and be it right or wrong you'll ask any Israeli he will tell you the whole world is against us no matter what we do the world is against us and if he is against us it's his blame not our blame and therefore we can do whatever we want not to speak about the fact that we are the chosen people and nobody is going to tell us what to do that's the mindset all right thank you for explaining that to us so clearly Michael so then given that the ICJ is an advisory body and that Israel as we're hearing from Gideon there is unlikely to comply with with any ruling what do you think are some of the mechanisms or international pressure even that could be helpful here to to pressure to enforce any ICJ guidance that will come about as a result of of this latest hearing well you're absolutely right i mean the ICJ can issue advisory opinions as you've said these are non-binding but they are a very authoritative statement on international law by the most respected international court that we that we have um and the the ability of ICJ uh advisory opinions or rulings depends upon the political will of the security council to fulfill them and that's not going to happen as long as the Americans have a veto so I then I think we shift our attention to the other international court that's in the HEG the international criminal court where which actually does have teeth 125 states in the world are members of the uh of the international criminal court when arrest warrants are issued all 125 states are obliged under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court to arrest those but as we saw I mean the ICC issued arrest warrants against uh the Israeli prime minister Netanyahu and the former defense minister but that hasn't led to anything no and you're right with the the one trip that um Benjamin Netanyahu has made to an ICC member has been to Hungary um and not ironically enough Hungary is one of the two states along with the United States that is appearing before the International Court of Justice this week on this advisory opinion request likely to argue in in protection and in favor of um uh of Israel but don't underestimate the uh the scope of the of the ICC's power uh with respect to this most just to clarify just to clarify Michael could the the IC ICJ's findings contribute to further action at the International Criminal Court and other courts yes of course i mean what the ICJ does is paid attention to by the ICC and vice versa if and when the ICJ decides on the separate advisor advisory matter with respect to the application by South Africa under the genocide convention that is going to be paid by close attention to by the ICC with respect to the prosecutor's decision to perhaps expand the number of arrest warrants and perhaps to expand the number of grounds for which uh these Israeli officials will be charged with all right Sam let me come to you now and you know ask you about what next i mean the legal ramifications of this case are profound but there's also a real human cost here um how do we ensure that the people on the ground in Gaza in the occupied West Bank are not forgotten in these legal debates especially when international aid and resources as we've been seeing for the past two months are being blocked by Israel i mean it's a very good question i mean this is a conflict that has received unparalleled levels of of attention the the the pictures the images that we'll never forget said into our minds in terms of what's happening to the people we are committed as ENRA and the rest of the humanitarian community inside Gaza inside the West Bank to continue pushing those messages out to make sure that the needs the suffering the rights of the population aren't forgotten the civilian population and that there is accountability for wrongdoing on on on on all sides but look this will only be addressed through political will if there's political will to open the borders now to ensure an orderly and respectful immediate release of of hostages but to put this conflict on the path to to to a solution so that Palestinians can enjoy the same rights and freedoms as their neighbors in in Israel without that uh we'll just repeat this again and again every few years and if this conflict and it's shocking to say after 18 months is not yet a wakeup call to the world on this then I then I I dread to think what what will be Gideon Levy in Tel Aviv will that political will that Sam talked about there will it ever come in Israel no it will not come in Israel but the challenge the real challenge is for the international community There's a member state of the UN which banned which is banning a very important UN agency there must be some kind of consequences to this there is a member state of the UN which violates the international law on a daily basis there must be some consequences to it and the challenge is not Israel the churches of the international community which is hugging Israel again and again and preventing any kind of accountability and if this will continue there will be no solution the solution will not come from within Israel israelis will not wake up one shining morning and say &quot;Oh what's going on in Gaza is not so nice let's put an end to it.&quot; No it will only be when they will be taken accountable and will also pay a price for it by the international community so the challenge is on the shoulders of the international community michael Link where do you think the solution will come from and what will we get at the end of this latest ICJ hearing and could could also the states that provide military support and political support to Israel uh ultimately be held complicit uh under international law if the ICJ were to determine that Israel's blockade uh constitutes a serious violation yes look um well international law doesn't have its own judges and it doesn't have its own armies that depends upon the political will of the UN uh and its leading members in order to be able to enforce there is a huge amount of legitimacy attached to decisions by the international court of justice and uh the international criminal court so with this number of decisions that Israel has been defined from the security council the general assembly the uh previous advisory opinions coming from the international court of justice and obviously as well these arrest warrants that have been issued by the international criminal court israel's legitimacy as a fair-minded uh player in the international system is taking yet more hits uh with respect to this but it only will we will only end the occupation we'll only have uh the realization of the Palestinian right of self-determination uh when the international community becomes mobilized enough to u finally impose a cost upon Israel israel has had an occupation now for 57 almost 58 years with virtually no cost at all uh politically or economically for this only when Israelis wake up and realize gee now I need a visa to go to Europe gee the prices uh of our goods are now becoming much more expensive because of the increasing blockades or the divestment coming from the international community only then I think will you see a significant change in Israeli public opinion and perhaps then the path to Palestinian self-determination thank you very much gentlemen for

A UN official called the limited supplies a drop in the ocean as the population of over 2 million is facing famine The leaders of Canada France and the UK all staunch allies of Israel warned they

before the lives of civilians reports on Myanmar 2019 Sri Lanka 2012 Sabrina Rwanda both in 1999 pointed to our collective failure to speak to the scale of violations while they were committed what more evidence do you need now briefing you again on this subject is a grim undertaking before starting I ask you to reflect for a moment on what action we will tell future generations we each took to stop the 21st century atrocity to which we bear daily witness in Gaza it is a question we will hear sometimes incredulous sometimes furious but always there for the rest of our lives we will surely all claim to have been against it maybe we will say we issued a statement or that we trusted that private pressure might work despite so much evidence to the contrary or pretend that we thought a more brutal military offensive had more chance of bringing the hostages home than the negotiations which brought so many hostages home maybe some will recall that in a transactional world we had other priorities or maybe we will use those empty words we did all we could mr president let me start with what we see and are mandated by this council to report israel is deliberately and unashamedly imposing inhumane conditions on civilians in the occupied Palestinian territory for more than 10 weeks nothing has entered Gaza no food medicine water or tents hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have again been forcibly displaced and confined into evershrinking spaces as 70% of Gaza's territory is either within Israeli militarized zones or under displacement orders as my colleague from the FAO will explain every single one of the 2.1 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip face the risk of famine one in five face starvation despite the fact that you have funded the food that could save them the few hospitals that have somehow survived bombardment are overwhelmed the medics who have somehow survived drone and sniper attacks cannot keep up with the trauma and the spread of disease even today the European Gaza Hospital in Khan Ununice was bombed again with even more civilian casualties reported i can tell you from having visited what's left of Gaza's medical system that death on this scale has a sound and a smell that does not leave you as one hospital worker described it children scream as we peel burnt fabric from their skin and yet we hear that we did all we could mr president our response as humanitarians is to make a single ask of the council let us work the UN and our partners are desperate to resume humanitarian aid at scale across Gaza in line with the fundamental principles of humanity impartiality independence and neutrality we have a plan we have shown we can deliver with tens of thousands of trucks reaching civilians during the ceasefire we have life-saving supplies ready now at the borders we can save hundreds of thousands of survivors we have rigorous mechanisms to ensure our aid gets to civilians and not to Hamas but Israel denies us access placing the objective of depopulating Gaza before the lives of civilians it is bad enough that the blockade continues how do you react when Israeli ministers boast of it or when attacks on humanitarian workers and violations of the UN's privileges and immunities continue along with restrictions on international and non-governmental organizations mr president this council has adopted resolutions that demand all parties to the conflict comply with international humanitarian law and protection of civilians including humanitarian personnel a reminder that Israel also has clear obligations under international humanitarian law it must treat civilians humanely with respect for their inherent human dignity it must not forcibly transfer deport or displace the civilian population of an occupied territory as the occupying power it must agree to aid and facilitate it so for anyone still pretending to be in any doubt the Israeli designed distribution modality is not the answer it practically excludes many including people with disabilities women children the elderly the wounded it forces further displacement it exposes thousands of people to harm it sets an unacceptable precedent for aid delivery not just in the OPT but around the world it restricts aid to only one part of Gaza while leaving leaving other dire needs unmet it makes aid conditional on political and military aims it makes starvation a bargaining chip it is a cynical sideshow a deliberate distraction a fig leaf for further violence and displacement if any of that still matters have no part in it mr president for the record we have tried the UN has met 12 times and again this morning with the Israeli authorities to discuss this proposed modality we wanted to find a way to make it possible we repeatedly explained the minimum conditions for our involvement on the basis of long settled fundamental principles aid based on independent assessments of who needs it the globally tested and donor demanded basic requirement and the ability to deliver aid to all those in need wherever they are the Secretary General set out the relevant international law in his submissions to the International Court of Justice and your resolutions have strongly condemned starvation of civilians as a method of warfare and the unlawful denial of humanitarian access resolution 2417 demands the council's full attention to widespread conflict induced food insecurity mr president it's not just Gaza appalling violence is also increasing in the West Bank where the situation is the worst in decades the use of heavy weaponry military methods of war excessive force forcible displacement demolitions and movement restrictions ongoing illegal settlement expansion entire communities destroyed refugee camps depopulated settlements expanding and settler violence continuing at alarming levels sometimes with the support of Israeli forces recently settlers abducted a 13-year-old girl and her three-year-old brother they were found tied to a tree do we also say to them that we did all we could mr president there is I fear a broader context here for the past 19 months Palestinian journalists civil society and individuals have live streamed their destruction to the world many have been targeted and killed for their testimony and during this time international aid workers have been the only international civilian presence in Gaza watching and reporting the unfolding horror we are your eyes and your ears and be in no doubt that we feel the weight of that responsibility to you to the communities we serve and to the world and so we have briefed this council in great detail on the extensive civilian harm that we witness daily death injury destruction hunger disease torture other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment repeated displacement on a large scale we have described the deliberate obstruction of aid operations and the systematic dismantling of Palestinian life and that which sustains it in Gaza so you have that information and now the ICJ is considering whether a genocide is taking place in Gaza it will weigh the testimony that we have shared but it will be too late recognizing the urgency the ICJ has indicated clear provisional measures that must be imple implemented now yet they have not previous reviews of the UN's conduct in cases of large-scale violations of international human rights and humanitarian law reports on Myanmar 2019 Sri Lanka 2012 Sabrina Rwanda both in 1999 pointed to our collective failure to speak to the scale of violations while they were committed so for those killed and those whose voices are silenced what more evidence do you need now will you act decisively to prevent genocide and to ensure respect for international humanitarian law or will you say instead that we did all we could mr president this degradation of international law is corrosive and infectious it is undermining decades of progress on rules to protect civilians from inhumity and the violent and lawless among us who use who act with impunity humanity the law and reason must prevail this council must prevail demand this ends stop arming it insist on accountability to the Israeli authorities stop killing and injuring civilians lift this brutal blockade let humanitarians save lives to Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups release all hostages immediately and unconditionally stop putting civilians at risk during military operations and for those who will not survive what we fear is coming in plain sight it will be no consolation to know that future generations will hold us in this chamber to account but they will and if we have not seriously done all we could then we should fear that judgment" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="one sure sign that the narrative the tide is turning on Israel's war on Gaza when a former Israeli prime minister describes the war as genocidal enough is enough medics getting the story out the doctors and nurses filling in the vacuum in the news coverage and taking a look under the hood of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the agenda never has been to provide humanitarian aid to the Palestinians an organization that does not do what its name implies more than 600 days into its horrific war on Palestinians in Gaza even Israel's most loyal allies from foreign governments to news organizations have been forced to confront reality from Berlin to London Paris to Ottawa support for Israel is turning into disapproval verging on condemnation over the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in the strip starving Palestinians have been lining up for food aid supplied by an organization that is the brainchild of the American and Israeli governments and looks more like a PR exercise than a humanitarian response the external political pressure along with rising dissent within Israel over the Netanyahu government's waging of this war is having an effect on the media narrative there and fracturing a consensus that goes all the way back to October 7th 2023 try as the Israelis might it will take more than a trickle of humanitarian aid to silence their critics more than propaganda to hide the war crimes it is committing when they talk about Israel and its genocidal ways in Gaza European politicians choose their words carefully particularly German ones like the chancellor Friedrich who went on the state funded broadcaster where he said finally and more than once that Israel has gone too far we have been hearing more and more international criticism germany's is probably the most significant one because of the historical baggage that guilt of the Holocaust that brought Germany to just accept and support whatever crime Israel has been committing so the fact that even Germany can no longer whitewash Israel's crime is extremely significant at the same time the foreign minister said &quot;But you know what we will not ban the weapons to Israel we reject an arms embargo so the European government is saying &quot;We condemn a killing spree but we will give the killer a sharper knife.&quot; Telling Israel &quot;What you're doing is morally wrong and might lead to negative consequences but we're not going to implement those consequences yet.&quot; With the European governments you can see stronger statements at the moment but statements basically bounce off Israel's iron dome of impunity from mers of all people it is truly too little too late and I await to see whether Palestinian solidarity activists students who have been calling out this genocide and facing brutal policing in some cases deportation i look forward to Meltz welcoming all those people back to Germany and telling them that they were right all along chancellor Meritz added Germany's name to a growing list of Western countries including France the UK and Canada that have criticized Israel over this war threatened it with sanctions but have not yet acted that effectively buys the Israelis time which they are using to keep punishing Palestinians cloaking their war crimes under the cover of organizations like the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the GHF after consistently blocking aid from getting into Gaza and attacking the agencies trying to help Palestinians including the UN's the Israelis teamed up with American military contractors mercenaries to create the GHF whose first foray into Gaza proved disastrous crowds of hungry Palestinians were herded like animals into an aid depot in Rafa humiliating scenes worthy of a concentration camp the crowd surged overwhelming those contractors shots were fired at least three Palestinians were killed the government media office in Gaza called it a deliberate massacre a full-fledged war crime committed against civilians suffering siege induced starvation people in Gaza are literally starving especially children because their bodies are not able to to withstand that that level of malnutrition even some of Israel's staunchest allies are now coming out to criticize Israel for its starvation campaign because this war has gone on for far too long we cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve it's not because they're having these big epiphies that that mass slaughter of Palestinians is wrong there's a great liberal centrist tradition of standing on the right side of history only when the relevant moment to do so has significantly passed we are seeing that grand liberal tradition be repeated now by Kama Emanuel Macron Mark Carney and other leaders who are only willing to condemn but indeed not stop Israel's activities at this point i think future proofing of reputation to say &quot;Oh but we did indeed speak up might very much be in play here.&quot; But those of us who have been paying any attention at all for the last year and a half plus are all too aware that these very governments have been funding and ideologically enabling uh Israel's actions throughout its war on Gaza Israeli officials from Benjamin Netanyahu on down have routinely dismissed allegations of war crimes as inherently anti-semitic the anti-semitic decision of the international court in the H is a modern driver that argument is more difficult to make now since more and more of those accusations are coming from Israelis including a former prime minister what is it if not a war crime ehood Ol first made that argument in a liberal Israeli paper Harets before repeating it on CNN golan a former army chief of staff turned opposition leader is another who has strayed from the path there have also been shifts in coverage in the Israeli media although limited and more common in the print sector than the broadcast side they are notable in that they reflect what is occurring politically almer is one of the earliest founders of Netanyahu's party Lioot so he's known left-wing pro Palestinian peace he's the guy that carried out one of Israel's most atrocious wars on Gaza Operation Gas so to see him now condemning what Israel is doing in Gaza as a war of annihilation as genocide it is extraordinary it speaks basically of how far Israel has gone this moment is ripe for the likes of Yer Golan and and other opposition figures in Israel because Netanyahu is facing increased pressure and leaders around the world will be happy to scapegoat Netanyahu as the perpetrator of this genocide in Gaza rather than face the reality that this was a genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian people by the state itself and so this moment presents an opportunity to put all the blame on Netanyahu both internally and internationally israel is now panicking realizing that their strategy of repeated atrocities to exhaust the global attention did not work that's why you had saying our propaganda is collapsing our legitimacy is over and you had Israel Hom saying the world is talking less about us and more about Gaza and their solution is not to end the genocide but to propagandize more to whitewash the genocide even more to double down on the failing strategy that didn't work without a doubt there are media outlets and journalists who are reassessing their position regarding this war and Wet is a good example they're showing more pictures of what's going on in Gaza speaking through the angle of starvation referring to it more and more overall however Israeli media coverage that allows for empathy for Palestinians remains the exception not the rule [Music] [Applause] 600 days into this war there have never been more lives at risk in Gaza where day after day GHF aid depots have produced nightmarish scenes of desperation and violence politicians overseas out to salvage their legacies could be enough to save some of those lives but as Israeli journalists well know there will be no saving of reputations on the Israeli airwaves the moral standing of news channels that too many citizens there still use as their primary source of information if you're only consuming Israeli media in Hebrew you will know less about what the Israeli army is doing in Gaza than probably any given citizen in the rest of the world the Israeli media has been a collaborator with this genocidal mindset and actually promoting it and by concealing the Holocaust of Gaza from the eyes of the Israeli public when the day comes that the criminals responsible for this genocide will stand on trial i think next to them on the bench the Israeli media should be located there's a reason that um experts in genocide studies and humanitarians are using terms like final solution for this stage of the genocide in Gaza we're seeing images of children burnt trapped in schools the reports we're hearing from the imperiled hospitals has prompted certain world leaders to speak up but that shouldn't lead any viewers to think that this is because there's been some sort of uh dramatic aberration by the Israeli military this is a continuation and an escalation in Gaza after so many many months of this kind of genocidal warfare throughout Israel's war on Gaza health care workers have become key voices in the reporting of this story and over the past couple of weeks the dispatches coming out of hospitals there have grown more and more desperate minakshi Ravi has been tracking this story gaza's health care system and the Palestinians who work in it have been systematically targeted by Israel for nearly 20 months now at least 94% of all hospitals in the strip have been damaged or destroyed more than 1,400 healthcare workers have been killed with thousands of doctors and nurses arrested the few who have made it out of prison say their Israeli captives reserved specific brutal torture for medics international doctors who have traveled in with aid groups now say their mission goes beyond medicine the main thing is to come here to bear witness because you're not seeing what I'm seeing because there's been a complete block to all media i am getting very sick and tired of having as as are all my colleagues of having to go onto the the news programs because journalists aren't allowed in etc to to point out what is happening here physicians returning from Gaza have also been outspoken on how dire the situation there has become the starvation the particular nature of the burns and injuries they are seeing and the targeting of Palestinian medics people need to understand that civilians their families uh healthare workers are are being intentionally and deliberately killed and I just want to say that the IDF have said in their statement regarding this uh attack in Kunis they've said that the IDF evacuated civilians from this area you don't ask the perpetrator of of of genocide we have to Dr hassan we have to ask the Israeli government if you also in addition to that response mentioned that Amn A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A amnesty international doctors without borders human rights watch the international court of justice would all beg to differ this past week American trauma surgeon Dr firo Sidwa delivered testimony to the United Nations Security Council i'm not here as a policy maker or a politician i am a physician bearing witness to the deliberate destruction of a health care system the targeting of my own colleagues and the eraser of a people these doctors are not isolated voices they have formed a network of sorts a valuable one to fill the void in reporting on this story caused by Israel's refusal to let journalists into Gaza and its killing of so many Palestinian reporters more than 200 of them thanks Mina in our lead story we touched on the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the GHF formed just months ago it is an American Israeli coalition that includes ex CIA and military personnel it is a shadowy group that started distributing aid in the southern end of the strip this past week there is not a single international aid organization that has endorsed or cooperated with the GHF instead from the UN to Oxfam to Medsan Frontier warnings have been issued that the GHF is militarized privatized and politicized an exercise in quote aidwashing when a pretense of aid is designed to cover up something else entirely one of the news outlets tracking the GHF closely with reporting from Palestinian journalists in Gaza is Drop Site News its co-founder Jeremy Scill joins us now jeremy let's start with the name of this organization now handling aid in the war zone the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the GHF out to do what its name implies not in any way shape or form i mean f first of all let's just get one basic fact straight the amount of so-called aid that it's distributing is is a pittance relative to what is needed in these starvation conditions in Gaza that are being enforced as an act of war by the USbacked Israeli regime it's incredibly cynical to use the term humanitarian in this name because Netanyahu himself has been very clear that this is a scam a scheme that is intended to kind of quiet some of the criticism that Netanyahu has received primarily from Republican senators who have said &quot;We don't like the appearance of starvation in Gaza so if you can create the facade that you're actually doing something then we're going to make sure that the weapons keep flowing and our support for your war of annihilation continues i mean Richard you couldn't get uh a a sort of uh starker symbol of what the agenda is here that you have a circumvention of an existing program that was effective that you have American mercenaries deployed on the ground that you have Israelis opening fire at desperate starving Palestinians and that it's all actually out in the open that the intent of this is to be uh just sort of a facade of humanitarianism to enable a genocide the GHF's aid distribution got off to a bad start this week the images that have come out of this the Palestinians in those caged pens lining up for food when you looked at those images what went through your mind well look I've been speaking to sources on the ground we have reporters inside of Gaza and my understanding is that there was almost no coordination whatsoever with uh local aid organizations to even inform people where they would be able to go to pick up these parcels or what would be inside of the parcels people just heard through text message WhatsApp word of mouth there's going to be aid dropped in this location and so because the population is starving and you have acute malnutrition among thousands of children people started to trek through incredibly dangerous terrain and they arrive at these sites and and it was very chaotic in some cases they were using biometric identification systems or interrogating people in others they forced or almost like cattle Palestinians into barbed wire fencing apparatus um on the first day that they started getting uh this aid distribution underway um we heard from sources inside of Gaza that a man had been kidnapped when he was interrogated by Israeli intelligence they got his family on the phone they were supposedly looking for some relative that the family hadn't been in touch with uh since the start of the war and when he didn't provide information that they were demanding from him they disappeared him that family has no idea where he is we've heard of at least a dozen or so more uh other people that were snatched when they went to go and get aid also the Israelis uh opened fire at one point they say that it was warning shots um but Palestinians were killed you know Israelis compare Palestinians to animals and this is part of what the plan is they want to essentially bait them into a cage shut the door behind them and then they either get killed in this killing cage or the ultimate plan which they call Trump's plan is to take that cage filled with Palestinians of Gaza and ship them to another country what we are witnessing here right now is is a a completely disgusting trap that Palestinians are being forced to as part of what Netanyahu has described as the final stage of his war to conquer Gaza now its backers say that the GHF is specifically designed to bypass the UN its relief agency ENROA why do the Israelis and the Americans involved in this say that that's even necessary the bypassing of established tried and tested systems of aid distribution richard it's because the the agenda never has been to provide humanitarian aid to the Palestinians um UNRA was established uh around the same time as the state of Israel was imposed on Palestine and and the reason that Israel has always stood against UNRA is because it is perhaps the most powerful symbol that uh that makes it clear that Palestinians have a right of return to their land have a right of return to their homes what we saw from the the the the moments after the October 7th operations happened inside of Israel was a very intense campaign to try to demonize the United Nations as a whole but UNRA specifically and the Israelis began planting stories that said that scores of UNRA employees had participated in the October 7th attacks and perhaps the the chief launderer of this narrative in the media was the Wall Street Journal and those stories were actually published with a by line uh of one of the reporters who herself was a uh a former IDF soldier and they they essentially portrayed UNRA as a Hamas front organization the United States and other countries responded to this propaganda and they admitted that they didn't even do their own independent review by moving swiftly to try to defund UNRA when the United States and major US media outlets began serving as conveyor belts for the lies of Israel about UNRA this was a devastating uh series of events and UNRA has been fighting for its life and so by creating an alternative pathway that circumvents international bodies that essentially seeks to to disintegrate UNRA what Israel is doing is saying &quot;We want to always be in control of the calorie intake of Palestinians we want to be able to shut off the water we want to be able to shut off the food we want to be able to block the medicine.&quot; The intent of this is to create the appearance of some alternative that would be viable to UNRA while at the same time ensuring full spectrum domination of Israel over the lives of Palestinians in Gaza you and Dropsite have done extensive reporting on the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation how difficult has it been to do that how transparent is this organization what kind of challenges are you facing in trying to tell this story you know as someone who's done a lot of reporting on mercenary organizations um and CIA front organizations it looked like what we would call a cutout that it's not actually intended to be what the public is being told but that it was set up for an alternative purpose sometimes intelligence agencies or governments set up fake companies uh to try to cover their employees as they do espionage other times they try to set up a company that has some legitimate front to it but the agenda is different i think we can safely say that the fact that there's very little information that's been released that we know the connections to both Israeli and American intelligence that this was intended to be a cutout uh that would serve the purpose of uh allowing Netanyahu to continue his war of annihilation while claiming that they're actually giving aid to people um in Gaza but Israel has been very effective with its propaganda in part because of its allies in the Western media particularly American and British news organizations that have promoted these lies or have not pushed back hard enough in demanding evidence so you know at some point uh all of these governments and officials are going to come out and pretend like they were always against the genocide we're seeing more and more media outlets coming out and taking that position we're seeing more and more academics and scholars taking that position you're seeing former Biden administration officials taking that position well history is full of people who want to be right uh through hindsight courage means speaking out in real time and so this should serve as a very serious lesson for journalists and governments when it comes to Israel you cannot ever believe the first draft of what they say you know Ronald Reagan used to say trust but verify in the case of Israel you have to assume it is lying and then check the facts jeremy Scill Drop Site News always great to have you on the show thanks again for speaking with us

          <attvalue for="7" value="this was the scene on Tuesday afternoon at the displacement area of El Moasi Rafa tens of thousands of starved Palestinians throng to the place where the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had set up food distribution points we were made to queue inside fence lanes 1 m wide and 20 to 30 m long each after an hour and a half my turn came and I was handed a box but people were hungry and jumped over the fence to get the food israeli soldiers fired shots in the air the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation or GHF was created with backing from the US and Israeli governments to replace traditional UN aid agencies israel accuses Hamas of stealing the aid from civilians and says the new distribution model is meant to prevent that but UN agencies are critical and have refused to work with the new organization we do not participate in this modality uh for for the reasons uh that we have u given um it is a distraction from what is actually needed recent imagery verified by Al Jazzer shows how Israel made sure that three of the four distribution centers were set up near Araf in southern Gaza and only one towards central Gaza but none in the north alazer has also obtained images showing the inhumane manner people were squeezed into tiny spaces while queuing for aid the motive behind the plan according to critics is to force people in northern Gaza to move south to obtain food but once south they may never be allowed to return to the north they say Israel is weaponizing hunger and using humanitarian aid to facilitate the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians the hunger streak in Gazms say they have no choice we found people gathering flour off the ground so we went to this place and found humanitarian aid being distributed the distributing entity did not ask for identification or anything they just asked for citizens to take the boxes it's been over 88 days since the crossings were closed and we are suffering from severe famine on Sunday the executive director of the controversial USIsraeli agency resigned saying the mission couldn't adhere to humanitarian principles but despite international opposition and the chaos it has already created on the ground there is no indication Israel is about to abandon its plan muhammad Val also zooms outside in central Gaza's largest hospital in Dala tar there's very little water or electricity in Gaza even if people were able to get supplies how does that affect how much they're able to use well Rob even when people here managed to get their hands on humanitarian supplies the lack of water and electricity in fact turn these supplies into limited use items if not completely unusable altogether uh let me just give you a sense of what that means here on the ground it's very impossible to cook any dry food uh in Gaza including lentils rice or uh even pasta without having uh water and if you had water you would need also electricity or fuel source which have been both completely cut off entirely from Gaza and people started recently to resort to completely burning scrap wood or plastic in order to make fire and this has been completely very dangerous and unsustainable so it's not just about bringing aid to the Gaza Strip but what might come next i mean here the uh numbers of atrox that were sent to the Gaza Strip over the course of the past week remain nowhere close enough to meet the very widescale uh starvation here in Gaza and basically the Israeli systematic military acts on the ground that include the uh destruction of civilian infrastructure all kinds of electricity networks in Gaza and the systematic ban of water flow to the territory also adding layers and layers of complications regarding how aid will be used in Gaza because families have run out of all cooking gas and recently they started to walk for long distance in order to get one meal per day and at the same time they started to rely on the sole disselination water plant in Gaza that currently is operating uh uh by the uh solar panels after the Israeli latest decision to cut off the soul electricity the line that is feeding the entire diesel ship plant there so Gaza is still in Gaza with a very soaring humanitarian crisis and families on the ground still navigating unthinkable circumstances in order to survive the next day tar not only are they facing a humanitarian crisis of course the Israeli attacks are continuing there have been more of them in the last 24 hours just talk us through what the latest attacks have been well Gaza is still a very active war zone and Israel is mobilizing more troops in order to operate in multiple fronts in Gaza and over the past 12 hours we have seen a cleur strikes that had concentrated on targeting residential houses one of the deadliest was in Asawi neighborhood when a multiplestory building was completely flattened nine civilians according to medical reports were killed and 15 others were reported injured civil defense members are reporting horrific tales of how they managed to recover casualties from underneath the ruffle there as the escalation is continuing elsewhere especially in Der Balah where we are as the Israeli military targeted another residential house is not too far from our broadcast point here as six Palestinians were killed in the strike and there were earlier more today from the courtyard of Al Axa Hospital Ahmed a very uh chaotic and even uh desperate scenes of families being completely and physically broken following the uh following the loss of their loved ones and they have been wondering about whether this world will come to an end but the severity of the military acts on the ground and the ongoing escalation give a clear indication that there is no end in sight for this ongoing war as the humanitarian toll continues to mount day in day out d thank you very much indeed d A Zoom there talking to us from Adair Albala make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from

Defense and Mossad into the Gaza Humanitarian Aid Foundation the prime minister denies it but is Israel financially profiting from and deliberately creating more deadly chaos in Gaza i'm Andrea Seni and this is the Newsmakers [Music] when Israel banned ENRA's crucial humanitarian work in the Gaza Strip it claimed other NOS's could replace it but didn't quite specify which eventually the newly created Gaza Humanitarian Foundation took over operations it's backed by a private US company and partly based in Switzerland where it's often tough to discern exactly where funding is coming from the GHF's opacity and abysmal performance have led to a number of resignations and ultimately the suspension of desperately needed aid so who and what is really behind this organization here's a look june 5th NASA Day an annual commemoration the day of the setback marking Palestinian displacement after Israel's 1967 victory in the 6-day war now catastrophic setbacks are hampering the delivery of food destined for the besieged enclave israeli opposition leader Ya Laid as far back as the start of May questioning the origins of funding for the new Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the cabinet approved the expansion of the operation in the Gaza Strip last night no one yet knows what the actual war plan is or what the words conquest of the strip really mean but there is one thing we do know this war is costing a great deal of money the question is who is paying for it enra the UN body traditionally responsible for delivering supplies to Palestine is no longer permitted to do so the Israeli government banned it claiming it had been infiltrated by Hamas and thefts of supplies were being used to prolong the war the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation an umbrella name for a private organization has taken over the task this direct aid to the population in Gaza bypassing Kamas is already changing the situation on the ground providing food directly to those civilians in need breaking Kamas hold over the population and has the potential to seriously harm the terrorists and the and to shorten the war but increasing questions of the source of money have grown into even larger concerns about whether the entire GHF is designed to fail on purpose it's been widely criticized by professional humanitarians because of its limited reach because of the limited nature of the supplies that it is going to provide now senior opposition politicians have alleged in Israeli news publications that the Israeli government even Mossad itself may be among the biggest financial backers of the private fund the GHF's mode of sending aid only to a small number of aid hubs within the territory forcing Gardens to travel long distances has also been criticized as ineffective as you can see all that's left here are body parts israeli forces tell people to move to so-called safe zones but the reality is there are no safe places shots fired by Israeli soldiers towards crowds in Gaza in recent days people desperate for food and medicine gazans say that the rush was because people were starving and wanted food for their children israel denied shooting into the crowds merely above their heads to control the crowds and just last week the American head of one of the foundations involved in helping create the GHF stepped down leading to sources claiming that the foundation would struggle without them in the last 24 hours Israel has suspended the GHF's operations june the 5th is Knax Day and history often repeats and rhymes is the private organization tasked with delivering supplies to gardens a serious attempt at private management of a humanitarian cause or a shadowy Israelibbacked organization designed to cause engineered scarcity a setback on the road to war's end yet again for Gaza so is the chaos of GHF's aid delivery by design and who is actually funding it well joining me now to discuss that and more are from Exit in the UK journalist Jhan Alfara from London research associate at SOASS University and author of an army like no other how the Israel Defense Forces Made a Nation Khim Rashid and from Washington visiting scholar at Georgetown University Center for Contemporary Arab Studies and author of Blind Spot America and the Palestinians from Bour to Trump Khaled Elgindi thanks all so much for being with me him I'll begin with you what is the government of Benjamin Netanyahu doing here and how cynical should the world actually be about how Israel is managing aid in Gaza now after banning ENRA well let's be practical about it the Israelis have never said anything that proved correct every single time that they um release a message to um the media it's a pack of lies so this is also a pack of lies this is not about feeding the gazans this is about reducing the pressure uh on the US and the west um when uh people all over the world are so angry about what they see happening in Gaza so um they have created a company uh in a number of countries uh by the Mossad the MSAD has created a company and is financing it uh and this was actually told us by Israeli politicians of the opposition uh they are not better than Netanyahu because they say Netanyahu is feeding the Palestinians uh with our money he should not do this and he should continue the war so in a sense um both the opposition and the government in Israel are about destruction are about genocide are about getting the Palestinians out of Palestine and first out of Gaza um and they use every lie that they can um and this system this this system is terrible as we can see yeah you were you were alluding to I mean mainly Avidor Lieberman member of the Knesset who's who's been trying to kind of spin this against Netanyahu by saying Israeli taxpayer shekels are paying to feed Gazins but when you say that that Mossad is behind uh this operation to what end is Mossad actually financing this it's it's not to make lives better is it does it make any any life better i mean basically more than 150 Palestinian were already killed probably more than that um waiting for to get food uh people who are um unable to walk great distances and and wait in the sun are not even able to get there most gazins will not be fed by this this is a PR exercise by Netanyahu to show that um this is not a starvation um campaign but it is a starvation campaign it is part of the genocide uh so um both the opposition and the government are just as nasty and just as responsible uh for what we are seeing okay i guess they can try to argue though oh that you know what it's well-meaning we're trying to provide age it's We're trying to provide aid we're trying to feed starving people but the logistics are incredibly complicated now you have these massive crowds uh that can't be managed people are storming uh the the distribution sites so they mean well they're trying to take the place of Anra but it's just logistically very difficult well ANRA and the UN said all the time that this is what will happen everyone every expert said this will be a killing machine um at the uh at the food aid um distribution and and now we see it happen um we were warned UN warned Israel uh that they shouldn't do it and they did it because that's what they want to do they want to create chaos yeah jan I mean do you believe that there is any intention at all via the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to help Gazins absolutely not um your guest just said that it was a PR campaign and that it is uh a way to reduce pressure on Israel and while I agree completely I think it's it's even more cynical than that it is actually being used as a lever to reshape Gaza's demography in general by force and it is a way to actually further their goals and to complete this genocide this new aid mechanism uh potentially involving Mossad uh which is entirely plausible is not just flawed it's actually dangerous it fundamentally violates the core humanitarian principles of neutrality um and uh and you know Smutz uh Smatri in his uh latest speech actually laid it bare you know uh he said that these aid corridors are not humanitarian at all they are strategic tools to ethnically cleanse Gaza by engineering displacement you know if you are creating aid dependency and only allowing aid to be controlled in specific strategic locations in the south so it's not even entire uh across Gaza uh while uh destroying homes you know refusing the return of people to their homes and now planning uh for the transfer of these people that get eventually concentrated in the south to third countries it's it's not aid it's it's an expulsion plan dressed in humanitarian language frankly and Israel has already set up an official body actually a directorate the directorate for the voluntary immigration uh of Gaza residents as they called it they don't they don't hide their intentions the question is will the world let them carry on uh with this genocide and empty Gaza out and and even the people of Gaza they don't see this as a they see it as another layer of domination and of control m Khaled you are in the United States part of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is is run by a somewhat shady at best I guess US company so try to explain if you can who in the United States is actually gaining from this what is the US gaining from this is it is it just an effort to undermine Hamas or is there something more cynical at play involved well I I agree with everything that both uh Haim and Jihan just said this is not about uh this is not well-meaning i think it's pretty clear israel's record in Gaza and frankly anywhere uh is has been pretty clear there is a you know in the words of most human rights organizations Israel has shown a blatant total disregard for civilian life um it cannot it's just strains credul to believe that after 19 months of destroying all of the sources of life uh all of the institutions and infrastructure uh that sustain life uh in Gaza um that now they're interested in in helping the the civilian population in Gaza um it is not about that it is about as Jihan said it is about facilitating their broader aims which is to move the population what remains of the population in the northern part uh to the south uh and eventually we can expect uh to to points outside of Gaza this is uh clearly a weaponization of aid in the same way that Israel has weaponized starvation um and uh if this were about uh uh the well-being of human beings well there are existing institutions and networks that have done quite a an amazing job of delivering humanitarian assistance all we have to do is look at the the uh the the weeks uh in which the first phase of the ceasefire plan um in uh in February and March until March 18th uh in which there were up to 600 trucks arriving a day uh and and there was no one going hungry during those weeks why the United States uh is backing this has to do with with Israel um the Trump administration like the Biden administration defers heavily to Israel israel's preferences uh are the most important consideration and so if Israel says they don't want Anoa or other UN or international agencies to operate uh then the United States uh reflexively goes along with that he let me come back to you though because you know the original foundation chief here Jake Wood was his name he resigned in May just after the the organization was actually founded then the Boston Consultant the Boston Consulting Group actually pulled its participation then you have Swiss diplomats dozens of them complaining about the Geneva branch of the GHF being non-compliant so as a writer yourself I mean do you expect all this to kind of unravel and eventually expose something even far more sinister than than what's been exposed so far it is already unraveling we don't need to wait it it is um um we can see that this is something set up by the Israeli Mossad to actually undermine the um UN ANRA and the Palestinian um um and and the Hamas and the Palestinian Authority because what happens here is first of all you can see on the screen u all the food is supplied by Israeli suppliers so this is a way of giving them some work and money um the money goes from Israel to Israel you know um the other thing is um that um the person John Moore um the evangelical Christian who is now the new um leader of U G GHF uh is um someone uh who is been a um a soldier for hire um for many years with links to the contraair this is all u a mafia um operation uh in order to um undermine the UN and as suppliers uh and to um make sure that they cannot supply there are thousands of uh lorries waiting to deliver food to everyone in Gaza and Israel will not allow it because uh as Jian said they want the um the concentration camp with biometrics that they have built in four areas of Gaza as part of removing the Palestinians from Gaza this is all about ethnic cleansing and and and about uh continuing the genocide uh it's not going to help anyone uh people some people the minority in Gaza will get food once or twice u people will know not get any food because they cannot get the whole way and wait because they are old they are ill uh they are babies you know this is really a way of decimating Gaza okay okay i' I'd like to speak uh further in just a minute about the the biometrics the iris scans that that you mentioned there but but Jana let me come back to you because if you can I mean tell us how this total failure of aid distribution now and all the corruption and you know to hear him describe it time again now as a mafia organization all of that how does it feed into your history as a Palestinian and correspond with you know today marking Naka Day yeah uh I mean look Nexa Day isn't just something that Palestinians commemorate on a day or another it's something that they continue to endure it's really the daily reality and what we're witnessing in Gaza today it's the sequel shall we say the the force displacement the military control the denial of very basic rights it's the same story just uh different tactics and when you know when Israeli officials like Smotri uh openly speak of um pushing Gazans out of their homeland and when uh these aid corridors double up as tools to force people further south uh then it is the NAKa and the Nakba all over again it's just now it comes with rebranded language it comes with 2,000 uh pound bombs and it is live streamed for the whole world to witness um from behind their phone screens yeah it's I don't have words anymore because the depths of the the destruction of of everything we've seen here is just it's now so far beyond description but Khaled now as as Kim mentioned Israel is looking at the use of biometrics those those iris scans we've heard about to to check those receiving aid what kind of door does that open here once that that technology is introduced well it's it's extremely dangerous uh we've already seen instances uh I think on the very first day u in addition to people being killed there were people who were abducted and disappeared uh people who were waiting in line uh for uh to receive their uh meager rations and uh they are clearly you know they are as part of the process they're inquiring about certain family members uh other members of their household uh of people who uh who are waiting in line um and trying to leverage that to to use the the the food distribution as intelligence gathering um and of course when you have a massive biometric surveillance operation in place that is tracking the movements of of every man woman and child uh in Gaza um that is not for the safety of those individuals uh or even uh Israel's security that is for control and that is uh ultimately for uh I believe disposing of of the population and and I think it's pretty clear and and frankly it's not even just you know fanatics like Smatri uh and Ben Prime Minister Netanyahu is saying it openly that there will not be a ceasefire uh until the world agrees uh to the Trump plan the Trump plan being the removal of the entire population of Gaza so he says it openly um they don't hide it anymore and and I believe this uh very cynical food distribution is is in furtherance of that uh ultimate objective yeah him you know the uh government spokesperson David Menser very articulately frighteningly articulately explained why uh Israeli security forces shot at crowds that were heading to a distribution center for for those meager rations you talked about he said that there were you know people remind us all among among these giant crowds of hungry people that were deviating from the crowd and then moving kind of toward Israeli troops and that they were warned to back off from these distribution sites but they did not and then here the Israeli troops had to fire in self-defense how is that playing out in Israel itself is is it still being bought as the narrative that every killing of a Gazin civilian is somehow in self-defense i think that uh less and less people in Israel believe this but unfortunately uh the Western media buys into this and and gulps it um as uh as truth um we've he we've heard him this is the official liar of the Israeli government um and he had been lying for 19 months and he continues to do that and they still invite him to speak and actually some of the people who interview him tell him that he's lying but he continues to lie uh this is about breaking the Palestinian people breaking their bodies breaking their morale uh making them um easier to export as packages uh to other countries uh other countries that didn't come and and offer it either so uh this is about continuing the Naka and the Nakba in uh a different more nasty way uh when uh yesterday in this interview of Mercer um he was asked um about the shooting uh and uh did these people that uh advanced towards the soldiers as he said um were they armed he didn't answer of course they none of none of the people we see on the screen are armed these are uh you know people that are trying to find food um they don't uh actually um fight um Hamas they fight the whole of Palestine which they want to empty not just Gaza but the rest of Palestine everyone understands it apart from the Western media you know Jan most aid workers in the region complained I mean dating years back now that these were almost impossible conditions to work in to try and get aid fairly to Gazins even when it was only described as you know an open air prison even before the October September 7th attacks but now you have countless people in need they are starving so how can any logistical operation even go smoothly enough to save the number of lives that need help right now is there a way do you believe do you have hope that there is a way to conduct such a logistical operation and that gazins can be saved if conditions were to change i think we do need to support a return to principled civilian humanitarian leadership un has done this really well un agencies there are many NOS's uh that used to do this um but more importantly we really do need to deal with the root cause the siege the occupation the repeated dehumanization of Palestinians because even before this you know this blockade of the past few months um I mean it makes you wonder like 80 and you know a year and a half of bombing Palestinians of children being obliterated to pieces was something that the world was able to tolerate but now suddenly after a few months of blockade of people going hungry the world is kind of shifting it's kind of saying this is a red line so bombing people and destroying their homes destroying the infrastructure destroying schools houses universities everything is being obliterated everything is being destroyed in the Gaza Strip that is all tolerated but now that people are hungry and we need to bring aid in that's the the the final red line i I Yeah I'm so sorry to interrupt

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] this is what Gaza looks like after more than a year of Israeli bombardment in 15 months this densely populated strip of land has been totally devastated the UN says more than 2/3 of all the buildings in Gaza have been damaged or [Music] destroyed the scale of Destruction is almost incomprehensible there's nothing really prepares you for what you see a landscape that uh really was evocative of images of Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the atomic bombs had dropped the sheer Devastation is such that that most people simply cannot conceive that this has been allowed to happen there was just Rubble in every direction as far as you could see uh complete devastation it is the most barbaric dystopian situation that I have ever seen in my life all days all nights you live in fear you move in fear you sleep in fear you wake up in fear you are not sure that you will be safe in the coming uh few minutes uh every morning when we meet everybody we say thanks God you are still alive in summer 2023 I came here to make a film asking if Israel was using water as a weapon in Palestine I had no idea these images would become one of the last records of a place that's been decimated beyond recognition we're sitting on a Titanic ship everyone is going to hit the iceberg this war didn't spare anything in the city didn't spare a building it didn't spare a tree it didn't spare a person the destruction uh was for all sources all aspects of life [Music] [Music] after 15 months of bombs drone attacks and a ground Invasion killing more than 60,000 people a fragile ceasefire has come into Force and the tens of thousands of gazin who had been trapped for months in the south of the strip can finally return to their homes as they emerge from their shelters and head north to see what remains of their old lives our team in Gaza went to search for the people who shared their daily struggle with us just a few weeks before the war started [Music] among the thousands of people walking North is farmer Muhammad Cel he abandoned his family farm in B laa more than a year ago when staying became too dangerous today he returns to see what remains of the home he once knew the reality hits him there's almost nothing left when we met him in 2023 times were hard and water was scarce but his farm was getting by growing fruits and vegetables to sell at the local market that's all gone now fore most of gaza's Farmland has been destroyed by the Israeli bombardment the once fertile region of B lahia in gaza's North is now a Barren desert south of Gaza City is zun the Olive District famous for its Olive crops now now almost completely destroyed the Orchards and Farms of can Yunis once again decimated by Israeli forces unable to produce their own food garans are now almost completely dependent on the food trucked in by Aid organizations and safe water is even harder to come by Gaza until before the war 40% of the population were receiving uh high quality of water after more than 15 years of the Israeli blockade the water situation was already critical and when Israel started its full-on war in Gaza following the Hamas attacks on October 7th 2023 it quickly got much worse signs pointing to war crimes and genocide started to emerge including water war crimes is Amnesty International concludes that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza to deprive the population of Gaza of access to water amount to acts of genocide taking for survival in the Gaza Strip we saw Israeli leaders saying in public we will cut off water we will cut off other essential supplies to the population this was to the whole population it wasn't targeting the military combatants of Hamas it was cutting off water for everyone in Gaza the Israeli even beside uh targeting building streets and killing people they were using uh uh the water as an additional uh an additional weapon against the Palestinians the more it went on the more that appeared to be deliberate like this Israeli soldiers filmed themselves blowing up a water facility in Rafa and posted it on social media and this the aftermath of an attack on civilians waiting in line at a water filling station in the alhatti refugee camp [Music] 10 people were killed rights groups say this is clear evidence of genocide so genocide is the intent to destroy and holler in part a population it does not limit just to killings or similar acts it can also be the creation of condition of life that can make living impossible Israel rejects all accusations of war crimes and genocide in Gaza prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu who alongside his former Defense Minister yav galand is wanted by the international criminal court says the claims are false and outrageous when we visited gaza's water Distribution Center in 2023 this man rationed the water supply to different neighborhoods by spinning these wheels since then the situation has gone from inadequate to desperate this facility has been completely destroyed the new pipelines installed by the International Community are now a ruin of Twisted Metal and rubble and all the households who received water through these pipes are cut off more than 80% of water networks have been totally destroyed uh 300 30,000 of meters of water networks have been totally demolished as well more than 600,000 M of sea networks have been also uh demolished destroying Water Supplies attacking water workers um preventing the Reconstruction of um Water Supplies this all adds up to the evidence showing this was a deliberate policy a deliberate policy to deprive the population of essential water they are war crimes because they targeting facilities essential to the population to the surviv of the population but they're also a crime against humanity a crime whose impact will be felt long after the guns full silent there is no justification for a war crime war crimes are war crimes The Taking of hostages by Hamas is a war crime that does not justify Israel then committing 14 months of war crimes in Gaza in 2023 Muhammad Ahmed was selling water from a private company in Gaza City to residents of the Shati refugee camp back then the public water supply was only available for a few hours a day and it was mixed with seawater to boost Supply Gaza residents spent around a third of their income on water paying people like Muhammad to fill the tanks in their houses after the ceasefire we tried to contact him for some time without success the shy refugee camp where he lives was hit by multiple air strikes and there is evidence Israeli forces have been actively targeting water workers with phone service often cut off our our team went to look for him in the camp and were relieved to find him alive and well his truck was bombed by an Israeli drone but he's still delivering water to his customers as gaza's water system was left in ruins the Taps dried up and it was up to people like Muhammad to step in with no running water today these trucks are the only way to get water in Gaza so we were transferred into a very primary way of of uh providing service by tankering water so we were obliged only to use water tankers in order to transport and dispute uh water to the displaced people 59% of casualties in Gaza are women children and elderly population so these aren't combatants and to read reports then if women who are mixing contaminated water with formula simply to try to feed their babies that these women unable to feed their children themselves doing everything they can and they're then risking the lives of their babies at that point Sorry in extended War children are around three times more more likely to die from diseases caused by unsafe water than from direct violence in 2024 studies showed that 90% of gaza's children under five were suffering from an infectious disease 70% of children were found to have diarrhea compared to just 3.4% in 2022 while 40,000 cases of hepatitis were reported in 2024 compared to just 85 cases in in pre-war Gaza the destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure in hospitals and healthc Care Facilities has led to an unprecedented risk of infection and death it was highly dangerous and not safe for the doctors and other healthc care providers to deliver Healthcare Services due to the systematic you know destruction of healthcare facilities we have witness the killing of thousands of healthcare providers in addition to the deliberate Detention of other providers who have been detained and tortured till death Israel claims the hospitals were used for military purposes the UN reports 136 attacks on hospitals in the first 9 months of the war pushing gaza's healthc care system to the brink of total collapse and unable to cope with an explosion in water bone diseases you know the water it's the essence of life and it's not that there is no life without water we have seen hundreds of thousands of cases diagnosed with infectious disease like diarrhea like gasis like gastroenteritis like JIS for example and those people they were mainly children and you know vulnerable population today people in Gaza are living off as little as 2 L of water per day seven times less than the minimum required by the World Health Organization and every day they have to spend hours trying to find it many families delegate the task to their children finding a water source and waiting in line is just the first step carrying these cans is heavy work for small hands some use makeshift trolleys to lighten the load but much of this water is contaminated and unsafe every sip carries the risk of illness or even death yet there is no alternative the water in Gaza has been horrifically bad for a very long time very high levels of contamination very high levels of salination that situ situation has only deteriorated precipitously we're never going to know the scale of this what are we going to see for the next years for these children the amputees growing up without hydration without food and without medical care the death and the disease and the impacts we're going to see for Generations as they are finally able to return to their homes Garin face a difficult question what do you do when your entire life your home everything you knew before has been utterly destroyed the answer for many Garin is we endure at Gaza City's Market Traders are returning to their stalls resuming their old routines every Trader here has a story of their presence in the market is an act of resilience [Music] I meil has been working at the same stool for decades he now has to work his sewing machine by hand but he's still open for business [Music] gaza's fishing port is also trying to to come back to life back in 2023 this was a hub of economic activity one of the few ways to make a living under the Israeli Siege every morning scores of boats would head out to sea in search of a good catch being careful not to go too far from the shore or they'd be fired upon by Israel's Naval [Music] blockade after heavy bombardment the port is now deserted the fishermen we met in 2023 are nowhere to be seen But others are returning to the only life they [Music] knew the few lucky ones whose boats are intact are coming back with their catch this fisherman whose boat was destroyed has learned to improvise with a makeshift raft for [Music] in 2021 Gaza produced around 4,700 tons of fish since October 7th many fishermen have been unable to access the sea While others risk their lives to bring in food he the once thriving Fish Market here is now deserted and these fishermen who used to play a vital role in feeding Gaza are now barely able to find food and water for themselves 15 months of Israeli attacks have almost completely destroyed water power and Food Supplies but yet amid the ruins and the grief there are flickers of joy and the hope of people who refuse to surrender to despair farmer Muhammad khel water seller Muhammad Ahmed and fisherman Abu nafed wake each day to an unrelenting struggle but they are still driven by The Dream to rebuild their land [Music] with the ceasefire in effect Muhammad can do

          <attvalue for="7" value="the talk of a ceasefire in Gaza is it real or just political theater if it's the latter why do news organizations keep falling for it we get the Hamas perspective on the negotiations the pitfalls and the patterns ukraine Russia drone strikes on both sides of the border and peace talks there that have gone nowhere plus the logging off club young people checking out of social media for their own good it is a recurring pattern in the ceasefire negotiations the ones aimed at ending the carnage Israel continues to inflict on Palestinians in Gaza proposals surface hopes rise then the talks collapse and the responsibility for that along with the eyes of international news outlets all land in the same place on Hamas israel agreed Hamas rejected it is a framing that is so familiar it rarely gets questioned but behind that characterization lies a deeper imbalance and it goes beyond military power it's about the narrative one that casts the Palestinian side as irrational obstructive inherently violent while somehow portraying Israel even at its most brutal its most genocidal as credible reporting the story that way has a suffocating effect on what news consumers are looking for the truth and it happens over and over again international news organizations should have it figured out by now but it's not as though they're being played by Israeli propaganda it's more like they're playing along when ceasefire talks fail as they did in the latest round of negotiations involving Israel Hamas and the United States the question that news consumers want answered is a basic one why and there is a journalistic urge to assign blame point fingers hamas has rejected a US proposed ceasefire deal for the Middle East conflict now it's Hamas uh that has uh issues uh with the plan uh when examining the headlines coming out of the international media the sound bites produced in various news studios the answer couldn't be simpler there's multiple articles and headlines that speak of how Hamas failed in the negotiating table where Hamas's position and the Palestinian position more broadly is discarded and Israel's position is basically advanced and trying to always blame the victims blame the Palestinians for their own undoing this is this is a a a trajectory of a policy that has been uh going on since the outset of the war and continues on all major news media in the west specifically when in fact by Israel's own admission by the Israeli media's own admission it's Israel that has often torpedoed a lot of these processes to obstruct even coming close to something of a ceasefire agreement israeli media had themselves disclosed that is that Netanyahui himself had torpedoed nine different attempts where Hamas were asking for something as basic as handing all hostages over in exchange for just preventing a ground invasion but it has been very convenient for both the US and Israel to blame the resistance when things have gone wrong when Israel has tried to torpedo any process of serious talks hamas had image problems internationally long before October 7th 20123 often framed as a barbaric terrorist organization the resistance movement reinforced that reputation through the brutality of its attacks on Israeli civilians that day and Hamas's strategy of capturing those atrocities on video for the world to see that imagery also had an eradicating effect on the context of the larger story in Gaza decade after decade of Israel's illegal occupation more monstrous and often misleading labels were then attached to Hamas terms that are seldom applied to Israel and the genocide it is inflicting on Gaza war crimes on a scale that dwarfs what Hamas did on October 7th it is a moral disparity a colonial mentality that taints the international news coverage of the ceasefire negotiations including the most recent talks where the third party at the table was Israel's closest and most important ally the US in this latest round I think the fingerpointing was mostly on Hamas largely because of the spokespeople that we heard speaking to it steve Wickoff the main negotiator from the US who essentially framed it that way saying Israel agreed to this hamas said no and changed the terms it is true that Hamas said no to the deal because it was a deal that made more on Israel's terms than through a process that would lead to an end of the war hamas's demands within um these ceasefire agreements are not outside the remmits of international law the full withdrawal of Israeli forces allowing for the uninhibited entry of of aid into Gaza and a permanent sessation of hostilities yet for some reason Western media insists on presenting these as unreasonable illegitimate demands how this narrative has been able to persist as long as it has is completely unfathomable as a spokesperson for Hamas Basam Naim has appeared on multiple media outlets albeit less often than Israeli spokespeople do naim has been privy to the ceasefire negotiations including the latest round of talks involving the Trump administration and Steve Witoff although Hamas's side of the story is usually given less credence and less airtime than the Israeli version it is one that news consumers could use considerably more of especially those who depend on American and international media platforms to understand what is happening in Gaza witkoff certainly contributed to reinforcing this negative portrayal we spoke to him in the last round of these negotiations and agreed on a plan to end this war he said our talks were positive and constructive but when he spoke to the Israeli side he came back with another proposal saying it was the only one available so this is the second time or even third that Witoff agrees with us on something and then makes a U-turn this prejudice towards Hames and the Palestinians is reflected in the American and international media because his voice carries weight within Gaza Hamas has been out to control the narrative it has suppressed journalists at times and even abducted some the movement was voted into office in 2006 and polls taken since the October 7th attacks have persistently shown that only 20 to 30% of the population supports Hamas censorship is common however during times of war and Gaza is no exception so Palestinians expressing dissent and those reporting on it don't have it easy many people in Gaza are very reluctant to openly speak out against Hamas many said that October 7th whatever anyone thinks about a right to resistance that Hamas had not prepared the population for it they had no plan for how the population was going to be impacted but there's also a lot of musling within Gaza by Hamas of journalists critiquing Hamas for those who are outside there's an idea that uh criticizing Hamas is somehow counter to being in solidarity with Palestinians many people off the record will be very critical but are very hesitant to be on the record as criticizing uh Hamas at least while the war is still ongoing there's no free flow of information necessarily hamas did crack down on some of the journalists and pressured them sometimes through imprisonment these oppressions that happen against journalists which are a problem in their own right are overblown to actually legitimize the daily violence and massacres that are happening in the Gaza Strip we should not overblow these violations as a as a means to completely discredit Hamas or exclude it from the political space uh more broadly Hamas is far from the biggest threat to journalism in the Gaza Strip unlike the Israelis it has not banned the international media from entering the war zone to bear witness document a genocide nor has it targeted journalists the way Israeli forces have killing more than 200 of them one would think that the casualty figures alone the slaughtering of so many reporters would generate more empathy among Western journalists and the news outlets that provide their paychecks the fact that it doesn't is a story in itself another measure of what Palestinians in Gaza are up against there is an enormous global media machine that's run by the Americans and the Zionists they pump out large amounts of media material to lie distort and fabricate we keep trying to present our position but journalists don't really engage and even if they do our statements will be at the bottom of their report the mainstream media is not impartial on the contrary it's been directly involved in this war and the negotiations in favor of the Israeli enemy and since the beginning of the war the mainstream media have adopted the Israeli narrative even though it was false hamas is not under represented hamas is over represented but as a profane barbaric actor that is irrational completely out of the realm of human possibility this is the dominant representation of Hamas this goes to tell us that this mainstream western media is is completely complicit in the ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip backing the government's policies in their countries in the UK in the US in Canada and other places of complete backing and political cover for Israel as it conducts in the war therefore the media is basically reframing what is happening in negotiations in a way that serves the continuation of American UK European policy of diplomatic cover and of course of material support for this genocide that is going on in the Gaza Strip moving further east now where negotiations to end the war between Russia and Ukraine have also come up short an audacious Ukrainian drone attack on multiple Russian airfields has revived the spectre of a possible nuclear confrontation tarak Nafa has been tracking the messaging around this story as a second round of direct peace talks between Moscow and Kiev ended this week without a major breakthrough Ukraine's security service posted and heavily publicized footage of a huge drone attack on its neighbor called Operation Spiderweb the coordinated drone strikes took place deep inside Russian territory reportedly damaging or destroying more than 40 military aircraft including bombers capable of dropping nuclear weapons that provided Ukrainian officials with a shot in the arm for their war narrative domestically and globally news outlets in the country have been running wall-to-wall coverage of what they called an historic operation ai generated videos paying tribute to the head of Ukraine's security services Vasel Maluk have since gone viral he's being hailed as a national hero operation Spiderweb has also boosted President Vladimir Zilinsk's image in international news outlets which had taken a serious beating as his popularity in Ukraine has tanked over in Russia the muted media coverage of the drone attacks tells a story of its own initial reporting featured short official statements from regional officials who failed to explain how Ukraine was able to pull off such an extensive attack since then the story has vanished from Russian news broadcasts president Vladimir Putin hasn't directly addressed the drone strikes but did accuse Ukraine of terrorist acts putin made no mention of Russia's own drone attacks on Ukraine the largest of which took place last month including on civilian areas thanks TK there is a trend emerging in mobile phone and social media use it's about logging off the need to be offline and it's gaining popularity particularly among younger millennials and Gen Z after decades of increased connectivity and screen time more and more young people now acknowledge how harmful that can be social media platforms plead not guilty they argue they have safety measures built into their systems like content monitoring and screen time limiters some governments have even proposed restrictions on young people signing up to social media however to combat loneliness mental health pressures and what seems to be an inability to function IRL in real life a less top-down more community-based movement has sprung up people who meet put away their devices and commit to living offline even if it's just for a bit the listening posts Ryan Kohl's now on why so many young people are logging on to the logging off club gen Z has a problem their families know it their co-workers know it most of all they know it i'm sorry to have to tell you this but we think you might have brain rot when you're saying my brain is cooked it's cooking the touch grass challenge go outside and touch some grass like I'm doing right now go go go stop doom scrolling if you have an issue with doom scrolling listen up for a generation that was born into an internet enabled mobile phone connected world screen addiction is a serious problem tackling it has required reintegrating into the society that exists in real life and that's where the clubs come in so at Logging Off Club we host our events around three main themes connection curiosity and wellness those are three things that we lose out in today's digital age and on social media we've collaborated with a walking club a crochet club and then essentially we just bring people together ask them to leave their phones in a bucket with us and just get talking to each other and get involved in the activities usually people feel lighter when they hand out the phone as if some sort of responsibility or obligation was put away and I think that comes from that sense of hyperconivity but of course there's other people that have a more difficult time and might experience some anxiety at first so this is why we provide some gentle guidance and usually through time they all reach that joy of being offline we felt like we were living our lives on super speed never really taking the time to stand still reflect and be off of our phones and actually be present with ourselves but also with the people around us we always say we want to become the third space for people to come relax and also translate it into different ways of enjoying being offline a third space is an environment in which people meet each other in person they can be churches they could be cafes they could be shopping centers gyms swimming pools libraries is a big one as well one of the things that younger generations have probably recognized is that these spaces are less accessible sometimes they've been shut down sometimes uh they don't operate in ways that are necessarily conducive for social interaction and as a result the attempt to start third space adjacent groups logging off clubs running clubs and dinner clubs but the whole point is that they're trying to kind of create social experiences that older generations may have taken for granted around the world screen time is skyrocketing modern urban life is packed full of screens but the The most addictive one fits right in the palm of your hand the bright display the notifications your email messaging apps and fitness trackers all in one device and most alluringly the possibilities of endless scrolling on social media phone addiction affects people of all generations but it's a particular scourge for Gen Z it is eroded attention spans anxiety over body image has spiraled and loneliness has become something of an epidemic it's paradoxical because the social media platforms that a majority of experts blame for Gen Z's isolation make big claims of creating social connection while most other tech companies focus on how people interact with technology we focus on building technology so people can interact with each other snapchat was built to enhance relationships between friends family and the world without Tik Tok I personally would lose that sense of community that I found within the app increasingly governments are responding to this crisis starting in December this year Australia will be implementing a ban on social media for children under the age of 16 many other countries have similar legislation under consideration governments need to recognize that social media addiction and technology addiction is a real phenomena and they should treat it more like a public health issue they need to also recognize that social media platforms and technology interact with every aspect of our society they are utilities and in the same way that governments regulate water electricity other types of utilities we use dayto-day these types of social technologies should be considered to be regulated in a similar way i definitely understand where the policy of regulating the use of social media comes from however it is rather a more sustainable approach where we educate people and provide them with tools to become more aware of what they need the technology for and have alternatives to scrolling by having offline habits reading a book and and experiencing the the benefits of that legislation like social media bans is definitely more of a reactive and band-aid solution to a bigger systemic problem that we have i mean I totally understand why governments and parents might feel like that is the solution to the immediate risk of many of the harms that we face online but what would actually be impactful is banning addictive algorithms because that is the problem here and that is why so many of us experience these types of harms while some governments grapple with the impact of phone addiction on young people older generations especially those with money aren't waiting around don't you want to take a break from emails notifications noise in the past few years a market has opened up for luxury getaways retreats to green resorts where people can put away their phones and immerse themselves in a wellness routine at Unplugged we help busy city folk like you get away from your devices so that you can recharge our off-grid cabins are nestled in nature i think it's important that when we talk about digital detoxing we recognize that there is a class divide and on one side there are very rich people CEOs or company executives who can afford to spend thousands and thousands of dollars going on these retreats and outsourcing their digital activity to people so that they can have um device free experiences but on the other side the people who often work for them are zero hour contract workers or gig economy workers for whom being online determines whether they get to eat that night or not i think it's definitely a privilege to to be able to log off and be offline uh especially because our lives are built around technology these days if you're working with a laptop or studying online course you do need to log in every day you cannot just put the laptop or phone away and live off grit and same if you're living away from your loved ones it is your only way to to keep connected to them so this is why they they call it the luxury like being offline is the new luxury because most of us I would say cannot really afford that tech companies can see there's a problem the lucrative young users they're all chasing want to live at least some part of their lives offline everyone has that one annoying app that they're most addicted to you know that one i hate these notifications how do you monetize someone's need to get away from you you say you are part of the solution but great technology should improve life not distract from it we came up with a range of ideas to help people find a balance that's right for them i do think that there is this irony in tech companies trying to use technology to solve the problems that they themselves have caused and so with these apps that are designed to reduce the amount of time that people spend on social media it doesn't solve the underlying problem what it says is that there are bad apps and there are good apps and if you subscribe to the good app then we can give you a better online experience rather than tackling the underlying problem which is that a user is spending too much time on their phones and not enough time in their social lives and it's really interesting to see now that AI is being sold to us as the solution to that very loneliness that has come as a result of this type of technology we're building this meta AI um it's our we call it personal AI that should like get to know you and like what you think is funny and like what you ate right so that way you know it can like or you know what your hobbies are so that way it can kind of relate to you there is this real push back and awareness among all of us that these are not true and that technology is not the solution and finally a revelation from one of Washington's former frontmen as the State Department spokesperson under the Biden administration Matthew Miller was the face of its diplomatic messaging operation miller made a name for himself and not in a good way good afternoon everyone day after day he defended the US's support of Israel by either dodging questions about all of the evidence coming out of Gaza or flatout denying that Israel was committing war crimes we continue to support uh Israel's right to defend itself when it comes to um uh potential violations of international humanitarian law we have our ongoing assessments um and they have not concluded recently Miller went on a podcast produced for the UK broadcaster Sky News where he admitted without hesitation or a trace of shame that he had been lying that the war crimes were and are real do you think what's going on in Gaza now is a genocide i don't I don't think it's a genocide but I think the um I think it is without a doubt true that Israel has committed war crimes you wouldn't have said that at the podium yeah look because I when you're at the podium you're not expressing your personal opinion you're expressing the conclusions of the United States government this is not the first such Maya moment politicians public figures even news outlets are now repositioning themselves in most cases it has more to do with protecting reputations than seeing the light people complicit in this genocide pretending they were always against it" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="the 7th of October did not come out of the blue sky it came after 18 or 17 years of Gaza as a cage Gaza is the biggest open prison in the world and what did we expect will will grow there under this conditions if not terrible mutations no other way to to describe it of of people who came to murder to kill to to rape to to do terrible things now the killing of Gaza reports on a catastrophe is a new book from the award-winning Israeli journalist Gideon Levy who writes for the liberal newspaper has aretes in Israel he is one of the most outspoken and controversial critics of his country's war in Gaza and of its approach to Gaza over decades what he calls Israel's aparte policies against the Palestinian people in this book he brings together his on theeg ground perspectives of the events leading up to the 7th of October and the ensuing Devastation of Gaza Gideon Levy welcome to radio thank you for having me oh thank you so much for being here now Gideon you are a controversial figure in Israel and an Israeli because of the strength of your opinions against your own government's treatment of Gaza even after it started to become clear what had happened in Israel on the October 27th 2023 sorry October the 7th 2023 you wrote behind all this lies Israeli arrogance the idea that we can do whatever we like that we'll never pay the price and never be punished for it we carry on undisturbed the Gaza Palestinians have decided they're willing to pay any price for a moment of freedom is there any hope in that no will Israel learn its lesson no now not many Israelis or people in the media held or able to hold positions like that Gideon what makes you able to do so first of all it's very unfortunate that not many people in the media can hold those positions but for sure in Israel it is problematic because I covered the Israeli occupation for the last 35 years and I guess I saw things that no other Israeli was exposed to and you know my my positions developed throughout my my research my witnessing my permanent visits to Gaza and to the West Bank and what you see there you don't see in Israel and it's not shown in Israel so I think that much of my positions are due to to my trips to the occupied territories and witnessing the crimes and witnessing the brutality which is avoided for most of Israelis so you say this you say this in your book that that most Israelis don't see this you say that Gaza is hidden hidden from the view of the Israeli public and that anybody watching television in Nebraska or any news newspaper reader in Scotland is witnessed to more of what is happening in the Gaza Strip than the average Israeli viewer is that true does Israel really not know what's going on I invite you to watch Israeli channels and to read Israeli newspapers and you will judge by yourself it's weeks and weeks that Israel gets weeks it's now one year that Israel gets only a one-sided picture with information only about our brave soldiers and our casualties and the hostages all very important um facts obviously but there is also another people and there is also another suffer and in the last year the other suffer is so much worse than our suffer that it should be at least covered should be told many Israelis might might justify it many Israelis might blame the Palestinians for the OWN Destiny that's fair enough but not knowing is not a privilege of any intelligent person in a democracy and unfortunately most of the Israelis choose this option and the Israeli media is collaborating with this and I guess as a result of this uh you say that nearly all Israelis are united around this aspiration to punish Gaza um in its entirety and there's almost a lack of opposition completely to carrying on with the war and and list I imizing these extreme reactions yes Israel has a very devoted opposition to the Netanyahu government to Netanyahu in person Israel has a very vocal protest for releasing the hostages which is quite REM remarkable but there is no opposition whatsoever to the war and its cries this is hardly seen in Israel except of some very devoted groups but very marginal ones unfortunately Israel supports this war basically and Israel is not troubled by the crimes and the crimes are on a daily basis by the time we are talking now more and more suffer more and more crimes in Gaza in the West Bank and very little of it is reported to the israelies but I think Gideon certainly judging from the reaction that I'm already getting from listeners the idea that there is a context an explanation for what happens on October the 7th um you know from people in and outside of Israel who who've read and heard and seen what Hamas did on that day you is Unthinkable especially when we have families who have no idea what happened to their loved ones or or still where they are everything has a context and to deny the context means not to want to solve anything because without understanding the context nothing will ever be sto by saying that there is a context it doesn't mean that all the means were justified by all means not but the context must be understood the 7th of October did not come out of the blue sky it came after 18 or 17 years of Gaza as a cage Gaza is the biggest open prison in the world and what did we expect will will grow there under these conditions if not terrible mutations no other way to to describe it of of people who came to murder to kill to to rape to to do terrible things but you have to understand that this had a context and the context is the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and also Gaza in different ways and if you want ever to solve it you have to realize that there is a context yes there is a context but what would what would a proportionate response by Israel have looked like to you I mean some would say that the US responded in a not totally dissimilar way after 9/11 how do you respond to the biggest terrorist attack on your people within living memory so first of all I would offer to listen to President Biden who told Israel learn from our disproportional way or for our mistakes when we reacted on the N9 911 the American reaction after 911 what was tot out of proportion and at least the current president is regretting it same for Israel now the question is not the justification the question is first of all did Israel gain anything out of this one year of brutal attack on Gaza killing and destructing and punishing without any borders is Israel in a better place now is Israel a more secure place today than one year ago is Israel more beloved in the world than one year ago those questions should be asked by the Israelis and then should be also come the questions of legitimacy you know the fact that you are a victim of an attack does not permit you to do whatever you want there are limits there are legal limits and above all moral limits and killing 17,000 children is far beyond any limit and any justification so I to talk about the international reaction because you do say one thing needs to be clear without International involvement there will never be a solution Israel is not going to wake up one morning and say to itself or to anyone else the occupation The Siege and the aparte are not good let's bring them to an end so Gideon what should the International Community be doing and who if anyone do you see any signs of doing so so first of all the biggest leverage in is obviously in the hands of the United States the United States applied in this this year Israel with all the arms and the ammunition and the Diplomatic support that it needed in other words the United States told Israel go for this war be brutal as you want we will supply all you need all your needs for this and this must be clear because the rhetoric of the American Administration was the opposite one but rhetoric is one thing and policy and measures is another thing and Israel learned that the United States is behind this war and we have to realize that the United States is part of this war and part of the crimes of this of this war now what could the International Community do everything just let take a lesson from what the the International Community did Visa V the aparte system in South Africa look how just the voted and effective was the International Community when it dealt with the first first apartheid state now you deal with the second apartheid state and the world is doing nothing about it and this is not only a crime against the victims this is also very bad for Israel because Israel needs someone to to to repair it and it will not come as I wrote it will not come from within Israel Gideon leevy thank you so much for your time this morning the killing of Gaza by Gideon Levy is

          <attvalue for="7" value="this is day 66 in the Kamas Israel war and the IDF has completed its takeover of Palestine Square in the Gaza Strip I'm Pinto reporting to you from Israel the IDF spokesperson's unit announced that AIA forces have completed the Takeover of Palestine Square in the Gaza Strip This Square includes governmental buildings of Hamas and a vast underground tear tunnel that reached all the way to the shifa medical center the IDF is focusing its attention in the southern part of the Gaza Strip in the area of kadel bad and kanun and the Israeli Air Force is investing efforts to locate and Target Hamas terrorists and installations in these areas it appears as if these locations have a strategic value for Hamas because its terrorists are fighting hard against these ready troops in and trying to hold their grounds after 24 hours of intense fightings the IDF was able to knock down a main communication route of Hamas this caused hamas's terrorists to give up on multiple locations and surrender to the Israeli troops it appears as if Hamas is concerned about the morale of its terrorists in the Gaza Strip because it sees so many of them surrendering to Israel and for the first time since the 23rd of November Abu abeda a Hamas official issued the statement praising the Hamas Organization for its military achievements against the IDF in the past 65 days since the war started he also stated that Israel failed in its attempts to release the Israeli hostages and failed in the ceasefire he made it clear that this statement was made in recent Days by stating the day of the war and mentioning the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas this is another lie that Hamas is telling this time to its own terrorists it's a pathetic attempt to twart the reality on the ground Israel is controlling the majority of the northern part of Gaza and more and more Hamas terrorists are surrendering every day the remaining terrorists are hiding in underground Terror complex without any ability to connect to the outside world and this is the future for the southern part of Gaza and for Hamas there the fighting against Hamas terrorists in Bia which is another huge Terr Hub of this organization is close to an end as Hamas terrorists are running out of ammunitions and weapons and many of them are surrendering but the IDF still is on high alert because Hamas terrorists can still pop out of underground Terror locations and hiding positions in the neighborhood of Kube south of Gaza the YF is engaged in Fierce battles against Hamas terrorists that are fresh because the IDF has not conducted operations in that area until now the IDF has been working hard in dividing the Gaza Strip into strips of land separating the terrorists from each other after the IDF is defeating Hamas in one area it is mobilizing his troops to carry out an attack against Hamas terrorists in another location that's why in the battle against the area of jabalia the IDF was able to bring additional forces from the area of beia in order to conduct a joint operation to neutralize Hamas terrorist s in that location as Hamas is withdrawing its forces from areas it cannot hold anymore it is always encountered by other IDF units in jabalia Hamas terrorists retre and were quickly engaged by Tank units from the coast of Gaza the IDF is stationed throughout the entire Gaza Strip and any attempt by Hamas terrorists to escape to the South is met by additional AA forces in the southern part of Gaza according to reports thousands of hamash terrorists are still hiding underground in underground Terror positions and pop out in order to carry out attacks against the IDF troops the battle in the south is going to be hard and it already is Taking Lives on the Israeli sides as more and more IDF troops are losing their lives in this war against Hamas and the majority of them are between the ages of 18 to 21 but the IDF is not giving up and their sacrifice is not for vain because we are not stopping until we will destroy Hamas and return our hostages in Israel's northern border in the battle against kisala the Israeli Air Force according to reports conducted aerial strikes that targeted kisala positions in Syria the Syrian defense Ministry stated that its aerial defense systems were able to neutralize the attacks but that severe damage was caused to the infrastructure the report further stated that the strikes targeted kisala and Iranian militias that were located next to the Damascus International Airport in Syria according to Lebanese reports unifil delivered a message on behalf of Israel to kisala stating that Israel sees any Target 3 kilometers from its border with Lebanon as a legitimate Target kisala responded by stating that if Israel will implement this new directive kisala will do the same on the Israeli side the situation on Israel's Northern front is very fragile and kisala and the IDF are on high alert because it appears as if both sides do not want to escalate into a fullon war but any wrong move can lead to another escalation the IDF spokesperson's unit released a recording of Yu elmi hamas's Communications minister in the Gaza Strip during his investigation in Israel he stated that Hamas is destroying the Gaza Strip and taking it back 200 years he also said that the people in Hamas are crazy and that they are following y Yousef stated that people in the Gaza Strip do not like y sin and that Hamas is responsible for the destruction of 60% of the infrastructure and buildings in the Gaza Strip when asked about Yas War hamas's leader he stated that nobody in Gaza likes him and that he only likes himself and takes actions without consulting with anyone Hamas is a terror organization that does not care about the well-being of its own people or the future of the Gaza Strip This is the truth I know that if you're not here in Israel it's very hard to understand the reality mainly because the international media is not telling the truth about what's going on and does not share a full picture and that's why I need your help I need your help in Sharing what is happening in Israel and if you have questions please research ask people I'm not afraid of the truth because I know that I am fighting a righteous war against the terror organization and I stand by the Army and the values that I grew up on in Israel so please join me in prayer and happy hanuka from Island" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="In his second appearance on “Palestine Talks,” American author and journalist Max Blumenthal discusses whether the recent but unusual “joint statement” by Western nations – pressuring Israel to end its “egregious actions” against the Palestinian people – holds promise, how major tech companies in the West, such as Microsoft and Elbit System, have aided Israel in carrying out atrocities against Palestine and what a visit to Iran (shortly before the interview) reveals about how Israel, disturbingly, has exported certain methods of torture beyond its borders and may be the same ones it is using on the Palestinian people today. &#10;&#10;Subscribe: http://trt.world/subscribe&#10;Livestream: http://trt.world/ytlive&#10;Facebook: http://trt.world/facebook&#10;X (Twitter): http://trt.world/twitter&#10;Instagram: http://trt.world/instagram&#10;TikTok:   / trtworld  &#10;WhatsApp: trtworld.com/whatsapp&#10;Telegram: https://t.me/trtworld&#10;Visit our website: http://trt.world" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="thank you so much Max for sitting with me again today for Palestine Talks i'm hoping we can talk about Gaza the Israeli military and your recent trip to Iran before we get into all that in earnest I'm hoping you can shed light on the recent statement and this is verbatim the joint statement from the leaders of the United Kingdom France and Canada on the situation in Gaza and the West Bank where on the surface at least they seem to be concerned with the egregious actions as uh it's stated in the statement of the Israeli government and uh the statement as I'm sure you know speaks to the uh the blockade and um the refusal of Israel to let in food is there any promise in this rather unusual statement from the West that might be too little too late well it's certainly too little too late from a group of states that have given Israel too much as a genocidal assault on Gaza was clear from the beginning and was signaled within hours of October 8th by key Israeli officials these Western European nations played a key role in shielding Israel from diplomatic accountability providing it with weapons the UK provided Israel with spy flights over Gaza which have been secret and unaccountable to the British public now they're suddenly stepping up at least with some rhetoric and the sanctions that they're looking to issue or individual sanctions that's where the too little comes in one of the figures they're looking at is Daniellea Weiss a fanatical settler leader who wants to colonize parts of northern Gaza after they're ethnically cleansed so my theory on what's happening here and why the Europeans the uh part of the axis of assistance has finally stepped up and said what's taking place is abhorrent is they recognize that the consequences of the apocalyptic final endgame final solution assault that Netanyahu is waging on Gaza is ethnic cleansing and that hundreds of thousands of people could be pushed out of Gaza through what Netanyahu calls voluntary migration but which is anything but voluntary through the Sinai desert and ultimately into Europe and you would have another refugee influx of war torn refugees many of them potentially radicalized by watching their entire families be slaughtered before their eyes this follows uh refugee waves from Libya when Mar Gaddafi before being betrayed by the West after he normalized relations with them warned that the shores of Lampedusa in Italy would be flooded with refugees from Africa that took place after Libya was destroyed and destabilized the refugee wave from Europe a million refugees following the dirty war which Europe participated in helped destabilize European politics and led to Brexit and so this coalition of leaders Starmer Mcronone they're afraid I think of another refugee wave which will drive right-wing populism in Europe and weaken their own domestic base weaken them domestically so this is a self-serving statement in my view and what also is interesting to look at here is how is the chatter from uh Israeli accounts on social media threatening Europe uh there's one count account account in particular uh open source or osent 613 on Twitter which consistently echoes the messaging of Israel's military intelligence apparatus and it has warned that if Europe goes forward with targeted sanctions even individual sanctions Israel could retaliate in a number of ways including by ending cooperation security cooperation security assistance and intelligence sharing which would then trigger in the words of this account a wave of jihadist attacks in Europe which suggests to me that Israel actually maintains jihadist sleeper cells in Europe which it can activate in order to punish the Europeans a kind of uh unconventional Samson option for any uh any accountability for this genocidal assault and that is absolutely terrifying as well as revealing about the the the role Israel plays as a so-called ally it's actually the ultimate frennemy and I I'm actually unclear about where the friendship lies here this is uh this is blackmail in the extreme you alluded to it just a moment ago about it being too little too late i'm wondering why did it take this long in addition perhaps to the reason you mentioned about the fear of um or the right-wing populism fear and um also maybe I should add like how do we ensure that even if this is promising in any way for the Palestinian people that these states are still held accountable that people don't forget that it took this long well I mentioned the the the threat of right-wing populism as a new refugee wave um you know looms on the horizon there's also the reality of Palestine solidarity mobilization we've seen recordsized rallies in the last week or two uh in Dublin and other parts and and and throughout the EU which certainly threatened the centrist neoliberal leadership uh which has tried to destroy these factions politically we saw that with the coup against Jeremy Corbin for example so they're concerned about instabil political instability the center is failing to hold they must recognize that the rules-based order that they represent through the transatlantic relationship with the US has been completely discredited through their support their steadfast support for what I consider to be the Holocaust of our times and billions of people across the world see it the same way and just the institutional uh lack of credibility any institution in Europe that seeks to uh play ball with Israel including Euro Vision the singing contest where we just saw an Israeli perform and was the the the producers of Eurovision actually had to lower crowd noise during the performance of the Israeli singer so that viewers wouldn't hear the loud booze and they had to play a message before the singer declaring that uh that that that that we stood we still stand with Palestinians for justice and human rights just to kind of soften the blow and the insult to our conscience of featuring this ghastly display on stage uh institutional credibility is collapsing across Europe european soft power is completely collapsing and the European public whether it's on the right for their own reasons which may be more sort of nationalistic or on the left just no longer support the centrist transatlantic consensus and how much have these states um since October but also before October 7th profited from their complicity and I'm wondering if in a very crass sense they don't see it now as being profitable and that has anything to do with the statement for the Europeans I think the Ukraine Russia proxy war the Ukraine proxy war is much more profitable and we saw this surge in sales and their defense industry after Trump humiliated Zalinski in the oval office and threatened to cut off arms to Ukraine um then it became clear what part of Europe's interest is in continuing this fruitless war but of Germany is the second largest supplier of weapons to Israel and and when I say second largest it's close it's a close second to the United States that's not widely recognized so Germany is not only uh mobilized by Holocaust guilt and this historic relationship with Israel which is a way of getting off cheap on the Holocaust kind of displacing it on the backs of Palestinians there's also a material interest there i mean they supply Israel with everything from dolphin class submarines uh a deal which Netanyahu exploited to uh fatten his own paycheck or or you know increase his own uh coffers but also uh cruiser like fast boats cruiser class boats everything that's needed to maintain the siege of Gaza as well as tech so Europe is deeply invested in the special relationship with apartheid Israel uh almost as much as the United States in the United States you see like Elbit Systems the Israeli state arms company putting factories strategically in congressional districts in Texas in order to ensure total support they'll spread out their factories and then say &quot;We're producing jobs.&quot; And then the members of Congress will actually show up at Apac and say &quot;I thank Israel for employing people in my own district.&quot; And what are they producing baby buster bombs uh drones that soar into the skies of Gaza and explode children with the push of a button that's those are the job creators in places like Texas Colorado and elsewhere so it sounds it's not just Israel it's other countries that are testing their weapons on Gaza is that the case how can these companies be held accountable legally or otherwise one company that I think needs to be looked at with particular scrutiny is Microsoft and the tech industry in general in Silicon Valley because Israel's uh genocide in Gaza has been the most high-tech assault in history and it's using AI pioneering AI to do targeting in ways we haven't seen before i assume the uh assassination of Muhammad Senoir who had taken over for Yaha Senoir in a tunnel in Gaza was arranged through AI targeting that's how he was located there and 70 civilians were killed in order to kill him that's sort of been standard operating procedure for Israel kill 70 people burn them alive in their tents bomb an entire wing of a hospital bomb a school slaughter entire families in their homes in order to get one senior Hamas commander who's quickly replaced and AI is at the center of this who's providing the AI technology companies like Palunteer which specialize in it run by Ultra Zionist CEO Alex Karp but also Microsoft is playing a quieter but much more substantial role as uh do not panic a Substack account that tracks the tech industry's involvement with apartheid Israel has documented Microsoft has hired an array of unit 8,200 personnel from Israel's cyber intelligence unit which oversees these AI genocide programs they're honeycombed throughout Microsoft's offices microsoft's they've helped design Microsoft's Azor cloud hosting program which actually hosts Israel's Rolling Stone program which is Israel's program to maintain the entire population registry of Gaza and to track the population's movements in order to kill them in the same way that IBM helped Nazi Germany maintain the Jewish population registry inside Germany it's the same level of criminality the same level of complicity there's actually a company that Microsoft just signed a deal with called AMD this is a company that was started very secretly in the 1980s by Israeli army veterans and Israeli intelligence veterans and it has maintained a very secret presence inside the United States during the George W bush era AMDOX was suspected of spying on the White House and the State Department and a counter intelligence investigation was initiated although they ultimately cleared them microsoft has just signed a deal with AMDOC to maintain telecommunications services so we're witnessing that at Microsoft meta has hired hundreds of former Israeli army personnel these are people mostly on the military intelligence side and so through the tech industry we are witnessing a vast Israeli intelligence penetration of American industry and American society which can then be weaponized against the United States in the event of a policy change i mentioned the threats against Europe before these uh these uh developments need to be challenged from inside the tech industry by people who are working there there has been an enormous amount of activism at Amazon at Google and elsewhere google which just signed a $ 35 billion deal with the Israeli firm Whiz which was founded by Unit 8200 veterans delivering a massive cash cow to the Israeli state which was starving for revenue after October 7th so these have to be challenged from inside the tech industry it's important for everyone watching this to understand that if you recognize that what we're witnessing is the holocaust of our time in the Gaza Strip and you are in a position where you can provide information or blow the whistle about complicity with the institution you're working in it could even be a Jewish institution in the United States because you were able uh as a Jew to get on the inside uh or a tech company or you are a police officer uh getting offered training with Israeli police personnel wherever you are you have the ability to blow the whistle and it's time for people to start stepping up and use their positions as insiders to blow the whistle on this genocide and it really starts with the tech industry right and these companies they're documenting the quote unquote performance of these weapons that they're using in Gaza and so they are So um what happens to this information does it get sold to states to um for them to figure out how to carry out uh more military-led atrocities that's one of the keys to the productive sector of Israel's economy is that according to journalist Yotam Feldman an Israeli dissident journalist who produced a documentary I think it's about 12 years old called the lab about Israel's military intelligence industry about 100,000 families virtually the entire upper middle class in Israel has some role or some material interest in the arms industry and Israel's weapons um you know a lot of them are good for sure they are at least they're as advanced as American weapons but what the advantage that they have is that they can go to any weapons fair around the world and market them as field tested because Israel is constantly at war and now the field testing is taking on new levels that we can't even imagine including you know quadricopters that would will fly into schools and private homes and assassinate individuals uh who knows it's still like a matter of debate what was used to kill Ismael Hania inside Thran but that's certainly something Israel would seek to market they have all of these opportunities to carry out hideous and daring acts of violence because of the nature of their state uh the unstable nature of the Israeli state as it and the logic of Zionism which sort of requires them to be in constantly in conflict to occupy a population of restive indigenous people simply because they are not Jewish and cannot fit into a state which Netanyahu just reaffirmed last week is not a state of all of its citizens it is the state of the Jewish people so this provides a boon for the arms industry as well as intelligence like if you take a direct flight from Tel Aviv to uh New York or Atlanta or somewhere chances are you might be sitting next to someone who's on their way to train security personnel privately or with some um state agency in uh their knowhow and they're so revered within like the NYPD or within corporate uh with within corporations israel's car Israelis carry this reputation it's a reputation bathed in blood yes that's perfect segue for this question I have here which bears on Israel's reputation or what was its former reputation as being the quote unquote only democracy in the Middle East and of course that's been exposed as a myth um since October 7th but of course before that and before our interview today you had some very interesting observations you shared with me about uh the consequences for Israel or Israeli society long term that aren't really being addressed in mainstream media i'm wondering if you can speak to that like what is going to happen to Israel and Israeli society after if we can put it this way after the genocide ends or after the hostilities end in Gaza what are um people who aren't from Israel for example traveling overseas going to experience after something like this well domestically Israel is going to go through a major shift which will be brought about through internal strife uh kind of civil conflict i mean sitting here it's hard to even predict when this ghastly horror will end when we'll stop waking up and opening our Twitter accounts and social media accounts and seeing images of shredded children it just been going on for so long and I think many people expected that after several months of that it would come to an end because it's just seemed unfathomable at this point in human history that could take place for so long what can we attribute that to to Jewish Israeli nationalists that can be attributed to an what they call an iron society national resilience that they were willing to go all the way to total victory and what is total victory in in the within the realm of in the framework of Zionism total victory is ethnic cleansing it's the completion of the genocide the genocidal process that began in 1948 which can deliver them an ethno religiously pure state free from these indigenous contaminants and getting the people of Gaza out is a priority that majority of them are refugees they have a militant mentality they're not going to stand down like the Palestinian Authority in in Ramla got to get them out of there how can you get them out of there without just be having the will to slaughter them shooting and bombing children as a kind of hobby you have to have a deeply deeply right-wing messianic society particularly among the youth that are pushing the buttons that are doing the killing and through this transitional process that really was consolidated with Netanyahu's election in 2009 he's now the longest serving Israeli prime minister they have been under this kind of right-wing messianic regime for long enough to have reached the point where they can just keep the killing going on a societywide basis indefinitely and they will be able to get the weapons because of their vast powerful lobby and and movement throughout Western capitals from Brussels and Washington indefinitely as well they'll have enough bunker buster bombs for the next year so the their uh s their their their ability to shed blood was underestimated including probably by Hamas i I I mean I think the theory of change of toan alaka alaka flood on October 7th did not include this going on for this long uh they assumed some kind of deal would have been brokered but there's this is going to come with major consequences for Israel their pursuit of total victory of a final solution which I mean so many Israeli young people I spoke to just want it they they would say we just need to push the button and oh just I wish they would all just disappear and die and this is their chance but that will come with a consequence there's still a sector of Israeli society that does not see uh the that does not see that as a resolution that considers it to be even inhumane and believes Netanyahu sacrifice the hostages in order to maintain this messianic fanatical coalition and pursue total victory and keep himself in power for as long as possible they're going they're in the streets but they're going to be uh pushing to topple this government there's also going to be pressure from the far right faction the Kahanist faction which has gained so much strength through this war the bezel smotrix uh Benguier who he just had a speaking tour in the United States where he found a large audience for his genocidal ideas they're going to be vying for more power and we're going to see a contest in Israel for I think the what what could be sort of the terminal phase of Zionism after Netanyahu israel without Netanyahu is going to face a lot of turbulence because Netanyahu has sort of united a lot of these factions before October 7th he had prevented a major uh a major war like this he'd always tried to negotiate his way out of it and then he went fully into it but most importantly Netanyahu was the most important propagandist for Israel on the world stage ever and the most effective one spoke perfect English he's a product of the United States of a high school in Philadelphia of MIT went worked in Boston Consulting with Mitt Romney he's as American as any American president but he's also defined Israel and he has this direct link to Israel's mythology through his brother Yoni who died in the Intebia raid so there's no figure after Netanyahu that can stand in hisstead so I see turbulence and social strife in Jewish Israeli society beginning as soon as there is a ceasefire and Netanyahu leaves the stage on the world stage I think it's pretty obvious where Israel is going it is a it is a pariah and you have a generation of Americans and Europeans and people around the world who see Israel as the new Nazi Germany which is tragic for me because I mean what is Israel's national logo it's the symbol of my faith community they've turned it into a swastika a lot of Jews are disgusted by this as well look at polls of American Jews liberal American Jews they simply no longer support Israel it's it's only Jews who have come from a conservative background and are raised in religiously hermetic closed settings that tend to support it that so that conflict is going to grow in the coming years and it's not going to ever move back into Israel's direction so the only way out for Israel going forward is more warfare and more threats and bribery of its so-called allies who are actually just too terrified to cut it off we even saw Marjgerie Taylor Green one of Trump's key allies in the MAGA faction in Congress suggest that she could be targeted with assassination for condemning Israel's actions and demanding a cut off in aid to Israel for actually for for condemning Apac she actually tweeted that she said &quot;I am a happy and healthy person and I would never take my own life.&quot; So I mean they know it yes they know that you know every Western leader I think knows that they face the threat of assassination if they turn on this monstrous apartheid entity well hearing you speak about Israel right now it's so violent so hateful even when you talk about those persons that you met who want to press the button it sounds like this is beyond bad politics it's pathological do you think that's going too far to call it pathological yeah sociopathic it is pathological you would say yes i mean you really have to be a sociopath to bear hug Netanyahu as Biden did you have to be a sociopath to look at what's taking place there and not use your leverage and I'm hoping on a positive note it will impress on people the urgency with which they should engage in say Palestinian solidarity um or do something to stop the genocide and I'm wondering if you have any final thoughts or observations well these are troubling times i remember our last talk in Washington and we were talking about many of the same themes and again it's just so dismaying and somewhat depressing that we're that we're the way that we're having having these conversations is is is is within the with within the the just abominable framework of an ongoing genocide so I hope the next one we have is takes place outside that framework and we're able to form a more long-term vision of how to prevent this from happening again uh but it's still important not to to lose motivation and to keep hope alive certainly thank you so much Max thanks a lot for having me thank you" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] you know the conflict in Gaza is a conflict that has generated uh different reactions and this is to be understood we saw this in the early years of the nakba in 1948 we saw this in 1967 in yum kipur we saw this in 1973 we saw these kinds of reactions in the intifada and uh I note that there have been quite a number of reactions since I made my position known on the ongoing conflict in Gaza first of all is always good to preface a response to reactions with the caveat that nobody has a monopoly of knowledge nobody has a monopoly of wisdom that what one does is to share one's perspective with the others in the hope that that enriches the debate I see uh a number of comments about the Bala declaration and it must be remembered that the Bala declarations was a series of uh events uh culminate beginning as it were in 1917 and there were also similar declarations in 1948 that uh were an offsho of that declaration and I can't agree more with those who say that because of the disease at that time in 1917 initially and 1948 culminating in the creation of what was fundamentally a Jewish State and the failure of the world at that time to create a Palestinian state that that in many ways has been the Genesis of the conflict so that the Israelis have always been seen by the Palestinians and the Arab neighbors as an occupying force and many of the wars that have been fought have been on the basis that we are dealing with Israel which is a Zionist regime which is an occupying force and it is in that context that all these attempts that have been made through successive administrations whether it's yakin whether it's manim be and a little earlier even during the reign of of of the administration of game and of course during the Netanyahu periods and we saw that all these particular problems have gained the attention of the world culminating much more prominently in the oso Accords and the oso Accords were designed to resolve the problem for all times by creating two states but that was never to be we ended up with a Palestinian Authority and that Palestinian Authority also had its own problems leading in the bitter fight between the Hamas and and fata and with Hamas occupying Gaza so when we say that the conflict has brought about many nonstate actors such as Hamas Hezbollah and all these others we are actually admitting that this is the time that the world should come and say with no equivocation that if we are to resolve the problem in the Middle East we must have a two-state solution a two-state solution whose fundamental anchor is that Israel exists and is recognized as such that Palestine is recognize as such and they exist side by side subject to international law as to whether that will immunize the region from the conflicts that we continue to see and including the Gaza war is one that is out for debate but what has happened and continues to happen in Gaza is creating enmity which will be difficult to eliminate for Generations to come the other concern that I've seen or response is the question of what has been described as white supremacy you know there are those who argue that those who occupy and control Israel are not Jews in the strict sense that these are white supremacists who are hiding behind the cloak of jewishness in order to visit pain upon the Palestinians in fact I've heard even in the continent of Africa some arguing that the Israelis who are of Caucasian origin are racists and they have given the example of how they treat the ethiop Ian Jews who are brought to Israel under the operation Moses there is Merit in that but I think that the question that we ought to preoccupy ourselves with at this time is how to eliminate conflict in the long run and the way to eliminate conflict as we have said times without number is to find a lasting solution the danger is is that we now see a world that is divided particularly at the political level uh in the western world everybody almost to a man that is to mean politician is reluctant to condemn the Israeli response to the activities on the 7th day of October the year 20203 and those who argue therefore because of the European support the Israelis are thus encouraged and there are those who on the other side are saying that it is important that the organizations such as Hamas Hezbollah and we have now seen the hes ought to be reigned in as a condition precedent to any lasting peace it is an egg and chicken kind of situation what do you deal with the International Community through the un have now said that there is need for a pose or a ceasefire which will enable the world to look at these issues squarely in the face and find a long-term solution whether that is going to happen is another debate we now see within Israel herself that there are centrifugal forces which say that President prime minister Netanyahu must find a different approach to the war in Gaza because the Israeli military thought that it would be a quick fix but is now appearing that it is for the long ha so my own view is The Sooner Europe and America encourage the Israelis to seize fire with a reciprocal understanding that hamash and other non-state actors such as Hezbollah and the Hues will also seize fire so that the world can engage in a constructive way the safer it is because the whole world is affected by this War I see here for example of a comment from my friend Douglas moama and Douglas says unfortunately the Hamas has used all his time and energy to radicalize all gazans to hate their longtime neighbors Israel completely true in fact it is now argued uh that every other person in Gaza is being told you have a perent enemy in Israel and and this is bound to happen when somebody loses their family in a bombardment then the only reason why they continue to leave is for revenge and and this is one of the reasons why the sooner this war is brought to a halt the safer everybody is and and and can't agree more with Douglas moama who takes this view that there is radicalization and it's not only within Gaza you can see it even in in Lebanon by heah you can see it even from the rhetoric that one sees coming out of yeni through the huis so we are living in quite difficult times particularly as regard this war and one must comment that is a war that affects all of us because when you interfere with shipping in uh in the Gulf of Aiden and in the Red Sea then everybody suffers Joseph also Joseph hudo have you asked why Israel has blocked two State solution if stateless Palestine can hurch October 7th then what could happen with the State security is Israel's prime fear they are an existential threat secondly how do you expect Israel to defend itself against rockets launched from hostiles un facilities presidential homes please give an example of how to make the war proportionate a very very valid question from Joseph there because it is very easy to say that this war is not proportionate the response is not proportionate and we have had I'm answering this question by Joseph at a time when the icj has pronounced itself on the representation made by the South Africans asking Israel to ensure that genocidal acts are not carried out effectively just stopping short of saying we need a ceasefire but I hold the view which view is capable of inter being interrogated that you are safer dealing with a state which is recognized under international law which is obligated to act in a responsible manner if you don't have a state and is not a state within the understanding of or within the meaning of international law then it allows organizations such as Hamas to exist it allows organizations such as alasan Brigade it allows organizations such as Hezbollah it allows other organization to operate outside of international law and when they operate outside of international law in my view they are greater threat to Israel because the weapons that they acquire are acquired in an irregular Manner and you do not know but if it was a Palestinian state which is recognized as such which acquires arms in a regular way then they would be under obligation to behave properly then they would not use human beings are shield they would not use civilian facilities for purposes of military reaction So to that extent you are safer with a state which is recognized as such which exists and which is obligated to respect international law that is not to say that a state within the meaning of international law does not occas does not threaten Israel but then it is easier to deal with it because you and me know that states are involved D in Conflict not withstanding that they are obligated to act otherwise internationally once again we are not engaged or involved in any mathematics so as to know that this is proportionate and this is not proportionate but if you look at the rhetoric of the military officers in Israel or the politicians in Israel they have said we are going to fight a war like no other War so that Hamas will never operate we are going to ensure that Gaza is not habitable and that is not proportionality not easy to argue in favor of and it's easy from the comfort of our armchairs to argue the way we are arguing but is not easy for those who are actually in the theater and the arena of War you and me can afford the luxury of intellectual and cool analysis but yet the realities on the ground do not lend themselves to the kind of cool analysis in which we are engaged a man who calls himself Curious George and and and let me speak to your curiosity super Curious George most of these mistakes makes sense but the point about non-state actors going after civilian Target is scar make me question the logic why can a state actor deem a Target necessary for its own political gain but a non-state actor which in some of these places and be acting on behalf of their people cannot go after targets it deems threat either countries abide by international law or they don't you know the world has known pain and let us understand after 1945 war the so-called World War II the very reason why the genocide uh genocide became the focus of International Community and we had a treaty on on genocide in 1948 with Israel being the first signatory was out of what was visited upon the Israelis by the German Administration is now accepted the nearly 6 billion Jews were targeted because of their race they were targeted because of their religion and then the world said we must never allow this to happen again no more genocide and we even said in Geneva in 1949 we even said even when we conduct War as human beings somehow accept that war will always exist we then obligated combatants that even in circumstances when Wars are being persecuted there are certain things that must not be done this is the basis of the for Geneva conventions of 1949 but even after that we have seen genocide or genocidal activity activities we've seen that in Sabia we have seen that in in places like Rwanda which tells you that both state and non-state actors tend to conduct themselves in a manner that is inimical to the prescriptions and the injunctions that are placed upon them by law and this in itself is is a sad thing and that is why we have international institutions which punish such individuals we've SE we saw that with slobot and milosovic after the Bosnia war and we have seen that the very reason why you created the international court of justice and international criminal court is to ensure that those who do not conduct themselves in a manner that is in keeping with the law will be punished in accordance with the law and we have these permanent institutions because prior to that you had ad hoc trials such as the nurenberg trials such as the Tokyo tribunals such as sier Leon such as Rwanda but we now know better that these institutions to the extent that is humanly possible are going to do that once again always easy to argue in the manner that we do but yet the reality is that it is not easy I I see here this is a very interesting argument by Samuel Zion was made by the Ashkenazi which are from Russia Ukraine Romania Hungary Czech and Australia there is in this that the ashkanazi actually are the dominant but the sheerin those who came from Morocco and Northern Africa really Israel became a home for all Jews it is very easy to try and divide the state of Israel as it is now but the reality is that we are dealing with a state that is recognized as such and which is under existential threat in that part of the world but what we are telling the Israeli that there is a solution to this that solution is to State you cannot in the nature of things having suffered in the manner that you did under the Holocaust having been dispersed all over the world deny another population a right that you yourself are benefiting from this is what we are saying and the world will be safer that way and and and that I think is what the world is telling Israel yeah Julie oo I am very happy uh you support My Views and and I and I think there is a reason why uh there is Merit in holding the views that we do because all that we desire is to live in a peaceful environment all that we have appetite for for the continent of uh Asia and the Middle East and Africa and indeed is to ensure that we live in an environment that is favorable to all and this must be understood in the context of the reality in the world that if there is a war anywhere it affects all of us who for example knew that because there is war in the Gaza there would emerge a h threat that would entail the disruption of Maritime activity in the Red Sea in the Gulf of Aiden in the Gulf of Oman and and therefore affect the supply of oil in the world so all of us really have a duty to ensure that there is Security in the world somebody is saying a very interesting I have an idea to end all wars how about we elect an international president who all leaders of the world have to answer to the world is now you know I believe that we have contri utions to make there was a time when I believed and I still haven't abandoned this belief that the occupation of political office gives one a platform to really put into practice what one is saying but we must remember that we live in a world where the best intention of men are and women are not necessarily the ones that appeal to the electorate the electorate is moved by different consideration particularly in Africa the electorate is moved by money the electorate is moved by ethnicity and in as much as one would want to be in such a position one finds oneself in a position where what one can do is to contribute informally and it is never lost on me personally that some of the people that are most attracted to were never occupants of any political office I'm attracted to the IDE years of mandas Karam Chand Gandhi known as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr and they became moral forces in the world because it is much more difficult to become a person who is a moral Warrior than to be a person who is a political Warrior who is beholden to many interests but never say never you never know which Voice May call and which voice one may answer answer to in order to play a much more visible role in the Affairs of the world that is Hilo who only hides behind the mask 09 a z but the mask is peeled you know the question of the war in Gaza is one that is alive and well it continues to generate reactions and questions and in reaction to my sentiment my sentiment there are hundreds of questions that have come about raising pertinent issues is two State solution the solution how do we deal with non-state actors what is the nature of the state of Israel what is the nature of Palestine what is the role of the international Community what should the international court of justice do in the face of the representation by South Africa too many questions to answer but it sends the clear message that the world is concerned that people are concerned and that people want a solution to the problem we will not answer all questions but we must continue the debate we must continue to talk about these issues because the day we stop talking about them that is when danger comes in and solutions die so thank you very much for your comments those which are interrogative those which are commendatory and those which outrightly disagree the beauty of any debate is that when we disagree even then we disagree in an agreeable manner thank [Music] you" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="A look into how and why international laws and principles are being applied and ignored in the Israel-Gaza conflict.&#10;&#10;The events of October 7 sent shockwaves across the world and brought to the forefront once again a conflict that has been ongoing for 75 years. The Israeli government’s response to Hamas’s attack was prompt – it embarked on a war of magnitude in Gaza, claiming it needed to take out Hamas and rescue the captives. At first, the consensus of Western powers seemed solid: Israel has the right to fight back against Hamas. But more than five months later, Israel’s military was facing criticism worldwide, including allegations that it is committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and even genocide.&#10;&#10;This documentary will explore whether Israel is breaking international law and, if so, why are Western powers, in particular the United States, silent.&#10;&#10;Edited by: Jameel Hodzic&#10;&#10;Subscribe to our channel http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe&#10;Follow us on Twitter   / ajenglish  &#10;Find us on Facebook   / aljazeera  &#10;Check our website:  https://www.aljazeera.com/&#10;Check out our Instagram page:   / aljazeeraenglish  &#10;Download AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile&#10;&#10;#aljazeeraenglish #palestine #documentary" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] it's an extremely cynical moment for international law it's an extremely devastating moment for the Palestinian [Music] people there are rules under international law and no matter which way you look at this Israel is in violation of those rules as of the 7th of October there is not one Norm of international humanitarian law that has not been violated I never imagined that in my lifetime I would see a genocide taking place in real time before my eyes the fact that it is being protected by most western governments takes it to a level that I just never imagined would be possible I come to Israel with a single message you're not alone you are not alone Canada will always be a friend of Israel and defend its rights including its right to [Applause] exist and Israel has a right to defend itself in fact it has the duty to defend its people as your friend we will stand with you in solidarity we will stand with your people and we also want you to win if one looks at our political leaders today and all of our mainstream politicians they are the most mendacious the most mediocre the least talented group of politicians that I can remember during my almost 60 years on this Earth it it is astonishing just How Deeply corrupt materially and morally they are because many of them be through donations to their political parties donations to them personally donations to their organizations like the labor friends of Israel the conservative friends of Israel the Democratic friends of Israel the Republican friends of Israel and the multiple and Myriad other organizations like that they provide an extremely good living for that person and for those political parties thank you for having me and uh I'm looking forward to having a thorough discussion about where everybody goes from here every day in the depth and bread of cooperation the West is intimately involved in Israel's genocidal campaign in Gaza for months we have seen us officials affirm time and again that there are no red lines for Israel using exactly that language uh when of course we know that international law draws many red lines and yet the US has come out in Stark opposition granting Israel full authority to proceed and to create As Much Death and destruction as it sees fit battle it's America's battle I'm shocked by the lack of action of the International Community I'm shocked by the hands raised by the US ambassador in the security Council voting against Asis fire vetoing Asis fire I'm shocked by the lack of action of principled States who need to take again a principled concrete stand against this aberration and start thinking of [Music] sanctions what we've seen is that the laws of war are used against weaker parties but if your ally is the United States and if your ally can veto any Security Council resolution and if your allies are the European States then the chances that the IC will bring you to Justice are very very slim the international court of justice is a court that renders guilty the losers in a conflict it is a court of the victors and a court that has double standards for the allies of the powerful and for those that it thinks of as its enemies The View that South Africa's submission to the international court of justice is some sort of anti anti-semitic screed and blood liel this is nonsense that you couldn't make up and the nonsense that is being enunciated constantly not just by the Israelis but that is then parroted by the US government the UK government the German government the French government Etc and this is being done to defend the indefensible to defend the slaughter of tens of thousands of innocent civilians to to defend attacks on Health Facilities on residential homes on places of worship on places of work we are seeing a genocide taking place in Gaza well truth the matter is if there weren't an Israel we'd have to invent one the truth of the matter is that I believe that you as I went home and said got in trouble it's the time but it's true you know you don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist you don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist it's the International Community and it's powerful member states like particularly the the us but in general Western countries which is still pilot and it's evident in The veto power that some member states can exercise within the UN three of those member states are from the West it tells us something no African countries has a VTO power in the United Nations system it's the entire system which is not fully representative of where the world is today but I would like to see this changing we need to think of better mechanisms not only inside the law but how the law is applied to ensure that there is no double standards so it's both a changing of the laws to so so that they uh address the current circumstances but also the institutions the judicial institutions that apply the law so that they don't apply it with double standards and we will continue to actively engage in the hard work of direct diplomacy on the ground until we reach a final solution the destruction of over 70% of Gaza the killing of over 30,000 Palestinians including 13,000 Palestinian babies and children the injuring of uh around now 70,000 Palestinians and the destruction of almost all of the civilian infrastructure in Gaza international law prohibits this completely we have to remind the world that there are at least in theory rules which Israel must abide by and which it is violating the IDF is doing anything they can in order to minimize the uh culties when it targets the the military targets but again we are in a war in a war civilians got H you will never see the IDF Target shoots down a civilian you will never see a group of children walking on the beach of Gaza and Israel Target them specifically or an old lady crossing the street and Israel shoots the old lady Israel does not Target civilians Israel targets military targets Israel targets terrorists and when these terrorists surround themselves with civilians with this little children with this old lady with this old people these civilians might get hurt but it's not on the fault of Israel it's on the fault of the one who surrounded himself with these civilians the one that use them as human Shields [Music] the argument of the human Shields of Palestinians in general being uh eager to sacrifice their own children as human Shields has been used and dismissed over and over the first one to dismiss this argument was Richard uh Goldstone the the head of the first Commission of inquiry over the first war in Gaza and it has been disproven over and over where is the evidence [Music] Israel's instruction to the Palestinians first to move South and then to move west and then to move north but basically that instruction which has displaced 1.8 million people tells the Israelis that any civilians that remains in that area or Israel assumes that any civilian that remains at that in that area is either a participant in hostilities and therefore can be killed or a human shield namely someone that is being used to Shield a legitimate military Target and that allows Israel to relax the repertoar of Le lethal violence that it uses against these people and in a court of law that can be used to justify the wholesale killing of civilians Israel does more than even it's required it drops fly uh over Gaza to tell the people to vacate the area it makes phone calls to residential um civilians to vacate the area uh Israel calls to vacate the area once Israel took this precautions it's allowed to take down the building [Music] if civilians prefer to stay they take the uh their own [Applause] responsibility this is a complete Distortion of international law if you consider also the fact that Israel is an occupier which I think is the relevant legal framing here Israel has obligations under occupation law um not only to end the occupation which has now been ongoing for 56 years but also to protect the occupied people and we also know that Israel has no right to claim self-defense in accordance with article 51 of the UN Charter with respect to attacks emanating from a territory that it occupies and this notion was upheld by the international court of justice in its 2004 ruling on the legality of the wall and so regardless of which way you look at this there is absolutely no legal defense to committing a [Music] genocide andal and Mazon and [Music] M we have the president of the state saying there's no innocent civilian or there's no uninvolved civilian in the Gaza Strip so these kind of remarks do point at it intent and the if if it gets to a court of law then these kinds of remarks become very important in terms of the genocidal aspect of this war a lot of people in Israel will not feel bad for the Palestinians but yet the leadership in Israel feels for the Palestinian people and they allow whatever the minimal uh humanitarian Aid to be provided to the population in Gaza [Music] [Music] [Music] the law does create a vision of a certain kind of justice that we want to Aspire for we want to Aspire towards a world where human rights for all are protected the immense scale of suffering in Gaza there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks which is what is currently on the table does human rights law give us the tools to achieve human rights I'm not sure because of the interests of powerful states because of the double standards that are applied in the international Arena and therefore if it gets to court often the human rights do not win the day and so we need to think of other mechanisms to achieve these human rights [Music] the problem is not the law the problem is with the enforcement of the law and in in the Middle East and in the global South I would say uh the problem is that law is closer to political convenience than to Justice as a European I'm very sorry to say 500 years of colonization has left a huge imprint in our DNA in general Western people are not able to assess objectively what is what is being done through the non-application of international law or through the discretionary application of international law it's terrible to see the dismantlement of international order premised upon international law piece by piece [Music] manen it's unclear absolute Victory will look like when you've destroyed already 70% of Gaza when the overwhelming majority close to 2 million Palestinians are displaced um it seems to me that absolute victory means the the total decimation of Gaza to the point that it's completely uninhabitable and the depopulation of Gaza which Israel has told us time and again uh in this current moment that that is their goal that their goal is the depopulation of Gaza and um the settlement of Gaza by Israeli settlers of course in total violation of international law Israel does not Bridge the international law Israel keeps strictly very very strictly all the rules of law according to the international law why a country should be above scrutiny I mean no one should be the international law is there to be applied universally and not just for cherry picking because this this forms as I often say human rights protection into protectionism and this is unacceptable for me the the idea that the law will lead to Liberation or emancipation or Palestinian self-determination is a fiction human rights is not necessarily the the tool I think the tool needs to be more political in the sense of divestments in the sense of sanctions in the sense of boycotts to use this kind of Arenal of nonviolent weapons to pressure Israel to bring about changee freeee [Applause] [Music] Israel about 12 or so years ago realized having been so close to apartate South Africa the very real threat that BDS posed to the existence of the Israeli State as a racist occupying State and they created a ministerial Department called the department for strategic Affairs specifically to counter the BDS movement and what was the strategy that they hit upon it was to ensure that any criticism of Israel any criticism of its occupation any criticism of its behavior in the occupied territories was made equivalent to anti-Semitism and they have been remarkably successful at doing that there is no other argument than accusing us of anti-Semitism so as to deflect the attention from what matters the most from what our analysis insists upon for decades now I'm not surprised that Israel recurs to any strategies it can to uphold its goals to reach its objectives but I'm surprised that International Community joins this action because today you are not just attacked by Israel for being an anti-semitic if you just ask for the application of international law to Israel Israeli actions it's many many Western countries who do so and they betray also what anti-Semitism has really been The Surge of anti-Semitism in the United States of America and around the world is sickening you know we see it across our communities in schools and colleges and social media they surface painful scars from Millennia to hate of hate to genocide of the Jewish people every time I get accused falsely accused of anti-Semitism I respond I don't stay quiet I don't get intimidated I become louder and louder and by doing so I think I also Inspire other people to do the same I'm Jewish my mother was one of 20 odd survivors of the Holocaust so to describe me as anti-semitic given my history of anti-racism and my work on genocide prevention my invoking of the Holocaust of which my mother's family were victims it's simply an absurdity the so-call Western world is prepared to sacrifice the entire architecture of international law that has been put in place post World War II specifically to prevent there being another genocide like the Holocaust we are prepared to rent all of that aunder so that Israel can continue to murder 247 Palestinians on an average day 48 of whom will be women and 117 of whom will be children we're prepared to throw it all out that's the point of Crisis that our politics are at now and it is up to all of us who recognize that to actually create a counternarrative to the nonsense that is spewed by our politicians to maintain their own place in this appallingly corrupt and malfunctioning political system we have we continue every single day to wake up and insist on freedom and life in the face of genocide and there's simply nothing more dignified that anybody can do in such a hopeless and desperate moment I don't believe it's going to be sustainable to continue to prevent Palestinians from their right to Freedom [Laughter] [Music]

images of suffering children and babies axios reported an Israeli official responding that Prime Minister Netanyahu does not feel pressured on the matter by Trump the official went on to say that if the president wants a hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza he needs to put more pressure on Hamas thank you Devo for that report and as Netanyahu presses forward with an increased ground offensive inside of the Gaza Strip reports suggest Trump is frustrated with the war and wants Israel to wrap it up joining us now to discuss is former Israeli ambassador Yuram Edinger who served as congressional affairs liaison in the Israeli embassy in Washington and is a leading expert on USIsrael relations and the Middle East thanks so much for joining us today thank you it's my privilege so it seems as if the tone did a 180 degree flip after Trump visited these Arab countries last week when it comes to the war in Gaza what is making Trump so frustrated right now well I I suggest not to assess President Trump's position based on his talk uh it's much more important to judge his position in accordance with his walk and the walk has been very very positive on USIsrael relations while Biden withheld essential military systems and ammunition from Israel um President Trump uh provided has provided uh this items uh President Trump also uh did not react negatively uh when Israel uh took care of 11 of Kamas top leaders while he Trump was in the midst of his visit to the Persian Gulf supposedly it could have embarrassed him supposedly it could have undermined his visit but I have no doubt that Trump inside his hotel suite probably told his staffers finally Israel acting just like Trump would uh would do uh at the same time we cannot ignore we cannot ignore uh the worldview of President Trump uh which is not exactly compatible with the Middle East as he assumes that Middle East conflicts such as the conflict with the Houthis and with the Ayatollas and with Hamas uh are very similar to businesslike negotiation and while money talks uh in the west when it comes to business negotiations it's ideology that walks when it comes to the Middle East and negotiation that President Trump is eager to to conduct with the Ayatollas are perceived by him to be a step towards reconciliation but that Ayatollas view it as a step uh which is designed to bolster their capabilities and get ready for another assault on the so-called infidel west the great American Satan and the infidel Jew and last and not least we have seen President Trump being very much impressed with the Syrian leader with the Qatari uh leader and and again we should be very careful uh not to assume that you can approach the Middle East through Western lances the west welcomed uh Humeni back in 1978779 supposedly as a leader who wants human rights for the Iranian uh people uh a leader who is anti-communist and therefore would be very pro- US and we know that uh that leader became the number one epicenter of anti-American war terrorism uh the US also welcomed Bashar Assad in 2000 in a very positive way because Bashar Assad spent few years in Britain he's opthalmologist he was president of the in Syrian internet society married to a very modern Syrian lady educated in the US spoke few foreign languages and we know that he became a butcher a real butcher now Trump may be right about El Golani from Syria but I would suggest that before rushing into suspending economic sanctions and declaring El Golani a potentially peaceful leader I would expect American president to require the president of Syria to uh uproot all hate education in Syria before he uh gets those privileges from the US to uproot hate sermons from the mass to uproot hate uh media from the official uh media and introduced a United Arab Emirat like peaceful conduct once the Syrian does that obviously he deserves to be uh accorded a real generous uh treatment but not before that we have run out of time but thank you so much for your perspective today thank you and now President Donald Trump revealed plans for what he's calling the Golden Dome which he says is a cuttingedge missile defense shield that would protect the United States from foreign attacks similar to the Iron Dome in Israel the selected design comes with a hefty price tag ilv's Devoc Klein has the details at a press conference inside the Oval Office surrounded by space and defense officials President Donald Trump announced he selected a design for the Golden Dome missile defense shield system which he says would protect the United States from foreign attacks once fully constructed the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space and we will have the best system ever built as you know we helped Israel with theirs and it was very successful and now we have technology that's even far advanced from that trump said the system would cost a total of $175 billion and said it will be completed and fully operational by the end of his term calling it a state-of-the-art system trump says it will be utilized across land sea and space and will integrate with existing defense capabilities he says the Golden Dome aims to create a network of satellites to detect track and potentially intercept incoming missiles uh ultimately this right here the Golden Dome for America is game changer it's a generational investment in the security of America and Americans in a blow to bilateral relations with the leading ally the UK has announced a freeze on a trade deal in protest over the growing Israeli offensive in Gaza the government also placed sanctions on Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria itv's Steve Lee Woods has the latest we must coordinate our response because this war has gone on for far too long we cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve and the foreign secretary will come to the house shortly to set out our response in detail after the British prime minister's announcement British foreign secretary David Lammy announced the pause in trade talk the Israeli foreign ministry responded to the announcement of the trade freeze saying this even prior to today's announcement the free trade agreement negotiations were not being advanced at all by the current UK government the agreement would serve the mutual benefit of both countries if due to anti-Israel obsession and domestic political considerations the British government is willing to harm the British economy that is its own prerogative additionally the UK placed sanctions on a number of Israeli individuals and groups in Judea and Samaria who it said had supported incited and promoted violence against Palestinians in the territories the foreign ministry responded saying the sanctions against the settlers in Judea and Samaria are puzzling unjustified and especially regrettable after the recent deadly terror attack the British mandate ended exactly 77 years ago external pressures will not divert Israel from its path in its struggle for its existence and security against enemies working to destroy it israel bonds the heartbeat of solidarity the powerhouse of support when the Israeli Hamas war hit Israel bonds stood tall proving we're more than just an investment we're a lifeline israel bonds pledges to ensure Israel thrives and flourishes investing in Israel bonds isn't just a financial move it's a declaration for resilience strength and a better future for Israel join us and let solidarity echo through generations and the family of hostage Matans and Calker said they received a troubling sign of life from their son after they learned he was held with American former hostage Don Alexander while in captivity according to Israeli media reports new information suggest Zenalkker is struggling to stand on his own and is suffering from severe stomach pain and intestinal problems they described his condition as barely being able to stand mute and starving zincalker suffers from muscular distrophe and experiences muscle tremors and weakness so severe he cannot stand and testimony describes him as refusing to eat or speak and isolating himself as his mental health continues to decline reports say he is believed to be held by senior Hamas terrorists and is and is experiencing a lack of oxygen flea and rat bites and is eating moldy bread and contaminated water his mother told one Israeli outlet the IDF discovered a handwritten note from Zancauer in an underground Hamas compound the note included his full name in Hebrew and English his ID number and text in Arabic his mother confirmed it was his handwriting and speaking of tunnels as reports continue to detail the horrific suffering of Israeli hostages in them an Alazer reporter tooured an underground tunnel with Hamas terrorists in a video released on Tuesday al Jazer reporter Mustafa Sethan was led through a narrow tunnel by Hamas terrorist armed and with their faces covered in the video the reporter was guided with a blindfold on by armed terrorists into the narrow tunnel and is heard saying it was it was difficult for him to breathe they arrive into a small room where you can see the reporter barely being able to stand up completely in the tunnel he interviewed the armed terrorist who told him the tunnels are for quote temporary stay until Israel attacks them however one terrorist did say if Israel expands the fighting they quote will be found throughout the entire Gaza Strip now the terrorists say they had no shortage of weapons and that they're quote preparing ambushes to kill Jews and expel them from our land end quote that was all heard on Alazer and a unique educational movement is taking root in Israel's north and south where fields stretch wide and communities grow resilient the Adamava Adama schools translated as man and woman uh man and land are redefining what it means to uh learning by doing supported by Jewish National Fund USA these schools are cultivating more than just crops they're growing a new generation of young leaders grounded in Zionism sustainability and a deep connection to the land today we are joined by two students um Adho and Shahar Stalber to take you inside the classrooms and green houses where Israel's future is being shaped by one student at a time thank you guys so much for joining us thank you for being here i have seen one of your amazing uh campuses before tell me why you decided to join this program um I can tell about myself that I grew up my grandparents they met in the agricultural school Mikv is they've been together for almost 50 years now and I've always grown about their stories i've always learned about I have always seen their excitement when they're talking about their experiences from waking up in 5:00 a.m to go to work and agriculture or um being in a room with 10 other people always the the light in their eyes when they're speaking about those experiences is always something that brought me so much joy and I always knew that I will go somewhere that is similar like that and I started looking in in 10th grade I started looking for agricultural schools for something that will expand my eyes expand my seeing of the Israeli culture and I came for Danma amazing now you told me you're from Ramatan which is nothing like where the school is located which is in Arava literally right next to Jordan what do you enjoy so much about this program i love I usually I do nothing at home i used to go to school where you work you you don't work you learn from 8:00 a.m to 3:00 a.m to 3:00 p.m and you don't do nothing at all here in this school we wake up at 5:00 a.m we go to work we work in the fields with the farmers and after this we finished something like 11 11 and a half a.m and in 100 p.m we start learning we're doing the whole we're studying till 6:00 a.m and after it we uh have study groups we have dinner and study groups and there I remember both of you told me before we went on set you can't believe how much day you typically wasted before going to this program now you're farming in the mornings tell me uh briefly just one life lesson that you learned from this program and how it might have shaped um how you envision your life in Israel uh like I said you said earlier I'm from Ramadan which is a city and I've never even thought of going to a gap year before the army and doing something meaningful for the country for our people not only like joining the army straight after school doing something that makes the next to the people i never even thought of going to a gap year so now now in this school I thinking of it and I want to do it in my school again i want to be here till like five years not four years of of learning of high school oh it's amazing to see uh how much you you have learned and grown um tell us just how old you guys are um I'm 16 i'm in 11th grade i'm 15 15 15 and uh 10th grade wow and and for anyone out there who's interested just give me a brief sentence of what you would tell them about this program um like what you what your biggest takeaway so far h how much connection we how much the land especially in Israel means for our culture how much without the without the farmers how much without the community that it brings to us i remember David Benuan said where the that agriculture should be a part of the school system it teaches us so much about our life our work ethics it brings so much peace and connects us to nature so much more i think agriculture has so many different aspects big bring so much positivity into our lives and I think I know about myself that it really changed my my aspects a lot of aspects of my in my life we do important things we help the farmers that's something that goes and it last it won't last long if we won't help them and we're doing it and we're happy for it and we chose it thank you both for sharing that thank you and now the documents and personal items of legendary Israeli MSAD spy Ellie Cohen were re were recovered and returned exactly 60 years after his public hanging in Damascus

          <attvalue for="7" value="public support for Israel in European countries has fallen to its lowest level on record that's according to a new Yuggov poll when asked about Israel's actions in Gaza more than half of all those surveyed said they were not justified with less than a quarter believing Israel was in the right and regarding who they sided with more than double those surveyed in the UK and Spain said they sympathized more with Palestinians than Israelis now last month the UK Canada and France released a joint statement condemning the starvation of Palestinians in Gaza under a three-month blockade on international aid they also vowed concrete action if Israel didn't reverse course the UK followed it by summoning the Israeli ambassador and suspending free trade talks in a week's time from now France will co-chair a UN conference with Saudi Arabia calling for recognition of a Palestinian state which could grant the Palestinians greater legitimacy at the UN and the ability to take Israel to international court on their own behalf france's President Manuel Macron has reportedly also been lobbying other countries to step up and recognize Palestine calling it a moral duty and a political necessity if we abandon Gaza if we consider there is a free path for Israel even if we do condemn the terrorist attacks we kill our own credibility in the rest of the world and this is why we do reject double standards and this is why I think it's very important in our current environment to be consistent and to follow our principles our rules and to consider that what is at stake is clearly the global order and what is at stake is our credibility to protect this global order now all of this has had little impact on the Netanyahu government which continues to expand its military occupation of Gaza displacing the majority of its population and depriving them of aid netanyahu himself struck back angrily at Macron saying that Israel will not stop and will not surrender but is rising diplomatic pressure on Israel changing how Israelis themselves see the ongoing genocide in Gaza to tell us more we're joined now by Israeli academic and philosopher Annette Matar annette thank you so much for being with us yes I think but not for the whole population i mean we we've seen recently it started a while after Israel resumed its war or whatever is genocide actually it's not a war um in in March uh 18th but it took some time until that sank uh and then liberal liberal in intellectuals um people who were protesting against Netanyahu throughout the last years realized that I think the West started to to to be annoyed and I think they somehow maneuvered their way out of the the the indifferent or whatever position that they held before it could have been indifferent it could have been supportive of the war and we're talking about different studies it's a very very long uh period that we're talking about so what was true for October November December 23 was no longer true for some of those people at the end of 24 say uh but uh but since March and especially since we've heard exactly what you said I mean the the this appro um by the allies I mean people they think themselves as part of I mean they these intellectuals they see themselves as part of the intellectual or liberal uh left and and or or the west and and now I think they're finding their alongside that so you you see much more protests against the war they still call it the war by the way um so much more protests even in my university and other universities somehow things things were shaken up and and we've been protesting since I think October and and only very recently other people joined which I find really it's it's good that it happened it's not good that it happened so late but it's good that it's happening i want to dig a little more into this because when you listen to the statements coming from Israeli officials whether the Netanyahu government or whether at the United Nations you get this recurring theme that the entire world is against Israel unfairly the United Nations itself is against Israel European leaders are targeting Israel unfairly that there is this double standard that Israel is being held to internationally do you think Israelis themselves when they hear this criticism coming from overseas are they following this line that their government is is holding or or do they believe this criticism to be legitimate again I think that the Israeli population is split almost half and half if you if you ignore the the my margin which is not part of any half but uh but let's forget about that so the Jewish majority I think is divided more or less u for in two halves and one half will go after Netanya whatever he says and and and they are still supporting of whatever remains of that war and and they even don't really care even if they say uh that they do about the hostages uh they're saying yeah we want them free but not at the expense of the holy war so so yeah that these people will buy whatever whatever slogan uh and for them Israel is the eternal victim and that's it and nothing will change there the other population is the one I mean in in in degradations but but uh but I think that the other population starts realizing that maybe in this case we're not the sole victim last month when Israel began allowing a trickle of aid into Gaza under the controversial Gaza found humanitarian foundation Netanyahu had to justify it to his own public saying that this is going to shield Israel from pressure that it was under from its allies and allow it to continue the war what kind of pressure do you think Israel is feeling in in real terms from its allies right now i I really don't think it's feeling any pressure i must say I don't buy this uh because there is no pressure when when you you look at the ground israel has a total impunity and we've seen that all along and we've seen that since October 23 of course but we also have seen this after March i mean when Israel Israel really explicitly breached the agreement it was signed on so I mean that it cannot be denied uh and still they they they are accusing anyone else who doesn't agree with them and no and I don't see any uproar not in England not in yes we've seen Macron and we we we've seen Starmer and we've seen Lami in England and you know and we've seen the in Canada and nowhere in other places but where are the real sanctions where is something that is go that goes beyond words so they're contemplating of you know putting aside an agreement and you know they're contemplating some symbolic steps but I don't see the the the real payment now many and it is my own conviction that until until a real payment will come nothing will happen now you mentioned sanctions there you have been one of those voices at the forefront of calling for sanctions against Israel why do you hold this position because I don't think anything else will change the the the situation here i really don't think anything else i'm not sure this will help by the way because of course there may be the the the knee-jerk reaction that you know oh they they sanction us we hate them even more and they're anti-semite and whatever so that it may be the case but any other option was already tried not reproaches articles in the papers uh you know expositions in the New York Times well new discoveries in the Guardian whatever i mean but nothing really changed you talked uh before about that sliver that you consider yourself a part of in Israeli society what does it mean for someone like you to say something like this publicly in Israel given describing the public mood that you are saying describing these two groups that are you know one they're both essentially against the war but on different levels what does it mean for somebody to call for sanctions against their own country given this climate yeah well it's not easy but I've been used to it for years so so just that the the last couple of years were particularly heavy but and they were heavy they are heavy um and still you know we have hostages in both sides and prisoners in both sides in terrible conditions in both sides and and I care about both sides um and I've been involved for years in committees for the Palestinian prisoners and I know what the situation in prison in the Israeli prison is so you know I worry uh it's not an easy period for me to to to live in Israel or anywhere because I I I don't think I would change anything if I was abroad uh but I have my circle of friends and and comrades and we we've been protesting together from you know very early on we've known each other for many years that that helps that helps m and I mean what do you take uh a hope in and where do you find strength to continue carving this very lonely path that that you're on well I don't see any hope at the moment i hope I hope I'm mistaken about hope but u but the strength well I've got it and um I think many because of my experience many because of the so many years that I've been active it you know it gives it gives you some energy to to keep going and as I said I mean there is this cluster of friends and and and comrades that you know we hold each other together now Today there was this explosive story that we saw about the Israeli government all but confirming that it has been arming gangs inside of Gaza affiliated some of its members with ISIS what do you make of the story i'm sure it's true i'm sure it's true because first of all be not not because of Fleerman or other people i don't I don't buy the the what what they're saying but it was covered in which is a reliable source and I I I know that when they say they have reliable source sources then they do but I also remember it from months ago i remember people I've I've been in touch with in Gaza directly uh telling me that you know that Israel disrupts the the ordinary um functioning of of the aid delivery and then that it supports the gangs and that was months ago i can't recall now but it was months ago and it came from you know many many people just you know I know or friends know so it was in the background already then but then now you have you have names you have faces you have pictures you have Tik Toks so and yeah I'm sure this is true and it's actually very typical when you think about Israel's behavior all along why not it's so obvious that this would be the the road it does betray a kind of cynical thinking when it comes to the way that uh the government chooses to pursue uh a military um it's the the way that it chooses allies in a place like Gaza um the way that it would arm one faction to go after another it is quite a far cry from the uh refrain that you hear from a lot of Israeli spokespeople about the IDF being the most moral army in the world and and and things of that nature uh I mean how do you think the Israeli public the ones that you say are are following Netanyahu blindly wherever he goes how do they justify for themselves some of these tactics that might be difficult to hear about well I don't know about them really because I cannot fathom what of Netanyahu really thinks because we know Netanyahu they may say that yes we're against Hamas and anything that can be bring down H kamas is in our side but this is what they said you know when they supported kamas years ago so you know this what I'm saying that this is not the first time it's not a surprise that Israel behaves like that so if they if they feel okay with all of Israel's history then they would feel okay now if they don't then okay they will be critical and I'm sure here we we will hear from that liberal part that I was mentioning in the beginning you know I'm sure that we will hear critical voices you know ex generals and all those people who just came to realize that the war is no longer u profitable was something they they will criticize I'm sure they will and finally and many Israeli voices that we have spoken to have said that the only pressure that only the pressure from the United States can have any influence on what Israel doesn't do and we saw the US's position quite clearly again yesterday at the UN when they vetoed a call for a ceasefire that all the other members on the security council supported without the US changing its position if that doesn't happen on the horizon what do you think the international community can do is there anything that they can do i I'm sure they can do a lot if they detach themselves from from mommy you know from from from the US i mean Europe is quite powerful i mean if they gather together and add this to to United Kingdom as well this is this is a strong power uh and actually when when uh when Trump announces announced his tariffs then you saw them you know uniting and and and and and you know talking against it and at least giving uh a sort of image of firm position and then he retracted a little bit so they can do this in relation to Gaza they simply don't" />

why has Israel decided to let in some aid and only under an agency it backs could this be part of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's stated plan to take control of Gaza and ultimately what does this mean for Palestinians who are starving we'll get to our guests in just a moment first this report from Imagin Kimber all these people are desperate for aid to hold off starvation inflicted by Israel that has barely let any food into the strip for nearly 3 months we're dying of hunger the children are saying &quot;Father I want to eat so I want to salivate my blood to feed them we can't find anything to eat.&quot; This aid is being distributed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation or GHF that is backed by Israel and the US and based in Switzerland the organization's plan has been criticized by the UN and other aid groups who say it appears to weaponize aid chaos broke out during the first delivery of food with Israeli soldiers opening fire as people rushed forward several Palestinians were killed others were too desperate to hold back we don't care about gunfire or shelling what matters for us is to bring food to our children israel says the GHF is a mechanism designed to assume control of all delivery of aid in Gaza and exclude aid organizations like the UN we're going to put many more of these and the idea is basically to take away the humanitarian looting as a tool of war of kamas to give it to the population eventually to have a sterile uh zone in the south of Gaza where the entire population can move for its own protection israel has long claimed Hamas loot supplies but this has never been proven and the armed group denies the allegation the UN criticized the operation on Tuesday saying pictures of the chaos were heartbreaking to say the least and explained why it won't be involved we do not participate in this modality it is a distraction from what is actually needed which is a reopening of all the crossings into Gaza a secure environment within Gaza and faster facilitation of permissions and final approvals of all uh the emergency supplies that we have just outside the border it needs to get in other international organizations are also boycotting the scheme saying it doesn't follow humanitarian principles if there is a reduction in the number of sites where people can access assistance that would effectively reduce uh or exclude the most vulnerable people in Gaza from accessing aid it's not feasible that's not practical in addition to that humanitarian assistance is only humanitarian when it's delivered independent from political and military objectives israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly stated Israel aims to control all of Gaza and wants Palestinians to leave and critics say controlling and limiting aid would appear to fit that plan imaging Kimber Al Jazer for Inside Story let's now bring in our guests in London is Chris Gunners former director of communications for UNRA the UN agency for Palestinian Refugees in Gaza City is Amjad Shaw who's the director of the Palestinian NOS's network also in London Ial Visman who's a professor at Goldsmith the University of London and author of the least of all possible evils humanitarian violence from Iran to Gaza welcome to the program gentlemen thank you so much for being with us i'm Jad Shaw in Gaza City let me begin with you the images that we saw from Rafa were shocking they were heartbreaking as a humanitarian from Gaza when you saw those pictures of of people climbing fences crying for food being shot at what did that moment represent were you surprised or was this to be expected thank you yes it was very sad moments as we used to have along the 600 days of war but this time it's uh shown how much the effect of the starvation that the people had to walk about two and a half hours to reach this m military basement guarded by militants in order to get some food back to their malnutrition children these people were insulted suffocated all the time but this time it's different and difficult and what we witnessed that this as I said that these militants shot and the Israeli army shot towards these crowds who were just trying to get some food and this scared me because this is the application of Netanyahu plan to force the people to displace from Gaza north right towards Rafa as he want as his plan for I'm before we get into what's motivating the this plan uh by the Israelis uh let me just ask you uh you know what you heard and what you saw about the aid that was distributed what was actually in the aid package that was given to to some of the people in in Rafa i read that some of it mostly was dried and prepackaged food like uh pasta and beans food that needs to be cooked i understand but that's extremely difficult right now in Gaza isn't it yes very limited amount of items which I think it's for two three days of family of five six members so just to let you know that we as a humanitarian we will not let this happen along the 19 months of the war we used to get the supplies the humanitarian supplies to the people to the neighborhoods to the sides not to get the people from where they are to these military basement to have small amount of aid and we are working in kind of compreh comprehensive approach not only just to distribute such minimal amount of aid and to use this way of dealing with the people and to shoot towards them by fire and to have tens of people who were injured this kind of insulting of our people it's very serious and to be considered that this is the real plan of the Israeli not to elevate the suffering of the people but also to deepen the humanitarian catastrophe this will not solve the problem of starvation caused by the Israeli occupation through denial of the entry of the supplies to Gaza all right Chris Gunnness let me come to you and ask you about your reaction i mean you've seen many crises during your time at at UNRA what did you make of the scenes in Rafa i'm calling the GHF the genocide humanitarian fig leaf because that's precisely what this is it's a fig leaf for genocide when an army that's been committing a genocide against 2.5 million people and starving it out in the way that it has done allows in just a handful of trucks of course this is going to happen and according to unconfirmed ICRC sources six people at least six people were killed by gunshot wounds and um well over 40 were injured because of gunshot wounds and this is what happens when you let an aid organization be taken over by a bunch of cowboys a bunch of mercenaries a bunch of people who have absolutely no track record in delivering aid to situations like Gaza there was no community consultation that's absolutely essential when you're delivering aid there was no attempt even to set up proper infrastructure we saw the laughable pictures at the beginning of your show of those it looked like a cattle pen it was that insulting for the people of Gaza um there was no attempt to prepare the community there was no consultation there was no attempt to get the infrastructure up and running and this gets to a very important point only UNRA has the warehouses the food distribution centers the staff 12,000 staff who have been working all the way through this crisis delivering food coincidentally everybody um so you know it's it's an appalling situation it's insulting that you know Gaza should be a successful the most successful export economy on the Mediterranean they've been reduced to abject food dependency in violation of international law it's disgrace this operation should end right now the crossing should be opened and UNRA and the other professionals in the UN agency unra has a track record going back to the 1st of May 1950 that's when they started delivering aid in Palestine the professionals should take over from the amateurs all they're going to see is more needless killing but Chris of course the Israelis and the Americans have said this operation was successful even if there was a a bit of chaos at the start of it and they say they'll continue it uh I let me come to you now you your thoughts about what's happened what went wrong with this alternative plan was it flawed in in design was it flawed in execution or both you know it's exactly the difference between a plan hatched on paper on computer screen somewhere in Tel Aviv or in Washington people think in the abstract and the reality of starved people um being channeled um into this degrading architecture of control and supervision being you know uh pushed there um by starvation and of course to expect people that are starving um to be um controlled in an organized way is completely idiotic of course you would see those scenes uh of chaos and of course that chaos as much as it is uh something that whenever we see an architecture of control being overrun by people there is some hope in that in in the people's sort of response to um all attempt to control them there is a price to pay the the the the food has not been distributed right this is a completely idiotic plan and we see the result of it right and I think that Yeah and Chris I wanted to uh Chris made an important point yal uh about the why I mean why establish a parallel untested aid mechanism when the UN and established NOS's have the capacity and the experience and the networks to distribute this aid what do you think yal this suggests about the motives behind this uh GHF operation and and this new system of aid distribution that the Americans and Israelis are backing i mean what what is ultimately the motive behind this so I think according to our analysis is this is the endgame of the genocide this is the final stage of it um we have seen in very early on during the genocide the complete systematic destruction of all agriculture and fisheries that is the capacity of Palestinians for food sovereignty to feed themselves uh then we've seen the destruction of all um aid distribution centers um we have seen it in early on in attacks on bakeries then we've seen it moving into attacks on aid convoys that was going on that enabled Israel to exercise control over allowing aid in through the checkpoints okay so Israel wanted full control over aid what they couldn't have uh exercise control of is over the distribution so this is why I call it the endgame of the genocide where Israel is trying to wrestle control over the last element that fell outside of their control is the actual distribution of aid so they've created starvation and during the last 3 months they've intentionally created starvation in order to to to supposedly come up with a remedy for it pushing through the starvation people into the infrastructure uh that that they've put in place which we've seen has been overrun at the get-go amjan I'll come to you in a moment but uh Chris you wanted to jump in chris go ahead to what extent do you think this plan is about feeding people i mean when Netanyahu was trying to justify the genocide humanitarian fig leaf um he said they were doing this because Hamas was stealing aid cindy McCain the head of the World Food Program said in the American media o on the record over the weekend that there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that Hamas is stealing aid and there's plenty of evidence that gangs who are enabled by Israel have been taking some of the food so let's just get that right there is no justification whatsoever in blaming Hamas let me ask about that Chris because um I think the other really sorry yeah on that point I just wanted to get Amjad on that point because he's on the ground of course in Gaza uh that argument Amjad that Chris mentioned there that's being raised by the Israelis and Americans that you know this they're pushing for this plan because you know the aid is being diverted by Hamas to to what extent is there credible evidence of that happening on the ground at at a large scale aid being diverted what have you seen in regards to that let me start out by the the the the humanitarian system the traditional one the UN the Angels and the National Angels which was attacked by the Israelis since the beginning of this war mainly the Honora which is the backbone for the humanitarian aid which was banned by the Israeli conet and now nothing entered to honor and most of the honora premises destroyed and also there's about 280 staff members of Anora were killed also the national NOS's the international there's so many restrictions of the work of this humanitarian structure and then now you know they want to make it collapsing so now they are trying to replace it by this military mechanism and the aid convoys which used to come through Karma Abu Salam commercial crossing there is in certain areas which is controlled by the Israel There is there is gangs who stop these convoys and under the Israeli observation and this happened so many times till the last week there was a convoy of flower about 15 tracks which was looted by militants in in Salah street which is this area is evac forcible evacuated and the quadcopter is over so it's this thing that we have very credible humanitarian system and we are working with the humanitarian principles to be applied in our distribution wherever the people are but this time through the provocation of Israel in this system along the time they wanted to smoothly put this uh Gaza humanitarian foundation on the track it's not for Gaza it's not a humanitarian and it's not a foundation for Gaza Palestinians it's to serve the Israeli security and politics all right Chris I'll let you continue your your thought about to what extent is the GF GHF plan less about feeding people and more about using aid as a tool to to reshape uh the political and territorial reality of Gaza well what we're seeing is force displacement and we're seeing ethnic cleansing under the opaces as it were um of this operation and as a I think quite correctly said this is the endgame of the genocide that you know you bomb these people into submission and trying to force them out of Gaza um but you know I look at the donors because the donors have allowed this to get to where it is the donors have sat on their hands and watched the Israelis try to dismantle UNRA there was a totally fictitious smear campaign based on the lie that was later shown by the Colona report the independent report to be a complete lie that UNRA staffers were involved in the October attacks the donors then withdrew their funding on the basis of absolutely nothing well those donors need to step up to the plate both politically they have to do what the ICJ has demanded and have a sanctions program against Israel so there has to be the political the economic they got to obviously stop supplying America Britain Germany these other countries stop supplying the genocidal weaponry and on the other side they have to step up to the plate in terms of first of all stopping the starvation then they've got to start doing the recovery these are the donors and then they've got to look at the complete reconstruction of Gaza it sounds daunting and it is daunting you know there are there are thousands and thousands of unexlo pieces of unexloded ordinance that have to be cleared but in 2014 after a devastating war not as bad as this one Gaza to some extent to a large extent was rebuilt you give the Palestinians the opportunity to do this and they will perform let me tell you I've seen it time and time again okay let me ask you then uh EA Chris mentioned the ICJ there and whether you think these recent events will uh affect the genocide case against Israel at the ICJ i mean the provisional measures that the ICJ called for was for Israel to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid and avoid actions that worsen the livelihoods of Palestinians but from what we've seen in Gaza especially yesterday that hasn't happened so how might these events impact that case so look you know Israel's defense uh on January 2024 was that it is warning the population it's providing aid and it's moving people for their safety now in the current operation it is admitting that the ethnic cleansing a force population transfer of Palestinians to places in southern Gaza are the aim of the operation so it's completely undermining its own arguments that you know were laughable already in January 2024 but now are clearly uh seen to be what they are when we speak about the endgame of the genocide Palestinians will be faced with and this is Israel's plan with two choices to leave Gaza under the Trump or any other plan or to die in Gaza and that in order to do that one has to create the space in which it is happen this is why uh spatial architectural analysis is very important in in cases like that because architecture when an architect works on a plan there is an intention to a plan it is very clear in architectural analysis to see what is the intention when you build a building you have a certain program to do that so we ask ourself what is the spatial architecture of Gaza designed for if not for the genocide of the people if not a transference of the entirety of the population to the one part of Gaza that has no agriculture that is no development uh within it there's no infrastructure so that every bit of infrastructure every bit of necessity that people need will be in the hands of the Israelis Now now we think that might be some kind of charity that Israel is uh is doing to the people of Gaza by delivering some sort of laughable amount of aid this is not charity firstly Israel is forced into doing that they wouldn't have done it if they wouldn't do it and so there's been the suggestion that this could also be in order to in order to bring the population into the places right by the Gaza Egypt border where just one more push would see them out of and there's also been the suggestion that this is also about starving support for Hamas about you know getting civilians Palestinian civilians to distance themselves from Hamas in the hopes of political change what do you make of that oh but you know I think I think both Chris and Amjad said it very clearly palestinian society is accustomed in the distribution and division of aid they know how to do it uh there are infrastructure of UNRA other organizations in Gaza that know how to divide the aid the the society knows how to do it it's been living under a a murderous blockade for two decades and it has learned how to do that uh very well no plan done by some architects on the outside or implemented by people without experience in humanitarian aid could replicate that palestinians know how to do that chris your your thoughts about the the motives and also this idea that this could be a way uh to to push Palestinians to distance themselves from Hamas and and lead to political change within Gaza look that's a joke i go back to the um elections in January 2006 where the world thought &quot;Oh we'll let Hamas stand in elections they won't get enough votes that'll split the Palestinians and there'll be no partner for peace we'll never have to do a two-state solution.&quot; I mean at every stage the international community led by Israel has completely got wrong the analysis on the Palestinian side and of course I mean of course the analysis is very much wishful thinking and here again we have more wishful thinking the idea that people will do Israel's bidding in Gaza do what the IDF has been incapable of doing for so long in spite of saying time and time again that they're waging this genocidal war in over in order to destroy Hamas destroy a political movement haha i mean we all know that you can't bomb a political and a social movement with high altitude bombers and this is going to be no different i mean all that's happened is Hamas is constantly um being reinforced as it were politically and in all other respects and I think this is going to backfire but I mean the good news is you can't spin genocide you really can't spin genocide you can dress it up as much as you can and I think the scales are falling from the eyes 19 months too late of course I think the Germans and who knows i mean the Brits too though they continue to sell 127 million pounds worth of military aid but you know you saw Trump raging spontaneously apparently against Putin maybe in one of his capricious fits he'll suddenly turn on Netanyahu and make some spontaneous decision to cut all military aid i mean who knows what motivates we have heard that change of tone yeah we have heard that change of tone from the Europeans but not yet from the Trump administration uh Amjad let me come to you now and ask you your thoughts about what we've heard from both Chris and EAL and also the important question um that raised and the choice that Palestinians in Gaza faced today um leave or stay and die in Gaza what is the mood on the ground i think yesterday there was a boom you know about this issue and about 85% of the Gazan sits clearly that they will stay in Gaza whatever the situation is nothing will abort us from here this is our land and this is where we belong to and we will not fulfill what Israel and Netanyahu want to reoccupy Gaza without its people and we are not investment project for any so the issue of our forcible displacement whatever the conditions will be we are staying here in Gaza North and the international community has to work hard in order to stop this genocide this war against civilians against the children against women to open the crossings to reenter the aid supplies which is waiting now for three months and part of it expired and damaged because of the denial of the Israeli towards it its entrance and the same time to protect the civilians every day yes I'm talking about starvation but the issue of killing of children women elders and to burn the bodies under their tents this thing has to be stopped and justice for these victims must be there thank you so much gentlemen thank you for for a great uh discussion an important discussion to have today thank you i'm Jad Shaw Chris Gunnis Eel

He fled Gaza in December after being detained by the Israeli military, but many of his extended family members were unable to escape. He reads a selection of poems from _Forest of Noise_, while sharing the stories of friends and family still struggling to survive in Gaza, as well as those he has lost, including the late poet Refaat Alareer. He also describes his experiences in Gaza in the first months of the war, including being displaced from his home and abducted by the Israeli military, noting that the neighborhood in Jabaliya refugee camp that his family first evacuated to last year was bombed by the Israeli military just days ago. &quot;Sometimes I want to stop writing because I'm repeating the same words, even though the situation is worse.

Gaza you die several times mosab abu's second book of poetry is just out it's titled Forest of noise his previous awardwinning book of poetry things you may find hidden in my ear poems from Gaza masab abua is a columnist a teacher founder of the Edward SED library in Gaza his recent essay in the New York Times is headlined Gaza schools are for learning not for dying and his latest piece for the New Yorker is headlined the Gaza We Leave Behind masab Abu TOA it's wonderful to have you in studio safely here in New York but I know that your heart and mind are in Gaza right now before we talk about your poetry uh you have just come with terrible news for you and your family about what is happening there can you describe what you've heard just today thank you so much Amy um yeah I mean just you mentioned the the the air strikes that U took down 10 residential buildings um I was staying with that in that place with my wife and kids just before we had to leave uh for an honor School uh to stay in a shelter there and before I was abducted by the Israeli Army and this morning I looked at the names of some of the people who were killed in that air strike and I see the I mean 19 um names from the same family including iMat AB Rashid I mean a temporary neighbor I mean we had M fat as a neighbor for a few days before we had to leave the neighborhood and now I read that this neighborhood which I where I was staying with them was bomed so she was killed along with some of her children and this is the of so many people I'm not sure if you can see this this is the list of the whole family and for example you're holding up a list of what some 20 names yeah 20 names including fat the grandmother her children and her grandchildren and I I look at for example I read this every day so there is Muhammad Salman his brother YF Islam s so five brothers and then there is there is muhm fat the son of fat Abu Rashid and his wife and his and their children so I've been seeing all this all the time time and by the way we are focusing right now on North North Gaza yesterday late at night Israel bummed intensely kanun and I'm looking at some of the pictures here these are the the photos of the children who were killed yesterday they just were able to withdraw the bodies of these children after the Israelis retreated from the area so and and that was today I learned about this just half an hour ago and then I went to the to the local news channel in my city Bia North Gaza and I saw the picture of my neighbor um Iman abua this is his photo he was killed he was killed this morning uh while he was trying to to get some water from from a tab in the street aan to honor his memory he was the principal of the Oni agricultural College in North Gaza and he was trying by the way he lived just a few blocks away and he wanted to move to to stay with his brother because there are some friends who and some neighbors are staying there so he wanted to be close to the people who are there but he was killed and his his son my wife just told me because she was on the phone with her mother and father who are trapped right now in bethle they were told that the brother of my my neighbor has been critically wounded and he is in the house there's no way that an ambulance can come there's no way that any anyone can come to their rescue and the same thing happened yesterday in the jab refug Camp the 10 residential bu building that were took down massab yesterday last night I saw you at the Brooklyn Public Library sold out to hear you speak about your poetry and you said at the beginning I saw your wife and your three little children but that hadn't been the plan uh you're now in Syracuse at Syracuse University um talk about you almost canceling the day before CU your wife was too terrified for you to come to New York indeed I mean taking my wife and three kids with me was a last minute decision I mean the Israeli Army has been in I mean horribly attacking North Gaza displacing people and and kidnapping abducting doctors and and nurses and and journalists and from and even the even even the injured people they were they had to evacuate I just imagine I mean people who have been injured and they had some medical care and they had to be um on some some some medical equipment they are taken away from the hospital some of them would die and that's why the Lancet Journal said that more than 200,000 people have been have died or were killed by the Israeli airri the Israeli uh military campaign since October 7th so my wife's family including her father her mother her her siblings and some of the uh the nephews and nieces her grandparents too aged 75 they are now trapped in the family house and they are unable to leave and now the ab my neighbor was killed just a few a few meters away from them by by by by Shel my from a tangel so she worries that if I I'm away from her and she gets some terrible news like to like today's news she she would she would die from from from Pain and grief so she wanted me to be with her and I told her I I I couldn't cancel you know the event at uh at the Brooklyn Public Library and also my event today at NYU so I said okay you come with me and now she came with me as if this would I mean I I don't claim I don't say that I would make her feelings better because I too have family in bethle I have a young sister with three children the youngest is 2 years old and I haven't talked to her for about 10 days it's it's impossible to get in touch with my sister I don't know how she's surviving or whether she's alive alive at this moment uh you wrote on social media six days ago I write with a heavy heart that my cousin Sama 7 years old has been killed in the air strike on their house along with 18 members of her family which is my extended family for our TV audience we are showing an image of sama right now tell us who she is so so s is one of the five children of my aunt Asma who was also injured the mother I mean in the House s was staying with her parents with her siblings with her grandmother who happens to be my my grandmother's sister and I used to call her grandmother because my grandmother passed away when I was very young so my my my my my grandmother's sister with two of her daughters and her grandchildren and two of her daughter-in-laws and the grandchildren are still buried under the rubble until this moment so s was killed in the air strike and the only reason why my aunt and her other children or even though they were wounded the only reason why they they were not killed is that they were staying close to the door because the bomb when it falls it usually hits the middle of the house so my my my my aunt Asma survived the air strike with some injuries along with her husband and four other four children and they had by the way they were my my my my aunt had to walk to the Israeli soldiers who were standing just a few meters away from the bond house so just imagine a criminal killing you and then waiting for you until you are either dead or or or come to them limping and and and she she she told me that she kissed their hands begging them to leave them alone and if she could take with her some wheat flour from the house that she was keeping next to her because there is no food in Gaza so s was seven years old and I remember something very clearly which is that every time I visited my aunt's house especially during theid the the you know after the Ramadan and all after you know the pilgrimage season so we have two big uh AIDS or feasts so I used to visit my aunt and her children are there and this this photo is from I think you showed it but this is from the theid this this is her dress and my aunt would bring um a sheet of paper and and ask her daughters including s yal because I'm an English language teacher so she said Y show show M the new words that you have learned the colors the animals but now S I mean I did not I did not have the chance to bid her farewell this is my cousin and I lost 31 members of my extended family including three first cousins two of them with with their husband and children I didn't get just the chance even to see them before they were buried and I didn't know whether some of them had any part of their bodies intact after the air strikes so just imagine the magnitude of loss that I'm facing as a I'm just one person some some other people lost all their families and we know about the the the new term uh wounded the child no surviving family about more than two 2,000 children had the same case they were the only the so survivors of their family I mean what future is awaiting them no one is asking this question no abuta is an award-winning poet and author he has a new book of poetry out it's called Forest of noise your descriptions now make me think of your little son you you came with your three children yesterday can you read the poem about your son and your daughter yeah sure so by the way this poem was written after May 2021 attacks so my son yazan was uh about 5 years old old my daughter yaa was uh four years old and this is about them now this is very important because you just said this is written in May 2021 half your poems in forest of noise are before last October 7th and the other half after well I mean this tells you this tells you and others a lot of things so this this poem could be written today and if if it was written today it there are so many things that would not be present here because this current genocide is so different from any other uh Wars that Israel launched against the civilian population in the Gaza Strip my son throws a blanket over my daughter Gaza May 2021 at night at home we sit on the floor close to each other far from the windows and the red lights of bombs our backs bang on the walls whenever the house shakes we stare at each other's faces scared yet happy that so far our lives have been spared the walles wake up from their fitful sleep no arms to wipe at their blurry eyes flies gather around the only lit ceiling lamp for warmth in the bitter night cold except when missiles hit and burn up houses and Roads and trees the neighborhood next to us where yazen learned to ride his bike scorched every time time we hear a bomb falling from an F-16 or an F35 Our Lives Panic Our Lives freeze somewhere in between confused where to head next a graveyard a hospital a nightmare I keep my shivering hand on my wrist watch ready to remove the battery if needed my 4-year-old daughter yafa wearing a pink dress given to her by a friend here's a bomb lood she gasps covers her mouth with her dresses Ruffles yazan her 5 and a half yearold brother grabs a blanket worn by his sleepy body he lays the blanket on his sister you can hide now he assures her and I have a video of that it's on my phone I took a video of my son throwing a blanket that's that's how I couldn't forget this moment now you're kids know the hospitals in Gaza that we were just describing um tell us to humanize Kamal adwan Hospital ala Hospital yeah yeah I mean by the way ala hospital so Kamal adwan is run by the Gaza Health Ministry the the Ala hospital is run by the Palestinian red crescent which is an NGO um and and the Ala hospital is U dedicated mainly to the uh people who cannot afford to pay uh health health insurance and uh many of the uh pregnant mothers uh who go to onra clinics are referred to Al the hospital to give birth there for free so it's it's a hospital not only not only for the patient but also for the pregnant women to give birth my sister a uh 30 sorry 35 years old is pregnant and she's about to give birth and there is no hospital near close to her so I don't know what she's going to do um Kamal adwan hospital is the main hospital in Bia and also in B project um and in the past few years it was turned into a children's hospital and I used to take yafa and yzan to that hospital when they feel sick when they have fever when they are injured and I have many friends who used to work as nurses there and I know Dr Ham Abu safia who is the the head of the kamalan hospital right now who we watched just a few minutes ago I mean he is very helpless I mean I use this in my language I say that situation in North G in be or north is catastrophic I mean how many times did I use the same word I mean sometimes I want to stop writing because I'm repeating the same the same word even though the situation is worse so I mean the language is is helpless I mean I use the same the same vocabulary after October 7th it describ the situation in in North Gaza in be lahia I said we had no water no food that was October 12th and now we are October 25th 2024 so I hear I mean does the language help us why do why why does the world make us feel I mean helpless I think I I mean I I I don't like this as a human being we have never never stopped shouting and screaming and showing our pictures and videos can you remind our viewers and listeners who may not have seen you on democ now first soon after October 7th we talked to you in Gaza um we then talk to you or spoke to others about you when you were taken by the Israeli military um then when you were released and made it with your family to Cairo we spoke to you yeah we spoke to you in South Africa and now you have come to the United States but take us on that Journey how you got out and remind us what happened when you were separated from your family and taken by the Israeli military so Emy that that interview that you did with me it was October 12th I can't forget the because that was the last the last day I was in my house I just finished my interview with you on October 12th I think it was uh 300 p.m. which is 8 oh 8 morning yeah I I even didn't pay attention to New York time yeah I mean by the time I finished my interview with you I went down my SI my father and mother and my my brother Hamza and his children and his pregnant wife my brother my brother Muhammad and his wife my sister a with her children who is now pregnant um my sister s and my sister SU about 25 people were in the house with me so I went down and I found my father and my mother packing their their bags and when I talk about bags I talk about children's uh school bags we don't have suitcases by the way which is something that many people don't understand why because we don't have airports we don't need suit suitcases we travel with our backpacks my children's kindergarten backpack I stuff it with some clothes and some I I put some water s some water bottle there so I found my parents packing their their their bags and I I asked him where are you going and they said you know the Israelis just dropped some leaflets ordering the residents of B about 9 90,000 people you know to evacuate and that was the first time I found my parents you know leaving and then I went upstairs I didn't know what to take with me I only took with me the copy one copy the only copy that I had of my first poetry book and I took a bottle of water and some clothes for my children and then we went to the refugee camp and where do you know where we stayed we stayed in the same uh neighborhood that was bummed yesterday where where 150 people were killed and I just told you about the names of the people who were killed including inat who I now remember that uh we got one hour of uh of water from the tab when I when we were in the camp and in fact he would tell tell the neighbors the water is on the water is on fill your buckets so I remember here um and then when the bombing got intense in the refugee camp we thought of going to an honorous school which is just a few hundred meters away from the neighborhood in the camp so we stayed in the in a in a school shelter in jabalia which was later raided by the Israeli Army and by the way a few days ago the Israelis again visited that school took the men out incl and they has they have abducted so many including my S my wife's sister husband he he's he's a brother-in-law to me so he they took him and one reason he he stayed in the school he's a nurse he couldn't leave the refugees in the school without any any any nursing person so he was abducted and he's left with three children the youngest was born after October 7th so when the bombing got intense I had to leave the school with my wife and kids especially because we had the the chance to leave Gaza H for Egypt and and and and on the Salah Street which was described by the Israeli as a save passage I was abducted by the Israeli soldiers I was handcuffed and blindfolded and before that I had to remove all my clothes I was naked for the first time in my life and under gun point two Israeli soldiers were pointing their guns at me and the the the person next to me and then they were we were taken to a place we didn't know I mean it's for me as a Palestinian who was born in Gaza I had never been to Palestine which is now Israel so so that was the first time for me to sleep in my country as a datiny as someone who was blindfolded and handcuffed as someone who didn't know there his wife and children who he left behind we're still breathing just imagine Not only was I taken and blindfolded and handcuffed and and beaten and harassed and insulted they kept saying bad words in Arabic to these are the only words they know in Arabic insulting words but also I did not know whether my wife and kids from whom I was separated were still breathing whether they went to a place that is safe because there is no place that is safe why because when there is occupation there is nothing that's called a safe place and I had also to worry about my mother and father who I left behind in the refugee camp and my siblings and their children I mean I I I I was torn I was torn into a hundred pieces thinking about myself where why are they taking me where are they taking me and I heard the the some young men uh screaming you know some of them were had to be separated from their from their pregnant wives so after 3 days um I was released I was dropped at the same checkpoint well there was International outcry over you having been taken as as as m not as a Palestinian so I think many people cared about me because I am uh a friend on and a writer but they did not maybe um consider maybe doing the same thing with other people it's easy to get someone out uh than getting a whole population uh from under the military uh Fist of the Israeli Army I mean just imagine if if I was not a writer if if I was not a poet if I did not have a publisher if I did not have an um you know some journals and magazine that I wrote for just imagine no one knew about me I would still have been under the Israeli uh custody maybe I could have died just like Dr Adan B who was taken from Al hospital by the way in November last year and he was announced last October he was the best surgeon in the Gaz trip and he was he died he was killed I wanted to ask you about another man another poet but he didn't make it um the Palestinian poet the Islamic University Professor someone you knew rafat alad last on Democracy Now October 10th 2023 rafat was killed by an Israeli strike in December along with his brother sister and four of his nieces this is Scottish actor Brian Cox reciting rafat ELO's poem If I must die and then I want you to share your poem a sort of segue to it a thoughts if I must die a video that went viral if I must die you must live to tell my story to sell my things to buy a piece of cloth and some strings make it white with a long tail so that a child somewhere in Gaza while looking heaven in the eye awaiting his dad who left in Ablaze and bid no one farewell not even to his flesh not even to himself seiz the kite my kite you made flying up above and thinks for a moment an angel is there bringing back love if I must die let it bring hope Let It Be A Tale Scottish actor Brian Cox you know um who played in succession reciting rafat alad's poem If I must die in a video that went viral and you can go to democracynow.org to see our interview with rafat just before he was killed in your book masab abua Forest of noise um talk about rafat and then your kind of rejoiner to this poem I I mean I I knew rat as a professor at the isic University of Gaza he did not teach me but I would say that he taught me a lot uh because when I was uh in my second year he was in Malaysia doing completing his finishing his PhD um and when he returned I was already finishing my courses um so but he was someone who led me uh to the we are not numbers project that he co-founded which is a project that um offer some mentorship for Young Writers I was uh in the beginning of my writing career so he introduced me to the group and uh that is a picture that I took with the strawberries uh we're showing an image of fat holding strawberries yeah yeah we picked that strawberry that same strawberry together in ble in my father-in-law's farm from father my father-in-law's Farm um so yeah I I knew as um as a father he's he he was a Wonder a wonderful father uh uh for his kids and he was a lovely son of his parents his parents still survive I hope in Gaza City um and he's also a professor of English literature and we talk when we when when we when we were talking uh about literature he would talk about Arabic literature and also English literature his favorite poet I think was John dun and in the Arabic language he loved the classical Arabic poems like Al like like he would recite some Arabic poems to me and I was amazed you know um so uh before before was killed he published his poem uh if I must die and he posted it on his Instagram and I read that and I was still in North Gaza it was before I was abducted and it was very heartbreaking for me I mean someone writing about his death and what his he wishes his death to be um um like and I couldn't but try and write my own uh if I must die but I did not call it if I must die I wrote If I'm going to die but after he was killed I retitled the poem which is now called a request a request after if I am going to die let it be a clean death no Rubble over my corpse no broken dishes or glasses and no not many Cuts in my head or chest leave my ironed untouched jackets and pants in the closet so I may wear some of them again at my funeral yeah MAV abuta reading from his new second book of poetry Forest of noise just months after rafat was killed his eldest daughter sha rafat um was also killed an Israeli strike in Gaza along with her husband and two-month-old son uh rat's grandchild yeah yeah I mean just imagine I mean rat became a grandfather after he was killed he was he became a grandfather after he was killed and I mean something that that breaks my heart just like just as it must break break everyone's heart is that when someone is killed they even don't know who was killed with them they don't know I mean did not know that his his daughter sha and her husband ABD I think his name and and and his grandchild were killed after him I mean I don't know whether he knows about this whether I mean he's now I mean feeling a lot of pain knowing about this um so it is it is a campaign of killing the father the mother the sister I would call this not only a genocide it is it's not only a genocide against a people but it's also a genocide against families because when you look at the names of the people who are killed you see the name of the father the mother the children the grandchildren it's not about killing five people from the street or five people in the mosque or the school it's killing a whole family when I tell you that I lost 31 members of my extended family I talk about two first cousins with their husband and their children I'm not talking about my cousin no her husband their children the youngest two or four m can you look into this camera and share your message with the world what you want the world to take away right now about what's happening in your home in Gaza I mean if the world cannot really help us I hope that they will not continue to uh to support the oppressor if you can't really stop this why don't you just go away I mean I I wish the world was ignoring us no they are not ignoring us no they are contributing to our suffering and our the our our the genocidal campaign that Israel has been launching not not since last year since 60 76 years I mean I mean you maybe you just mentioned that um that that blinkin would say says that in a few days you know the the negotiations would start again I mean why don't you say the same things about sending the weapons to Israel why don't you oh in in a few days we will try and send the Israelis some new weapons why don't you take your time and think about what these weapons are going to do why does it take time to resume negotiations and force the Israelis to stop their their their killing of my people why does it take time what why is it difficult to stop this but it's easy to send more and more weapons just leave us leave us alone your choice of a last poem to share with our audience around the world would you like to share the moon or right or left or under the rebel oh under the rebel is long so I would just go with right or left which is a poem that I wrote for one of my my my friend's uh sisters my friend himself was killed with his parents with his uh with with four of his sisters with his two children so the only survivors was were his wife and two other sisters so the the body of my friend is abuin the body of his sister uh 16 years old and his father are still under the so I read this poem about the bodies that remain under the rubel the body of his sister right or left under the rubble her body has remained for days and days when the war ends we try to remove the rubble stone after Stone we only find one small bone from her body it is a bone from her arm right or left it does not matter as long as we cannot find the H from her neighbor's wedding on her skin or the ink from a school pen on a little index finger" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="In a searing address to the UN Security Council meeting on the Middle East and Gaza, American trauma surgeon Dr. Feroze Sidhwa delivered a first-hand account of Gaza's collapsing healthcare system, drawing from his two medical missions to Khan Younis. &quot;I am not here as a policymaker, but as a physician bearing witness to the deliberate destruction of healthcare, the targeting of my colleagues, and the erasure of a people,&quot; he stated, describing surgeries performed on filthy floors without anaesthesia and children dying from preventable causes due to Israel's blockade of medical supplies. With haunting detail, he recounted treating pregnant women &quot;whose pelvises had been obliterated and their foetuses cut in two,&quot; and revealed that 83% of American medics in Gaza reported seeing children shot in the head or chest. &quot;This is not system failure - it has been systematically dismantled through violations of international law,&quot; he emphasised, condemning the man-made famine now killing more civilians than bombs. His testimony peaked with the March 18 mass casualty event at Nasser Hospital, where 221 trauma patients arrived in one morning - 90 dead on arrival, nearly half children - an onslaught no besieged health system could withstand. &quot;Parents memorise their children's clothing to identify remains,&quot; he said, exposing the war's psychological toll: nearly half of Gaza's children are now suicidal, asking, &quot;Why didn't I die with my family?&quot; Dr. Sidhwa implored the Council to enforce seven measures, including an arms embargo, calling their inaction &quot;a testament to collapsed conscience&quot; as Gaza's last doctors and a generation of Palestinians face annihilation. &quot;You cannot claim ignorance,&quot; he concluded, &quot;when children no longer want to live.&quot;&#10;&#10;Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe&#10;Follow us on X:   / ajenglish  &#10;Find us on Facebook:   / aljazeera  &#10;Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/&#10;Check out our Instagram page:   / aljazeeraenglish  &#10;Download AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile&#10;&#10;#UnitedNations #UnitedNationsSecurityCouncil #UNSC #Palestine #Gaza #GazaHumanitarianCrisis #Israel #GazaWar #IsraelGazaWar #GazaHospitals #GazaHumanitarianCrisis #GazaStarvation" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="i now give the floor to Dr Feroh Shidua Please Thank you Mr President Members of the council my name is Dr Fose Sidwa I am an American trauma and critical care surgeon based in Stockton California I come before you today to speak about the Gaza Strip where I have volunteered twice since October 7th first at European Hospital from March 25th to April 8th of last year and most recently at Nasser Medical Complex from March 6th to April 1st of 2025 Both are in the city of Kununas I'm not here as a policy maker or a politician I am a physician bearing witness to the deliberate destruction of a health care system the targeting of my own colleagues and the eraser of a people The constitution of the World Health Organization states that the health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security and is dependent on the fullest cooperation of individuals and states I have taken this to heart and it is the reason I volunteer in conflict zones from Haiti to Ukraine to Gaza In Gaza I operated in hospitals without sterility electricity or anesthetics Surgeries took place on crowded and filthy floors Children died not because their injuries were unservivable but because we lacked blood antibiotics and the most basic supplies that are readily available in any large hospital anywhere else in the world I did not see or treat a single combatant during my five weeks in Gaza My patients were six-year-olds with shrapnels in their heart and bullets in their brains and pregnant women whose pelvises had been obliterated and their fetuses cut in two while still in the womb Mothers sheltering in the hospital cooked bread on hot plates in the emergency department during mass casualty events as we dealt with the reign of fire and death falling around us everywhere Mr President the foundations of life in Gaza family health and community have been shattered The medical system has not failed It has been systematically dismantled through a sustained military campaign that has willfully violated international humanitarian law Civilians are now dying not just from the constant air strikes but from acute malnutrition sepsis exposure and despair Between my two visits to Gaza I witnessed a sharp decline in patients health driven not just by injury but by worsening hunger and malnutrition that left their bodies weaker their wounds slower to heal and their survival far less certain And let's not forget this is a man-made catastrophe It is entirely preventable Participating in it or not allowing it to happen is a choice This is a deliberate denial of conditions necessary for life food shelter water and medicine Preventing genocide means refusing to normalize these atrocities It means refusing to dehumanize the Palestinians to refuse to see them as calories counted or numbers of trucks moved We see now that this way of thinking has brought about a human dignity crisis with an entire people on the edge of survival On March 18th the ceasefire was violated by Israel That day I witnessed the most extreme mass casualty event of my career at Nasser Medical Complex 221 trauma patients arrived in one morning 90 were dead on arrival Nearly half were severely injured children No health system on Earth could cope with this least of all one that is besieged and starved of supplies Hospitals are meant to be sanctuaries Healthcare workers and first responders are supposed to be protected Children are supposed to be protected In Gaza these protections are simply gone Every day the distinction between combatant and civilian is erased Most of my patients were pre-teen children their bodies shattered by explosives and torn by flying metal Many died Those who lived often awoke to find their entire families gone Last year I published in the New York Times a survey of 65 American healthcare workers who had served in Gaza 83% of them reported seeing children shot in the head or the chest I personally treated 13 such cases in my two weeks at European Hospital According to the Warchild Alliance nearly half of Gaza's children are suicidal They ask &quot;Why didn't I die with my sister my mother my father not out of extremism but out of unbearable grief I wonder if any member of this council has ever met a 5-year-old child who no longer wants to live let alone imagined a society in which so many young children feel this way And what astonishes me is not that some children in Gaza have lost the will to live but that any still cling to hope My Palestinian friends mostly healthcare workers no longer speak of resilience or even survival Parents memorize their children's clothing in case they must identify their remains later They pray for one piece of bread to give them before they sleep so that their children might die less hungry if they are killed at night And meanwhile my Israeli and American friends express horror at what is being done in their names Many of us cannot understand how our governments continue to arm this senseless destruction But you in this chamber have the power to stop it Mr President I am here because I have witnessed what is happening in Gaza with my own eyes especially to children and I cannot pretend not to have seen it You too cannot claim ignorance I urge the council and especially my own government to act with urgency on these enforcable measures One demand an immediate and permanent ceasefire including a halt to all arms transfers to all parties to the conflict alongside targeted and lawful sanctions on Israel Two demand the reopening of all of Gaza's crossings and guarantee unrestricted medical evacuations including to hospitals in the West Bank and East Jerusalem where Palestinian patients can be treated by Palestinian doctors with safe return to Gaza assured Three guarantee sustained humanitarian access throughout Gaza allowing all essential supplies shelter food water fuel and medical supplies to reach all people in need Four strongly and explicitly reject the weaponization and politicization of aid embodied by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation whose executive director a veteran of the US Marine Corps publicly resigned on Sunday citing the foundation's lack of adherence to humanitarian principles We must affirm support for existing UN mechanisms back UNRWA and ensure NOS's with expertise in reaching and providing specialized care to those in need have unimpeded full access Five the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages Six the immediate and unconditional release of all healthare workers including Dr Husam Abu Sufi now held in Israeli detention for more than 150 days And seven without delay uphold the UN charter and act now to prevent genocide One day Gaza survivors may have a record of the empty promises made by the members of this council as their wounds deepened and their lives were lost If this council remains silent and fails to act now that record will stand as a testament to a global failure to provide urgent care and to the collapse of our collective conscience I'm pleading with you to do what you were entrusted to do to protect international peace and security and to prevent irreversible harm The steps I mentioned are the very least that is needed I'm asking my own government's representative to hear the voices of the majority of Americans who are calling for the same If this continues there will be no Palestinian doctors left no one to care for the sick and wounded There will be no Palestinians left to rebuild the health care system We are losing a generation before our eyes condemning people to die of hunger disease and despair Deaths that could be easily prevented Thank you I thank Dr Shida for his briefing Make sure to

          <attvalue for="7" value="people on the streets of European cities simply holding a Palestinian flag could be arrested i didn't believe we'd ever reach this degree of paranoia about simply standing up for the rights of Palestinian people joining center stage today is Jeremy Corbin one of the most polarizing figures in modern British politics throughout his political career from being on the political fringe to his tenure as leader of the UK's Labor Party and now as an independent MP Corbin has always campaigned for economic justice peace and a British foreign policy that tries to atone for its imperial legacy in this episode we discuss the price paid for being vocal in supporting and standing in solidarity with Palestine while Corbin also speaks about the future of Europe and how the continent may need to unite in the face of a US-led trade war jeremy Corbin welcome to Center Stage absolute pleasure to be here thank you for inviting me you've been an advocate for Palestinian statethood for decades what would you say the past 18 months have meant for that fight i think the past 18 months has been probably the worst time ever ever for Palestinian people and the loss of life in Gaza and increasingly in the West Bank and not forgetting the plight of people in the refugee camps has just been truly atrocious what it has done is awoken the rest of the world to the plight of Palestinian people so in a perverse kind of way it's probably meant that uh Palestinian recognition more universally is probably nearer now than it was but that's on the back of uh at least 60,000 deaths and the blockade of Gaza now gone on for over 50 days no water no food no power no medicines nothing for 50 days and so I find an element in my mind of disgust at the way in which the world's powers including Britain have continued supplying weapons to Israel knowing full well that they're in breach of international law and bombing civilian targets in Gaza you mention the position of the British government you've been demanding an inquiry into what you describe as complicity what would that inquiry achieve what would that investigation reveal would it bring justice the reason I put it forward is is this i was very involved in opposition to the Iraq war and we believed all along that the war was a illegal and based on utterly false information the allegations that Iraq for example held weapons of mass destruction and at the end of the conflict or we demanded a public inquiry and that inquiry took a long time and came out with a huge document which indicated deficiencies in the decision-making process false information and the inadequate legal advice and so what I've de demanded is now an inquiry into the British government's policy in relation to the supply of arms to Israel and diplomatic support they've given to Israel the reason I've done that is that um we've seen the case that South Africa took to the International Court of Justice and uh that court gave its opinion that acts of a genocidal nature are taking place the International Criminal Court followed that up with arrest warrants including three arrest arrest warrants but one particularly for Benjamin Netanyahu and yet throughout all this Britain continued supplying some arms to uh Israel um David Lami eventually said they were going to suspend some of the arms licenses 30 out of the 300 that Britain had at the time we still don't know what those licenses really are weapons were still being supplied and the Royal Air Force Base in Cyprus Acretier is also being used as a staging point and we also are aware that 15% of the total number of components of every F-35 jet are made in Britain they couldn't fly without the British parts they're still being supplied and um the government's response is that uh they abide by international humanitarian law but they can't upset the global supply chain of the F-35 because they don't know which parts go to which country i'm sorry that's just utter nonsense it's just nonsense they know exactly where every single one of those parts goes those industries are very well organized and very careful on their recordeping um and so since there's been no answer I've then um written to the prime minister publicly um and I've got the support of a lot of members of parliament of almost all parties in signing this letter demanding an inquiry um so far interestingly there's been no formal response which is interesting it hasn't been rejected now I'm not predicting that's all going to go through straight away it's not it's building up the campaign we need to know the truth and the people of Britain need to know that their country is complicit in this your position with regards to Palestinian rights has also meant quite a lot of political very aggressive political backlash for you um would you say your position was ever misunderstood or or or distorted distorted and grievously misunderstood um I've been to Palestine on nine occasions i've been in all parts of Palestine i've been in Israel as well i've been in Jordan i've been in the refugee camps it's not as if I don't come to this position without some knowledge on the ground of it all the most disgraceful accusations were thrown at me that um uh I held anti-semitic views i absolutely do not i work with many Jewish organizations that are also appalled to what's going on in Palestine the issue is human rights and justice and a humanitarian approach to issues around the world and uh last year uh the Labour Party decided that I wasn't apparently a fit person to be a member of parliament any longer was that hurtful yeah i joined the Labour Party when I was 16 i spent my whole life in the Labor Party i've held every position there is to hold in the Labor Party from a street collector through to leader of the party and for them the new leadership to then less than a year later after I'd stepped down as leader do that to me um did you think of giving up altogether no never never why would I give up it's not about me personally it's about the arguments it's about the issues and it's about the principles and I feel what we did in uh my constituency in Islington North last July was to show that there are people who are prepared to listen to a voice for justice and humanity and um we won that election i'm very proud of that result i want to go back to to the backlash because being critical of Israeli government policy these days can have very serious sometimes devastating consequences for everyone for people people have lost their jobs they've lost visas they've lost their freedom did you ever think that you would come to that no I didn't um not in the slightest uh I did not believe we'd ever get to the situation where people on the streets of European cities holding a Palestinian flag or anywhere else in the world America for that matter simply holding a Palestinian flag which is a UN recognized entity should we say could be arrested i didn't believe we'd ever reach this degree of paranoia about simply standing up for the rights of Palestinian people and so I think it's important that we all speak out on it and the demonstrations around the world have shown that uh despite what some of the world's media do despite what mainly Western European North American governments do the majority of the world's population are with the Palestinian people and through the progressive international we have set up the H group um of UN member states there's um nine joined initially led by um Brazil South Africa Malaysia um to adhere to the rulings of the ICJ and the ICC and form a group within the UN to push for that but what's happened now with South Africa the United States putting extraordinary tariffs on South Africa very very critical of the South African government on everything but really it's because of their attitude towards Palestine but isn't it staggering that you have to go and form a group of countries within the UN to actually follow the courts decisions it's like what does that tell us about global order and and international law what it shows is that the um powerful particularly the United States but they're not alone in this really do not want or like international law the US has never signed up to the international criminal court and I don't think it ever will but what it shows is something very dangerous about the idea of international law i mean I I was born late 40s i grew up in that post-war consensus period where international law meant something where the United Nations was seen as the great hope and uh we now see the United Nations underfunded inadequate and lacking authority and power to actually deal with things so the UN has not managed to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza or the West Bank has not managed to bring about a ceasefire in Ukraine has not managed to yet to bring about an effective peace settlement in Yemen Congo or Sudan and so is it losing its credibility it's it's lack of power lack of ability is a real problem so there's two factors I think we need to look at here one is what is influencing those governments think of how much money has been made out of Palestine Ukraine Sudan Yemen Congo by global arms companies all of which are based in Western Europe or North America don't think there isn't an arms industry pressure also in China and Russia but that's of a different order compared to that of the USA so that's part of it the other side of it which gives me some hope is the numbers of people that have been involved in publicly going out and demonstrating their support for Palestine in Britain I estimate more than a million people at various times in the past 18 months have taken part in public activities and support of Palestine that's a lot of people for a country that doesn't have a tradition of mass demonstrations and as you said in in um in a in a dark way this particular onslaught of Gaza has made more people aware of what the Palestinians have been going through for the past 70 plus years not only for the past 18 months exactly too much of it is put in the narrative it all started in October 23 no it didn't it's been going on for a very long time in various forms sometimes more vicious than others but it has been going on but I think where a lot of the global media have missed out is on what's happening in the West Bank at the same time gaza does get through the bravery of journalists such as in your channel do does get coverage whereas the West Bank basically until recently is not and so there is clearly an Israeli strategy of um destroying the Palestinian villages on the West Bank increasing the power of the occupation forces and of the settlement policy the ICJ rulings were not just about genocide they were also about the illegality of the occupation at all you mentioned the United States what do you think the return of Donald Trump will mean for this crisis but also for the future of Palestinians well I don't think the result of the US election would make much difference either way camela Harris had um very very pro-Israeli views also and she and the Biden administration of which she was part had supplied enormous numbers of weapons but she wasn't talking about developing a sea resort in Gaza right i guess Trump takes it a stage further and announces that he wants to expel the entire population from Gaza shift them somewhere else now that's got a complete kickback but the US economic power over all of the neighboring states is absolutely huge particularly the money they put in to Egypt and other countries is so enormous so Trump's election has been disastrous for the Palestinian people that's for sure what about more broadly the return of Donald Trump to the White House has meant that every day there are either new tariffs or antagonistic statements about several issues europe is in a very difficult position do you think there could be I don't know an opportunity here for Europe to stand on its own or will it have to align with US interests i think we're going to look back on this period of 2025 in years to come as been a period of sort of unbelievable levels of absurdity when the president of the US goes into the rose garden reels off a whole list of tariffs he's going to put on to places and um announced that this is going to make America great again in reality a tariff policy will do what uh damage supply chains damage US manufacturing capability lead to inflation and probably a depression in the United States but it will also actually realign the world's economies in a way that he doesn't want and probably couldn't have predicted and so the BRICS nations Brazil Russia India China South Africa and uh those that have more recently joined will become more important and will become a global source of trading and will build their own currency as well so do you think it will backfire yeah so the backfire is going to be that US influence in the world be much less now the question about Europe economically Trump is not really very interested in relations with anybody else is only interested in um in the US in to some well to a great extent and that means that Europe has then got to think a bit more about its role it's going to have to build a trading relationship with the southern countries and with those countries particularly Canada and Mexico as well as the BRICS nations rather than depending everything on trade with the United States the response so far by the European Union has been beyond disappointing it's been devastating where Ursan Leiden now proposes that Europe become a defense superpower spends more and more money on weapons and manufacturing weapons for what is it to continue a war the cold war with more with Russia rather than searching for a way to end the Ukrainian conflict or is it about interventions in Africa where you think strategically 20 30 50 100 years time the continent with the most mineral resources is Africa and that is why the interests are increasingly moving into military interventions in Africa so I think we need to look at this as a sort of global point you have been very critical throughout your career also of British foreign policy especially in the Middle East would you say the UK has had the opportunity to reckon with its colonial past or has it been playing imperial games by other means there's something in the European psyche in which the principle of empire has never gone away i give you an example whenever there's a crisis somewhere in Africa or anywhere else in the world and the European Union starts thinking well how will we we react to this crisis what do they do but reach for the former colonial power so if something happens in Nishair in Sagal Mali so on France France must deal with that mhm if it's Nigeria the British can do that it's like the colonial mentality has never gone away and in Britain uh I think there is still a huge imperial mentality in the thought processes within foreign policy in the processes within the military and increasingly um ever since Johnson changed the strategy which had been adopted for 50 years of ending the global role of Britain militarily britain now seems to think that by spending so much on defense we can have a global role and so this thinking has led to the government in the past month announcing5 billion pounds cut in disability benefits in order to increase defense expenditure so that means we are impoverishing people with disabilities retaining a benefit cap on the poorest children in our society in order to pay for more bombs and weapons europe is becoming more and more instead of the prosperous equalitydriven continent it was intended to be is becoming more and more socially and economically divided as we spend more and more on weapons of war and uh that cannot be good for the future going back to the situation in the Middle East right now the Israeli government has insisted that you will fight until victory seeing the pictures of Gaza today the levels of destruction are staggering unprecedented what will victory look like and I remember a joyous visit to a school in Jabilia refugee camp some years ago before the intensity of the fighting has got worse i remember meeting the children in the school and talking to them about their lives they showed me their artwork they read me their poetry and it was lovely visit i spent quite a lot of time there then we went onto the roof of the school and from the roof of the school you can see the fence you can see the machine gun imp placements you can see where they can't go and to the north you can see Ashcolon however these children were getting the best education that ENRA could give them and um they were full of hope and full of optimism that school is rubble what happened to children i had no idea and um I've been to the universities in Gassa City and so on all of that is now destroyed so even if there was a complete end to the whole conflict tomorrow you've got basically a 2 million people with no homes to live in no water no sanitation and uh a mental health crisis and so the trauma will never ever go away and uh it does require that uh Israel withdraws it does require that a huge amount of money is provided to the Palestinian people to rebuild Gaza in their image not Donald Trump and golf courses and resorts and all this nonsense gaza was traditionally a very productive place it was the home of fresh fruit home of vegetables delightful strawberries farming projects they were doing really well in Gaza and they were trying to make Gaza self-sufficient in fresh fruit and vegetables and so all that is now just destroyed and deliberately done by Israel deliberately financed and sanctioned by the USA and Western Europe we're coming to the end of this interview and I want to ask you about a look back at your career we're coming up to 50 years of of public service if I'm not mistaken you're going to give people my age next aren't you no no no i won't i I'll stop here but but I did speak to one of your constituents and and she volunteered in your campaign last year and she told me this he said the main impact of the Corbin era was that the thought of real change didn't seem far away mainly due to the fact that the man that was supposed to change everything for us was one of us and the whole movement was focused on the collective is that how you want people history to remember you i spent my life um obviously politically active and active in trade unions but also active in trying to ensure that people don't get forgotten and left behind but there are a huge number of people all over Western Europe that are looking for an alternative which is of peace which is of social justice which is of environmental sustainability which isn't the politics of condemning people all the time it's the politics of trying to include and inspire people and so um new political organizations are growing up all across Europe the future is in our hands it doesn't have to be run by the minority of global corporations it doesn't have to be run by the arms trade technology doesn't have to be our enemy it can be something that gives us opportunity and empowerment but above all why should we be destroying this planet condemning so many people to a life of the most desperate poverty and at the same time spending last year $2.4 trillion dollar on weapons of destruction all around the world come on guys we can do it differently and do it better that's my life's work and it's not stopped chair McCorbin

of an Israeli ground offensive on the area and caused by its politicians to permanently expel Palestinians from the strip fears are growing of yet another the force population transfer people in power investigates we should create a humanitarian problem that will force Egypt and turkey and Europe to absorb the Arabs as refugees the purpose of the Zionist project was the Eraser of the Palestinian people the methodology was mostly expulsion intimidation and massacres Ya Allah Ya Allah Ya Allah since October 7th 2023 about 2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have had to flee for their lives to escape death and destruction which has followed them even in areas they've been told are safe zones thear thear came Israel's war on Gaza has wrought an unprecedented humanitarian disaster push to and cornered in rafah through air and land assaults by the Israeli Army gazans fear the worst people and power set out to investigate if population transfer of the Palestinians in Gaz and the occupied West Bank is Israel's ultimate goal as of February 21st 2024 close to 30,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli Army and more than 60,000 wounded and maimed thousands more are missing many presumed dead under the rubble Israel's real aim is clear is to empty the land of Palestinians Marwan Masher Jordan's former foreign minister and once ambassador to both Washington and Tel Aviv has long been involved in Arab Israeli relations Israel is obliterating all forms of life in Gaza not just human life but the infrastructure the schools the places of worship uh the hospitals in a clear attempt to make Gaza uninhabitable so that Palestinians are forced to leave Jordan has taken the lead in warning the world about the dangers of large-scale population transfers of Palestinians I I think on the first part of the question on the issues of refugees coming to Jordan and I think I can quite strongly speak on behalf not only of Jordan as a nation but of uh our friends in Egypt that is a red line uh because I think that is the plan by certain of The Usual Suspects to try and create de facto issues on the ground no refugees in Jordan no refugees in Egypt a lot of people in the west uh look at this and say how can people not allow uh Palestinians to get in but in fact this is a position coordinated with the Palestinians themselves who have learned the lesson from 1948 who do not wish to leave uh and so the the decision to close the border is actually a decision not to allow Israel to solve the conflict at the Palestinians expense and drive Palestinians out of their land most UN member States including Western Powers have expressed concerns for the fate of gza's 2.3 million people they have publicly condemned Israeli politicians and leaders who call for the expulsion of the Palestinians on January 28th at least 10 Israeli cabinet ministers participated in a reset settle Gaza event in Jerusalem Israeli National Security Minister itamir benir addressed a cheering [Music] crowd there will be no Arabs in the Gaza Street they will go to Turkey to Scotland to Britain I want them out of Gaza and we'll use different methods one of them is not to give them any human humanitarian Aid so the countries of the world will have pity on them and take them at one of the few entry points into Raza Israeli settlers storm Aid convoys preventing them from delivering food and medicine one of the families waiting for Aid is that of Amir jaaji in October 2023 they fled Gazza City to a refugee camp in Rafa after their home was bombarded and their neighborhood destroyed experts say plans to displace and transfer these Palestinians began decades ago the most important method used by these European Jewish settlers to take over a land that will belonged to the Palestinians and build their own Homeland on it the main method they were using was ethnic cleansing expulsion transfer if you want Professor Elan Pape is Israel's foremost historian on the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians it really begins in the late 19th century when an ideological movement called Zionism uh decides that the best way to solve the problem of anti-Semitism in Europe and the best way for a modern future for the Jewish people is in the land of Palestine so in that period between the late 19th century and the end of the first world war Zionism becomes effect on the ground in in Palestine at the time it was the United Kingdom which was a Chief Architect and Ally of zist aspirations in Palestine the British ruled Palestine as part of their colonial portfolio between 1918 and 1948 so in the mid 1920s the Zionist movement succeeds in buying land in Palestine in two places called Wadi haari and marbar before Zionism people also bought Land There were transaction but the custom was The Villages who lived there for centuries remain I mean the change of ownership does not appro the Zionist as land owners the first thing they do they go to the British government and say you should evict The Villages so already in 1926 they evicted 11 Villages uh which means few thousand people were the First Palestinian victims of ethnic cleansing deprived of their farmlands expelled Palestinian villagers became part of the urban working class over the next decade Palestinian resistance against Zionist settlers took the form of strikes and rallies and increasingly armed resistance killings of Palestinian leaders by the British contributed to the 1936 Arab Revolt after the Revolt the British sent a commission to Palestine and the commission was the first to think of the idea of two states that included the relocation the term was of some of the population Professor Assam Nassar is a Palestinian historian whose focus is the history of the British mandate period the main champion at the time was someone with the name of you vites and whites was the head of the Jewish National Fund whose job was to acquire lands for Jewish use only uh the discussions went further to the level that they started to think of where do we move these Palestinians so when we reach the end of the Mandate that is May 1948 you can see that the Zionist movement managed to buy five to 6% of the land of Palestine that's all because people resisted and uh not everybody was willing to send land understanding that purchase of land immediately is followed by eviction of people it's a settler Colonial movement of a project of displacement and replacement like all set the colonial movements if they don't complete the Takeover of the land and the transfer of the people they will continue because they really believe ideologically that without a total control of the land geographically but also demographically namely to have it an absolute majority or just an absolute presence that's also the main motivation for the Israeli edin today in the Gaza Strip and also it's the Israeli plans for the day after while the refugees in Rafa ponder their day after moment that day came for yakui in the spring of 1948 when Zionist forces expelled them from their home in lifa outside Jerusalem leaving their homes uninhabitable and banning them to this day from ever [Music] returning Yak keeps his family property Deeds photos and a house key from lifa close to his heart first of to prepare a master plan for the expulsion in March called Plan D plan dallet and in April and the beginning of may they implemented and the first stage of Plan D was to take over the urban space of Palestine and they depopulate most of the Palestinian cities out of the 75,000 people who lived in hia only 3,000 remain hi's old Arab neighborhoods today are sprinkled with Arabic names signs here and there and old photographs on the homes of those who were driven out south of hia yea was another major Palestinian Port City that was forcibly depopulated by Zionist forces samad's family was among the few that managed to remain the main tools for uh ethnic lensing of Palestine between 1947 and 1949 was Violence by different Zionist terrorist groups at that time the British called them terrorist groups all the important Palestinian cities yaa Ram people were expelled if you are imagining what is what is now being done to the Palestinians in Gaza so they are pushing all the Palestinian population towards the city of Rafa towards the border and they said clearly that their strategic plan is expulsion and they said that the preferable scenario is total expulsion of 2.3 million people from Gaza to Sinai and then they not also want to keep them in sa they want to spread them all over the world the Israeli Ministry of Intelligence on October 13th 2023 recommended the forcible and permanent expulsion of the 2.3 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip to Egypt's Sinai Peninsula after a leaked copy was published by the Israeli magazine plus 972 Israel's Ministry of intelligence verified the authenticity of the document the vast majority of gazza's new refugees are descendants of families expelled from what is now Israel including Amir jaaji and her family for the majority were expelled through the sea because Jaffa is a coastal city those who went South I'm talking about tens of thousands of people were expelled to Gaza Gaza is only Gaz Gaza is only 65 kilometers far from Jaffa Juliet Tuma is one of the few Aid workers who's been able to enter Gaza during the war places like schools for example had to be converted into shelters what we call and even those shelters were never spared during the war we have recorded more than 300 people who were killed during those hits and over a thousand people who were injured only in unare facilities the so-called evacuation or ERS that the Israeli authorities um kept on issuing especially the first one under which at least 1 million people were impacted they created this sense of sheer panic and people quite often just left and left everything behind experts say today's events are a continuation of a s decade long Israeli practice of forcing Palestinians out of their homes and then barring them from ever returning in first of all there was a ethnic cleansing of about 300,000 Palestinians in the immediate aftermath of the June 67 War since 67 until uh today Israel used an incremental policy of ethnic cleansing around half a million Palestinians were uh expelled in one way or another or ban from returning which is the same past policies demonstrate that attempts to end Gaza are not new in 1967 and there was a plan particularly of uh reducing the number of refugees in Gaza and there were talks about let's destroy the refugee camps and transfer this population to Jordan and until Jordan started to prevent gazin from entering Jordan a total of 12,000 gazin were let into Jordan in 1969 and temporarily settled in a refugee camp near jash the Gaza Camp is the poorest most marginalized camp in Jordan and that's because the residents of that camp they don't have the national ID that they need to allow them to work nazal is a co-founder of a Cooperative that helps gazan women refugees in Jordan find culturally relevant employment Amal aradi is the descendant of gazen Palestinians who were driven out of their homes twice by Israeli forces so you can see over the past 75 years consistent attempts to erase Palestinian identity simple ways like co-opting hos but T is a way for us to affirm the existence and continuity of the Palestinian identity so now you see symbols like the watermelon like embroidery like the cfia even without embroidery being used within the global solidarity movement and within the Palestinian diaspora as a further confirmation not only do we exist but now everyone knows that we exist over the years Jordan became a way station for millions of Palestinians pushed out of their homes and expelled into other countries I am a descendant of AAR solite family God bless his soul ABD my father and he s is in katamon which is in the west part of Jerusalem which was occupied in 48 so we were forced to leave or we were kicked out in the war of 48 these are parts of the structural and Architectural plans of our home in katamon and I see the stamp date and it says City engineering department 4th of January 1945 this is which I was very happy to see or find my father's signature as an owner and that's his name here Muhammad ATA runs a farm in the Jordan Valley right across from his birthplace in Jericho he is one of up to 4 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan who await the moment they can return to their former homes and we left Jero when I was 13 during the war 67 one of the things that is kept in my memory is how we left all the whole family we were 12 children and my mom and maybe some of the neighbors all backed in one vehicle well I remember another thing that isra Al ples were bombing people as they were leaving talking about things repeating itself and one family that was killed with an airplane an Israeli airplane was killed here not far from the farm across the Jordan River in the occupied West Bank Israel has walled in and isolated most urban areas and declared many rural Communities closed military are areas a samama a community of 300 was declared a closed military zone in May 2023 and its residents expelled in 2023 alone a dozen such communities were banished at gunpoint the people of aamia now live in Barracks less than 15 km from their former homes in the occupied West Bank more than 300 Palestinians have been killed by both Israeli settlers and the Army since the war in Gaza began in a parallel Battlefield Israel has a mechanism of about 200,000 people are daily employed to police the Palestinians wherever they are and part of this policing is also dealing with sometime individual cases of ethnic cleansing but it's a Perpetual reality it doesn't it doesn't end what Jordan and Egypt today are doing is Raising awareness in the International Community to the question of mass transfer uh to Israel's real aims so that such a scenario does not develop we cannot uh today say that mass transfer is a thing of the past that cannot be [Music] done Ford" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] men have been fighting underground for centuries before gunpowder was even invented soldiers sneaked into castles through secret tunnels spies use them for getting in and out of fortified camps the ancient Romans used tunnels the Mongols used them Ivan the Terrible used tunnels to dig under the walls of the city of Kazan and bring it down so the tunnels under Gaza are not a new military challenge but they remain one of the world's most difficult it's actually difficult to believe that with all the modern technology and inventions that go into powering our 21st century War Machine something as ancient and simple as a tunnel could still pose such a big challenge to the world's most advanced armies in 2001 Osama Bin Laden outlasted a Relentless us bombing campaign by hulling up in the tunnels and caves of torab Bora even 15,000lb bombs and 100 air strikes in a day failed to break through let's look at the first world war armies on both sides were digging and counter digging Switzerland for example built an entire series of military fortresses under the Swiss Alps but the West also realized that regular soldiers could not fight at their best inside tunnels in 1914 the British army started getting in Miners and training them for military tasks Britain created special Bantam troops these were soldiers who were shorter and thinner than average in fact smaller size was one natural advantage that Asian armies had when they faced Western Invaders Invaders who were bigger in size strength and number tunnels became almost a symbol of resistance against a stronger enemy Japan used tunnels extensively to defend Pacific Islands against Allied invasion years later the Viet Kong fighting the US in Vietnam used tunnels to evade their enemies and launch surprise attacks and these were extremely effective attacks they cost the US heavily despite the fact that America had its own underground Warfare specialists in Vietnam they were known as the tunnel rats but the tunnel rats were up against a vast underground Network and an enemy that was agile inventive and determined the vietcong's network of tunnels was incredibly sophisticated they had armories hospitals mes hols manufacturing centers and storage facilities all underground and there were different varieties squads siiz tunnels which were generally less than 6 ft deep and 100 ft long there were company-sized tunnels which were WI rer but did not have too many compartments and then there were Battalion siiz tunnels which could be as deep as 50 ft underground and sometimes had up to four different levels many key connecting parts of these tunnels were as narrow as possible the walls were angled it was almost impossible for an American Soldier to fit through many of these tunnels and they were extensively booby trapped they were hard to spot from outside they had camouflaged airshafts disguised entrances almost imp pregnable even the B-52 bombs that the Americans dropped could not destroy many of the Vietcong tunnels and all of this 60 years ago so it's not difficult to imagine the level of sophistication that may exist in the tunnels beneath Gaza the tunnels under Gaza were built before Hamas had even formed and they were built by Smugglers who used them since the 1980s for smuggling goods under the the Egypt border most of the Earth in Gaza is rich in clay except near the coast which means that it's easy to dig through and does not need complex supports now over time the Palestinians realized that the tunnels could have a military use and they extended the underground Network Hamas expanded and utilized the tunnel system that they inherited with an eye to strategy and since they were operating beneath territory that they controlled they didn't have to worry about noise or vibrations alerting the enemy so the tunnels expanded quickly so much so that when Israel attacked Gaza in 2014 the IDF was stunned at the extent of the tunnels which was reported at the time to have surpassed 100 kilm Israel began setting up specialized units for underground Warfare fairly early starting with the combat engineers known as yaham set up in the '90s this unit was almost doubled in size after the 2 14 Gaza W that's when Israel really came face to face with the complex challenge of the modern Hamas tunnels now Israel has a commander unit called samur or the weasels they tunnel Warfare Specialists trained in undercover assault techniques leading the IDF when they enter the Gaza tunnels now the first thing to crack for Israel are the entrances to the tunnels these could be in the tens of thousands in Gaza most of them are hidden they're inside homes garage es shops warehouses under rubbish dumps and now probably under heaps of rubble now what Israel has been doing is using drones for 24/7 surveillance they're using Advanced software to analyze movement patterns and they're also using human intelligence from informers on the ground to build up a map of these crucial entrances they don't know it all but they're hoping that they know enough most of the Gaza tunnels have several entrances at each end so that if even some are discovered and blocked others will stay usable underground the tunnels are all interconnected so that even if one entire section is blocked off that may not make a big impact it's this interconnected underground web that Israel needs to map underground where GPS doesn't work satellite signals cannot reach Israel will have to fall back on magnetic sensors and INE movement trackers plus they can't use lights because that would give away their presence so night vision goggles are crucial and the US has been shipping hundreds of these to Israel preparing for just this battle underground in the darkness Israel's underground units won't have radio communication with the surface so again they may have to rely on Old School methods like field telones that's technology from over a 100 years ago Israel soldiers will have to stop at every Junction of the tunnel to map their positions secure the area and leave some troops to defend against counterattacks every time they find a shaft they'll need to figure out if the area above is controlled by Hamas or has been taken by Israel because an attack could come from above at any moment now imagine repeating this 50 times 100 times yes Israel has drones and robots but their movement is limited and signals underground may not be effective and then there will be the obstacles underground booby traps IEDs smoke bombs to suffocate Intruders may be triggered by motion sensors or light sensors Hamas has had years to set up hidden cameras underground detection devices to alert them of intruders and wires and cables that may trigger explosions if they're cut this means the entire section of the tunnel could collapse with one wrong move trapping Israel's forces it's not only Hamas who may use toxic gases underground Israel might also use chemical agents such as tear gas then there's the option of using water to flood the tunnels it's been used in the past Egypt for example poured sewage water into the smuggers tunnels going into Gaza from its side of the Border but this is such a huge tunnel complex that some experts have said there's simply not enough water in Gaza there's been a lot of Buzz about Israel's sponge bomb a device that creates rapidly expanding foam when triggered which hardens to form a kind of plug that will block a tunnel but the chemicals in this sponge bomb are dangerous ones and there have been reports of Israeli soldiers blinded after mishandling the bomb the simplest solution to many people may simp simply seem to be blowing up the tunnels but such a massive engineering feat during an active war is next to Impossible the whole of Gaza May quite simply [Music] collapse first there's the question of size there's no room underground to maneuver machine guns and rifles then there's the darkness The Flash after firing an ordinary pistol will leave Israeli troops temporarily blind especially especially if they're using night vision goggles then there's a question of space standing in a tunnel only one person can fire at a time at most two if one person kneels and the other person stands you're likely to be so close to the enemy that using something like a grenade could harm your own side as well the most likely option for the Israelis will be the smaller caliber weapons with sound suppressors that will prevent muzzle flashes again they'll be falling back on age-old weapons like knives tried and tested over Generations in hand-to-hand combat in this Arena every step could mean death" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="good afternoon everyone it's your host Danny Hiong back for another live stream just 14 hours later it is good to see all of you please hit that like button as we get started we have a very big panel today that I'm going to introduce to you in just a minute but first to just introduce what we are going to speak about today uh there's been stunning blows to the IDF from the resistance in Gaza we've seen Yemen exhausting the Iron Dome on a daily basis and of course the cruel and unusual weaponization of aid by the Israeli regime USbacked its fragility has never been more apparent now Netanyahu is facing even more internal opposition as the genocide drags on with no end in sight and with no notable achievements beyond the complete devastation of Israel's global reputation at a historic rate what is the state of the resistance as we enter month number 20 of this gruesome genocide in Gaza and the proliferation of regional war and regional resistance to discuss all of this I have three of my most trusted and of course uh just prolific voices journalists uh on these matters first let me introduce Professor Muhammad Mandi of the University of Tan geopolitical analyst professor Mandi good to see you again thank you and then we have Loki he is a hip-hop artist a journalist an activist you can find his tour tickets in the video description below he's going on tour this fall loki good to see you good to see you Danny thanks for having me and then we have Ali Abuima he's chief editor over at the Electronic Antifa uh a publication you all need to follow uh Ali good to see you again thanks Danny hi everyone all right well let's get started well I actually wanted to begin with there is this very uh it's it's making the rounds and we've been talking about here on this show and and we've spoken about it before the uh state of this forever war and genocide in Gaza now it's taking a very strange turn where it's been revealed that Israel has been arming and funding uh groups that some former Israeli officials are saying are are affiliated with ISIS this is what uh Benjamin Netanyahu had to say in response to that it's the first time Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly admitted to Israel aiding armed Palestinian groups in Gaza on the advice of security officials we activated clans in Gaza that oppose Hamas what's wrong with that this is only good and saves the lives of IDF soldiers so maybe I can turn to you Loki about this what do you know about this development because as we've talked about we have these reserveists these settlers not wanting to fight there's been desertions there's very strict and repressive laws about this but what exactly is going on here why is Israel and Netanyahu why are they so uh joyful and jovial about what they're doing with regard to these so-called Some are calling them gangs some are calling them ISIS what's your assessment well it's important also to contextualize this in a trajectory of Israel's support for this essential inversion of Zionism a sort of mirror inversion of Zionism in the region we know for example that when uh you had a sort of appearance of dashes in the Sinai and they actually kidnapped and executed some Egyptian soldiers on camera the exact thing that the dash um individuals said is they said this person is guilty of smuggling weapons to the apostates in Hamas this was the exact words which were uttered by a dash individual in the Sinai before this Egyptian soldier was executed now the fascinating thing to me which struck me as strange is that ISIS would be using this way of discussing uh a Palestinian resistance group and that the reason for execution would be that alone and so to me it seemed as if Israel was perhaps pushing a button in Egypt to uh maybe warn the Egyptian regime or the Egyptian military more specifically when you look at the development of ISIS and Jebet Nusra which is kind of a sister organization in Syria it is a known fact Elizabeth Ciro the uh Israeli spy who is currently in Iraq published an article in Foreign Policy in which she stated clearly that 12 groups within Syria were being funded by the Israelis and were being paid a wage actually and one of those groups was Jabetusra we know for example and you know what were the rest of those 12 groups um you also have to take into account that when Pretty Patel the uh British home secretary who had to resign um because before that she'd been in charge of uh Britain's international aid and she met with had 13 meetings with Israeli government officials without informing the British government including with Netanyahu but one of those meetings was about the siphoning of funds to um groups like Jebad Nusra in Syria um in a way for Israel to cover up the uh movement of uh funds towards these people and the amazing thing about both this and the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation debacle which has developed is that the information about the funding of these organizations has come from the Israeli political elite so you've had in the case of the Gaza Humanitarian um foundation it was Ya Laid who comes out and says they've set up shell companies and this is Mossad money now we've known for a long time that the way the Israel lobby has functioned is the setting up of shell companies the the pager attack in Lebanon is also another example of the setting up of shell companies it's what Israel does and uses the western world as a playground for this and is able to launder money in different directions to achieve specific objectives so now both this and this uh funding of Abu Shab and his gang um of of you know Dlan is somebody that is famous for collaborating with the Israelis against the Palestinians in Gaza but I I always felt that there are many dans it comes in in in many different guises and many different masks and and one of them will be a a a more dash type of orientation as we've seen across uh the region but so this funding came out because Avidor Lieberman um actually had said that this is what the Israeli government is doing so actually now when these political figures are going to war with each other secrets are falling out which actually have a lot of benefit for the rest of us to know and form an idea of of what is happening here but you know this is not new israel has been doing it across the region for a long time it's important to also understand what is the function of a Golani in Syria it's not that he might normalize it's not that he um uh he might stand up to them no it's a simple fact that he was cultivated by the very same British external intelligence which cultivates the Palestinian Authority so that is the model government for the region which Israel Britain and the United States deems acceptable it's either a Palestinian authoritarian um a Palestinian authoritarian um authority uh type model perhaps with a dash flavor so there's always the chance of sewing internal chaos and there's always the opportunity to push sectarianism against the only forces in the region who are actively stopping Israel that's basically the option that people in the region have and Israel rules Syria today let's be clear israel rules Syria it bombs wherever it wants why is it that even BBC journalists can be stopped stripped handcuffed by the Israeli soldiers in southern Syria golani rules nothing and he is bending over backwards to try to be allowed to have some form of briefcase independence but it seems that even that is not going to be um possible within the the Zionist imagination this is in a state of constant expansion and and as I say this information that's come out about the funding of this particular um group of thugs in Gaza is interesting um not new more uh kind more kinds of leaks like this are going to come out from the Israeli political elite and I think that's ultimately a good thing yeah Professor Mandi what does this what does this tell you about the state of things because you know uh as Loki was talking uh he said that one of the reasons that this is happening is because Israel wants to get rid of all the forces that are fighting for Palestinians well one of those is Palestinians themselves and in Kunist there's been heavy fighting jabalia there's been heavy fighting actually in Kunis the reports are 17 dead are wounded in just a day of Israeli soldiers i mean I I mean what does this say to you that Israel is going to these lengths to what they claim to be is uh to get rid of Hamas and the resistance uh what's your assessment of this the the regime has been using uh such groups for a very long time and uh Loki is absolutely correct uh when we look at Syria uh the u from the very beginning of the uh dirty war in Syria we saw that uh al-Qaeda was cooperating with the United States they were on the same side of the battlefield and the famous uh tweet or sorry the famous email uh that I and others have tweeted so many times of Jake Sullivan to Hillary Clinton jake Sullivan the previous uh US uh national security adviser where he said in Syria al-Qaeda is on our side that email was on February the 12th 2012 so that is how the United States works that's how the Israeli regime works the Israeli regime actually in its Hebrew press it's much more open about its uh sinister uh views and its sinister activities than it is in its English press so uh if people go to the translations there's a lot more material out there but they have openly in the previous decade spoken about how they've been supporting ISIS al-Qaeda and other extremist groups in Syria to undermine the previous Syrian government and alongside the occupied Golan Heights the Syrian Golan the the Israelis were supporting al-Qaeda and ISIS both of these groups had bases alongside the Golan Heights and uh whenever the Syrian army would try to advance they would strike them with artillery or with tank fire or other means to drive them back and they would treat the injured ISIS and al-Qaeda militants terrorists uh in their own hospitals they would give them weapons they'd give them food they give them uh they'd also be funding all all other terrorists and in Syria we had a host of different groups and now we see how the infighting in Syria's uh beginning again uh but uh in in the case of the Gaza Strip I think it's going to be more difficult for the Israelis this is not new as uh again Loki pointed out the the murder of those uh Egyptian soldiers goes back quite a while and the their their uh crime was for their because of their support for Hamas hamas I believe is too strong in Gaza to be able for them to for the Israelis to undermine them through Palestinians uh their allies are uh very close to them the Palestinian Islamic Jihad which is the second largest resistance group they will stick with them till the very end and hopefully we won't we will never see such a situation but they will stick with them and the other Palestinian groups they too are with Hamas there have been some protests obviously the Israelis uh Mossad and others have been behind it but those are small groups of people who many of them were just it's they they small groups but many participated in in because of the desperation the desperate desperate situ situation they're in and that's a policy that the Israelis and the Americans have always pursued what that's like what the Americans have done in Cuba in Cuba the American Americans are strangling the people of Cuba and uh their hope is that people will turn against the Cuban government out of desperation they do the same in Venezuela they I just returned from Venezuela uh that the sanctions there are are hurting people and the objective is to hurt people so that the the population would turn against the government the same is was true of course with Syria but Syria ultimately collapsed the same is true with Iran and any other it's a war it's a form of war the Israelis do the same thing in Gaza they're slaughtering people they are starving people and they the they and Western intelligence agency that the Israeli intelligence agency agencies as well as Western intelligence agencies work together to turn people against the resistance but I don't think that's going to work i don't think uh ISIS is going to be able to undermine Hamas in any way or form and we saw as you pointed out today that the resistance has been able to score uh successes against the this uh the Zionist regime and inflict significant casualties i I I also believe that um we're going to see further attempts to to turn both the local population against Hamas to try to encourage people to protest simultaneously you're going to see uh these terror groups uh being deployed against Israelis this will this will continue but uh I think to to the credit of the resistance uh after 20 months of genocide uh and to the credit of the people of Gaza uh people have remained steadfast across uh the Gaza Strip and they've tried to separate the people put them in different in boxes in different parts of the Gaza Strip separate them make it impossible to manage they would bomb police officers uh they bomb people who who would guard and do bomb people who guard just a few days ago they did it again people who are guarding uh food and uh that for or aid that was being brought to the people they bombed them they kill them in order and use these terror groups in order to create further chaos but so far we've seen that Hamas and the resistance has been able to maintain control because the population remains loyal they may not be and I cannot say uh I cannot speak on behalf of Palestinians in in in Gaza they may not they may have their own grievances but they know who the enemy is they know what the enemy is trying to do so someone may not be a supporter of Hamas someone may be a supporter of a different group someone may not be a part of any group but they know that the Palestinian cause is just they know that the Israeli regime and the Americans and the Europeans and this and regional regimes are doing nothing for them at at best uh but they still know that they have to stand with the resistance and that the other side is only trying to undermine all of them through division through through supporting ISIS and uh through trying to create unrest in in Gaza Ali please Stephan yeah um I think with respect to what's been revealed in the last couple of days in Gaza I'm somewhat skeptical that there is really an ISIS link uh you know and what is ISIS really it's a brand that is used by Western intelligence services so you know it it they can use it for for anything they want to use it for i think the key point here is not whether or not this group is ISIS affiliated but that it is Israel affiliated that's the important thing and I think the context in terms of the history of the struggle in Palestine is that Israel has always sought Palestinian collaborators and for that matter Lebanese collaborators and as Loki pointed out Syrian collaborators and this model goes back decades and it's a classical colonial model you find local native collaborators to help you fight the resistance against you know your own people's resistance against the occupier and there's a history of this in Palestine going back many decades but we can start in the 1970s with the so-called village leagues which Israel tried to set up in the occupied West Bank uh following the occupation of 1967 and then of course the Oslo Accords turned the Palestine Liberation Organization from a liberation movement into essentially a collaborative force with Israel and yes Arafat who was the head of the Palestine Liberation Organization was murdered when he refused to collaborate enough as far as Israel was concerned and so they replaced him with Mahmud Abbas who has been much more willing to collaborate with Israel and is is completely an Israeli asset as is his newly appointed deputy Hussein which Israeli leaders called and this is a quote our man in Ramallah so this is the model that they're trying to establish in Gaza and this uh Abu Shabbab this this local collaborator who may be a thug who may be a criminal who may be an opportunist uh a local warlord that Israel wants to build up into an asset or a client actually claims to be operating under what he calls Palestinian legitimacy and therefore suggesting a link with the Palestinian Authority and last month uh the resistance had uh put out a report uh a field report and a video saying that they had carried out an ambush of what they thought were were what called Mustav or Mustin these are Israelis who uh disguised themselves as Palestinians in order to infiltrate and carry out assassinations and terrorist attacks for example in the West Bank these mistim uh often uh have have often gone into hospitals and murdered people in hospital beds descri uh while these these killers these gunmen are dis disguised as Palestinians so the resistance thought they were attacking a force of uh Mr and it turned out that they were actually Palestinian collaborators coordinating with and being directed by Israel and so uh as Loki pointed out it was the Israeli right-wing politician Avagdor Lieberman who blew the whistle and confirmed what has actually been known or suspected for a while you know to the extent that there's been any looting of aid even Cindy McCain the wife of uh ultra neocon pro-Israel uh John McCain the late US senator who who never saw a war he wasn't thoroughly enthusiastic about now she's head of the UN's World Food Program which traditionally that's a role that's given to an American and even Cindy McCain is denying and saying there's no evidence that Hamas steals any aid to the extent that aid has been looted and stolen and this has been reported and documented for months and months it has been by these Israel affiliated mercenaries and gangs and what has happened in the last couple of days is essentially this has now been officially confirmed by Israel and it's very interesting what Netanyahu said when he said that you know what's wrong with this i think on the one hand he's acknowledging that Israel does this that this is standard Israeli uh modus operandi but he also said this will save Israeli soldiers lives so again the they want a proxy force just like in South Lebanon between 1978 and 2000 when Israel had the so-called South Lebanon Army militia a traitor militia of Lebanese uh Lebanese collaborators under Sad Hadad and um Antoan Lah uh to fight on behalf of Israel because the casualties uh inflicted by the Lebanese resistance were so die they wanted local people to pay that price in blood similar again to how the West wants uh Ukrainians to die for its proxy war against Russia they want uh um Syrians Syrian proxies to die uh in their regime change war in Syria and Israel wants Palestinians to die killing other Palestinians on its behalf but this is an acknowledgment from Netanyahu that Israel cannot sustain the level of losses that it is sustaining in Gaza that's why they need local collaborators because the losses are so high and the operation today this morning in Kunes which killed Israel has acknowledged so far four of its soldiers and it severely injured five is only the latest of this drip drip drip drip drip of daily uh casualties which is why Israel is unable after 2 years to achieve any of its goals in Gaza yes we know they're the world champions at murdering babies at starving children at bombing hospitals no one will ever be in Israel's league when it comes to that but in terms of gaining operational control they do not have operational control over any part of Gaza and remember a couple of weeks ago they were blustering about how we're going to send in you know if if if Hamas doesn't agree to whatever ceasefire terms Israel was trying to dictate through its American uh lawyer Steve Witkov that we're going to carry out a huge massive invasion we're massing for what was it 450,000 troops they cannot fill the the brigades that are in Gaza most of them are missing uh uh whole units and uh the when they call for reserves only a fraction is showing up and this is even acknowledged within the Israeli media even if we don't know the full story because of the you know military censorship and fudging and so on so they need these proxy militias but this strategy has consistently failed and I think it will fail in Gaza it will sow chaos yes they're sewing chaos they have been trying we talked about this last time we were all together on this stream with those astroturfed protests in northern Gaza they're trying to generate some kind of popular uprising against the resistance in Gaza as Dr mandi said Palestinians may have different political opinions they may hate Hamas some of them may hate Hamas politically speaking but the idea of a mass uprising against the resistance is a a a fantasy for the Israelis that will never come true people will differ politically but they will not turn against the resistance and if they haven't done that after 20 months of genocide they're not going to do it now or in the future or ever and they haven't surrendered and they haven't kneelled despite the unbearable suffering Israel and its Western backers the United States Canada uh the European Union and others and the complicit Arab dictatorships and vassels in the region who are also uh effectively on board with this throwing promises of trillions at Donald Trump without even saying end the genocide end the starvation in Gaza if none of that has brought Palestinians to their knees and brought them to the point of surrender there is nothing Israel can do that will oh no that's a powerful powerful take Ali because and I I definitely agree and I wanted to uh bring it back to you low key uh you know with everything that Ali just said there's this reality that maybe Israel will need uh proxies uh in order to fight even within Gaza to continue this genocide there was a recent study that said 40% of Israeli settlers are considering leaving and we know how many tens of thousands of Israelis over the past what has it been nearly two years a little under two years since this uh massacre began so uh is this a matter of low-key that Israel is going to need to outsource because it has it is exhausting itself and breaking itself through this forever genocide and war in Gaza or uh what what's your assessment of this well Zionism necessitates genocide and it has always necessitated the institutionalization of a human shield strategy and what has just been laid out by Ali is that the way that that human shield in a collective sense is playing out but I think an important part of the story which has not really received that much attention in terms of um the media has been the very duplicitous role of regional actors so on one side we would expect those in the UAE for example or those in Saudi those especially in Qatar to have given some form of requirement when uh prostrating before Donald Trump for this this protection money that he claimed at least a mentioning of of the Palestinians but it is the simple fact in terms of infrastructure that you've had weapons going from the Alade base in Katar to uh Neatim base in uh the Zionist entity that's happened several times throughout the war you've had the same with US bases in Kuwait and weapons going directly there in the case of the UAE and Turkey though for example it's really extreme what has happened during this time so last time I mentioned the way that there's an Israeli company called Highlander which manages quote unquote Israel's airspace that is partially owned by the Edge Group which was which is a UAE state-owned company but it gets actually worse than that israel has something company called Third Eye Systems which operates um around Gaza and works on uh target acquisition and other things that is 30% owned by Edge Group which is a UAE state-owned company you have for example all of the money that's been poured in through the UAE and Saudi into Jared Kushner's affinity partners which from the beginning Kushner said this is a corridor for Gulf investment in Israel and one of the stipulations of the Abraham Accords is that each country had to invest 10 billion over the coming years in Israel 10 billion dollars and so through for example affinity partners that you've got Saudi and UAE money in Phoenix holdings phoenix Holdings is one of the biggest shareholders in Elbert Systems it has a role in expanding settlements in the West Bank you look at channels like Hadith and Arabia in the case of Arabia they have directly worked with the Israeli military throughout this war these are Saudi owned channels you have for example the Israeli spy Gad I think is his name he's a Lebanese origin Israeli spy who has gone on record saying that he smuggled weapons for Israeli intelligence recently had an interview on Arabia English in which he was trying to discredit the idea of empathy from afar now this is quite complicated psychological warfare that's being waged through a channel owned by the Saudi government how many people have you seen detained and told they cannot have any semblance of anything Palestinian around the Kaa how how many times have you seen people detained for wearing kufi okay for us to say the Saudi government uses Israeli company Celbrite to hack people's phones it was hacking Jamaal Kha Shakji's phone with Pegasus spyware normalization happened the the Gulf region and the rulers there have been essential to the war on Raza netanyahu went on record and he said &quot;We give we give these states some wiggle room in their public pronouncements.&quot; meaning they'll allow Saudi to call it a genocide when sitting at the absolutely useless Arab League which actually in and of itself where do you think the Palestinian Authority gets its money from it gets its training from the British government it gets its funding from the Arab League from the EU who are they giving that funding for they're giving it because it's a condition that the United States and Israel puts on them fund our proxy in the West Bank which is priming the population for at best dispossession ethnic cleansing at worst mass murder that's what the Palestinian Why is it that when the British are training the Palestinian Authority agents they are not allowed to train them in the use of sniper rifles they are not allowed to train them in the use of sniper rifles that specifically because they fear the chance of those weapons being turned on the Israelis and and it has happened there has been um cases of that of course and Turkey you know we really have to get into Turkey and more needs to be said about Turkey because you have this uh Turkish journalist Metin Shian who has actually gone on record and publicly made the claim that Borak Odan the son of Oduran has been trading with Israel throughout the Gaza genocide and the data that he used was from the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce and this was something he tweeted on the 7th of December 2024 he said &quot;While the attack on Gaza was continuing we sent 400 ships to Israel we sent 4 million tons we provided fuel for the Israeli planes clothing for its soldiers parts for its weapons.&quot; He said &quot;Thank God we sent our prayers to the Palestinians do not forget um Palestine.&quot; What you also have the case of is several business figures close to Odan actually owning shipping companies that have been involved in uh sending uh shipments to the Israelis you of course have 40% of the oil that Israel uses flowing on the pipeline from Azabaijan um to uh to Turkey and then on to the Israelis really there's there's so many examples of uh the way that this is happening so for example there's an Israeli company by the name of DAD Energy which supplies electricity to Israeli military bases now the second largest shareholder in this Israeli company is Zulu Holding which is headed by Odugan's close friend Ahmed Zulu so what are we talking about here we are talking about betrayal on a grand scale by the very same people especially odan especially odan who they in Arabic they say he he he is the biggest propagator of prayers for Palestine we don't need your prayers in fact your prayers are probably harmful In this case Odan is guilty is guilty is guilty is guilty and these are the rulers in the region there needs to be a reckoning where we are able to um clearly have clarity about what has been done during this period and by whom israel couldn't have kept going without of this this this support from um its allies but specifically those in the region who are actually financially benefiting off it that's that's what we're talking about here we're talking about financial benefits from the infrastructure built up around genocide and I think also there needs to be more clarity from um if if you are if you are involved in arms struggle against the Israelis and I completely understand there is a necessity to have diplomatic relations with all sides and there is help given in a limited way how can you trust the safety of of of of information exchange there or any of that when when this level of uh integration between these forces is so extreme you know the British for example have excelled at portraying themselves as sort of bumbling noble intentioned incompetent actors but all of that's propaganda and rubbish this is Britain is the most sly actor in uh in the region you've seen complete integration of the British and the Israeli security services britain for example the British police are using the Sandcat armored vehicle that Israel has been using in Gaza they've literally purchased it off the back of Israeli activity in Gaza and they're rolling it out on the streets of Britain the British police hack phones with an Israeli company there is an integration that has taken place and Israel is in the process of integrating itself with the regional security services also so it's uh yeah absolutely in order to to to carry out this uh maximalist project of Zionism it is needing all the help it can get from those in the region yeah and uh Professor Morandi I wanted to you know Loki laid out this picture of of the region and uh it is indeed a stark one and and certainly there's been so much enabling of uh the Zionist regime of Israel but there was a recent article I want you to actually react to uh I'll just how the how Ansarala rattled the US Navy and transformed maritime war and I think this is incredible given this regional situation that uh Loki just laid out uh just what has happened here on the opposite side with uh the resistance outside of Gaza uh here you have uh the Wall Street Journal acknowledging that Ansarala engaged the US Navy in the fiercest battles it's fought since World War II despite being one of the world's poorest countries and uh then it said here some 30 vessels participated in combat operations against Ansarala in the Red Sea from late 2023 up until this year and rain down 1.5 billion worth of munitions on Ansarala uh and while they claim that they destroyed much of the arsenal that's uh very very much under question given that Ensurala continues what it is doing it says that the US Navy was not able to achieve the strategic goal of restoring shipping through the Red Sea so uh FA Mandi uh your your reaction to this uh given that you have Israel kind of in this uh very unhinged state it's bombing Lebanon of course it's continuing its onslaught in Gaza and uh yet it seems to be mired in many fronts and Yemen happens to be one of the biggest ones right now yes and uh I think if we go back to um when Trump began this genocidal onslaught against Yemen which is the only Arab state that has been supporting the Palestinian cause in a meaningful way ansarah is a part of the government they are the government that rules in San the cap the capital of Yemen and they are the legitimate power in Yemen even though the UN security council does not recognize them at the behest of Saudi Arabia and the Emirates but they have been in power for uh a decade now over a decade uh the United we you recall that when this attack began and it was all done to support the Israeli regime the Wall Street Journal after a period of time I think it was the Wall Street Journal yes and they admitted that the United States was unable to destroy the underground facilities of Ansaro and we saw from the leaked signal uh chats that were carried out between American officials that they're targeting uh they were targeting civilians in their air strikes if you recall they said the the head of the the guy who was the head of the missile force they never named the person they just said that he entered a building and we brought down the whole the the whole building all the people living in that apartment building were slaughtered because of some person that they claimed was the head of the missile command and a person who they couldn't name and Ansar ultimately stated that by the end of the conflict none of their commanders were martyed the Americans had failed across the board and the Wall Street Journal back then admitted that the US failed to destroy their underground facilities and they were only able to damage the entrance points which were immediately rebuilt then the New York Times later on admitted that I I never read the article because it was behind the payw wall but they said it was said that they spent they wasted $7 billion in this monthlong campaign and I don't think that included the F-18s that were uh that fell into the Red Sea or the drone so the real cost could have been a lot more the United States failed against Yemen and they had to capitulate trump said Yemen capitulated but when we saw what really happened it was clear even the Americans admitted that it was the United States that capitulated and I I think that this uh is an this this was a major victory the the West likes to say that the resistance has been defeated on all fronts and that the Israeli regime has has been able to expand its power but I think that's propaganda and wishful thinking what happened in Yemen I think was the the the greatest defeat for the United States uh really since uh Vietnam uh it was brief but it was uh humiliating the United States went to war against Yemen they engaged in war trump prom and Trump and his secretary of defense promised to crush what they called the Houthis or Ansarah and the Yemen armed forces and the Yemen government and all they did basically was slaughter civilians in different cities they failed completely to deter Yemen if they had had any if they had success they would have continued with the onslaught they would have continued with it for two three four months until they until they finished the job but it was clear that uh they had they were they had failed completely and also I think what we saw yesterday in Lebanon is significant that uh the Israeli regime while it's carried out a new wave of bombings on civilian targets and it was clear that was they were all civilian targets they were just apartment blocks the bombing was carried out out of spite and hatred for uh for human life and using Hezbollah as an excuse and we saw how the Western media basically repeated whatever the Israelis said that they were striking Hezbollah targets i know those neighborhoods those are all people's homes they destroyed between 100 to 200 apartments two 100 to 200 families are now permanently displaced kids who have who are in the middle of their exams near the end of the school year during the Eid uh vacation where family people came from abroad to visit they they created chaos across southern Beirut simply out of spite but that it it shows that the Israelis have not succeeded in Lebanon and uh in Lebanon by the way another victory for the resistance were the local elections the in the local elections Hezbollah and its allies won across the board after this devastating war after this genocidal war the fact that the resistance is so popular in Lebanon despite what the Americans and the Europeans and the Israelis and their local partners their genocidal fascist partners in in Lebanon tried they failed so in Yemen the resistance won the war in uh Lebanon the resistance is alive and well and in Syria it is a sad state of affairs but at least the reality is being exposed to many who for whatever reason failed to see the reality and that is that what happened in SP in Syria was a conspiracy regardless of the nature of the previous government the Iran was never a fan of the Ba'ist party whether in Syria and obviously in Iraq we fought Saddam Hussein and and the Ba'ist party in Iraq invaded Iran so Iran was never in love with the batheism but Iran saw what the Americans and NATO were doing how they were conspiring to bring down uh Lebanon how they were conspiring to bring down the resistance in Lebanon and to bring to destroy the bridge to the resistance in Lebanon as well as the bridge to the resistance in the West Bank so this black hole that is now that sir which is now a black hole uh sadly and where people are suffering I think that in the long run this is going to be more costly what uh for the Israeli regime they are overstretched in Syria and for the collaborators who brought about this horrific state of affairs it's going to be very costly as well and they have vindicated the resistance they vindicated and its allies that people now see what happened in Syria was exactly what Hassan was saying would happen yeah Ali I definitely want to bring you in here and also there have been reports over the last uh recent period of a a new possibly a new resistance emerging in Syria as well uh I know firing rockets uh into the uh or you know Syrian territory uh Golan but Israeli occupied Syrian territory uh but your your reaction to any of this yeah just to say that I think when there is occupation and colonialism resistance in is inevitable and you know the in the US and Israeli view of the world or at least what they claim to believe the reason there is conflict and bloodshed and there is no peace is because Hamas and Hezbollah evil organizations that exist just to hate Jews and kill and cause chaos for the sake of causing chaos but the reality of course as most people will know is that Hezbala was created as a reaction to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon the murder of tens of thousands of people and it it was an indigenous resistance group that grew up and that's exactly the same with Hamas hamas emerged in the late 1980s in Gaza in opposition and resistance to decades of brutal Israeli occupation and the PLO the Palestine Liberation Organization also and its different factions uh emerged as a resistance to uh Israel uh at an earlier phase when the PLO essentially became subcontractors of the Israeli occupation resistance didn't disappear resistance reemerged in the form of other organizations so suppose a genie comes out of a bottle and uh you know Benjamin Netanyahu rubs the bottle and says and the genie comes out and says what's your wish and Netanyahu says my wish is that Hezbollah and Hamas disappear and poof they're gone well maybe Israel will get calm for a very short period of time until new resistance groups emerge and so that's what will happen in Syria that's what will happen in Lebanon for political reasons Hezbollah has decided not to respond militarily to Israel's constant aggressions it's not that Hezbollah can't respond that can respond but as part of the uh ceasefire deal the one-sided ceasefire deal uh that uh the Lebanese government s signed and agreed with Israel as sponsored by the United States and and France and whoever else agreed to step back and say to the Lebanese state to the government okay you're in charge uh you get our land back because of course Israel still occupies uh Lebanese territory uh along the border and continues to attack Lebanon and violate its airspace daily including the massive barbaric terror attacks carried out by Israel last night in the southern suburbs of Beirut so Hezbollah said to the Lebanese state &quot;Go ahead to the Lebanese state go ahead it's all yours.&quot; Now I can imagine a point where uh if the Israeli aggression continues to escalate where Hezbollah will may decide that that position is untenable but uh if they sit it out too long other people in Lebanon will start to resist and to say we can't tolerate the attacks on our territory so the root cause of all violence is the aggression is the colonial occupation is the attack from Zionism against the people of this region uh and their land and as long as that attack as long as that original aggression continues and persists and is backed by uh of course when people in the region are resisting against Israel they're resisting against the might of the entire West uh and so as long as that attack continues then there will be resistance and that's just a reality and and in the past in Palestine it was called the Palestine Liberation Organization that's no longer a resistance movement in any form uh and uh today it's called Hamas or Islamic Jihad or uh you know the the other smaller factions that are involved in the resistance today in Lebanon it's Hezbollah but if Hezbollah uh doesn't return to military resistance for any reason I suspect that other military resistance organizations will emerge and and so the same is true in Syria uh you can have a Golani a British American intelligence asset Abu Muhammad Galani aka Ahmed Shah who has been crowned as king of Syria by the western intelligence services uh and he can pledge as he has been doing repeatedly that we don't want any trouble with Israel we don't want anyone to attack Israel please please please just leave us alone but there are Syrians who will uh rise up and say this is our land and we cannot tolerate this aggression this occupation this humiliation and and so we are going to resist even if the American installed monarch in Syria the king of Syria decid or the king of Damascus uh decides he doesn't want to um to resist yeah uh low key I I definitely want to uh uh bring you back in here to uh react to you know what Ali said but also uh you know Yemen has recently fired one of its Palestine hypersonic 2 missiles at Bengurian airport of course there was the moment not too long ago where one struck and pierced the Iron Dome but they keep firing the ballistic missiles and the hypersonic missiles and they keep having an effect of shutting down the airport and of course uh causing economic uh you know dislocation and disarray and then you have I don't know if you saw the reports too of a new Islamic resistance front in Syria that had recently fired rockets um into Israeli occupied Golan uh is this all for not because I think a lot of people are very pessimistic about the situation when you have Israel raising Gaza the genocide the you know the massive infrastructure destruction the aid weaponization what the you know the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation debacle uh luring people Palestinians into essentially um uh uh to their to their deaths um shooting them down as they were receiving these this pitiful amount amount of aid uh your take on this because I think a lot of people are very pessimistic about the situation despite the presence of resistance as Ali said uh continuing well I think it's important also to clarify that what the resistance in Lebanon is protecting is the entire region why is Israel so obsessed with getting to the Lethani River because it wants to control the water sources of the region now what did Golani facilitate by allowing Israel to occupy Syria the way it has this king of Damascus he has facilitated Israel controlling 40% of Syria's water israel controlling ala dam which supplies water to Jordan now let's not forget that Jordan is actually one of the poorest countries in the world water-wise so now through the occupation of Syria Israel has a further control on this poodle in Amman that they that they control now in terms of the case of um the the other aspect you have to remember that Israel occupied the highest the highest point in the entire region in Syria um and so therefore has this strategic um full spectrum visibility of the region it's always wanted to get to that mountaintop and it did now uh in response to uh some of what you said yes you have the development of this in Syria who have shot these uh weapons from the Jolan Heights you also have to remember that the Yemenes said to the former Syrian government &quot;Let us come and open the front.&quot; This is following the alaka flood they said &quot;Let us come and open the front.&quot; And they were prevented from doing so at least that is my understanding of what happened from some in Yemen but also one other thing that I've noticed is there is a coordination playing out across the axis of assistance in the region and they are trying to astroturf anti-resistance feeling why is it that on the same day you had Mahmud Abbas come out this Israeli spy this filthy killer and torturer to death of Palestinians Mahmud Abbas came out with the statement he said he said &quot;Give up the hostages you sons of dogs.&quot; This is what Mahmud Abbas said on the very same day El Jolani arrests the leadership of Islamic Jihad in Syria not long after that he arrestal Naji from the PFLP the same period the Jordanian government outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood which is essentially about targeting Hamas so all of that happens on the same day or within days of each other so this is the axis of assistance which in the region is pushing to astroturf these anti-resistance ideas who remembers the reports that Arabia the Saudi channel were putting out about the leadership of Palestinian resistance factions and then the reaction from the Iraqis when they went down and they and they shut down Arabia they are trying as much as they can to warp people's perceptions of this entire situation they are trying to give the mood music for Israel to carry out this uh genocide on the Palestinians and and and look at Yemen look at what Yemen has contributed to humanity when you even look at the um the um the the the convention on genocide you have very clearly laid out the basis at which an intervention should take place yemen has launched the most humanitarian of humanity the mo the most humane of humanitarian interventions that we've ever seen when the resistance in Lebanon was um directly engaging the Israeli en enemy what were they striking they were striking military targets they were striking military targets there was a point when they struck a house of Benjamin Netanyahu yeah frankly as somebody who has a uh a an arrest war well who is who is believed by the International Criminal Court and wanted for um for the crime of genocide that is a legitimate target yeah so really what you've seen is the resistance forces in the region carry out their engagement in this with far greater respect for international humanitarian law than any of the other actors that we're talking about we're talking about high techch savagery and barbarism visited upon poor starving people and actually this Gaza Humanitarian Foundation these aid sites they are disappearing Palestinians on a daily basis they are baiting them so they can be massacred on mass and I'm certain I am certain they are being used to try and bully and and uh intimidate and torture Palestinians into some form of collaboration and it's the direct use of food for political uh purposes that's certainly what's happening at these at these uh sites and and I do believe there's greater Gulf involvement even in terms of the mercenary groups that are manning some of the checkpoints videos have come out of some of them some of the individuals have been Egyptian some of the individuals have been speaking in in in Gulf Arabic there's a video I've seen of one speaking the with an Iraqi accent where are these people coming from what's happening here exactly um and so you know all of that will come out um as time goes on uh the extent of collaboration that all of this has uh has entailed yeah vers Randi your your final comments on this before moving on i understand why some people are pessimistic and uh people raise these issues often but I I I don't feel that that is really u a valid belief i think that uh the resistance obviously is always going to face great difficulty you have an alliance behind Israel that uh is has been controlling world affairs for centuries and uh since the second world war the United States has had uh an empire that after the collapse of the Soviet Union literally became universal and as both Ali and uh Loki have pointed out you have regional countries that uh have been collaborating they've been cooperating in in one form or another so in Lebanon for instance many people think that Hezbollah is the government hezbollah has never been the government lebanon is a is a country where the United States and the Europeans and these collab regimes that collaborate with the west either as part of NATO or as a part of their regional uh alliances uh they have they have huge uh influence and they have uh NOS's and spies and embassies that have always been working against the resistance unlike in Yemen where Ansarah is in control of much of or most of the uh country which is has a a significant population and unlike in Gaza where Hamas is in control of the has always been in control of that territory lebanon is not like that lebanon is a deeply divided country and uh the United States has fascist allies in Lebanon which uh are always stabbing the resistance in the back the Hezbollah accepted the ceasefire because Lebanon was divided and there are strong elements there are people in parliament in Lebanon who support Israel there are people in parliament and in government who want to see Hezbollah bombed that's how divided the country is the majority is with the resistance according to polls according to election results but it's still deeply divided in the West we know where they stand we know where the oil and gas rich countries in the Persian Gulf stand don't be fooled by some television outlet that supports the Palestinians in Gaza in the broader picture they are in the American camp all of these countries are in the American camp so it's very difficult for Hezbollah it's very difficult for Ans to do more than what it is doing it's under siege it's being starved and of course Hamas is in a terribly difficult position along with its allies like Islamic Jihad but I agree with what Ali is saying resistance is not going to go away what the Israeli regime is actually doing in Lebanon is that it's strengthening Hezbollah because it is showing that those who put forward the argument to fool the population that the Lebanese state in cooperation with the United States will end Zionist aggression the ceasefires prove that that's nonsense even now we're seeing for the first time last night the president and even the prime minister who's the prime minister of Lebanon who's more than pro-American even they have had to take a stand so the country the population those who were sort of in the middle are seeing that the issue is not Hezbollah the issue is that Zionism is an ideology which does not accept peace it does not accept borders it only believes in domination and supremacism so what Netanyahu is doing is he's ultimately strengthening Hezbollah hezbollah is preparing itself there's no doubt and the same is true in Syria they've occupied key areas in Syria but people in Syria are not going to accept that if the the new regime that's come to power this regime that's been installed by the West and its regional clients if this regime fails to retake Syrian territory all of those territories take that have been occupied by the Israeli regime then it will lose its legitimacy in the eyes of those who saw it to be legitimate or those who want it to be legitimate or those who are willing to wait and see if they're going to take back or that territory is going to be taken back these areas now occupied by the Israeli regime in Syria are are the most important parts of Syria they are the most important parts of Syria and of course it's also it adds to the threat against Hezbollah because Hezbollah is now surrounded on its uh eastern flank as well they'll manage but in any case it's this land is very ter it's very very very important so this situation in Syria is not going to be sustainable and all these terrorist groups that are under this umbrella organization controlled by Golani they're going to turn against one another for a host of different reasons and people are going to see how fanaticism and these groups many of them foreigners from Central Asia and China and elsewhere that uh they are going to be they are more busy suppressing Syrians rather than taking back territory taken by the Israeli regime so in the short term the Israelis may have success in Syria but in the long term I think actually they are proving to everyone that they are the problem and what they are doing is actually in the long run I think going to take away the tools that the West and regional oil and gas rich dictatorships use to divide the region sectarianism racial hatred and other means through which they keep the region divided remember these all of these countries are in the American camp all of them whatever you know whether it's the Emirates or the Qataris which despise each other they're still in the American camp whether it's Turkey or Saudi Arabia which despise each other or dislike each other they're still in the American camp the American camp is the problem it is the United States that's the problem but I think it's becoming clear to everyone that the region cannot live with Zionism and the not only is this true about the people in the region but it's true about people across the world the Israeli regime has exhausted itself the resistance continues in Palestine the resistance is fighting back in Yemen the resistance in Lebanon is rebuilding itself the American Israeli NATO project in Syria is bound to fail hatred towards the regime is overwhelming across the region one of the things that I find so fascinating so extraordinary is that none of these despotic regimes or none of these regimes that are facilitating the genocide or that are accommodating the genocide none of them are they if they took a stand against the regime the Israeli regime they would become they would be the most it would create popularity for them among their populations imagine if Turkey took a stand imagine if Egypt took a stand imagine if any other country in the region took a stand if if the Emirates took a stand the leaders in these countries regardless of the nature of their their regimes they would have the the overwhelming majority of the people behind them because this is a cause that now everyone believes in beyond the region everyone believes in so I think that in the long run this is like it's working against the Israeli regime and it's working against the collaborators who cooperate with the regime it's working against the West it's working it the Israeli regime has lost its legitimacy across the world people look down at Zionism people look with disgust at what they do whether it's in China or in Central Asia or in Latin America the new polls that have come out that I think Ali has done an article on they show they indicate how badly things are going for the Israeli regime so I think we should remain optimistic the axis of resistance is very much active the axis of resistance will continue to grow and the broader resistance that goes beyond the axis of resistance the global resistance is on the rise i'm I'm very confident about the future that these are dark days what we're seeing on the ground is very painful but I think that ultimately the Israeli regime has has sealed its fate it is not going to last yeah well I think it's is a good transition uh to our final uh story uh Ali this one centers on you so you can definitely begin i wanted to pull up your uh I think very important coverage of the new polls that have come out um that have shown that revulsion for Israel as you said is surging worldwide according to the survey here the Pew survey i mean it's absolutely stunning um and then you just look at the west or I mean some of these countries like you say Hungaria you could argue it's not the west Poland but just the very unfavorable in Netherlands Spain this is of Israel itself the opinion of Israel 75% Spain 75% Sweden even the United States 53% 60% Canada I mean this is this is a I think a stunning development Ali so talk about this research what it reveals and uh why why it's significant uh given uh all that uh you've been covering yeah it is significant you know I mean the the thing is this this is a survey done in 24 countries by the Pew Research Center which is sort of one of the most respectable mainstream US institutions so this is really an establishment think tank that did this survey in 24 countries and really it it's stunning evidence of just how unpopular Israel is around the world and they actually say in 20 of the 24 countries surveyed around half of adults or more have an unfavorable view of Israel around 3/4 or more hold this view in Australia Greece Indonesia Japan the Netherlands Spain Sweden and Turkey and it's notable that say in Europe among the countries surveyed in Europe the Netherlands had the highest uh negative views of Israel at 78% which is remarkable given that historically the ne the Netherlands is one of the most pro-Israel countries in Europe um and then look look at Germany 64% uh which is also remarkable given the solid support across German political elites for the genocide you know whether you talk about the Green Party or the Christian uh Democrats or the Social Democrats or whoever they are that's not reflected that you know the public opinion in Germany is disgusted twothirds of German the German public are disgusted with Israel and you mentioned Hungary even Hungary you have a majority of the population that has a negative view of Israel and that's remarkable too because Victor Oban the Hungarian prime minister is the only leader in Europe who openly welcomed uh Netanyahu to visit Budapest a couple of months ago vi uh you know flagrantly violating Hungary 's uh legal obligation to arrest him on that international criminal court arrest warrant and then if you take um the United States I mean there are some things that are not surprising here uh and and then again in light of Loki's comments about Turkey 93% of the Turkish Turkish public have very negative views of Israel they didn't survey Jordan Lebanon Saudi Arabia Egypt because I think it would have been redundant to do such a survey it would have you know been 98 or 99% yes you have a small elite that is pro- Israel but the public are certainly not um or if not if not pro- Israel certainly not willing to to do anything real to oppose it but um remarkably I think it's very notable that in the United States there have been for many years now polls showing you know if you go back a decade or more there have been polls showing that the support among uh certain subgroups of Americans for Israel has eroded steadily so for example among Democrats among younger people among people of color for a while now there have been majorities who view Israel negatively or who support Palestinian rights what's new in this survey is that for the first time that I've ever seen and I've been looking at this stuff for 30 years for the first time I've ever seen you have a sort of a credible respectable polling organization finding a majority of Americans overall turning against Israel that is unprecedented and there's if you dig deeper into it it's even more interesting because Pew observes that in general in many of the countries that it surveyed people who place themselves on the political left have a more negative view of Israel than those on the right but that ideolog ide ideological gap is more pronounced in the US where 74% of liberals have a negative view of Israel compared with 30% of conservatives so it's been true for a while that Israel has more and more become a right-wing conservative cause but but even that is breaking down now because Pew did another survey in April focusing on the United States and they found a sharp rise in the number of Republican voters who view Israel favorably rising from 27% to 37% since 2022 indicating that Israel is losing support across the political spectrum and we've seen that um reflected also in the emergence of a relatively new phenomenon of really prominent right right-wing commentators like Tucker Carlson Candace Owens Judge Npalitano voicing skepticism about US support for or ties with Israel and sometimes really harsh criticism and denunciation of Israel's genocide side so that really is a new phenomenon in the US this breakdown in support not just on the left or the liberal sphere but even on the right i've never seen that before so and again the the the the reason the Israel lobby has worried about this for so long particularly the erosion among younger Americans is because that's where the future is the future of the US support for Israel when this generation of young Americans grows up they're not going to want to keep spending billions to finance genocide and that's why US politicians have been in such a panic it's why they're they're focusing their crackdown on college campuses it's why they want to ban Tik Tok because they're hoping uh like King Canute that they can turn back the tide and I don't think they can there's nothing nothing no multi-billion dollar PR campaigns that are going to counteract the horrific reality of this genocide that is streamed in high definition to our phones every day there's nothing you can say about that there's nothing that that Israel can say that can justify what it's doing there's nothing that Hamas did or could have done or that Israel claims it falsely that it did on October 7th that is going to convince anyone that mass murdering people at uh so-called aid distribution hubs is justified that um blowing the limbs off thousands of children is justified that attacking hospitals is justified that starving two million people to death is justified the good news is we don't live in a world where ordinary people see that as normal or acceptable yes our lead our so-called leaders are willing to accept it are willing to be silent about it in order to keep their uh seats or or their privileges or whatever but the world is turning against it israel is done low key I know your time is short for you so I definitely want to get you in here absolutely and you know what's fascinating is in the UK context you had the Israel lobby have such a free run in the Corbin years literally almost every single prominent journalist was singing from the very same himsh sheet with talking points that came directly from Israel lobby groups 247 corbinism was something I have never seen you are talking about the uh confection of a supposed crisis for Israel's foreign policy gain in Britain but also the British establishment murdering a uh someone seemed to be a a radical um in Corbinism and so literally reproducing these things now all of those same journalists that during those that time did such a service to the lobby are now essentially trying to save their souls this is about their own redemption and this is about saving their own legacy and so they're making quite a big song and dance of the fact that now they sort of can recognize at least partially Palestinian h humanity but what I worry about in all of this is that you know Zionism has always been a topheavy movement and so what I mean by that is you have many of these supposedly right-wing some actually right-wing um podcast hosts actually ranging from you know Joe Rogan to even you know someone on the more liberal end like Piers Morgan all of these individuals have their podcast sponsored by ExpressVPN now ExpressVPN is a subsidiary of Cape Technologies kate Technologies was founded by Teddy Sagi who's given $3 million to the Israeli military during the genocide uh the company was headed it had CEO Ido Erlikman who was from the Duvdean unit unit 217 the Mustin um it was also founded with alumni of unit 8200 in the Israeli military um this Teddy Saggy has made very clear his political um orientations in this equation and so what you then have to think of is if ExpressVPN is being used by people all over the world also and if these now critical of Zionism um right-wingish uh podcast hosts are now um directing their users towards ExpressVPN how has Israel engineered the infrastructure of this entire system to work in its uh in its advantage you know you also have to look at for example the whether it's the Leavon affair in Egypt where you had the Abdas government and uh the Israelis the defense minister at the time uh Leavonne they sought ways to literally plant bombs at sites of both American and uh Jewish um uh use in Egypt you have the same thing play out in Iraq with the amazing book the law of Zion he really shows how Tofi passed the law the denaturalization law which would allow Iraqis to become Israelis no one took them up on the offer no one took them up on the offer so what did the very new Israeli external intelligence agency MOSAD do it literally placed bombs at synagogues and so I guess my fear in all of this is the type of tricks that Israel will resort to in in uh in trying to turn back this tide and also the extent to which it has been able to entrench itself within the infrastructure and the the big tech aspect um of this of all of these states you look at the Netherlands for example um you know there's huge pro Palestinian feeling when you had the Makabe uh hooligans there running riot their repulsion was largely supported by people across the Netherlands but what is the case of the Netherlands you've had literally since the '9s their uh hacking carried out for the Dutch government by Verin which is an Israeli company and then after that now cyber intelligence an Elvis system subsidiary has the right to hack phones for the Netherlands um internal uh intelligence operations so it literally means that states across the world in Europe and in the Middle East are outsourcing their internal and external intelligence functions which key part of their sovereignity to the Israelis so I wonder about how entrenched that is and what kind of leverage that can potentially give the Israelis to try and bully um particularly political elites and others within these within these societies but certainly on a popular level Zionism has never been more naked than it is today indeed indeed uh I want to get Professor Mandi in here though but uh low key uh this might be the final comment uh do you want to do you need to go now or later i definitely want to promote i just say keep up the absolutely amazing work i'm so happy for example that the electronic interfer exists in the world all of our understandings of all of this not only during this period during the Corbyn years and long prior to the Corbyn years all of our understandings would be far poorer were it not for the electronic interfa so may you continue and keep strong and thank you Danny and Professor Miranda it's great to see you all as uh as as always and hope to see you again soon thank you well everybody everybody go to the video description and find uh Loki's link to all his tour dates if you happen to be in the area uh out west uh out in the UK I believe but uh Professor Morandi your comments on what we've been discussing here i I don't think um there's much that I can add to what Ali and Loki have already said uh I think that uh the tide has turned i I I've believed this for a very long time now and I think actually if Pew had been more representative in its u choices uh it would have looked a lot worse for the Israeli regime uh I I took a very brief look at the art at uh the piece in electronic inifat which everyone should be uh constantly uh studying at electronic inifat in general uh Argentina which is an extremely white right-wing government the if I'm not mistaken the the the the amount of disgust towards the Israeli regime is very high even though the president has converted to Zionism uh or in the case of India which has always been an exception to the rule it doesn't look too good for Zionism they're not uh they don't have this strong majority they have a minority of support uh in China my understanding through my different trips there and through my uh communications and the meetings with Chinese scholars and students the population is overwhelming overwhelmingly critical of the Israeli regime the same is true in Russia in our region it would be almost 100% as Ali mentioned earlier in Iran the only people who would support Israel are some young liberals who really may support the Israeli regime out of spite and whenever I have conversations with them on campus their arguments quickly fall apart in Iran it's uh almost universal the hatred for the regime again as except for a certain class of people who I think out of out of uh spite they may take a different position but I think deep down they all know where the truth stands so uh I see this is the death of Zionism it is when when it is despised across the world it cannot sustain itself and when it is despised universally across the region by uh the population regardless of what some of these elites do uh I don't see a future for it it is tired it is not doing well after almost after 20 months of genocide we saw today them take losses they are overstretched their economy is falling apart and their supporters in the west are the west itself is in terrible shape they have the the Israeli regime is dependent on the west for its existence the west is no longer the empire that governs the world it is the empire is collapsing before our eyes the what we saw between Trump and uh yesterday and and and how Musk was attacking him i think is just reflective of a broader problem in the United States and in the west at large that the west no longer has that unity it no longer has that authority it no longer has that aura of strength and power that it had before and without that without the overwhelming uh power of the west and the US empire how how is the regime going to sustain itself it is completely dependent on it those who in the west who like to say that the Israelis are uh the supreme power in the region or they're the superpower in the region the Israeli regime is is a puny tiny vulnerable weak regime that is completely dependent on the West for everything it does all of this whole genocide is being carried out with Western wealth with Western money with Western support if the United States or even the Europeans if they withheld their support for the Israeli regime for a few weeks it would be over the regime would be over right now the Germans the the British and the French at the UN Security Council they voted for a ceasefire it was only the Americans that vetoed it but will the British and the French really do anything against the Israelis they will continue to support the Israelis the Germans will continue to support the Israelis and they'll even purchase Israeli weapons in order to help fund the genocide but they are on the decline so this com this regime that is completely dependent which had the benefit of Western media Western soft power that was able to to in the past create a favorable environment for the Israeli regime and and Zionists across the world that media has failed western soft power has failed western economies the Western Empire is failing it they they no longer have it no longer has the power and authority that it had before so Israel's support is weakening on all fronts it is failing at home people despise it this is not this is not good news at all and I personally think that Netanyahu is destroying the Israeli regime he is the person who's he is destroying it because he's not even fighting for the interests of Zionism he's fighting for the interests of Netanyahu and Netanyahu's allies and he's allied with these people for the sake of Netanyahu so ultimately I you know again as I said a few minutes ago 10 15 minutes ago I'm optimistic about the future i think the resistance and the access of resistance will continue to degrade the regime's capability and the United States which has overextended itself in trade wars in in uh in Ukraine where Trump foolishly foolishly was unable to bring an end to the war he he could have ended the war and he didn't and now this war is going to continue to degrade the capabilities of of of the West so they've overextended themselves on multiple fronts they've destroyed their image because of their support for the Holocaust things I'm I'm optimistic i'm optimistic about the future of Palestine the suffering that we see day and night is intolerable but uh I I definitely see light at the end of the tunnel yeah uh Ali it was your article so I maybe I'll give you the final word actually because um after hearing what person and and Loki before he left said uh what immediately came to mind was you know all successful resistance movements had this element where the outside world or the world perhaps around uh the resistance wherever it is uh really came to its support i'm curious if you think that is what has been happening and and whether it will accelerate but any final thoughts you have on your uh piece here yeah I I think I want to make a general point that I hope everyone who's watching and listening to this whether they're watching it live now or later on YouTube or any other medium should know is that the voices of people around the world actually matter and the reason we're seeing now some things starting to shift the governments in the West particularly where Israel's base of support is will resist till the very end any change they will hold on to their beloved Israel as long as they can and I'm on an old I'm old enough to remember that that's how it was with apartheid South Africa now in hindsight everyone likes to pretend that they were against apartheid in South Africa when Nelson Mandela died Barack Obama and all those Western leaders went to his funeral and they were taking selfies and pretending like they thought he was a hero at the time when most of those governments treated him and the African National Congress as terrorists and they supported the apartheid regime and every western university resisted and refused divestment and uh the governments the western governments particularly West Germany the same Germany that supports the genocide now in Palestine West Germany was opposed to sanctions on apartheid South Africa Margaret Thatcher the British prime minister was opposed to sanctions on apartheid South Africa Ronald Reagan the US president was opposed to sanctions on the genocidal white supremacist regime in apartheid South Africa why did it change it changed because of people power it changed because the public made that politically untenable yes there were also ge geopolitical factors as well just as there are now by the way you know this was coming towards the end of the Cold War and the West didn't need South Africa as an asset as an anti-communist uh anti- colon an anti-communist pro-colonial pro- empire asset in southern Africa the same way there are geopolitical shifts now and Israel is lo losing its relevance as the US empire declines so I want to emphasize that people power is essential the voices the protests uh showing visible solidarity in any way you can it's all so important speaking out on social media they haven't shut us down yet they you know with all the manipulation of algorithms and all of this kind of thing they still can't make Israel's crimes disappear from people's screens and consciences and so people have to keep it up your voices matter this is why they're cracking down with such heavy-handed and crude censorship in the West uh arresting journalists arresting college students smearing people all these tactics are because they know they're losing and we are winning humanity is winning so keep it up don't despair yes our hearts break yes we're sad yes it's okay it's okay when you see and hear the suffering that's going on in Gaza it's okay to cry it's okay to mourn we need to do that because what we're seeing is horrible but don't despair because we are winning globally we're winning humanity is winning justice is winning things are they we will see i believe I believe it visualize it it will happen that when Netanyahu falls when Israel uh when Israel um uh you know unravels even more than it is now the way these western corrupt regimes are going to um redeem themselves is just the way some of the western pro- genocide journalists are now now they're saying &quot;Oh you know Pierce Morgan uh Dr mirand's friend Pierce Morgan uh of course I'm being sarcastic there but uh you know now Pierce Morgan is trying to rescue his reputation by being critical of Israel western leaders and governments will do that too and I believe we will see Benjamin Netanyahu uh arrested and brought to trial and that of course will only be the beginning of accountability for this genocide could I just add a couple of very quick points one I agree with everything Patty said uh even if even if if even in my opinion if the situation was hopeless we all have a responsibility nevertheless we have to support what is right and oppose what is wrong but the regime is losing the regime is lo the Zionist regime is losing on all fronts and therefore we all have to push harder and young people have done a fantastic job young Jews young Christians young Muslims young Hindus we saw the young lady uh at MIT take such a heroic stance and people across the world saw saw it we have to all of us collectively continue pushing hard everyone doesn't matter how much influence we have what it's our intentions that they count so now is the time the regime and uh I think Loki may or maybe it was Ali alluded to this that they they're desperate they may go for false flag operations they will do whatever they can to turn the tide but I think it's too late and I think people are too too much awake but we have to continue pushing harder and harder and when Netanyahu falls and he will fall whether he's uh he will be I agree I think he will probably be arrested not for necessarily the right reasons but he will probably be arrested by the regime itself for other reasons but the regime post Netanyahu is going to be in a far more in a far worse situation than it is today and today it's in a very very bad situation well I think this is a great place to end the conversation um by the way sorry correct myself when I say he will he may be arrested for the fall wrong reasons I don't mean that he isn't corrupt i mean the real reason why he should be arrested and put on trial is for the Holocaust but the Zionists themselves corrupt as they are they will they will probably arrest him for corruption yeah that's uh I don't know if there are truer words spoken there Professor Mandi it seems very likely that's going to be the case without further ado though this was a a great conversation we really covered a lot of ground i want to thank Loki of course you had to run uh a little earlier uh I want to of course thank you Ali thank you Professor Morandi uh we can find your work in the video description both of you uh your Twitter uh Pro Randi is in the video description electronic Inifada is in the video description where you can follow all of Ali and his colleagues's work you really do have to support and follow electronic andifada

final uh words Ali personandi for the audience before we head out just go and see Joe i promote Loki as well i think he's he's on a tour right yeah in the fall in the fall if you uh if you happen to be in the UK area uh go to the UK and uh you know sign up for one of his concerts i would I would highly recommend i think it's all throughout the month of September I believe but you can find the

          <attvalue for="3" value="Support our work: https://democracynow.org/donate/sm-de...&#10;&#10;We're joined by Israeli journalist Gideon Levy as we continue our conversation on the Israeli-Lebanon ceasefire. We take a look at the mood within Israel, where Levy characterizes the Israeli public as &quot;sour&quot; about what is seen as a premature deal. &quot;They would like to see more blood, more destruction in Lebanon,&quot; says Levy. &quot;Israel wants wars.&quot; This retributive stance is still being felt in Lebanon, adds writer Lina Mounzer, who says Lebanese people are &quot;very terrified of the day after&quot; and do not feel that they have been awarded peace, despite the terms of the ceasefire. Meanwhile, the Israeli government has unanimously voted to sanction the Israeli newspaper Haaretz_, claiming that its editorials &quot;have hurt the legitimacy of the state of Israel and its right to self defense.&quot; _Haaretz has criticized the move, which comes just months after Israel banned the international media outlet Al Jazeera, as anti-democratic. Levy, a columnist for _Haaretz_, says the sanction makes it clear that Israelis cannot take the freedom of speech &quot;for granted anymore.&quot;&#10;&#10;Democracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on over 1,500 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

          <attvalue for="7" value="I want to bring giddon Levy into this conversation in Tel Aviv um giddon if you could start off by responding to there was a um latest text from the Israeli negotiator Gan Basin um who wrote the ceasefire agreement which went into effect today is good news the agreement is between Israel and the government of Lebanon not between Israel and Hezbollah it seems that Hezbollah has been weakened enough um it says uh it seems that it's been weakened enough um that let's see if I can find this that it's been weakened enough to end the war in Lebanon before the war in Gaza has ended your response to this and also the response in Israel right now to I think it was about 4 a.m. that the ceasefire or this cessation in hostilities went into effect yes I wish I could tell you that Israel is happy about the ceasefire I wish I could tell you that there is even a relief in Israel but unfortunately in Israel everyone almost everyone is critical about this agreement I guess many Israelis did not have enough for sure the right Wingers for sure the most of the inhabitants of the north they would like to see more blood and more destruction Lebanon and therefore they are so sour today and the other Camp as usual is saying nothing and even one of the opposition leaders Benny gun even criticized the ceas he saw the war should go on in other words Israel wants Wars that's the inevitable conclusion when you see reactions to a ceas fire which puts an end at least partial end to suffer in both sides suffer which didn't lead to anywhere Israel didn't achieve anything in this war it will not achieve anything in the war in Gaza 10 times or 1,000 times worse and here I must emphasize that nobody should have any Illusions has no intention to put an end to the war in Gaza what happened in Lebanon will not happen soon in Gaza because if he goes for an agreement in Gaza he loses his government and that's his top priority and Israel at least part of Israel has very serious intentions to resettle Gaza don't underestimate those settlers the sky the limit for them they just wait for Donald Trump to get into the office and I will not be surprised if we very soon later see settlements in Gaza in other words nothing was solved yesterday accept of the the the punishment of of Lebanon which came to its end but also this is for a very limited time I mean when the prime minister speaks about the agreement and all he has to say are threats about Lebanon and kbal that if any violation will take place immediately Israel will attack again so we are going from one war to the other and from one viol confrontation to the other without even suggesting any other alternative nothing nobody speaks about diplomacy nobody speaks about touching the core issues both in the north and in the South our friend from from Lebanon our Lebanese friend just mentioned violations of the of the sovereignity of Lebanon anyone speaks about the fact that Israel I'm sure will continue to fly over Lebanon known for intelligence this will be kosher this will be legitimate and only the violation of of of Israeli sovereignity is never forgiven and get Lev I wanted to ask you in terms of the the the toll on the the IDF now over 800 soldiers have been killed in Gaza about the estimates are about 70 73 or 74 uh in in Lebanon on and those are the only ones the ones publicly acknowledged uh the what is the impact on Israel of continuing this war on the economy of Israel on migration on tourism and the other aspects of economic life in Israel the price is enormous but somehow Israeli accepted this is this unbelievable phenomena in which people are ready to sacrifice the dearest ones I mean who is more than your son without seeing a real purpose I mean they all tell themselves that they were killed sacrificed for the for the defense of Israel what what kind of defense is it if you bomb camp in Gaza what what does Israel benefit out of it the economical price is one thing I mean you mentioned tourism there's no tourism whatsoever there are hardly any International Airlines to fly in here but there is a much heavier price namely turning Israel into a par State you know it very well from the United States but everywhere else it's not only that netan and and the Gallant are now wanted all over the world every Israeli will feel it when he will go abroad now every Israelis everywhere will feel at least discomfort in presenting himself identifying himself as an Israeli and still Israelis are ready to take this only because they were told that we have to live from war to war to live on our sword and there is no other option which is a total lie because Israel never tried an alternative but brainwash like brainwash gon and I don't know if you can respond to this but the Israeli cabinet has unanimously voted to sanction your paper harat saying its editorials quote have hurt the legitimacy of the state of Israel and its right to self-defense unquote under the move the Israeli government will stop advertising in the paper cut off all Communications with haret haret has slammed the decision saying it quote is another step in netanyahu's Journey to dismantle Israeli democracy like his friends Putin eruan Orban Netanyahu is trying to silence a critical Independent Newspaper haratz will not bulk and will not morph into a government pamphlet that publishes messages approved by the government and its leader unquote this all comes 6 months after Israel banned Al jazer from operating in Israel and as the president-elect here in the United States uh Donald Trump threatens to go after major US broadcasters and Publications calling the media the enemy of the people get on you serve on the editorial board of harats I know you can't speak specifically about the sanctions against your paper but can you talk broader about these threats to the Press sure it's not that I can't but we decided that this this message that you just read now is is our reaction as a newspaper but I think that those sanctions tell much more about Israel and Israel's government than about the arids and here I think especially in the United States who always speaks about the shared vales about the only democracy in the Middle East so first of all it's questionable if if a state which rules in such a brutal way in five million people can it all be defined as a democracy but let's put the occupation the part they side even for us Jews in Israel who used to live in a quite liberal democracy things are changing right now from day to day from week to week legislations against freedom of speech against the legal system against any kind of Human Rights against any minority are being ruled and and nobody says a word I mean nobody can stop it at least as long as this government is there so what I would like to stress here Amy is that you have to also look at what's going on within the Jewish Israel it is Chang changing while we are speaking and the war in Gaza and Lebanon has a lot to do with it because the those two Wars with all their lack of legitimacy and brutality also influence the domestic structure and the domestic system of Israel and you see the outcome I don't take my freedom of speech and I have of speech total freedom of speech but I can't take for granted anymore well I want to thank you both for being with us and I want to give Lena munza just we have 30 seconds but the last word on what you expect to happen from here as you watch what has happened to your country uh at least for this moment from afar uh look we're very terrified of the day after Mr Levy talked about the effect on internal Israeli politics we're also very afraid uh Lebanon is a very fragile you know pluralist state but at the same time the Israelis also have known very much how to uh work on that so they've been specifically bombing where the refugees have gathered we've seen over the last few months that people have been Turning Away refugees these refugees are largely Shia from South Lebanon uh and from uh the southern suburbs of of Beirut so there's been a lot of hostility that has incurred uh so we're really really afraid of the day after in terms of you know the internal stability of the country and what's going to happen to it and I just want to say you know to go back to this idea of collateral damage this is something that the United States normalized you know in our region in Iraq the way to punish an entire country in order to change some sort of internal mechanism which then devastates the country because of course they have no idea what they're doing and this is not you bring about change so we're all also very afraid of now what's going to happen to Lebanon internally as we go on and as the pieces are picked up and a lot of anger and recrimination is going to start coming to the surface among the population so you know as we say in Arabic Al like we have no idea what's going to happen Lena muner we want to thank you for being with us lean's writer and Senior editor of the Arts and literature magazine the maraz and gon Levy award-winning Israeli journalist at harat's author of the new book The Killing of Gaza reports on a catastrophe we thank you so much both for joining us from Montreal and from Tel Aviv" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="democracy depends on a free press please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org/g this is democracyow democracynow.org the Warren Peace Report i'm Amy Goodman with Narin Sheh we turn now to Gaza where more evidence is coming to light about how Israel has systematically used Palestinians as human shields in violation of both international and Israeli law that's the conclusion of a new investigation by the Associated Press based on interviews with Israeli soldiers and with Palestinians who said they were used as human shields to inspect buildings tunnels and other sites in Gaza and the occupied West Bank the AP reports the Israeli soldiers said the practice was used in part to spare combat dogs from injury or death one Israeli sergeant admitted to using Palestinians as young as 16 years old as human shields in February the news outlet 972 revealed how Israel used an 80-year-old man as a human shield troops tied an explosive cord around his neck then forced him to search abandoned buildings after he finished the mission he was ordered to flee but then another Israeli unit fatally shot him and his wife haratz and the Red Cross have also documented Israel's use of human shields the AP report is based in part on testimonies collected by Breaking the Silence a group made up of former Israeli soldiers opposed to the Israeli occupation the group's also released photos of Palestinians being used as human shields in Gaza we're joined now by the group's executive director Nadav Vimman he's a former Israeli soldier joining us from Tel Aviv thanks so much for being with us tell us what information you collected the Israeli soldiers you talked to and how exactly they are using Palestinians as human shields so Amy I've got to say that from the beginning of this war we got testimonies from soldiers that told us they they were ordered by senior officers to grab Palestinians next to them and to use them as human shields meaning that they were they were ordered to send Palestinians some of them were dressed up with IDF uniform cameras on their uh head or on their chest and then they were sent into tunnels and houses to check that there isn't any IEDs or explosive over there so the soldier could enter safely or clear the area and um we got testimonies from different units different times and different places in the Gaza Strip which shows as you said that it's widely spread this protocol and Nadav as far as you know how long has this practice been in place now um the first testimony that we have is from December 2023 meaning immediately after the ground invasion started and the last testimony that we had is from the beginning of this year beginning of 2025 just before the ceasefire and and it's something that the IDF is using more and more and more more units and more areas throughout the war and to what extent are you aware of soldiers resisting uh these orders to use Palestinians as human shields yeah so so it's interesting now every almost every soldier in the IDF learned about the fact that we used Palestinians as human shield during the second back then we called it the neighbor procedure when you come to arrest a high-ranking Palestinian or you know that he's armed so you grab the next door neighbor and you told the neighbor you knock on the door not me and maybe he will get shot and if nobody shot him then we told them get inside the house open all of the doors and open all of the lights so we will be more safe and that was banned by the Supreme Court in Israel in the end of the second father so the reserveist in the Israeli army grew up on that history that we did something it was bad but it was banned and that's it and now they got a command that is exactly that but I can say even worse actually right because he's dressing them up in IDF uniform some of the soldiers told us that it's maybe that they will be the target so they will get shot now the the thing is is that our testifier told us there was a debate inside their unit but it's our testifiers right i just read an oped in of an officer that served in Gaza and he said that almost every platoon is using human shields right so our testifiers told us there was a debate they came to their senior officers and told them hey you know that's we were trying to fight not to use human beings as human shields or that dea dehumanization of Palestinians or that's immoral or illegal or I don't know what but I cannot tell you what's going on in the greater IDF at the moment so explain the Dav why this is called the mosquito procedure and also talk about what these Israeli soldiers told you about what happens to the Palestinians many forced into houses buildings tunnels um that are suspected being booby trapped allegedly made to perform tasks like um looking for explosives uh in tunnels yeah so first of all a lot of things that uh the IDF has names for I don't know the reason but I can say that mosquito it's it's like it's a bug that flies in the air and like you can kill it who cares about it and that and that was the relationship a lot of times between the soldiers and those individual that were used and that's the word they were used right we have a testifier that called them a sub army of slaves now the the protocol is quite simple you need that individual with you for a period of time two days three days a week three weeks so it means that only when he's scanning a tunnel or an or a house or an alley so he doesn't have handcuffs or a blindfold the rest of the time when you're he's with you inside the house you need to feed him you need to take him to the bathroom uh but he's also handcuffed and blindfold so you need to help him in some unit there were um the mosquitoes inside the house were used to clean the house where the the soldier um stayed so it's not only you know don't only think about that time in the tunnel when they need to endanger their life think about the rest of the time the majority of the day that they they were living with the soldiers inside the house but again eventually they were supposed to be um released so it's um again I'm quoting that soldier a sub army of slaves and Nadav could you talk about the context in which this news has been coming out where there's mounting uh anger against Netanyahu protests all across the country yesterday uh for refusing to agree to a deal that would uh guarantee the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza if you could explain what the mood is uh in Israel uh the repeated calls for Netanyahu to step down you've said that he's acting like a dictator yeah so from the very beginning of this war we and other human rights organization we called for a deal to release our hostages ceasefire and enter humanitarian aid into Gaza now at the beginning we are we were a minority at the protest but as as this war it's hard for me to call it a war because as a soldier they told me that the war it's two armies fighting one another so is this intensive operation in Gaza went so long and we killed so many civilians and we lost so many of our soldiers and also we also some of our hostages more and more Israelis are resisting this war and if you look at polls in Israel at the moment you can see that the majority of Israelis meaning even BB's voters I believe are against the continuence of this war and pro- hostage deal and pro- ending this war and and you can see the atmosphere on the streets um what happened yesterday it was the 600 day uh of this uh operation or since October 7th and and we saw a lot of anger you know protesters in Tel Aviv took over the headquarters of the Liut party in Tel Aviv for a couple of hours right and they and they put signs they said it's the embassy of Qatar because of the allegation that Qatar paid for the close advisers of BB to support them more than anything else but but but I can say that what changed is in the mid mid-March when we returned fighting in Gaza when we continue bombing in Gaza and we broke the ceasefire and we stopped releasing our hostages the majority of of the audience in Israel understood that this is a war to protect BB's seat and BB's government not to release our hostages not to fight Kamas and not to defend our borders because if that was the case we will go to a hostage deal like um uh like Witkov help us achieve uh the minute Trump step into office now what we saw yesterday is more and more Israelis understanding that we are being lied to that our soldiers are sent to die and to be killed for themselves without any good reason without without releasing our hostages or ending this war i wanted to turn uh for a last example to the occupied West Bank israel admitting to strapping a wounded Palestinian man to the hood of an Israeli military vehicle during a raid on Janine relatives and neighbors of the man Mujahed Azmi said Israeli soldiers used him as a human shield instead of allowing him to get medical care after he'd been shot this is 13-year-old Alme speaking last year we told them we want an ambulance for the wounded person in the room so the army told us to bring him to them we got him outside and for about an hour or half an hour we kept asking for an ambulance then we called one 15 minutes later two jeeps came and they got in here the troops told us to turn around and not to look and they put mujah on the jeep's hood and took him after video of the incident went viral the Israeli military released a statement claiming the action was quote in violation of orders and standard operating procedures um Nadav if you can talk about how Israel is responding now to this latest news of this much more widespread use of exactly this kind of example now first of all I've got to say that IDF spokesperson a lot of times when they are confronted with something bad that soldier did that are against regulation they said it's against regulation we will educate the soldiers a mistake and that's it no investigation no nothing now I've got to say that that now the IDF announced that uh six investigation were opened after the IDF soldiers used Palestinian human shield in Gaza and it's a joke right because we have so many more incidents and even Yaniv Kubovich from Harit's newspapers published a couple of months ago that Helsi then commander-in-chief of the IDF was sitting in the meeting room while the mosquito protocol was discussed meaning that everybody knew now I've got to say that connects to something a lot bigger in the Israeli society and that's demonization of Palestinians right since October 7th it's even on steroids right we have government members that openly talking about genocide right when the head of the Labor Party Golan last week said that the right-wing politician likes to kill Palestinian kids and babies he was called as a traitor by our government you know we have ministers saying there isn't any innocent in Gaza that all of the Palestinians are assisting terror or terrorists by themselves and that sips down into the IDF into command that soldier are getting and if you connect that with the fact that we have more and more soldier officers and commanders in the IDF that comes from the religious rightwing or for the settler movement and believe that maybe it's a holy war uh not a war of defending ourselves you can understand why you have such a huge amount of those kind of incident dehumanization of Palestinians in in Israel uh became something so common that it also leads to this kind of practices inside the IDF nav want to thank you for being with us executive director of breaking the silence a whistleblower group of former Israeli soldiers democracy Now is funded by viewers like you please give today at

          <attvalue for="7" value="- This was the Gaza Strip, a 25 mile stretch along the Mediterranean coast, home to just over 2 million people. Today, the once bustling streets and high-rise buildings have been reduced to rubble. But underneath the wreckage lies a vast, sophisticated web of tunnels longer than London's underground. This extensive network is a key weapon in Hamas' arsenal, from which they smuggle weapons and people for their w*r against Israel. The tunnels began as a lifeline for families divided by impermeable borders. When Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in 2007, they poured billions of dollars into this underground infrastructure, waiting for the day their enemy would meet them in this airless, subterranean battlefield. How did Gaza's tunnels go from a primitive supply network to the world's largest underground w*r zone? (gentle instrumental music) Our story starts in Rafah, a city in the south of Gaza with a tumultuous history. In a matter of decades, it changed hands four times, from the Ottomans, to the British, to the Egyptians, to the Israelis. In 1979, things changed once again when Israel and Egypt signed a peace agreement. As part of the deal, Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula. The new border between Israel and Egypt split Rafah in half. One part returned to Egypt, the other remained under Israeli control. And in the middle, a massive, impenetrable wall. - Right now, we are standing in the urban area of the town of Rafah. The immediate problem that the line, as you see it over there, should run across the city, and cut the town into two parts between Israel and Egypt. - Suddenly, neighbors who had grown up side by side lived in different countries. Families separated, unable to visit one another. But Gaza's people weren't about to let a wall keep them from their loved ones. Armed with shovels and determination, they dug the first tunnels beneath Gaza. Simple passageways carved out of sandy soil, connecting homes on either side of the border. These early tunnels were modest and easy to build with openings hidden in basements. On one side, a family in Gaza, on the other, a family in Egypt. In between, a secret passageway that allowed them to visit. For a brief moment, the tunnel stood as a testament to the enduring power of human connection. But it didn't take long for bad actors to exploit the system. With the wall cutting off access to Egypt, Gaza faced severe shortages of everyday essentials. Seizing the moment, enterprising smugglers turn the tunnels into underground trade routes, moving car parts, gasoline, and cigarettes into Gaza, all with a hefty markup, of course. When supply is low and demand is high, profits soar. And while the smugglers were cashing in, they were also filling a critical gap, helping your neighbors get the supplies they so desperately needed. For many Gazans, these tunnels became a lifeline. One Palestinian poetically called them, &quot;The lungs through which Gaza breathed&quot;, the only escape from the suffocating blockades that Egypt and Israel imposed. Egypt and Israel were well aware of the tunnels, but for a long time, the two countries just looked away. They weren't going to interfere with the smuggling of cigarettes or with the family reunions that the tunnels enabled. Everyone, from the people of Rafah to the governments on either side of its wall, understood that this underground network kept Gaza's economy and morale afloat. But everything changed with the First Intifada. In 1987, tensions between Israelis and Palestinians reached a boiling point. Palestinians, frustrated by decades under Israeli control, began protesting. But the grassroots movement escalated quickly. Protests turned to riots, screams turned to stone throwing, Palestinians took up arms, and the clashes between the IDF and the Palestinian crowds soon turned deadly. Gaza was tightly controlled by its neighbors in Israel and Egypt, and still weapons kept appearing in the streets as if by magic. The tunnels had become a pipeline for the w*r against Israel. Israeli authorities tried to destroy the tunnels where they could, but the network grew increasingly sophisticated, and no one in Gaza was going to give up their lifeline to the other side. In 1993, Israel signed a peace deal with the Palestinian Liberation Organization, creating a semi-autonomous Palestinian government for the first time. The Jewish state asked the newly created Palestinian authority for help in locating and destroying the tunnels, an opportunity for the PA to demonstrate its commitment to peace by cracking down on weapon smuggling. But the PA failed miserably. Through a toxic combination of incompetence, corruption, and complicity, the PA left the tunnels intact, and for the next decade, the tunnel network only expanded, snaking underneath more and more of Gaza. By the time the Second Intifada broke out in 2000, the tunnels had become a critical component of Gaza's underground w*r machine. Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Fatah smuggled weapons at unprecedented rates. Underneath the ground, weapons makers assembled the bombs that would detonate Israeli cafes, and buses, and streets, claiming more than 1000 Israeli lives. Israel cracked down hard, determined to stop the terror. And at the end of the Second Intifada, more than 5,000 people were dead. The military launched operations in Gaza to stem the flow of weapons. Demolishing buildings suspected of concealing tunnel entrances, but these efforts often meant displacing civilians and destroying homes, drawing harsh international condemnation. Despite these efforts, the tunnel network endured, smugglers kept profiting, terror groups kept building weapons. The problem seemed insurmountable, so Israel tried a different approach. In 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in the hopes that granting Gazans self rule would finally reduce tensions, - But the move backfired, spectacularly. Without Israeli forces on the ground, Hamas and other groups expanded their tunnel operations unchecked. What had once been a covert network grew into an underground empire, a sprawling web of tunnels beneath Gaza streets, the most important weapon in the fight against Israel. And that fight was now Gaza's first priority, because in 2006, Gazans voted for Hamas to lead them. - Now to be clear, these people weren't all terror supporters. In fact, exit polls showed that a shocking 40% of Hamas voters supported the peace process, and over 1/3 thought that the best path forward was the Two State solution. They saw Hamas as an antidote to the spectacular corruption of the Palestinian Authority. But Hamas and its rival party, Fatah, were unable to share power. Their attempts at a unity government ended in a civil w*r. By 2007, there was only one ruler in Gaza, Hamas, and they had one goal, targeting Israel. - So they poured their considerable resources into expanding the tunnel network. Billions of dollars earmarked for aid went instead to building a fully equipped w*r machine, with tunnels carved from solid rock more than 20 stories underground. For many Gazans, the tunnels still served a practical purpose, alongside weapons, they continued to deliver essential goods like food and medicine. But Israel and Egypt had imposed blockades to curb the flow of weapons and weapons making materials, and the blockades meant the demand for smuggled goods skyrocketed. Smuggling was lucrative, particularly for those who controlled the operation. Known as snakeheads, these individuals invested heavily to build the tunnels and then rented them out to groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. In return, they earned a cut of every shipment. The prophets were staggering. By 2010, snakeheads could rake in up to $200,000 a day. It was a fortune in a region plagued by poverty. But for the ones doing the digging, the story was starkly different. Thousands of Gazans had once worked in Israel, an economic lifeline for a region plagued by poverty and unemployment. But that lifeline soon dried up. Hamas had refused to give up on its goal of eliminating Israel, launching more and more attacks on Israeli cities. And so Israel rescinded the work permits that had allowed Gazan men to feed their families. Without other options, Gazans turn to the backbreaking, dangerous work of digging tunnels. But the burden often fell on children who were small and nimble enough to chisel away at the tight crevices in the bedrock, dozens of feet under the ground. A veritable army of kids risked their lives every day just to bring home a few dollars. - For many children in Gaza, digging tunnels has been a grim rite of passage. But the work was deadly. Cave-ins, electrocution, and exposure to toxic gases were constant threats. - By Hamas' own admission, at least 160 people had died digging tunnels by 2010. Yet the practice continued. Perhaps the most heartbreaking part is that these children understood the dangers before they ever picked up a shovel. - But with no other options, the risk wasn't enough to stop them. For many, it was their only chance to put food on the table. - The tunnels offer a devastating glimpse into Gaza's increasing desperation. For many, they provided essential income and supplies. But for Israel, the tunnels represented an existential threat. Eliminating them became a national security imperative. The Israeli government wasn't interested in cracking down on the smuggling of food, cigarettes, and other goods. It mostly cared about the terrifying prospect of the tunnels being used to launch attacks within Israeli borders. This wasn't just paranoia. - In 2006, Hamas fighters emerged from an underground tunnel and kidnapped an Israeli soldier named Gilad Shalit. For five years, they held him in a two-room complex lined with explosives, 50 feet underground. So the Israelis built a 20-foot high, 10-foot deep border wall equipped with sonar sensors to detect underground activity. But Hamas adapted, digging tunnels deeper, sometimes hundreds of feet below the surface, rendering the wall ineffective. In 2014, the IDF destroyed over 30 tunnels in a major military campaign. And on the other side of Gaza's border, Egypt flooded the tunnels with seawater from the Mediterranean. But the problem persisted. For every tunnel Egypt and Israel destroyed, Hamas just built more, deeper, stronger, and more sophisticated. Israeli engineers developed high tech detection systems and implemented a systematic process for locating and destroying tunnels. Dubbed the Steel Dome, this initiative aimed to neutralize the underground threat. In 2021, Israel announced significant progress, claiming to have destroyed 62 miles of tunnels. But Hamas was quick to counter, asserting that much of the 350 mile network remained intact. - These are no longer the narrow, rudimentary tunnels of the 1980s. Today's tunnels are fortified with concrete and steel rebar, designed to last. Some even resemble luxury living spaces, complete with toweled floors, air conditioning, plumbing, and ventilation systems, and they've grown in scale. Some wealthier Gazans have even used them to smuggle in luxury cars. This vast underground network is more than a military asset. It's an entire infrastructure hidden beneath Gaza's surface. Building hundreds of miles of deep, fortified, and well-equipped tunnels doesn't come cheap. Estimates suggest that constructing Gaza's underground cost nearly $1 billion. That's an extraordinary sum, especially in a region devastated by poverty. So where did the money come from? Much of it was stolen from the very people Hamas claims to represent. Israel approved construction materials to enter Gaza for civilian projects, like rebuilding homes, roads, and schools. But instead of improving life on the surface, Hamas diverted these materials underground, redirecting them to expand their network of terror tunnels. The cost to Gaza civilians was staggering. Homes crumbled, schools and hospitals were left unfinished. Communities in desperate need of support saw their resources vanish into the ground, literally. When Israel discovered this blatant misuse of resources, they stopped sending construction materials, a logical step to protect their own security. Unfortunately, this also made life harder for ordinary Gazans who were caught between Hamas' ambitions and the resulting restrictions. - Gazans lacked basic supplies. But they did have a sprawling, fully operational underground military base, complete with communication systems, storage facilities for weapons, training areas, and even weapons manufacturing sites. Hamas can move personnel, vehicles, and arms anywhere in Gaza without exposing themselves above ground. For over a year, they've been waging w*r from below the surface. But the most critical and dangerous function of the tunnels is their ability to shield Hamas from Israeli surveillance and airstrikes. The subterranean tunnel network presents a serious challenge to the Israeli Air Force. Many tunnels are buried so deep that surface attacks have no impact. The sandy soil, which made the tunnels easy to dig in the first place, now absorbs much of the force from the strikes. And then there's the simple but crucial advantage of concealment. No satellite, drone, or advanced technology can detect targets hidden beneath layers of earth. This isn't a side benefit of the tunnel system, it's a core feature. Hamas values the tunnels because they give them the ability to operate in complete secrecy, outmaneuvering even the most advanced military technology. - Meanwhile, Hamas officials refuse to let ordinary Gazans shelter inside, leaving them exposed to Israeli airstrikes. Hamas leaders shelter beneath schools, hospitals, and homes, turning Gazan civilians into human shields. The international community is quick to blame Israel when civilians are caught in the crossfire. - Gross violations of the human rights of civilians. - We believe that w*r cr!mes are being committed there. - But they conveniently omit the fact that Hamas intentionally places its terror infrastructure directly beneath civilian populations for this very reason. Hamas has been explicit about its willingness to sacrifice civilians. - So Israel is left with only bad choices. Should they sacrifice young soldiers to the booby traps inside tunnels and homes, or should they target Hamas' infrastructure with drones and bunker busters, knowing that civilians and Israeli hostages might be inside? When Israel has chosen the latter, it has been at a very high price for civilians. When Israel has chosen the former, it has been at a very high price for its soldiers. Meanwhile, Hamas exploits its remaining tunnels to move undetected and ambush IDF soldiers. This has dragged the conflict into a prolonged w*r, and that's part of Hamas' strategy. By forcing Israel into a drawn out conflict in a civilian heavy area, Hamas is betting on fierce international backlash. So far, it's working. Israeli citizens are fiercely critical of their government. While the rest of the world claims Israeli tactics are tantamount to genoc!de. - Madam Speaker, we are witnessing the Israeli government carry out a genoc!de in Gaza. - This w*r is unlike any of the world has ever seen before, but Israeli military is clear in its purpose. It's not waging a w*r against Palestinian civilians, it's not waging a w*r against Gaza, it's fighting Hamas, an internationally recognized terror organization that for years has treated its own people as cash cows and human shields. For everyone's sake, they must be defeated. Only then can the people of Gaza live the safe, dignified, prosperous life they deserve." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="the police stopped them from getting to the Gaza crossing at Karam Shalom So they held their protest at the side of the road All the pictures of the children here of Gazan children that have been killed uh by our army Yeah And how does that make you feel Furious Um we are here to say no more There have been many demonstrations in Israel about the hostages still being held in Gaza but it's quite unusual to see people holding up pictures of Palestinian children Of course these people are on the left but still there is a growing concern about what is being done in Israel's name Some on the Israeli left thought the war was initially justified because of the October the 7th Hamas attacks but now they see nothing but cruelty Although we are not the majority uh we are the reality is still the same reality of genocide extermination famine uh transfer and expulsion plans Amongst the speakers reserveist Captain Ron Feer who faces 20 days in prison starting on Monday for disobeying orders by refusing to serve in Gaza Those orders are not moral They are not serving the h security interest of Israel They the only thing they will bring is death of more soldiers more Gazan civilians and our hostages I would prefer to not get punished but if this is the the price I have to pay for making my moral decisions and choices I'm okay with it A counterprotester arrives asking why they're holding up pictures of Palestinian children when Israeli children have also died &quot;We mourn both,&quot; she's told before the police move her away Across the road a small group who say that Israel must continue to attack Gaza were praying and cursing their enemies The wicked will perish Those who hate you will be destroyed Some were ready for an argument with any left-wing protester who ventured over We are not attacking civilians If you are taking babies under the ground and taking babies in your basement and you are a terrorist don't think we we not shoot you Okay This is a very very specific orders The Arabs make terror and terrorist And you're disagreeing Of course I disagree because in Egypt we did an agreement with the same Muslims There is peace in Jordan We have peace Agreements make security not military And and when he say they they the children the women they are bombing us I think it's a long war and somebody will give up Okay we are not going to give up because this is the land of the Jewish people I think the land is the land is of of God The land is of God I'm going to leave you two to carry on your argument A few miles away in Gaza they gathered not to protest but to dig out the dead and injured from the wreckage of a house in Jabalia destroyed by an overnight Israeli air strike About 50 people had been sheltering there A baby and a child were amongst the dead Neither protest within Israel nor sensia from European countries is stopping the Israeli government from continuing their onslaught The people of Gaza do not have the luxury of argument just the reality of trying to survive Well joining me now live from Tel Aviv the former Israeli Prime Minister Eh Almouth who was once in the same party as Benjamin Netanyahu but is now one of his biggest critics Thank you for joining us When we see Israelis accusing their government of war crimes of genocide it's a it's a remarkable thing Do you agree with those people that that's what's going on Well I uh may not use necessarily the same terminology of genocide Uh I'll be very hesitant Uh but uh the one thing is obvious What is done now in Gaza is totally unacceptable intolerable and unforgivable We have to stop the war immediately There is nothing that we can achieve by expanding the military operation that can be of any value Uh on the contrary we are likely to use the hostages to lose the hostages and to lose soldiers that will fall in battle and to kill many uninvolved Palestinians in Gaza None of which is something that worse this uh military operation We have to stop it and we have to try and come to some kind of an accommodation that will bring back all the hostages We've seen Netanyahu and his ministers attacking the British prime minister the French president effectively blaming them accusing them of uh of anti-semitism and of feeding anti-semitism with their language I mean what is happening to Israel's international relationships Look uh we certainly uh disagree completely with this uh language which is absolutely obnoxious and outrageous Uh Great Britain prime ministers Mr Sturma uh President Mcron Prime Minister Ki of Canada all are friends of the Jewish people and the state of Israel There's no question about it They may not be friends of the Israeli government I'm not a friend of the Israeli government and the majority of Israelis I believe today are not friends of the Israeli government So uh yeah we are all uh victims of this uh very uh very aggressive u government uh Prime Minister Netanyahu is a captive of these uh messianic groups of extreme right-wingers fundamentalists Benvir and Smriidge and their supporters and uh I think it is going to cost Israel a great deal in the international relations However I I can't criticize President Mcron Prime Minister Sturma or Prime Minister Khani or Prime Minister Melan or or the Prime Ministers of other European countries because I also criticize the Israeli government for more or less the same things So and I think that most of the Israelis feel like me They think that the war should end today and that we should bring all the hostages and there is no reason and no wisdom and no moral foundation for killing so many innocent non-involved people in Gaza has to stop The the opinion polls keep suggesting as you say that a majority are against this going on but the Israeli political process does not deliver that right now and and doesn't look like it will in the foreseeable future Well the you know you are democracy in great you know that sometimes government has a majority uh when everyone knows that the majority of votes in the parliament does not necessarily reflect the attitude of most of the people You were in a similar situation in Great Britain last year For most of the year uh 2024 there was a government and everyone knew that Labor is going to uh win the elections big time but as long as there was a majority in parliament they can do certain things So we are trying we are rioting in the streets hundreds of thousands of Israelis day in day out uh and we are taking all kinds of uh protest actions against this government trying to uh uh overthrow the government in a democratic manner of course uh by adding actions uh against this government and uh maybe also the international pressure and the attitude of countries which are known to be traditionally very friendship to the state of Israel British people French people the Canadian people and their leaderships they never were against the state of Israel They are against the government and if they will carry on uh in expressing their attitudes it may be very helpful to the public opinion of Israel Well I mean should they go beyond that There are calls for sanctions against members of the Israeli government Do you think that kind of pressure would be a good idea by countries like Britain and those in the European Union I'm temp tempted to say something which might sound cynical Uh if Britain will uh put sanctions on Benv and Smidge they will not be allowed to go to Britain And some people would say in Israel they'd better go to Britain and not come back So I don't know uh whether these sanctions I I think that uh I'd not like that the state of Israel and the people of Israel will suffer from for instance economic sanctions as the Europeans are threatening to take and Great Britain talking about a trade agreements with Israel which may be cancelled which will affect the Israeli people I'd very much hope that we will not come to that point But if we will come to that point I think it will be clear that the um guilt uh of for this lies entirely on the shoulders of the uh Israeli government And if you're right that the you know Israel may change its government one day in the future do you would you want to see that government delivering international law to effectively hand over Netanyahu to face criminal charges Well my my desire and I think the desire of many Israelis is that Netanyahu will disappear forever from the landscape of our political and public lives Okay So I think at this time what we are interested in is making a political change that will bring back down this government and will allow more decent more responsible uh and more humane people to take over and that they will be dedicated to what I think is the main objective of Israel to conclude once and for all the historic conflict between us and the Palestinians to proceed rapidly into a two-state solution negotiations between us and the Palestinians which is the only possible way to resolve this conflict This is what I was trying to do when I was my minister Unfortunately at that time Palestinian leadership was was not courageous enough to come along on this path But there is no alternative and this is what the new Israeli government will have to do And I hope that the Palestinian leadership at that time will be compatible in terms of its openness to take part in this effort And what will be the personal fate of Netanyahu is less important in as long as he will disappear completely from the landscape of our political and public lives Hood on Thank you very much indeed" />

THEY BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS ASKED ISRAEL TO MAKE SURE NOTOTHING TERRIBLE HAPPENS TO THIS GROUP. WHAT IS THE IDF PREPARED TO DO WHEN THIS FLOTILLA GETS CLOSE TO GAZA. GOOD TO BE WITH YOU, ELIZABETH. I MEAN, SHOULD BE OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM. OKAY. WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF HUGE WAR IN GAZA WE'VE GOT THAT FIGHTING GOING ON THE NORTH OF LEBANON. WE'VE GOT QUITTING MISSILES. &gt;&gt; TO TEL AVIV, I LIVE IN SOUTH TEL AVIV. EVERY NIGHT WE RUN TO A BOMB SHELTER. WE HAVE THE SITUATION IN SYRIA WHICH IS VERY UNSTABLE AND WE HAVE THE IRAN NUCLEAR ISSUE IN THE MIDDLE OF GRETA THUNBERG COMING WITH HER BOAT. OK? BUT LET'S ADDRESS IS NOT THE FIRST LOOK TELE ISRAEL'S HAVE FACED PROBABLY THE MOST FAMOUS OR INFAMOUS WAS IN 2010, THE MAVI MARMARA. A NAVY SEALS TRIED TO INTEEPT ABOUT THAT WAS FILLED WITH VERY LARGE THUGS WHO THE SKIES, THIS PAD DEMONSTRATORS THEY IN FACT WERE WERE ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS WERE ARMED AND NAVY SEALS LANDED ON THESE BOATS WITH PAINT GUNS AND THEY WERE SET UPON AND BEATEN AND STABBED AND SHOT.

THEY DOWN WITH WITH THE WITH, WITH, WITH WITH SIDE ARMS, ALSO WHIPPING CUTS. SO I THINK WE LEARNED A LESSON FROM THAT THAT THAT IF YOU'RE SO WHAT'S THE IDF GOING TO DO WHEN THEY GET CLOSE? SO IT BY THE WAY, THEY CALL IT THE SELFIE FLOW. TELL THAT THE WHOLE THING SEEMS RIDICULOUS. IT'S IT'S A PLUS OF THE PUBLICITY. SOMETHING FOR HER, IT'S LIKE WHAT KEEPS HER NAME IN THE NEWS, RIGHT? MAYBE WANT SOME THINKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE THE WAY THEY USED TO. AND THERE SHE'S USED TO HAVING THE INTERNATIONAL SPOTLIGHT. SO HERE SHE GETS TO RETAIN THE INTERNATIONAL SPOTLIGHT FOR A WHILE. AND OF COURSE, SHE'S NOT. BUT FLOTILLA TO THE SEDAN. NOT GOING FALL TO LEAD TO A CONDO OR OR TO OTHER PLACES WHERE THERE WAS MORE ISN'T AFFECTING MUCH, MUCH BIGGER AND MUCH MORE DESTRUCTIVE. AND THAT'S GOING ON IN GAZA. NOTHING ABOUT THE UKRAINE. NOTHING ABOUT THE MILLION MUSLIMS PUT IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS IN CHINA'S. SHE'S NOT SENDING A FLOTILLA. THERE'S YOU'RE SENDING IT GAZA. OKAY. WHAT IS THE ISRAELI NAVY GOING TO DO IS PROBABLY GONNA STOP STOP THEM BY MIDDLE GETTING VOTES TO CUT OFF THE ROOF. TAKE DO OUT OF IT. BUT I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING. AND, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT REPRESENTED ISRAELI GOVERNMENT ANYMORE. NOT JUST MY PERSONAL THINGS.

THE U.S. NAVY TRIED TO BUILD UP HERE. IT FAILED U.S. AIR FORCE TRIED TO AIRDROP IT FAILED BECAUSE WHAT GOES ON IN GAZA IS THE MANY TRY TO BRING IN GATE. 2 THINGS HAPPENED AT EITHER OTHER PEOPLE 1000 PEOPLE JUMP ON THE AID AND MAKING THE POSSIBLE DISTRIBUTE. BUT MORE LIKELY HAMAS WILL GET AND HOW MUCH WILL TAKEN AT GUNPOINT. THEY'LL SHOOT PEOPLE TRY TO GET THE AID THEY SHOT. BUT ROUGHLY 50, 60 PEOPLE IN THE LAST WEEK TRYING IF THAT'S A LITTLE I MEAN, THAT IS DISPUTED. AND I IDEA HAS RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING THAT IT DID OPEN FIRE, WARNING SHOTS AND THEN SHOT AT PEOPLE WHEN THEY DIDN'T STOP. BUT NOWHERE NEAR THAT AREA. &gt;&gt; NOWHERE NEAR THAT AREA AND I HAVE IT FOR MY OWN INFORMATION. THAT IS THAT ISRAEL'S NO WAY CULPABLE FOR THOSE 50, 60 PEOPLE, WE ACTUALLY HAD VIDEOS OF OF HAMAS, PEOPLE SHOOTING PALESTINIANS TRYING TO GET &gt;&gt; SO TELL IT'S GOING TO TAKE IT'S GOING TO 2 THINGS WITH THAT'S GOING TO FEED ITS OWN TERRORIST WITH THAT AID AND THEN IT'S GOING TO SELL IT BACK TO PALESTINE IS A GROSSLY INFLATED PRICES.

          <attvalue for="7" value="let's go to the latest developments in Gaza and the West Bank where the UN is struggling to get aid into the enclave while the IDF has fired warning shots near foreign diplomats in the West Bank david Sedfield is the director of Rise University's Baker Institute and is a former US envoy for Gaza aid he joins me now from Houston uh good to have you with us David appreciate your time now first to the news you know that the IDF had fired these uh what it calls warning shots at a group of foreign diplomats d touring in Janine in the West Bank how could this possibly have happened and and what you know would those diplomats be thinking you were one yourself uh in in the area i think the answer to this is a very simple one but it's also complex the simple answer is it's it's fog of combat fog of engagement the IDF is is heavily involved in operations in the West Bank as it is in Gaza um there is obviously a deconliction mechanism that's necessary in these kinds of circumstances my understanding is the diplomat's visit had been pre-arranged uh on a cleared route with the IDF what happened there will be the subject of investigation uh but there is obviously no justification uh for any form of risk uh or firing in the vicinity of diplomats yes i mean uh you mentioned fog of war the IDF says that you know this delegation had deviated from an approved path i mean is that is that a good enough excuse for the IDF well it's not a question of excuses it's an issue of of how to ensure that anyone uh who is conducting business that has been cleared by approved by the IDF is able to do so safely if the route was one that was not authorized by the IDF then that needs to come out in the form of investigation but we've seen many many cases in Gaza uh where humanitarian actors following completely approved routes no deviations uh still came under fire from or adjacent to fire by the IDF this kind of of problem deconliction problem uh has to be addressed at the highest levels okay let's uh look at the aid front you know we are still getting reports that the desperately needed food supplies are not really getting into those who really need them they're desperate for for them from your assessment where's the hold up look there there are two issues here first the population of Gaza approximately 2 million people has been denied uh humanitarian assistance since March 2nd uh the need is extreme a few trucks entering a few dozen or even a few hundred on a oneoff or two off basis won't address this need and because the need is so severe you have two problems the aid is inspected and moves to a platform a loading platform just inside Gaza it then has to be moved by the humanitarian agencies to their warehouses and from the warehouses to distribution points this has always been a difficult issue because those aid movements once they're within Gaza are subject to extraordinary security threat whether from lutters criminal gangs or what the humanitarian community calls self-distribution a desperate people taking the aid off of trucks off of lries as they move through my understanding is that the aid that's moved in over the past 72 hours a significant quantity has now been moved to the warehouses of the humanitarian actors away from that Gaza border platform but the point here is not what happened to a 100 trucks or 200 trucks you need hundreds of trucks a day 300 400 every day they're going to suffer predation initially and to keep it going yes and if Israel knows that in uh you know that the people in Gaza Palestinians there do need these hundreds and hundreds of trucks that you're talking about you know just to get by as well is there a a sense that you know this is a deliberate strategy to starve a population when Israel as a matter of declared state policy as it did at the beginning of March halts all movement of food humanitarian assistance that's state policy it started a clock ticking a powerful political international clock ticking which had to be addressed but the difficulty in Israel now and its political problem uh is you have two circles that need to be squared the recognition and I'm quite certain there is full recognition at the highest political levels and certainly within the Israeli Defense Forces they've got to get food in before actual starvation and famine appears that's one imperative the other imperative is purely political it's within the coalition it's within the cabinet of how do you meet that requirement to move assistance without triggering the threatened departure from government uh of two uh extreme nationalist parties from uh Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition it's the attempt to combine both of those imperatives that have created the difficulties but frankly unless the volume of assistance by the international humanitarian community increases and increases rapidly there will be at a point in coming weeks where famine and starvation do appear it's not a controversial point it's well understood it needs to be addressed now while there is time remaining and what's we've seen uh you know international pressure on um on Benjamin Netanyahu we'll speak about that later but can you give us a sense you've been to Gaza of at this moment how Palestinians are then viewing um Hamas as it is because it's it's still a force where it is there is little doubt that the Palestinian population of Gaza does not have strong support for Hamas hamas has brought this disaster this miserable uh situation of suffering onto the Palestinian people no question about that at all indeed the popularity of Hamas is lowest in Gaza if you take polling throughout the Arab world but still Hamas on the ground possesses the gun possesses the ability to influence the population and that's the difficulty where the IDF is not physically present in force hamas is the effective presence it has not been eliminated and and I'll make the point here elimination of Hamas i put the phrase in quotes how do you achieve that it's a goal everyone supports it's a vicious terrorist group it has agency it has produced this suffering it sustains the suffering of the Gazin people but you need both military pressure and you need a political framework and it's the political framework which has been absent uh during these past 19 months who might be responsible for the political framework i we are looking at actors beyond Israel and Gaza here well we are looking primarily at the government of Israel and I don't listen to analysts such as me on this listen to the public calls of the most senior Israeli national security leadersh who said the ability to eliminate Hamas through kinetic through military means only uh that can't be done you do need military pressure absolutely but you also need a framework and that framework is not just important for any resolution in Gaza that addresses Hamas it's critical to bringing in stabilization reconstruction assistance from the Arab world it's vital to the conclusion of the so-called Saudi deal that needs that political commitment from the government of Israel to a negotiated permanent status resolution those are hard words to hear in a traumatized Israel and I fully understand that but hard words are sometimes necessary to be spoken and that political framework is an essential element of anything in Gaza other than a continuation of desperation radicalization and misery and just briefly um are sanction sanctions against Israel or the threat of sanctions by some countries uh going to make any difference i do not believe those threats or application of sanctions are a useful tool in this situation look Hamas as I said has agency hamas created this in the massacre that occurred on October 7th 23 it could end the suffering of the Gazin people tonight this afternoon if it elected to do so it hasn't and it won't why because it believes it will win and a victory by Hamas its survival is a threat first and foremost of course to Israel and Israelis but also to the region as a whole so no I don't believe sanctions are appropriate what is appropriate is continued counseling which I have no doubt is coming from the United States as well as other friends of Israel partners of Israel that this situation needs to change and it cannot change solely through application of military force okay Dr david uh David Satderfield thank you so much for your insights into this thank you so much thank you" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="the Israeli Air Force has made a decision and the  fighting in the Gaza Strip undergoes a tactical   revolution welcome to this special edition of  Boots on the Ground i'm your host Y Pinto and   today we're going to give you an in-depth look at  what's happening in Israel as we dive into the Air   Force's combat revolution this is more than just  a change in the way that the Israeli Air Force   strikes it is a revolution in military affairs  that is already changing the face of modern   warfare worldwide since the launch of Gideon's  chariots the current route of fighting in the   Gaza Strip we are already seeing a new layout of  the Israeli air force that includes less bombing   by fighter jets more precise operations and  significant coordination with the Navy it's all   about close support for ground troops using UAVs  and attack helicopters this is being done in order   to redirect the fixedwing aircraft and related  forces toward broader operational activity in the   Middle East strikes in Iran and distant Yemen are  complex operations that require sending aircrafts   refueling planes and of course putting the pilots  at risks so why has Israel chosen to focus on   smaller faster aircrafts is this a mistake that  needs correction let me know in the comments is   this context the question arises is why doesn't  Israel fire long range missiles at Yemen in   response to the Houthi launches instead of sending  pilots on a long dangerous mission beyond enemy   lines do you have the answer for that let me know  in the comments we'll provide the professional   explanation for this question and meanwhile the  Israeli Air Force is preparing at the home front   and the general staff systems for a multiffront  war ensuring continuity defensive readiness and   protection of vital operational components so get  ready to dive into all the in-depth analysis of   the Israeli Air Force i'm Yay Pinto and this is  your boots on the ground explainer edition today   we're examining the brave fighting of the Israeli  air force in the war against Hamasbala the Houthis   in Yemen the Shia militias in Iraq and all the  other armed groups in this region that are acting   under the orders of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary  Guards Corps which is the head of the Axis of Evil   in the Middle East in just a moment before we take  off with all the details I want to invite you to   continue spreading the truth and to support us  with a click on the subscribe button it helps us   reach more people so let's begin with the fighting  in the Gaza Strip and how the Israeli Air Force   is doing its part the Air Force is changing the  way that it strikes in Gaza by making less use   of bombings by fire jets in favor of more precise  close support from maneuvering troops using UAVs   drones and attack helicopters in the first days  of operation Gideon's chariots the air force of   Israel acted with great intensity carrying out  hundreds of bombings sorties on Hamas and Islamic   Jihad targets throughout the Gaza Strip including  terrorists and mid-level commanders of Hamas   it included also tunnels and buildings that were  used for storing weapons and containing explosive   devices and weapon systems intended to harm IDF  maneuvering forces these strikes using heavy   munitions aimed to break Hamas's defensive lines  in Canunes in Javalia in northern Gaza in Gaza   City and in the central camps but now that the  IDF has deployed five divisions into the battle   including all its regular forces three armored  brigades five infantry brigades the commando   brigade and three combat engineering battalions  the Israeli air force had to shift its force   operation and moved to close support operations  mostly based on intelligence from the Shinbet and   military intelligence as well as fire control  centers of maneuvering battalions and brigades   operating numerous aircrafts over Gaza sky the  main firepower now comes from UAVs and attack   helicopters immediately available to strike in  response to battlefield developments and the   needs of the maneuvering ground forces this is  in contrast to what happened in the first days   of the war when the Israeli air force struck  every known terror command post in the field   sending hundreds of sorties every day utilizing  bunker busting bombs and focused GBU39 bargages   every intelligence marked target got personal  treatment from the sky there was a complete   focus on kamas targets including operational  squads headquarters launch sites and tunnels   running under residential buildings and public  institutions the first hitunes Jabalia Gaza   city and every refugee camp that turned into a  bunker for Hamas terrorists but then something   changed in this round the IDF went big on ground  operations instead of distant strikes and indirect   fires suddenly the air force stopped acting like  a detached squadron and became a soldier on the   company on the ground there was a shift from long  hours of coordination with headquarters to direct   and immediate connection to the forces at the  front lines of the battle anytime ground forces   spot a threat the Air Force responds like a team  member uavs and Apache helicopters circle above   not waiting for instructions they're part of the  immediate response so if a terrorist emerges he's   hit with pinpointed fire if there is suspicious  movement on a third floor the balcony vanishes   this shift is dramatic because kamas the terror  group that thought it ruled the field has suddenly   and totally lost control every building that they  thought was safe all of the sudden becomes a death   trap as soon as a UAV arrives every attempt  to set up an anti-tank squad is interrupted   in under 2 minutes this is no longer an air  force that bombs at night and then flies away   this is an aerial force living near the ground  spotting reacting and supporting the ground   fighters at every step it's not detached fire it's  tactical fire smart sharp and synchronized to the   platoon commander level this breaks Kamas's entire  operational logic they don't know whether the blow   will come from the ground from the air an alley  and a backyard intelligence assets follow them   from every angle and fire lands on them within  seconds of the emergence from cover and that this   exactly is what reinvents the whole concept  of combat in the Gaza Strip because for the   first time the air force doesn't just strike it  fights it doesn't just hammer bunkers it covers   its comrades it doesn't just prevent future  threats it eliminates threats mid battle and   when the warriors of the sky fight like soldiers  on the ground Hamas with all of their tunnels and   their slogans simply loses control it only reacts  and once an enemy is only reacting it's no longer   winning so guys continue spreading the truth  about Israel by sharing our videos on YouTube   and

and we know whose side   God is on and guys speaking of which since the  beginning of the war the Israeli air force has   struck countless times deep behind enemy lines in  dangerous territory this raises a question about   why Israel sends its planes and its pilots on  such dangerous missions far from home instead of   just responding to the Houthis or to the Iranian  missiles with our own long range missiles which we   have very very advanced missiles so on the surface  it seems simple launch a groundto ground missile   quickly and hit the target precisely with no risk  to our own warriors it even seems cheaper than   risking a fighter jet and a pilot training but  once you dig deeper the story changes entirely   one of the main claims from advocates of a  missile core attack in Iran and Yemen is the   cost angle and on this point they have a point  because a missile certainly is cheaper than a   fighter jet but then again the fighter jet that  struck in Yemen also conducted strikes in Gaza   also in Lebanon and Syria and Iran a missile is  a one-time use item once it's launched and hits   it's gun from inventory when comparing missile  costs to aircraft munitions the longer a missile's   range the more expensive it is a L missile with  a 400 km range costs about $3 million per unit   missiles with ranges of 1,500 to 2,000 km can  cost tens of millions each a medium or long   range missile costs 10 to 20 times more than an  aerial munition some missiles cost nearly as much   as a fighter jet which can perform missions for  40 years or more the maintenance cost of missiles   and launchers and the readiness infrastructure  are also no less than maintaining a fighter jet   so if you're talking about a serious missile  force it may cost even more than the aircraft   a missile launched to Yemen or to Iran carries  a warhead weighing half a ton to a ton and it is   effective only against a limited range of targets  furthermore launch preparations are relatively   easy to detect especially with long-range missiles  as we saw before during Iran's attacks of Israel   the launch itself is detectable and the trajectory  is fixed and interceptable just look at the   Iranian launches at Israel which included dozens  or even hundreds of ballistic missiles with only   marginal damage relative to cost and effort  to see how limited a missile's power can be   on the other hand a fighter jet can carry 10 to  11 tons of bombs and missiles and hit multiple   targets or change targets mid-flight if needed  the damage that a plane can inflict is therefore   significantly higher than a missile and beyond  that air launch munitions have better penetration   capabilities than missiles which is critical for  Israel when targeting underground infrastructure   and tunnels from Gaza to Iran to Yemen finally air  power can be approached from multiple directions   and fly below the radar making interception  very hard equally important from a political and   diplomatic angle jets allow plausible deniability  unlike groundto ground missiles yes munitions   launched from jets can also be intercepted as we  saw in Syria but because of their size price and   quantity many can be launched from several jets  overwhelming air defenses and hitting the target   this is far more cost effective and efficient  than using expensive missiles a missile core   is therefore nothing more than a niched used for  very specific targets it can be a force multiplier   but it cannot replace or substitute an active  air force no advanced country in the world has   a missile core instead of an air force or even as  a major part of one in fact terror groups and some   of Israel's hostile threats the states that are  attacking Israel rely on missiles and on rocket   forces because they do not have the ability  to maintain an advanced air force just look   at decades of rocket and missile attacks on Israel  to understand the differences so guys here at TBN

          <attvalue for="3" value="Watch the second episode:    • How is Israel’s military tech marketed abr...  &#10;&#10;Uncovering how Israel profits from surveillance technologies using occupied Palestinian territories as a testing ground.&#10;&#10;Israel punches way above its weight when it comes to arms sales. The 97th country by population, it is the ninth largest arms dealer in the world with a $13bn military-industrial complex.&#10;&#10;&quot;Plenty of countries sell weapons,&quot; says award-winning journalist Antony Loewenstein, &quot;but what makes Israel's industry unique is the mix of weapons, surveillance technology and architectural techniques that combine to create a comprehensive system for controlling 'difficult' populations and are based on years of experience in Palestine.&quot;&#10;&#10;In this two-part series, Loewenstein goes on a journey to investigate how these weapons and surveillance technologies are used to control and repress Palestinians in Palestine before being sold all over the world.&#10;&#10;Antony Loewenstein is a Jewish, Australian journalist and author who for more than 20 years has written unflinchingly about Israel and its relationship with the Palestinians, even though it has often put him at odds with many in the Jewish diaspora and Israel.&#10;&#10;In Episode 1, Loewenstein returns to Israel to investigate how cutting-edge military and surveillance technology is being used on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip, before being marketed to international clients as &quot;field-proven&quot; and &quot;battle-tested&quot;.&#10;&#10;Hearing from Palestinians and Israelis, he uncovers how a pipeline of personnel and research from the Israeli army feeds into semi-private arms companies which form a crucial part of Israel's exports to the world. He also investigates the Israeli army's use of targeting systems that utilise artificial intelligence during the Gaza war after October 7, 2023.&#10;&#10;Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe&#10;Follow us on X: https://x.com/ajenglish&#10;Find us on Facebook:   / aljazeera  &#10;Check our website:  https://www.aljazeera.com&#10;Check out our Instagram page:   / aljazeeraenglish  &#10;Download AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile&#10;&#10;#TheTruthUncovered #documentary #ThePalestineLaboratory #AlJazeeraEnglish #palestine #israel #technology #westbank #gaza #surveillance #aljazeera" />

military hardware billions of dollars of civil and Military deals are done here every year standing shoulder-to-shoulder with these global Military Giants are Israel's top weapons manufact fa like Israel Aerospace Industries and missile makers Raphael in the main hall Israel's largest private weapons company Elbert has a huge stand they need it to Showcase their worldclass drones and missiles despite its tiny population Israel is the world's ninth largest weapons producer aom this High budget promo is for the trophy anti-missile system made by Israeli company Raphael it's the kind of advanced technology Israel specializes in and makes the Israeli MK for tank one of the best on the market automatically activated only when enemy fire is sure to hit the vehicle both tank and anti-missile Systems sell around the world to undisclosed clients overall Israel exports more than $13 billion of weapons and surveillance equipment a year and with adverts like this for the spike Firefly Israeli companies hint that their products may have been battle tested in Palestine so how does being a major armed supplier impact Israel's diplomatic position could it give the country a measure of impunity when it wants to undertake its own [Music] Wars I've just got a stash of books from my publisher today uh my book and other books mostly related to Palestine and uh Guerilla journalism just some light reading I'm about to do an event a Q&amp;A about my book The Palestine laboratory the book's been quite controversial it's a look at how the occupation of Palestine allows Israel to test weapons which are then sold around the world I wanted to do a book really not just about the whole concept of the arms indust industry which is an interesting subject but can be a bit dry but what Israel is testing and selling and promoting is not just Weaponry it's an idea it's a concept and it's a very appealing concept to many other countries Israel sells the idea of getting away with it to find out how tiny Israel has managed to develop this huge military and surveillance machine I'm heading back to Israel and Palestine it's not really clear if I'm going to get in I haven't been there for a few years wish me luck although I'm Jewish I'm not a citizen of Israel and their immigration rules say they can refuse entry to critics of the country or those who have called for boycotts so they have multiple reasons for turning me away my arrival was surprisingly smooth so I'm heading straight to East Jerusalem Israel has been occupying the West Bank since 1967 and has developed a unique system of controlling the Palestinian population from checkpoints in the separation wall to increasingly Innovative methods of surveillance these walls are not just walls they can listen and they are listening to probably us right now I suspect it's it's in these population management technologies that Israel is a global leader so I want to see how they first use it to control Palestinians before being sold around the world I'm on my way to Mama a businessman in East Jerusalem to find out how all this impacts ordinary [Music] Palestinians you can see my office from this camera inside so the cameras are both looking into Damascus gate but also out in and out so I'm standing on a balcony literally overlooking Damascus gate it's osama's office his insurance office and all around behind me over there there's multiple surveillance Towers right behind me there's a camera watching me so I'm going to watch it Asama wants to show me the very physical reality of the occupation the restrictions on the movement of Palestinians his daily commute from the West Bank to Jerusalem is through the Candia checkpoint AMA how do you feel when you cross kandia checkpoint you're crying I 24 hours about my my daughter my son if he need me I am here and this is traffic I need 3 Hour 4 hour to go to to help my son you understand that I do I can understand why this would make you nervous you can see Soldier here any mistake you lost your life and that's happened many times yes the soldiers have the power to detain people like aama for hours question them and place them in administrative detention without charge or trial [Music] should ask that's it I can go I ask him it's almost like you have to ask permission to go into Jerusalem to get back to your own City but this physical infrastructure is just the beginning Israel has a vision of a seamless future where technology minimizes the interactions between Palestinians and the Israeli Army Israel says it's safer but it's quite dystopic my hi a meeting Palestinian digital rights campaigner monaa to find out more explain the growing Trend within Israeli thinking of a so-called frictionless occupation well the whole automation aims to eliminate the the direct interaction between the Israeli as occupying force and Palestinians as occupied people and to make the main interaction between Palestinians and the technology so it could create this idea that our problem is not with the occupier but rather with a technology heon is the testing ground for many of these supposedly frictionless Technologies the city is split into two zones H1 with a population of nearly 200,000 in H2 355,000 Palestinians live under the Gaze of the 750 settlers and 800 soldiers who have taken over the center of the city Palestinians living in H2 face the heaviest surveillance in the West Bank and the strictest travel [Music] restrictions fore fore cat for under the so-called frictionless occupation these cameras are linked to artificial intelligence systems watching for what Israel deames threatening behavior there's someone who watch you who knows what you are doing but you don't necessar know who's watching you Palestinians need to think about behaving at our best all the time sometimes you might be angry from something that happens with your family in your home or at your work and then you might look like angry and with a predictive policing you never know when you would be identified as a security threat by the Israelis so you need to fake your emotions if the frictionless occupation can't get a fixed camera on you it can send a flying one this was recorded just a few miles south of Hebron [Applause] Issa Amro is a human rights activist living in H2 this is a military post full of cameras and surveillance and they watch us for sure now so let's say hi I usually say hi to them we are in the main street in teda Palestinians are not allowed to drive here pal shops are closed by military orders and the street here is full of Israeli military surveillance let's see the Palestinian K kids in the window they are caged in the house look they they put fences in their Windows to be protected from the settler and army violence look surveillance for the military is up there and this is the surveillance of the Israeli settlers so imagine that the Israeli settlers they have their own systems here these checkpoints are where the latest frictionless technology is tested including this AI enabled remotely controlled gun which fires stung grenades tear gas and sponge tip bullets it's made by Israeli company smart shooter these checkpoints also boast Israel's most comprehensive data Gathering tool Wolfpack from 10 to 15 cameras are at the checkpoint this is where they use red wolf and blue wolf the Israeli military recently invented two systems red wolf and blue wolf blue wolf in the soldiers phones they take your photo then they know all details about you where you've been where you go what you like what you don't like your private things then there is another system the red wolf is set up in the checkpoints and in the control rooms and it's profiling Palestinians according to their political stands when the soldiers scan a Palestinian face they get a traffic light style indication of their supposed risk white for Palestinians who are not doing anything about occupation you have yellow and you have orange for example I'm a human rights Defender I am red it means check him make his life harder he's a suspect so the frictionless technology actually enables a lot more friction for some people they use us as simulation objects for their technology Israeli sec SEC solution companies they installed cameras sensors drones and they tested it on us without our consent do they sell it do they use it for other research what kind of data they collect it seems to be the often secret Partnerships between the military and private sector that have helped Israeli companies become world leaders in their fields in 2019 a report revealed that Israeli company any Vision had installed Styles in the West Bank and was collecting movement and biometric data from the tens of thousands of Palestinians forced to use them early investor Microsoft pulled their funding after this was revealed the company changed its name to Uso and says it works in 43 countries with clients including casinos airports and schools another Israeli company visites make behavioral recognition systems that watch CCTV feeds for any threats the company actually created the ability to take a realtime video stream and understand what's going on within the stream the company is supported by the Israeli military it's marketed for use in cities prisons and refugee camps around the [Music] world we're in abis in East Jerusalem and I'm standing next to a old but now derelict Hotel owned by Palestinians and during the second Intero in the early 2000s the separation wall was built and it's kind of surrounded now on all sides no one can access it the owners can't use it the guests are not coming but what Israel has done is on the top they've installed surveillance cameras the location is patrolled by police and private security 24 hours a day just a minute ago we saw the move probably to watch us minutes later four young Israeli police officers with machine guns approached us so what are you explaining about the situation this formerly Palestinian Run Hotel taken over by the military and turned into a surveillance post could be seen as a microcosm of the occupation but what is visible is just part of the overall picture of how the occupation surveils Palestinians first there is the physical infrastructure of walls and checkpoints the checkpoints record movement data and biometric information then they have CCTV cameras which are monitored by AI for perceived threats of violence and that in turn is hooked up to databases like red wolf which track everyone's political profile but there's also a more fundamental level of surveillance which is that most of the phone and internet system is routed through Israel Israel is controlling the ICT infrastructure in the in in the occupied Palestinian territory which means that Palestinians are not able to have safe access to the internet with control of basic Communications infrastructure the Israelis know every phone number and can tap any call Israeli intelligence also have teams monitoring all the social media platforms many Palestinians basically they don't share their political opinion online because they would be afraid of being interrogated or arrested by the Israelis I find it remarkable that sometimes blanket CCTV coverage analyzed by artificial intelligence and backed up by biometric movement tracking just isn't enough surveillance I'm off to meet a man who once presented such a threat to the authorities that they deployed the world's most invasive spye on him Anthony hithon lovely to meet you U alaboodi didn't look threatening to me he runs the bisan center which campaigns for the rights of Palestinians do you have any idea why you were targeted I think it has to do with the targeting of any kind of Palestinian Civil Society Israel sees us as part of a establishing that there is a Palestinian people how did you hear that your phone had been infected by Pegasus and why do you think that happened you're working with Palestinian human rights organization El haak right I was contact by alhak in late 2021 they found that one of their employees had Pegasus on his phone I had my device checked and they told me that my phone was infected by Pegasus spyware a couple of days later the Israeli uh Minister of Defense uh benig Gans designated six Palestinian Civil Society organization as terrorist organization including ban including ban Pegasus is unique spyware that can access every aspect of your phone it can take control of your camera your microphone and broadcast it to those controlling the software they can see your location access your data and see what's on your screen including encrypted messaging apps is there anything you feel like you can do or do you ultimately feel like there's not much you can practically do it was explained to me by a citizen lab that once a state actor goes after any citizen or small organization there's basically very little they can do Pegasus is produced by Israeli surveillance company NSO and is marketed to government agencies as a tool for fighting crime and terrorism in 2021 an investigation revealed that around 50,000 people worldwide potentially had it on their phones and a large number of them were journalists lawyers dissidents and human rights Defenders 1 2 34 we don't want your cyber War it's no accident that this spyware was developed in is much of nso's staff is drawn from the Army's cyber intelligence unit [Music] 88,200 this unit is tasked with Gathering intelligence from electronic communications and conducting cyber warfare against Palestinians it's known for being highly Innovative and spinning out successful cyber security companies like NSO to find out how 88,200 has helped Israel become a global leader in surveillance technology I'm meeting Yakov Perry a former director of the shined intelligence agency this one here was you dressed as an Arab in Gaza when do you think that was 88 1988 can you say what you were doing no okay that's um 68 yeah okay in ness okay so the first year after six day occupation yeah yeah here we have all kinds of of way to smuggle hangers what hangers also with explosives how has Israel sold itself really for decades now as a global leader in defense and homeland security equipment you cannot defend yourself only by a human uh sources you have to use also a technology in order to be on the uh pinning side Israel had to be very very very creative to find solutions that um you cannot buy in the market or the um around the world one of the innovators is unit 8200 it's been around for many years talk a little bit about based on your experience what that unit is we have developed a unique technology how to where to tape whom be be raped and the ability to reach to top secrets that usually are hidden we say that if a ruler wants to H do something it's is in his mind but he cannot do it alone he has to share it with at least one two three or four people who are close to him and we have developed Technologies that can reach the right persons that we will tap and know so 88,200 became a one of the secrets of Israeli intelligence I'm not asking you to reveal top secret intelligence but give a sense what are the kind of methods that Israel was using to try to get that intelligence if you want to follow a certain terrorist or a certain cell you have to be equipped with surveillance technology that gives you the advantage to watch him without him sensing you you have to develop ammunition which you can use in a remote control for a long distance so sometimes the you headquarters is in Tel Aviv and the terrorist cell is in Gaza Strip and you want to uh kill somebody you have to be very very accurate you have to be with a the best technology that you will not be accused by killing innocent people we are getting hits send the lanus Israel is a leader in remote control bombing with small drones like the controversial lanus systems presents lanus SE an attack in one new Innovative autonomous lethal solution they're part of the class of small highly maneuverable quadcopters getting extensive use for the first time in Gaza the high budget promo suggests it may have been battle tested in Palestine and the Drone is exactly what Perry is describing andity in a complex Urban environment a remote controlled explosive that can be put next to the Target Israel is now about the ninth or 10th biggest arms seller in the world it depends every year how does Israel become for a relatively small country one of the biggest arms sellers in the world yeah it's true that Israel is one of the biggest AR arms sellers we have been also selling a um all the technology that can help you to deal with terrorists I mean the whole world is dealing with terrorist activity so the market is big I would say that 80% of the technology that we have developed in Israel is not top secret it's something that you can share with other ER organizations mainly H security agencies and armies H for instance the most most common technology that we have developed here is the Iron Dome and now we can sell iron do to the whole world with a wave of its innovative wand Raphael has developed a first of its kind counter rocket artillery mortar cram system with pinpoint accuracy interceptors against asymmetric threats Iron Dome the Iron Dome is often used to refer to all of these Israel's anti-missile interception systems together they make Israel a world leader in anti-missile protection and are a showcase for Israel's weapons companies who are Keen to promote how Cutting Edge and Innovative they are aro3 the ARA system counters high altitude ballistic missiles and is made by Israel Aerospace Industries II also makes the cafir jet Heron drones and its own Jericho ballistic missiles they claim to offer comprehensive Solutions in all domains since Russia's invasion of Ukraine II are marketing their interception systems to European countries on us in 400 m exit right to find out more about Israel's military industrial complex I'm going to meet security and intelligence expert Yosi Melman Israel from the outset decid decided we have to build our own uh strong military industrial complex that realization has been always in the mind of Israel we have to be uh on top of our enemies from the scientific technological point of view Israel's been developing a range of new technologies and weapons certain kind of Robotics certain kinds of drones quadcopters explain a bit about what you understand is being used there has been a major shift in the focus of the Israeli Industries if 30 40 years ago Israel industries were still selling rifles pistols ammunition nowadays they have moved to more advanced technological equipment the logic is very positive to try to minimize Israel's own casualties it's safer to first move into the tunnels with a robot rather than sending your foood soldiers a formation of autonomous aerial and ground systems can provide unprecedented ISR capabilities to units on the Tactical Edge from 3D Legion X is the integrated combat system for controlling autonomous robotic vehicles and drones all made by Elbert Israel's largest private weapons producer Andy Legion is maximizing now worth nearly 10 billion Elbert promotes itself as leading the world in Automation and Robotics and this technical Mastery is key to how Israel has governed Gaza Israel directly occupied Gaza from 1967 to 2005 when the Israeli Army and settlers withdrew but Israel retained de facto control over the fundamentals of the territory Power Water who could enter and leave how far fishermen could go from the shore and even how many calories people have to eat eat every day the depth of this control was constantly updated with technology in 2021 defense minister Benny gance launched a smart fence stuffed with the latest tech including tunnel detection equipment in 2021 Israel unveiled a huge amount of new technology around Gaza theyd spent billions of dollars they claimed that it was going to keep Israel safe was going to keep Palestinians essentially in Gaza what exactly was being put in place around that time well all sorts of equipment Israel surrounded Gaza with all these Technologies facial recognition hacking telephones visual intelligence from drones reconnaissance flights reconnaissance balloons Israel had the phone numbers of many Hamas members and not only Kamas members also innocent people that information came from bugging and listening and Observatory equipment so so Gaza was surrounded by the equipment and Israel believed that they can control the population and they control above all Hamas the domestic security service shinb and the military intelligence mistake they almost adored worshiped technology but on October the 7th 2023 as part of a highly coordinated offensive hummus drones attacked the watchtowers disabling the CCTV and automated guns with few soldiers on the border the Army claims they were effectively blun to what unfolded Hamas Fighters quickly overran multiple bases which were sparsely manned and not prepared it is said that thousands of hamus Fighters and other Palestinians broke out of Gaza by land sea and air it was the most deadly single day in Israel's history Israel claims that 1,200 people were killed nearly 800 of them civilians and most of them Israeli and that another 250 were taken back to Gaza as hostages according to Hamas and international organizations these numbers have been inflated hamas's attack begs the question of how this multi-billion dollar smart fence armed with radar CCTV and surveillance drones could miss an assault that took years to plan and rehearse so I'm on my way to see Israel Z who's a former Israeli General and he used to actually had the Gaza command for the Israeli Army and o on October 7 he grabbed a gun from his home near Tel Aviv and went down to near the Gaza border to try to as he says kill Hamas terrorists and rescue hostages so let's go see him explain what happened to you on October 7th I've learned that I'm still good even with the pistol I had a chance to to to rescue quite a few people you know some of them were hiding in the area that theas control what do you think as far as we know went horribly wrong everything it's the system collaps I think Israel took one step too far rely in too much on technology which in area like Gaza was very convenient to put all those visual toys you know and and it gave the feeling that we are protected but maybe it wasn't the technology that failed we know that IDF soldiers monitoring Gaza reported increased Hamas activity in the months leading up to October the 7th we saw the Maneuvers we saw the preparations we have listened to the plans we have photoed the terrorist coming I know but for sure that in the Israeli Secret Service and the Israeli intelligence Army intelligence service they uh information was there before October 7 before October yes but nobody thought that it's really going to happen everybody thought you know the Kamas would not there maybe they do a terror act but not such an operation the biggest failure starts from the higher level of command which actually refuses to to to believe or or to see it coming despite the supposed failure of the technology to stop the October the 7th attack 2024 is predicted to be the best year yet for Israel's arms industry and while the Israeli Army may have been slow to react on October the 7 they quickly announced their intention to unleash hell on [Music] Gaza what Israel calls the swords of iron War has resulted in unprecedented levels of death and destruction [Music] I've come to one of the few places in Israel where you can see that with your own eyes I'm in the Israeli town of sto and behind me is Gaza we're pretty much as close as we can get all these religious Jewish people who were behind me gathered as the sun is going down many of them actually want to settle Gaza occupy Gaza build settlements in Gaza and and they're treating it almost like a family get together they're are kids they're having fun they're smiling taking photos it's pretty surreal seeing Gaza here and knowing what's happened since October 7 the mass destruction the mass killing it's yeah pretty overwhelming the war has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians and seen more than 80% of gaza's buildings rendered unusable it might look like random destruction but Israel would claim these are all valid targets and they're all generated by the latest Innovation from unit 88,200 a new system powered by artificial intelligence I've come to Tel Aviv to meet the investigative team who first r red her AI is being used in Gaza some in the military felt that the systems that existed were not giving them in previous Wars enough targets talk a little bit about what that meant practically in previous war what is called in Israel the target Bank was very swiftly was was empty previously they would produce 200 300 targets a year now they can produce sitting an hour the AI targeting systems are only possible because as we've seen Israel collects data on every aspect of Palestinian life the system called The Gospel also takes in historical and Geographic data to generate infrastructure locations that the AI thinks are probably linked to hamus these include tactical targets like military bases and tunnels but there's another category called Power targets that include residential Towers and Civic buildings like schools and medical centers an alifer hospital they are being hit in order to create a psychological effect on the gazin pushing them to go against Hamas of course this didn't happen the Israeli Army says Al shifer housed the Hamas command and control center the bombing of it resulted in over a thousand people being killed injured or disappeared 25,000 people in the surrounding area were also displaced Israel never provided evidence that it had found the command and control center to identify individual Hamas members unit 88,200 created lavender this analyzes the key Behavior traits of active Hamas oper where they go who they talk to who was in their phone contacts and then looks for anyone in Gaza with similar characteristics what are they talking about what kind of words they're using uh all these kind of things you create a list of possible members of Hamas from the very low level or even people that are not really part of the military ring this is basically basically a death list once you are there you are Lely to meet tet the alel neighborhood known as the backbone of Gaza was hid in December 2023 the Israeli Army said it was because there were Hamas operatives concealing themselves there the entire area was devastated what the AI generates is not facts but targets with a statistically probable link to Hamas despite this the systems have led to another change a rise in the acceptable level of Civilian deaths prior to this war a very senior uh Hamas uh Commander there was a collateral damage of let's say five maximum 10 person in this war it was decided that for very Junior Hamas militant the collateral damage decided was between 15 and 20 his family and his neighbors could be killed in order to kill him and if it's a senior Hamas militant then the numbers over 100 sometimes 300 and we know it happened I wanted to know what someone close to the Israeli military thought about this use of AI it's really kind of a big step you know forward in terms of intelligence and also decision making because it's doing the right selection and and put in front of the decision maker much better and clearer picture in order to take decision we did of course ask former General ziv about claims Israel and its AI systems were perpetrating a genocide in Gaza his response the standard line that the Israeli Army is the most moral in the world so AI became a big factor in in in this whole component of Intel decision making command and control uh of the modern fight storing surveillance on an entire population generates a vast amount of data enter Google on Amazon who have been building cloud services and data farms in Israel since 2021 under a deal called project Nimbus After the War Began the Army's Computing division said they were collecting so much data that to move some of it onto the civilian Cloud A200 is using a cloud service by Amazon to storage huge amount of information about people in Gaza and that the This Cloud was used at least to help some of the attacks I've been looking at how Israel's Army and Tech sector benefit from conflict in Palestine but could it also be true of other countries and multinationals to find out more I met with Paul bigar the founder of a billion dooll tech company Google's motto used to be don't be evil and it seems like a lot of these big tech companies Amazon Google and others have no issue with working with Israel in fact they're often expanding their contracts do they not care about the reputational damage fundamentally they're about making money getting that cloud Revenue um you may have started as a $600 million contract but it is uh expanding massively over the years so we are talking uh at the stage where uh where they may be getting billions and possibly tens of billions of dollars from Israel via project Nimbus they're also setting themselves up as the de facto people to talk to when your government needs to uh needs to scale so there's a lot more governments that are a lot larger than uh than Israel and Google wants to be first in line for those contracts and more importantly they've realized there aren't any reputational consequences for what it does so it's not just Israel that uses the Palestinians to test their products on it's actually the whole world and there's no greater arena for testing weapons than a live War the iron sting is a guided mortar marketed as a Precision weapon the iron sting is so precise that it can even hit a specific room without causing damage to other rooms in the same building this is its first use in [Music] battle and looks like it might have damaged more than one room at least two Israeli companies have made drones stable enough to handle gunfire this is elbert's bird of prey seen here accompanying an armored bulldozzer into battle eyewitnesses in Gaza say these drones with guns are proving terrifying and deadly arms experts have told us the last moment of the life of Hamas leader Yaya sinoa were likely filmed on one of these drones his final Act to throw a stick at it talk about some of those things in Gaza that Israel has been doing militarily since October 7 and why you think that might be appealing to other nations everybody knows that that you know Israel is very advanced in in their technology but definitely after such a such a war in Gaza when when people see the demonstration in real life and it's working uh it creates uh you know the needs and the understanding how crucial those things are and and how critical for others to to hold it and to have it now Israel has physical access to Gaza they're rolling out many of the surveillance techniques used in the West Bank unit 88,200 is giving soldiers and drones AI enabled surveillance technology to search for anyone linked to Hamas or other rebel groups the system relies on technology from corite an Israeli video Analysis company and the Israeli Army is also using Google photos which can identify people from just a fraction of their face we are basically speaking about about a system where the government where the private sector producing and exporting the facial recognition technique they test those Technologies in Palestine in the occupied Palestinian territory so occupying people is profitable because it's not only you take the resources of the land now we are speaking about digital occupation where also your data is a new resource to develop a new technologies and to start selling that worldwide to profit from oppressing other people but perhaps the most advanced and gamechanging weapon being used in the Gaza war is the targeting of human beings by artificial intelligence so do you think that tools like lavender the gospel there's a decent chance of Israel could potentially be selling those tools to other militaries I think it's a very fair possibility that Israel will will sell it and this is I think one of the reasons they allowed our story to be published just explain a bit what you mean by that H you have to file any report that relates to the military the military censorship and they can allow disallow I suspect there were people in Israel who wanted the world to know that they have very very sophisticated AI surveillance methods that can collect and kill being here again I've seen how physical barriers and high technology divide this land in a way many human rights organizations call apartheid I've seen how this has allowed Israel to create World leading surveillance and arms Industries who export their products globally in the next episode I'm heading off to some of Israel's top customers I'll be asking if Israel is just selling its technology or if they're also exporting something else the ideology behind the occupation of Palestine
