today's show looking at the university protest movement nationwide as students deliver commencement speeches over the weekend many focusing their remarks on denouncing Israel's relentless war on Gaza and their university's complicity in attempting to silence their voices on Friday the Indian-American class president at MIT the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Mega Viri was barred from attending her graduation ceremony after she gave a commencement speech on Friday uh on Thursday when she wore a red and white kafia and said MIT students would never support a genocide praising them for continuing to protest despite quote &quot;Threats intimidation and suppression coming from all directions especially she said your own university officials.&quot; This is part of her speech the Israeli occupation forces are the only foreign military that MIT has researched ties with this means that Israel's assault on the Palestinian people is not only aided and embedded by our country but our school as scientists engineers academics and leaders we have a commitment to support life support aid efforts and call for an arms embargo and keep demanding now as alumni that MIT cuts the ties meanwhile at Harvard University down the road in Cambridge faculty join students and calling for an end to Israel's war on Gaza this is professor of law Andrew Crespbow addressing the 2025 Harvard Law School graduating class last week commending students for standing up to the Trump administration's crackdown on universities and education in an endless barrage our government has tried to crush Harvard University the very symbol of higher education in the world and more simply than that our home our scientists and international students have been taken hostage our research bankrupted our community terrorized all in an effort to try to change the way that we teach the questions we ask and the answers we offer from climate change to vaccines to the study of race and inequality in our country's past and present they want us to shut up or worse they want us to say only what they want to hear this too is what authoritarianism looks like in the face of it fear is rational but courage is essential and to your great credit you the class of 2025 have taught us time and again what true courage looks like harvard Law School professor Andrew Crespo also criticized his own university's response to the wave of pro Palestine peaceful protests on campus we your university have not always learned well the lessons you were trying to teach harvard deserves praise for taking a stand to defend its academic independence [Applause] it is just as important for Harvard to use that independence to protect the academic freedoms including the rights to study publish teach and yes protest of everyone on our campus without exception especially when our messages are politically inconvenient in this respect whether in denying degrees to peaceful protesters or suspending hundreds of students and some teachers from our libraries or firing the faculty directors of our center for Middle Eastern Studies in what the New York Times called quote unquote an offering to the Trump administration I fear sometimes our university has too often exhibited acquiescence when courage was called for sooner rather than later I am confident we will learn the lessons you try to teach us for our own sake and for the sake of this democracy harvard law professor Andrew Crespbow was speaking after winning the 2025 Albert M saxs Paul award for teaching excellence at Harvard he was addressing the graduating class of the Harvard Law School in a minute we'll be joined by Zara Imam a new graduate of the Harvard Divinity School where she delivered the commencement address last week she's also Muslim associate chaplain at MIT she spoke out in support of Palestine in her remarks class of 2025 Palestine is waiting for us to arrive and you must be courageous enough to rise to the call because Palestine will keep showing up in our living rooms until we are ready to meet its gaze zera Imam is wearing a kafia on her head she held a Palestinian flag as she addressed the commencement ceremony at Harvard Divinity School zara Imam joins us now for more she's also a Muslim associate chaplain at MIT just down the road uh Zara congratulations on your graduation uh from Harvard Divinity School can you elaborate on your comments yeah um first thanks thanks for having me on the show Amy um I what I was talking about in my speech is the fact that we this is a moment that calls for courage uh not just on part of the student body but the administration and all college campuses beyond harvard and beyond um we are seeing that um last year Alan Garber um got booed at commencement and this year he got a standing ovation for celebrating international students but what if those international students are Palestinian and they come to a place like Harvard where you know I took a class called um on on Israel Palestine and that class no longer exists and at Harvard i also um went to Palestine through Harvard Divinity School that program no longer exists at Harvard Divinity School um the three professor the three teachers who taught that class are no longer at Harvard so what kind of a place is Harvard for its Palestinian students who are coming in and for its pro Palestinian students who are protesting at Harvard um so that's that's what I was calling attention to i was also calling attention to the fact that I have worked with students in Kaza who I was in conversation with as I was working on this speech and they are living their history's worst nightmares um and there are parts of the speech that I didn't even put in that um I want to share right now which are that I I felt truly that I'm in touch with the Anne Franks of our time and but we can still change the ending and I say that because just yesterday I saw Anne Frank's uh great cousin come on uh a video and he he called for the Jewish community for the Germans for the international community to stop the war crimes that are happening and taking place in Gaza and all across Palestine so that's that's what I was calling attention to in um in bringing up Palestine in my speech who wrote your speech along with two other students one Christian the other Jewish you are Muslim correct and we each wrote our respective parts we each gave input to one another we had other students look over the speech i had I personally not only brought in students from um I I had a lot of quotes from students from Gaza that you know some I brought in some I couldn't but I was in I was in conversation but yeah it was a it was a group effort um not because we agreed with everything we were saying um but because it was important to be in solidarity with one another in a moment when um the world is is extremely divided um and I think we wanted to show what it means to be in community with one another um so yeah so let me ask you um you are also um an associate chaplain at MIT um I wanted to get your comment on the Indian-American class president at MIT Mega Vim Murray who was barred from attending her graduation ceremony after she gave a commencement speech the day before um around Palestine uh your thoughts um I think Mega is incredibly brave um she and as are all the students at MIT and on college campuses who are standing up for Palestine um yeah everything she said really speaks to the heart and soul of the student movements which are going to be undeterred um and that was clear in her speech um students will keep uh speaking up for Palestine and for liberation um across college campuses so I'm I'm really proud of Mega for for having finding the right words and um really really being very courageous well I want to thank you for being with us uh did you get your diploma after you gave your commencement address Zarah Imam i did um you know and I so I mean I have it so far so I don't have any um haven't changes with that yet even though Mega V Murray was not allowed to attend her graduation uh MIT did bestow upon her her diploma unlike NYU that took away the diploma of a young student who spoke out in his graduation address uh that does it for our show i'm Amy Goodman thanks so much for joining us democracy Now is funded by viewers like you please give today at

          <attvalue for="7" value="this is democracy Now democracynow.org War peace and the presidency I'm Amy Goodman on Sunday here in New York City more than 2,000 people packed the historic Riverside Church for a discussion about America and the war on Palestine it was hosted by the Palestine Festival of literature or palfest the church Riverside where Dr Martin Luther King Jr uh gave his speech on April 4th 196 67 a year to the day before he was assassinated the event yesterday featured several speakers including Palestinian human rights attorney Nora erot a professor at Rutter's University author of justice for some law and the question of Palestine another of the panelists was kianga yamata Taylor professor of African-American studies at Princeton University and contributing writer at the New Yorker magazine you can see our interview with Professor yata Taylor last week at democracynow.org in a minute we'll hear from human rights attorney Nora erot she was introduced by the moderator and author tanasi coats his new book the message in part about a visit he took to the occupied West Bank and Israel that was organized by members of palfest the sponsors of yesterday's event this is what he had to say when I think about being here I I think about ancestors and I think it would be wrong if I didn't if we didn't proceed without acknowledging that um first of all I was informed uh when I came here that this is where uh Edward s's funeral was um and so it's incredibly appropriate to be here in this moment um the second thing is something that yes me and I talked about and have't been talking about for a year even when we did the other event before um was the fact that this was also the place where Martin Luther King uh stood up against the Vietnam War uh and was so courageous and I want to acknowledge that in his time when he did that a lot of people did not applaud um I want to acknowledge that there were many people who he thought of as his allies um who left him um yes yes yes yes yes that's why I think it's very appropriate right absolutely um who urged him to U be silent as bombs were being dropped uh on on on helpless people um and he did not do that and so I think in that Spirit that's the spirit in which we proceed in our conversation yes um we're going to talk a lot about Theory today um not that theory is irrelevant but I do think it is important for us to ground ourselves in the reality of what is going on right now um and nor if you would just take a moment uh for us us um and speak to the ongoing genocide um the pain the life lost um frankly the role that we as Americans play in that um if you would just take a moment for us just to ground us so so that we are not forgetting so that we are not you know all the way up here thank you thank you tanassi thank you kianga into this audience again thank you for coming to find Sanctuary collectively I think that this was a concern that after more more than a year of watching Slaughter of babies this is essentially and continues to be a war on children uh in a besieged territory where 50% of the population is children so even before a bomb is dropped it is a war on children um that it's really easy to then pivot to the theoretical piece to make sense of it we want to make sense of it at this stage and what gets lost is what's happening and so I appreciated full full transparency tanasi asked me to do this just you know right before this event so I thought that the the proper way to do it was actually to read testimony from the ground um from a colleague um from a colleague who who uh in Gaza who is recounting as of 6:00 a.m. this morning one of his colleagues uh woke up to 32 members of his family who were killed in jabalia and jabalia is in the north which is now under now an even tighter Siege in a campaign of extermination and ethnic cleansing what he writes um upon waking up at 6:00 a.m. and finding his family slaughtered is that quote I live meters away from them it is a matter of luck I wish I died with them neither my heart or mind can tolerate this my Uncle his wife and three sons and grandson grandsons and daughters all deleted um his he also lost his brother earlier in the year and as we've been paying attention in this moment which is important to ground we're on Day 400 of genocide but we're on Day 36 of the siege of the North and the siege of the north is a tightening of the siege that already existed right and it's a siege that even predates the beginning of this campaign this genocidal campaign it's a Siege that's been in place since 2006 at the earliest thinking about a land Siege and a naval blockade but 1993 if you go back to when Gaza is first circumscribed by barbed wire as a way to prepare for peace the irony is that the preparation for peace was a program to isolate and separate the Gaza Strip from the rest of the question of Palestine and to call it the pal the Palestinian state Le and never to leave the West Bank to negotiation but it was done in the language of peace that this this double speak continues but now here we are of this third and 36 days of this particular campaign and we got the earliest indication of it on day six of this genocide when there was an order to evacuate the north to below the W line right the line that's the which was the order if you remember when 1.1 million Palestinians that's more than half the population besieged was ordered to leave the north to below the weine but note that that removal was a death sentence as the World Health Organization called it a death sentence how do you remove the immobile how do you force the sick to travel and those that did take the risk and travel were targeted on the on the humanitarian lines that they were given indicating to us on day six that there would be no safe quarter that this was a campaign of genocide and it's why um Holocaust studies scholar Ros seal the very next day published in Jewish currents this is a textbook case of genocide right and it's why 800 12 Scholars third world approaches to international law Scholars I I when people call me international law you know the constant question that I get is how do you still believe in the law and I'm like I'm a twail scholar we never believed in it we've been telling you it is a source and a sight of Oppression and Colonial domination my book tries to see that yes and tries to to to demonstrate how despite this colonial structure we can use it for emancipatory purposes under which circumstances right use it when it suit us abandon it when it doesn't create new law when we can it is a tool it is not the word of God it is not holy it is subject to change and to change by us so those 8002 Scholars who know that said raising the alarm this is genocide this was all within the first week all within the first week and now we're hearing something known as the General's plan the General's plan which is the the the the formula for Exterminating the north the 400,000 people total Palestinians left in the north 100,000 particularly in the area now marked for ethnic cleansing um the General's plan is the brainchild of General um I Gora what is his first name Gora Eland Gora Eland who proposes this plan Gora Eland was also the architect of the Elon plan in the early 2000s which competed with Ariel chiron's plan for unilateral withdrawal and disengagement which was the withdrawal of Israeli settlers and the withdrawal of military installations but the maintenance of occupation of Gaza that Elon plan in the early 2000s was to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza into the Sinai right so what the idea that he's now by the way Med so thanks to you know our partners Med have written wrote beautifully and and thoroughly about the Elon plan but you have the 1993 circumscription of Gaza and preparation for peace you have the Elon plan in the year 2000 you have the evacuation order on October 12th which was uh called a death sentence you have the calls that this is genocide since day seven you have now the General's plan we have a year over a year of bearing witness to what you know my my job and other people's job has been to to illuminate what can't be seen what's been ausc they have illuminated it for us at this point it is not about us telling you what you have to read between the lines it's literally about what they don't want to hear not what is not being revealed because they are telling us they have shown us it is evident they are defending it they call it self-defense and they call the completion of the neba as as the right to complete so it's less opusc right and now it becomes more about it's a battle of narrative who do you want to listen to nura erakat professor at rutr University author of justice for some law and the question of Palestine speaking Sunday here in New York at the his Riverside Church at an event moderated by author tanasi coats his new book The Message the event was hosted by the Palestine Festival of literature also in that discussion uh Kanga yamata Taylor Princeton University Professor to see our interview with her go to democracynow.org the next palfest event Palestine Festival of literature will be held in London November 20th to Mark the republication of Edward S book the question of Palestine followed by events in Detroit Philadelphia and Minneapolis"

          <attvalue for="7" value="democracy depends on a free press Please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org/g This is democracyow democracynow.org the Warren peace report I'm Amy Goodman with Narin Sh We turn now to look at how criticism of Israel is growing in Europe as the UK pauses trade talks and the EU reviews its relationship with Israel That is this is British Prime Minister Kier Star speaking Tuesday But first Mr Mr Speaker I'd like to say something about the horrific situation in Gaza where the level of suffering innocent children being bombed again is utterly intolerable The recent announcement that Israel will allow a basic quantity of food into Gaza a basic quantity is totally and utterly inadequate So we must coordinate our response because this war has gone on for far too long We cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve Kier Starmer the British Prime Minister long an ally of Israel The British foreign secretary David Lami also condemned Israel's actions in Gaza in a speech to the House of Commons Prime Minister Netanyahu end this blockade now and let the aid in Regrettably Madame Deputy Speaker despite our efforts this Israeli government's egregious actions and rhetoric have continued They are isolating Israel from its friends and partners around the world undermining the interests of the Israeli people and damaging the image of the state of Israel in the eyes of the world Therefore today I'm announcing that we have suspended negotiations with this Israeli government on a new trade free trade agreement The comments of the British Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister came days after as many as 500,000 people took part in a massive march for Palestine in London to mark the 77th anniversary of the Nakba Meanwhile the European Union has announced its re reviewing its relationship with Israel We're joined now by two guests from Brussels Lynn Boland is with us a Irish member of the European Parliament chair of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Palestine And joining us from London British MP former Labor Party leader Jeremy Corbin welcome back to Democracy Now Um MP Corbin if you could start off by responding to the shift We just were in Gaza talking to a British doctor who's there helping uh the children and the people of Gaza saying that what Kier Starmer has done does make a difference Now uh you were certainly opposed to uh the prime minister It's so much of the support of Israel What is causing the shift in the British government's position it's pretty clear that the huge demonstrations in Britain and the outpouring of uh public condemnation of Israel's bombardment of Gaza has eventually forced the British government into a slightly different position in that they've now suspended as you reported the trade talks with Israel They claim to have suspended all arm supplies to Israel but we question that because we believe that parts for the F-35 jets are still being sold to Israel And we're also questioning the amount of arms that have been sold over the last few months But there's no doubt that the uh position of the Palestinian people being starved to death bombed to death in Gaza has forced the British government into a different position We are keeping up all the pressure we can in order to get aid in but also to end the occupation because that is clearly what the ICJ position is end the occupation of Gaza and of the West Bank Well let's bring in uh Lynn Bolan Uh Lynn you're a member of European Parliament Uh could you talk about and also chair of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Palestine if you could talk about the significance of this review Uh the European Union is of course Israel's largest trading partner but what do you think could come of this review given that there is no unanimous position uh within the European uh Union on Israel well I think for first and foremost I' I'd echo what Jeremy is saying is that the the only reason why the EU has announced this review and there isn't even a an overall like there isn't even a majority at the EU council level to review the trading agreement is because of the people power and the pressure that is coming on politicians right across the European Union and I'd encourage people to continue to do that Um but I would say that the time for review is long since passed So what we're calling for is to spend the agreement pending the review The review can take place They can do the the research If they haven't seen what everybody has seen on their phone is that Israel is not upholding uh human rights and article two of the trading agreement it should be suspended But we're calling for them to suspend it then carry out your review and come back with your findings But what we're fearing is that the announcing a review is like kicking it down the road It's I suppose addressing the people pressure but actually not doing anything concrete um to address the situation So we're also calling on MEPs right across Europe uh who are frustrated by the lack of of Europeanwide action to call on their national governments to end trade with Israel For example in Ireland we have what's called the occupied territories bill um which would cease trade obviously just with the occupied territories but it would be a significant uh message sent out that at least Ireland wants to be compliant with international law and we're encouraging MEPs across Europe to do similar initiatives in their countries And so Jeremy Corbin if you could talk about what sanctions the UK has already imposed on Israel and against whom and talk about the new inquiry You've been calling for a new inquiry into Britain's relationship with Israel If you could tell us what that's about Sure On June the 4th I'm introducing a private members bill into the House of Commons calling for an independent inquiry into the whole process of policymaking in relation to Gaza the West Bank and uh Britain's arm supplies to Israel particularly during the period since October uh 2023 This is similar to the inquiry that was headed by Sir John Chilcott eventually to inquire into policym surrounding the Iraq war My purpose in doing this is because the government has obfuscated on many many occasions over the past 18 months over the level of arms supplies over trade over aid over uh credits and so on to Israel and also particularly about the manufacturer of Israeli weapons in Britain particularly in Sheffield and other places where parts with the F-35 are made So a group of us in parliament have been raising this consistently The issue of arm supplies goes something like this Britain was a was and remains to some extent a supplier of arms to Israel David Lammy the foreign secretary suspended 30 arms licenses out of 300 that were in operation without ever specifying what these 30 licenses were And to be honest I still don't know what those 30 arms licenses are He claims they were over supply of weapons that could be used for crimes against humanity But we later discovered that many weapons have continued to be supplied And yesterday we published a report from Progressive International and other groups which is outlining the whole case for suspending arm supplies and pointing out the dishonesty of the British government over the past 18 months on this And that report is being circulated to MPs and will be part of uh the case I'll be making to the British Parliament on June the 4th The question of suspending the trade talks is an interesting one and a very interesting development because to some extent it is running in tandem in parallel rather with what the European Union is doing because Britain is no longer a member of the European Union We welcome that suspension There has always been the legal case against buying settlement goods because of the illegality of the settlements But it has been very hard to trace what are settlement goods and what isn't But actually a consumer boycott is gathering pace The members of the cooperative society a very big retailer in Britain with a huge me membership base across the whole country voted by 70% last week to request their board to suspend all purchases from Israel So no Israeli products would be stopped in co-op stocked in co-op shops And there's a lot of pressure on to the other big wreathers to do the same So there's been an enormous shift in public opinion And it's caused by utter revulsion at seeing emaciated children starve to death or dying on the operating theater where there's no anesthetics or even antiseptics to treat their terrible conditions they're suffering People can stomach no longer the sight of Palestinian children being starved and murdered by the Israeli occupation of Gaza MP Corbin the UK sanctioned violent western uh West Bank settlers but the British foreign minister Lami stopped short of targeting Israeli officials Can you talk about the um significance of those sanctions and uh what you think has to go further the sanctions themselves against individual violent um settlers are important and a good a good step forward So far the only sanctions apply to um Beny Netanyahu and Benny Gance who have um arrest warrants out from the International Criminal Court And Britain as a signary to the Rome Convention is required to carry out those arrest warrants should either of those individuals turn up in UK territory What David Lammy stopped short of doing was what many of us requested which is a wider sanctioning of officials in the Israeli government who've been a party to the decision making on the bombardment of Gaza Their names are well known but also of uh Israeli Defense Force um high command who are also obviously very much part of the decision-making process on which buildings to bomb and which buildings to blow up not that there's many buildings left in Gaza that are still to be blown up And so we are continuing that pressure So there's a big move in parliament on military equipment on demanding aid get in rapidly rapidly rapidly to Gaza um and also sanctions against Israeli officials And so changes are happening but it's desperately slow And already over 60,000 have died in Gaza Can I also ask you about your response to what happened in Washington uh all these young uh embassy and consular uh staffers uh from different uh consulates uh and organizations gathered at the Jewish Museum and uh a young man uh opened fire killing two of those who worked at the Israeli embassy Your response it's absolutely shocking Nobody should be shot Nobody should be killed at any event anywhere around the world That is not the way to solve the issue And so we have to be resolute in demanding peace for all and also recognize that um in the case of Britain and also in the case of the USA the big demonstrations in support of the Palestinian people are of Christian Jewish and Muslim and people of no particular faith And one of the biggest groups on our demonstrations in support of the Palestinian people is actually the Jewish block Uh Lynn Boland finally before we end uh if you could also respond to events here Washington DC the killing of these two uh Israeli embassy staffers and then the fact that within the EU it's France that's leading efforts for the official recognition of Palestine if you could talk about the significance of that France meeting Saudi Arabia next month apparently in uh uh New York Foreign Secretary Lammy has said he's also in talks with Fr France and Saudi Arabia about officially recognizing Palestine Um please Yeah And and just to echo I suppose what Jeremy has said and send my condolences to the family of the two who who were shot dead last night Um nobody should be losing their lives Um what we want to see is peace We want to have a a longstanding peace uh in Gaza in Palestine for the Palestinian people and Jewish people to be able to live in peace Um in regards to President Mcron and leading the the case for the recognition of the state of Palestine look it is very welcome Um Ireland and Spain recognized Palestine I think it was about a year ago You know Sweden some years before It is it is important It's a really significant step and I'm sure it be very much welcomed by the Palestinian people But for me the urgency within the EU now is ending the blockade is demanding the ceasefire And demanding the ceasefire means that EU countries need to stop supplying weapons to Israel So Jeremy was talking about Britain's role in in arming Israel We have countries within the EU who are significant weapons providers to the Israeli state if they wanted this conflict and this war and genocide to end tomorrow then they need to stop supplying weapons to to Israel Um and the F-35s is a critical part of that Um we also need to see the aid getting in and the aid needs to be delivered and and supported through UNRA Um and we're fighting very hard back at any push to to militarize the aid agenda And we're seeing Israel talking about setting up compounds where you know women would have to to to go to areas putting themselves in vulnerable positions people with disabilities children having to go and that Israel would decide who is deserving and who isn't deserving of aid Uh this cannot be tolerated What we need is UNRA to be allowed to do their job lift the blockade let the trucks in and deliver the aid to the people who so desperately need it those children 14,000 children who are at risk of dying from starvation in the next 48 hours That's where our focus should be Absolutely Recognize the state of Palestine But right now the people of Palestine need food They need medicine They need water And they need to stop the bombs dropping on them Democracy Now is funded

          <attvalue for="7" value="we haven't yet actually discussed the origins of of Israel um and Palestine let's discuss the Genesis of Israel yeah so in the aftermath of World War II uh the Zionist movement finally had a little bit of uh of legitimacy so Zionism was born in the end of the 19th century as a result of the dfus affair so dfus was a Jewish German officer in the French army it's a little a little convol he gets busted by the French for being a spy for Germany the Jewish population in Europe interpreted that as an attack on a on a Jewish person it it's just as possible if not as likely that it was it was actually an attack on an ethnic German living in France right yeah there was probably I'm not denying that there was anti-Semitism in France obviously was but but he was also German so there was probably also a component of anti-german the reality was is he was scapegoated he had nothing to do with what he was being charged with and so um zionists like Herzel are Bor the the Zionist movement is born Herzel kind of being the father of it in the Jewish population it had already existed as an idea we described earlier Napoleon wanting to send Jews to Palestine so the dominant anti Jewish ideology was originally called uden hos in Germany which meant Jew hatred the problem with the name was it sounds like an emotional thing as opposed to a logical thing so they coined the phrase anti-Semitism so that they could say look it's I it's not that I have an emotion I just I disagree with the presence of Jews in Europe part a component of the anti-semitic movement was we just wanted the Jews to leave the initial ideology didn't want to kill the Jewish population obviously it morphs into that and turns into the Holocaust but the orig goal wasn't to kill them it was just to evict them um you know in the same way that uh there's a there's a portion of the United States population that wants to evict undocumented immigrants or that the German population wanted to evict undocumented polish immigrants or that the British wanted to evict the Polish immigrants and that's why they voted for brexit right it's that it's that mentality and so here are these profoundly racist anti-semites they coin the phrase anti-semitism the Zionist movement goes maybe they're right maybe we should leave Europe maybe we're not we can't make a good life for ourselves here um Herzel wasn't interested initially in Palestine he want he was thinking someplace like Uganda so in a really weird way what happened was the creation of a population of White Europeans who were who wanted to conduct a colonial Enterprise not unlike the colonial Enterprise that ended up with Argentina and in the United States in Canada and Australia where there would be a population of white people going to another country and ethnically cleansing and genociding the local population to take it from them ultimately the zionists really just wanted to go to Palestine um the balfor Declaration sort of reinforces the idea of going to Palestine um balfor was a British Lord who said that's where they should end up um and then World War II happens before World War III happens a lot of Jews decide to do this and they begin migrating to Palestine the Palestinian population welcomed them they they saw this as sort of a natural outcome um in part because historically Jews and Muslims and Christians in the Middle East got along you have to remember that even during the Crusades the native Christian population if it had been open to the Crusader states in the beginning totally rejected the Crusader states by the end and were siding with the the the the their fellow Muslims against the Crusades the Crusaders and the Jewish population was always against the Crusaders there was this history of Muslims knew the Jews were their allies and so the idea of Jewish Europeans coming to Palestine the Palestinians welcomed them in uh there's count account after account after account of Palestinian families letting like Jewish poles move into their homes and live with them and then they would do something foolish like go on vacation and come back and the Jewish population in the home said no no this is our home now and you can't come back into it and and and so there was this strange effect of the Palestinians going yeah sure come the Jewish immigrants to Palestine sorry this was like 1910 20s like tens 20s 30s some of them began to do terrorism and so they terrorist organizations formed they began attacking British assets they attack hotels British military bases um so there's a violent element to this um there was a also an attempt to Simply legally purchase land and the the Zionist ended up purchasing somewhere around 5 10% of Palestine legally and then in the process uh there was attempts to create land confiscation where they would just go onto a piece of land that nobody owned and begin colonizing it um the World War II happens there's the Holocaust which is a catastroph event and the world becomes open to the idea that yeah there needs to be a Jewish State the irony is if you're going to create the Jewish State let's do it so I'm part Austrian just I want to out that because I'm I'm GNA suggest the Middle East peace solution let's make Austria a new Israel Hitler was an Austrian the the Germans Austria is German they speak German you can talk to austrians and go I'm not a I'm not I'm not German I'm Austrian whatever they're Germans the Germany did the Holocaust Germany annexed Austria and did the Holocaust so put Israel in Austria call it Israel make the danu be the the boundary between the Austrian area you know so instead of calling it The the West Bank call it the North bank right and put the austrians there Vienna will rename it Jerusalem and then tro will call up the terroll strip and we'll just shove a bunch of the Austrian population into the North Bank and the terrol strip but then let's colonize the the North Bank and and create little walled off sections and ghettoize the I mean I think that's the solution the natural solution instead the world thought let's do this to Palestine which is ironic because it's the Palestinians have nothing to do with the Holocaust in any way shape or form uh during the war some Jews from Palestine actually joined a Jewish uh Brigade that fought with the British the British wouldn't let Palestinians do that because they didn't want Palestinians to have had combat experience but but they did employ Palestinians as stors so Palestinians did serve on the docks loading and unloading ships uh so that so that white people could fight the war because the British were nervous about having brown and black people fight they they did BR and black people definitely fought for the British they were just reluctant they didn't want anybody getting an idea and leading a rebellion when they went back home to Kenya or South Africa or Palestine um ironically the BR British love to put giras and Maes into combat situations but that's a different story so in the aftermath of all of this the UN votes to divide Palestine and and create an Israel and a Palestine the division the vote for the division gave Israel about 55% of Palestine and gave the Palestinians 45% so the 55% that was going to go to Israel that land was to create a Jewish only state and then the 45% that was going to go to Palestine would be for Christians Jews and Muslims but the problem was is that the the land didn't belong to the Jewish population right because they bought 5 to 10% of the land so basically you're gifting somewhere between 45 and 50% of the land to this Zionist movement what about the Palestinians already living there so the Arabs rejected this the Israelis invaded they declare they declare their independence what it is is it's a colonial Enterprise they invade and Conquer Palestine there's a war the 1948 War and the you know the Egyptian army goes in with rifles that don't work they had tanks that were profoundly flawed like tanks that could only turn in One Direction or the turret didn't turn or the machine gun didn't work um they were mostly I don't know if they were mostly but a lot of them were stewards which were these little itty bitty tank cats uh the Israelis were better armed better equipped they had more combat experience there was a bunch of them there was a huge Invasion Force you know the jordanians made an attempt to stop this the syrians fought there were Iraqi units that showed up as volunteers nobody could stop the Israelis from creating the state by the time they were done the Israelis ended up with 78% of Palestine so the UN division of uh Palestine created three Israeli wedges one in the middle one in the north east and then one in the South and then it created four Palestinian wedges one that was about twice the size of the Gaza Strip where the Gaza Strip is like the remnant of it one that was probably about one and a third times the size of the West Bank where the West Bank is and then one in the Northwest um so you know like Bethlehem was supposed to be in the west bank and then uh hia was supposed to be Palestinian and by the time the Israelis were done they had Shrunk the West Bank they had dramatically Shrunk the Gaza Strip and they just took the remaining piece there were four pieces because yaffa was going to become a little Enclave in Palestine that was completely surrounded by Israel and the sea and then uh Jerusalem was going to be a neutral zone and it was going to be administered by the United Nations that was the plan and uh the Israelis of course broke the whole thing Old Jerusalem or west or east Jerusalem ended up in Jordan West Jerusalem ended up in Israel and uh the Israelis during the conquest committed some acts of terrorism so there's a place called darene where they do they conduct a massacre and the Hope was to cause panic in the Palestinian population to cause them to run away and they did a huge portion of the Palestinian population flees fearing that darasin was just the beginning of a series of massacres one of the catastrophic ironies of all of this is yod vashem the Holocaust Memorial is across the Valley from Dar so it's almost like there's there's the commemoration of a terrible cruel Injustice across the Valley from a terrible cruel Injustice instead of the world creating more Justice it heaped more suffering on a population of people that had nothing to do with the initial suffering" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="rabbi David Feldman thank you so much for sitting here with us today and we're filming this interview at a time where student activists across the US are being arrested for their pro Palestine activism with claims that they're being anti-semitic what's your take on all of this well accusing people who stand up for the oppressed people who say something when they see crimes taking place uh this is not this is not anti-semitic you know doing what's right and speaking up for the press is not anti-semitic in any way um when these people when these students it's not only the students it's so many other people are being attacked with the with this false accusation of anti-semitism uh this is disturbing because in in the time as you say in the time that we we see this genocide going on in Gaza so many people tens of thousands of people are being mass murdered innocent people uh this is something that us people in the free world should say something this is injust this is unjust for the people of Palestine that that this voice is attempted to be silenced but it's not only doing injustice for the Palestinian people this is doing injustice for the Jewish people as well because when you conflate Judaism and Zionism you conflate anti-Zionism with anti-semitism you're making a statement as if all Jews support all what's going on and as if all Jews are accountable to what's going on but we always need to know better than that and we try to educate people to understand that anti-ionism has nothing to do with anti-semitism because Judaism and Zionism are not the same judaism is a religion zionism is a political movement should never be conflated yes and New York is one of the hot spots shall we say of Judaism with over 2 million Jews living in this city and as you say some of them are anti-Zionist but meanwhile some of them are support the state of Israel and you know identify as Zionist and sometimes we see them confronting you because of your stance what's your take on them well f first of all as you say New York is a very good example uh yes there are a lot of Jewish people in New York many of them support Israel but there's a massive community who is anti-ionist and people might not know because the mainstream media would never show you that like for example there was a couple of years ago there was a huge mass uh anti-ionist rally a Jewish anti-ionist rally in front of the Israeli consulate on 2nd Avenue Manhattan and then CBS would announce that there is a traffic jam on Second Avenue and they would not say what the reason is in other words they purposely intentionally ignore what is going on so many people have no idea but there there is a massive uh religious Jewish anti-ionist community who are outspokenly uh against Israel um but but uh what's what what's important to understand is that these not not everyone comes out in each and every occasion as you say intimidation is massive uh pressure is enormous uh I I I always tell this story uh I had a very close friend of mine comes over to me once and and tells me I'll do everything I can to support you to support your activities but there's no way I can come out in person i run a huge business i come out in person they take a picture of me I close down the business the same day but uh but still the the anti-ionism is is is strong our communities are very strong and you can you can imagine if it wouldn't have been for those massive communities but that will be behind us we would not be able to be out there in these numbers and this uh so frequent and do so much yes you have huge numbers behind you but also we're seeing Zionist groups like Betar recently becoming more emboldened and seeking to confront you can you speak on the activities of Zionist groups such as Betar well Betar to begin with I'm not sure how large they are how strong they are uh they might be very uh uh wild they might be very uh aggressive uh we didn't see them in large numbers uh but yes they are very aggressive they're coming out uh in public intimidating harassing demonstrators happens to be peaceful demonstrators you know these these demonstrations taking place in New York City that that we all attend uh these are not dangerous demonstrations and uh these people will always claim that the pro Palestinian solidarity movement is dangerous uh and so on yeah and sometimes they approach you they tell you things like &quot;You should go to Gaza you won't be safe in Gaza.&quot; How do you respond to that oh that's that's that's a good point what they say is &quot;Yeah go visit Gaza.&quot; And they always they also say you know go to the Arabs they will kill you first and I always respond to that and usually these these arguments end up with nothing because they they they don't know what's going on whatsoever and and I try always to tell these people and people who who are willing to listen and some people are willing to listen and I tell them you know why are you so scared from these Palestinian people they don't hate you they don't want anything they just want their freedom we can live in peace with them we lived in peace with them before Zionism came they were always respectful for Jews and they still are but in the same time they are deeply upset and against the crimes being committed to Palestine which doesn't make these people anti-Semitic doesn't make these people dangerous for Jews while in the same time yes those people are vehemently opposing this uh occupation of Palestine now when when you find when you find people on the street uh protesting the genocide in Gaza this is not about protesting the Jewish people this is not about protesting the Jewish religion this is about crimes and they which which they are opposed to and we as Jewish people share their uh frustration and we share their pain of people who are disturbed when all of this is taking place what about what do you say to those who maybe agree with what you're saying but also say that um Jews Jewish people need a strong Israel to be safe this is this is one of the arguments that the the Zionists are using that uh Jewish people suffered in the Holocaust uh we were in we are in exile for the past 2,000 years it's about time for us to have a safe haven uh and most of the time this is being uh religion is being used into these conversations they are trying to use religion some concepts of the Jewish religion to justify this claim but what one needs to understand is basically two points first of all this is not Judaism according to Judaism we are forbidden to create this so-called safe haven for the Jewish people according to the very basics of Judaism there's a concept of Jewish exile which is a divine decree which we are forbidden to end by any physical means even if we find that this building is a safe haven would be in our favor according to our religion this is forbidden we accept the decree of God whether it is comfortable or it isn't we accept the word of God that we should not end this exile by any physical means and we leave this up to God for him to end our exile this is exactly what Judaism teaches us that it's only God god himself that will bring the ultimate redemption where all humanity together will serve the one God in peace and brotherhood zionism is forbidden safe haven is Zionism but I have to add this other point all of this would be true even if this would have been the safe haven for the Jewish people even if this would have been the favor of Jews um but it happens to be that the state of Israel is the greatest danger for the Jewish people while we lived in Palestine in peace it is the occupation of Palestine which has destroyed this peace and and in in addition we have to I have to add that coming back to the previous point even if this would have been in the favor of the Jewish people we should never oppress another people we should never harm another people because it might be in our interest certainly very interesting points you're making there philosophically and religiously very interesting arguments but uh Zionists often use religious arguments to justify the existence of Israel how do you respond to those claims and also uh Zionists equate Judaism together with Zionist Zionism and how what's your take on that zionists are conflating Judaism with Zionism because they need Judaism to support their movement of Zionism but what happens here is something very ironic and very hypocritical you have a movement of Zionism which is officially a secular movement it's not only secular because the founders of Zionism and the people to Zionists today are not only secular they basically many of them hate Judaism they hate God and his religion for example I have a friend of mine uh who grew up in Zionist education grew up in Jerusalem and he told me that what he was taught is that we the Jewish people have two enemies now guess who the two are in who the first is the first is the religious Jew and the second is the Arab now both of this is wrong the religious Jew is not is is is basically the Jew uh but this is how they hate religion the Jewish religion and they hate religious Jews and and and which which just shows you how far away they are from Judaism but that movement the movement of Zionism who is secular and who refuses to follow Judaism they misuse this very same religion they refuse to follow and they misuse it to justify crimes which are forbidden in this very same religion because killing and stealing oppressing an entire people all of this is forbidden in Judaism and as I said before the whole concept the idea of Zionism to build a sovereign homeland for Jews is in total contrast of Judaism now see seeing a secular movement misusing the religion doesn't make sense in the first place but what my response to those people is we can only explain and educate that while you are misusing the Jewish religion the Jewish religion in each and every way is in total contrast to this movement of Zionism and when we take a take a look at what's happening right now overall in the Middle East with President Trump taking office he ran as being a president for peace and he promised that he can bring peace not only to the Middle East but to Ukraine and many other regions how is your take on how his administration their policies have been so far and do you have hope for peace now I I I'm not a politician now i'm not sure exactly uh what can be done in each and every conflict around the world uh but when it comes to Zionism it comes to Palestine uh what we are presenting is we are presenting the view of Judaism of our religion and yes we do uh see the approach that our president of the United States has has taken uh we always say to politicians we appreciate when politicians or individuals extend the hand for the Jewish people we definitely appreciate but we try to educate and to explain that supporting Israel is not in favor of the Jewish people supporting Israel is is is doing so much harm to the suffering people of Palestine and so much harm for the Jewish people we do everything we can to explain to educate that Judaism is not Zionism and in this climate when some are afraid of speaking out as you said they're worried about losing their businesses how important is it for Jewish voices like yours to speak out for Palestine well it it is extremely important for us to speak up for many reasons first of all the people the oppressed people of Palestine deserve that people in the free world should speak up and without Jewish people coming out the rest of humanity is being intimidated of being anti-Semitic this is one of the reasons why it's so important for Jewish people to c to come out and to uh help people overcome this propaganda and and understand that this is a human uh cause this is a righteous cause this is a cause that uh needs to be addressed uh and we all share this uh this very important cause mhm and in addition to this this is so important because we have to break this stereotype people should should know that not all Jews take part in this no Jewish people who are right-minded people disagree with all of this the state of Israel does not represent us is certainly doesn't represent our religion if there is a group of people supporting these crimes you know that's that's their that's their own decision but this is not the voice of the entire Jewish people when you speak to Jewish people who are kind of on the fence they're not Zionists but maybe when they see you they see that there's an alternative path they can take can you speak to those conversations maybe not some who are set in their ways but some who you can actually change their perspective there there are many people especially since October 7th so many people are waking up so many people are seeing something new that they didn't realize until now you know until now everything was like okay but now they they are waking up to see that something is wrong and and these people are willing some of them are willing to listen in my experience the Zionist propaganda is so strong and so massive that even if you would find some people who are not supposed to be Zionist who people who in essence are not Zionists but the movement of Zionism has managed to confuse the masses the Jewish people are in danger it's those enemies of ours who seek to destroy us all and they want to drive us into the sea from the river to the sea people are so uh h um disturbed by this slogan from the river to the sea and I speak to people and I try to explain them what do you think is the second half of this slogan from the river to the sea kill all the Jews and people say yes people believe that from the river to the sea Palestine wants to see all Jews killed which is which is so ridiculously wrong it doesn't make any sense and I always explain to people Palestine doesn't want to see Jewish people dead they don't even want to see all Jews expelled from Palestine that's not what they are saying all they want is total freedom for their people and freed their land and we have we we spoke to so many uh political leaders of the Palestinian groups so many religious leaders so many individuals layman people nobody says otherwise but unfortunately people following Zionist propaganda are so misled to the point that they even lose their mind to be able to figure out what's in the best interest for themselves let's let let's put the oppressed people of Palestine aside which is something that everyone should think about but even for their own interest like they they are fighting for the Jewish people and by doing so they are endangering all Jews like by supporting what Israel is doing this is not in favor of the Jewish people but I'm pleased to see that people are listening and we we do this already for decades but especially since October 7th people are opening their minds and you know they see that they have to rethink what they were programmed until now and they slowly open their minds and can you give a bit of a more personal perspective your family ha uh escaped Europe back in the days they escaped genocide so being a sort of a survivor of genocide what kind of responsibility does that put on you on your shoulders to speak out when it's happening we always say it's because it's our communities who suffered in the Holocaust it's our families who suffered in the Holocaust that's a lesson for us that we should not want to see this happen to anyone when we are seeing what's happening in Gaza this reminds us of the stories that our elders told us just a couple of decades ago uh uh one a number of my teachers were Holocaust survivors uh and and you know they they they were telling stories terrible stories and unfortunately we we hearing similar stories now this is something that should the the the Jewish history and the Holocaust should be a lesson for Jewish people how to refuse this genocide taking place in Gaza so turning to the future of Jewish and Palestinian solidarity what do you need what do you think needs to happen in the US so that more Jewish people support the Palestinian cause like you do basically they need information they need education they need to uh realize not only that what's being done to Palestine is wrong but even more importantly they need to know that Palestine is not the enemy of the Jewish people and they never were uh there there's a massive propaganda that is ingrained in their minds from their very young age but this needs to be uh corrected mhm and once this will be corrected we can we can get quite uh we can proceed further and going forward some people are very unhopful for the future of Gaza what do you see happening now that the ceasefire has been broken again the Netanyahu government seems to be uh seems to want to keep pushing to exterminate the Palestinian people from the land what do you see happening i'm not sure exactly what's going to happen in Gaza i hope for the best but generally speaking with Palestine uh I I I I see I see a better future why because we see at least since October 7th even before people are waking up the general public is changing their views public opinion is shifting uh maybe we have to give credit to Netanyahu for waking up the people i always say uh it's so sad when we have to pay this terrible price for people to wake up so many people so many tens of thousands of people need to be murdered for people to finally wake up but this is what's happening but while they're waking up on one end but also on the other end here in the US there's a lot of crackdown against pro Palestine demonstrations as we mentioned earlier people are getting snatched of the street do you have any worries for you for your community because you're standing up for Palestine could something happen to you well it can happen it can happen but but to be to be clear here this is not showing uh that that it's not being successful on the other on the other way around we see this a success if there is no response to the pro Palestinian solidarity movement other than physically cracking them down then this is an achievement in other words there's no other uh reasonable response and how has this response been has there been threats against you against your community well we have threats from time to time we have physical attacks from time to time it's okay it's okay you know we we expect this to happen we expect that the other side is strong and aggressive uh but again this is encouraging because this is all they can respond with uh they have no logical or reasonable or religious argu proper religious argument to make so in the face of threats you're actually saying that this means that your activism is working because now people are getting worried and they're taking backlash against you but we're also seeing backlash to students such as the Turkish student who was recently arrested Romesa Mahmud Halil a student from Colombia who perhaps you demonstrated with very closely what's your message uh to these students out there who are maybe worried and who are looking for guidance on what to do in this time well all we can say is yes it's difficult yes it's challenging but in the same time we all of us know that what we are doing is right uh I cannot necessarily advise people exactly what to do what not to do that's the choice of the individuals uh in the face that we can face uh backlash but we are doing we are speaking up for humanity we are doing a righteous deed we please God by our acts and this is what needs to be done now who should be those doing it that's up to the individual and can you talk about a bit about your experiences when you went to Gaza or when you've been to other countries in the Middle East how were you received by the people there perhaps like you can explain it in a way for other Jewish people who've never been what would their experience be if they went this is a this is a very important question because our personal experience is shocking for general Jewish people we visited Gaza and this was after the beginning of the siege this was in 2009 uh Gaza is the most affected people from this conflict from this war and people were questioning before we went whether it's going to be safe because after all you know these people should uh be dangerous to people who harmed them but this wasn't the case they knew exactly who we are who we were they knew that we're not enemy they had no problem with us as Jewish people we visited we met Ism Khan who was the prime minister of Gaza at the time and uh he said to us privately in a meeting and then publicly in a press conference he said &quot;We have nothing against the Jewish people neither against the Jewish religion we are against the occupation.&quot; This makes simple sense i always take these stories back to our communities and I tell people Palestine is not dangerous to the Jewish people i visited Gaza i visited many other Muslim countries frequently I visit Muslim or Arab conventions and guess what i came home alive it's not dangerous at all people need to know this and people who only follow mainstream media or Zionist media generally speaking they don't have even a chance to interact with any Palestinian or Muslim to to have personal experience which is it's very unfortunate because their information is being built on fabricated propaganda versus facts on the ground" />
