getting in and out of fortified camps the ancient Romans used tunnels the Mongols used them Ivan the Terrible used tunnels to dig under the walls of the city of Kazan and bring it down so the tunnels under Gaza are not a new military challenge but they remain one of the world's most difficult it's actually difficult to believe that with all the modern technology and inventions that go into powering our 21st century War Machine something as ancient and simple as a tunnel could still pose such a big challenge to the world's most advanced armies in 2001 Osama Bin Laden outlasted a Relentless us bombing campaign by hulling up in the tunnels and caves of torab Bora even 15,000lb bombs and 100 air strikes in a day failed to break through let's look at the first world war armies on both sides were digging and counter digging Switzerland for example built an entire series of military fortresses under the Swiss Alps but the West also realized that regular soldiers could not fight at their best inside tunnels in 1914 the British army started getting in Miners and training them for military tasks Britain created special Bantam troops these were soldiers who were shorter and thinner than average in fact smaller size was one natural advantage that Asian armies had when they faced Western Invaders Invaders who were bigger in size strength and number tunnels became almost a symbol of resistance against a stronger enemy Japan used tunnels extensively to defend Pacific Islands against Allied invasion years later the Viet Kong fighting the US in Vietnam used tunnels to evade their enemies and launch surprise attacks and these were extremely effective attacks they cost the US heavily despite the fact that America had its own underground Warfare specialists in Vietnam they were known as the tunnel rats but the tunnel rats were up against a vast underground Network and an enemy that was agile inventive and determined the vietcong's network of tunnels was incredibly sophisticated they had armories hospitals mes hols manufacturing centers and storage facilities all underground and there were different varieties squads siiz tunnels which were generally less than 6 ft deep and 100 ft long there were company-sized tunnels which were WI rer but did not have too many compartments and then there were Battalion siiz tunnels which could be as deep as 50 ft underground and sometimes had up to four different levels many key connecting parts of these tunnels were as narrow as possible the walls were angled it was almost impossible for an American Soldier to fit through many of these tunnels and they were extensively booby trapped they were hard to spot from outside they had camouflaged airshafts disguised entrances almost imp pregnable even the B-52 bombs that the Americans dropped could not destroy many of the Vietcong tunnels and all of this 60 years ago so it's not difficult to imagine the level of sophistication that may exist in the tunnels beneath Gaza the tunnels under Gaza were built before Hamas had even formed and they were built by Smugglers who used them since the 1980s for smuggling goods under the the Egypt border most of the Earth in Gaza is rich in clay except near the coast which means that it's easy to dig through and does not need complex supports now over time the Palestinians realized that the tunnels could have a military use and they extended the underground Network Hamas expanded and utilized the tunnel system that they inherited with an eye to strategy and since they were operating beneath territory that they controlled they didn't have to worry about noise or vibrations alerting the enemy so the tunnels expanded quickly so much so that when Israel attacked Gaza in 2014 the IDF was stunned at the extent of the tunnels which was reported at the time to have surpassed 100 kilm Israel began setting up specialized units for underground Warfare fairly early starting with the combat engineers known as yaham set up in the '90s this unit was almost doubled in size after the 2 14 Gaza W that's when Israel really came face to face with the complex challenge of the modern Hamas tunnels now Israel has a commander unit called samur or the weasels they tunnel Warfare Specialists trained in undercover assault techniques leading the IDF when they enter the Gaza tunnels now the first thing to crack for Israel are the entrances to the tunnels these could be in the tens of thousands in Gaza most of them are hidden they're inside homes garage es shops warehouses under rubbish dumps and now probably under heaps of rubble now what Israel has been doing is using drones for 24/7 surveillance they're using Advanced software to analyze movement patterns and they're also using human intelligence from informers on the ground to build up a map of these crucial entrances they don't know it all but they're hoping that they know enough most of the Gaza tunnels have several entrances at each end so that if even some are discovered and blocked others will stay usable underground the tunnels are all interconnected so that even if one entire section is blocked off that may not make a big impact it's this interconnected underground web that Israel needs to map underground where GPS doesn't work satellite signals cannot reach Israel will have to fall back on magnetic sensors and INE movement trackers plus they can't use lights because that would give away their presence so night vision goggles are crucial and the US has been shipping hundreds of these to Israel preparing for just this battle underground in the darkness Israel's underground units won't have radio communication with the surface so again they may have to rely on Old School methods like field telones that's technology from over a 100 years ago Israel soldiers will have to stop at every Junction of the tunnel to map their positions secure the area and leave some troops to defend against counterattacks every time they find a shaft they'll need to figure out if the area above is controlled by Hamas or has been taken by Israel because an attack could come from above at any moment now imagine repeating this 50 times 100 times yes Israel has drones and robots but their movement is limited and signals underground may not be effective and then there will be the obstacles underground booby traps IEDs smoke bombs to suffocate Intruders may be triggered by motion sensors or light sensors Hamas has had years to set up hidden cameras underground detection devices to alert them of intruders and wires and cables that may trigger explosions if they're cut this means the entire section of the tunnel could collapse with one wrong move trapping Israel's forces it's not only Hamas who may use toxic gases underground Israel might also use chemical agents such as tear gas then there's the option of using water to flood the tunnels it's been used in the past Egypt for example poured sewage water into the smuggers tunnels going into Gaza from its side of the Border but this is such a huge tunnel complex that some experts have said there's simply not enough water in Gaza there's been a lot of Buzz about Israel's sponge bomb a device that creates rapidly expanding foam when triggered which hardens to form a kind of plug that will block a tunnel but the chemicals in this sponge bomb are dangerous ones and there have been reports of Israeli soldiers blinded after mishandling the bomb the simplest solution to many people may simp simply seem to be blowing up the tunnels but such a massive engineering feat during an active war is next to Impossible the whole of Gaza May quite simply [Music] collapse first there's the question of size there's no room underground to maneuver machine guns and rifles then there's the darkness The Flash after firing an ordinary pistol will leave Israeli troops temporarily blind especially especially if they're using night vision goggles then there's a question of space standing in a tunnel only one person can fire at a time at most two if one person kneels and the other person stands you're likely to be so close to the enemy that using something like a grenade could harm your own side as well the most likely option for the Israelis will be the smaller caliber weapons with sound suppressors that will prevent muzzle flashes again they'll be falling back on age-old weapons like knives tried and tested over Generations in hand-to-hand combat in this Arena every step could mean death" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="- This was the Gaza Strip, a 25 mile stretch along the Mediterranean coast, home to just over 2 million people. Today, the once bustling streets and high-rise buildings have been reduced to rubble. But underneath the wreckage lies a vast, sophisticated web of tunnels longer than London's underground. This extensive network is a key weapon in Hamas' arsenal, from which they smuggle weapons and people for their w*r against Israel. The tunnels began as a lifeline for families divided by impermeable borders. When Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in 2007, they poured billions of dollars into this underground infrastructure, waiting for the day their enemy would meet them in this airless, subterranean battlefield. How did Gaza's tunnels go from a primitive supply network to the world's largest underground w*r zone? (gentle instrumental music) Our story starts in Rafah, a city in the south of Gaza with a tumultuous history. In a matter of decades, it changed hands four times, from the Ottomans, to the British, to the Egyptians, to the Israelis. In 1979, things changed once again when Israel and Egypt signed a peace agreement. As part of the deal, Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula. The new border between Israel and Egypt split Rafah in half. One part returned to Egypt, the other remained under Israeli control. And in the middle, a massive, impenetrable wall. - Right now, we are standing in the urban area of the town of Rafah. The immediate problem that the line, as you see it over there, should run across the city, and cut the town into two parts between Israel and Egypt. - Suddenly, neighbors who had grown up side by side lived in different countries. Families separated, unable to visit one another. But Gaza's people weren't about to let a wall keep them from their loved ones. Armed with shovels and determination, they dug the first tunnels beneath Gaza. Simple passageways carved out of sandy soil, connecting homes on either side of the border. These early tunnels were modest and easy to build with openings hidden in basements. On one side, a family in Gaza, on the other, a family in Egypt. In between, a secret passageway that allowed them to visit. For a brief moment, the tunnel stood as a testament to the enduring power of human connection. But it didn't take long for bad actors to exploit the system. With the wall cutting off access to Egypt, Gaza faced severe shortages of everyday essentials. Seizing the moment, enterprising smugglers turn the tunnels into underground trade routes, moving car parts, gasoline, and cigarettes into Gaza, all with a hefty markup, of course. When supply is low and demand is high, profits soar. And while the smugglers were cashing in, they were also filling a critical gap, helping your neighbors get the supplies they so desperately needed. For many Gazans, these tunnels became a lifeline. One Palestinian poetically called them, &quot;The lungs through which Gaza breathed&quot;, the only escape from the suffocating blockades that Egypt and Israel imposed. Egypt and Israel were well aware of the tunnels, but for a long time, the two countries just looked away. They weren't going to interfere with the smuggling of cigarettes or with the family reunions that the tunnels enabled. Everyone, from the people of Rafah to the governments on either side of its wall, understood that this underground network kept Gaza's economy and morale afloat. But everything changed with the First Intifada. In 1987, tensions between Israelis and Palestinians reached a boiling point. Palestinians, frustrated by decades under Israeli control, began protesting. But the grassroots movement escalated quickly. Protests turned to riots, screams turned to stone throwing, Palestinians took up arms, and the clashes between the IDF and the Palestinian crowds soon turned deadly. Gaza was tightly controlled by its neighbors in Israel and Egypt, and still weapons kept appearing in the streets as if by magic. The tunnels had become a pipeline for the w*r against Israel. Israeli authorities tried to destroy the tunnels where they could, but the network grew increasingly sophisticated, and no one in Gaza was going to give up their lifeline to the other side. In 1993, Israel signed a peace deal with the Palestinian Liberation Organization, creating a semi-autonomous Palestinian government for the first time. The Jewish state asked the newly created Palestinian authority for help in locating and destroying the tunnels, an opportunity for the PA to demonstrate its commitment to peace by cracking down on weapon smuggling. But the PA failed miserably. Through a toxic combination of incompetence, corruption, and complicity, the PA left the tunnels intact, and for the next decade, the tunnel network only expanded, snaking underneath more and more of Gaza. By the time the Second Intifada broke out in 2000, the tunnels had become a critical component of Gaza's underground w*r machine. Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Fatah smuggled weapons at unprecedented rates. Underneath the ground, weapons makers assembled the bombs that would detonate Israeli cafes, and buses, and streets, claiming more than 1000 Israeli lives. Israel cracked down hard, determined to stop the terror. And at the end of the Second Intifada, more than 5,000 people were dead. The military launched operations in Gaza to stem the flow of weapons. Demolishing buildings suspected of concealing tunnel entrances, but these efforts often meant displacing civilians and destroying homes, drawing harsh international condemnation. Despite these efforts, the tunnel network endured, smugglers kept profiting, terror groups kept building weapons. The problem seemed insurmountable, so Israel tried a different approach. In 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in the hopes that granting Gazans self rule would finally reduce tensions, - But the move backfired, spectacularly. Without Israeli forces on the ground, Hamas and other groups expanded their tunnel operations unchecked. What had once been a covert network grew into an underground empire, a sprawling web of tunnels beneath Gaza streets, the most important weapon in the fight against Israel. And that fight was now Gaza's first priority, because in 2006, Gazans voted for Hamas to lead them. - Now to be clear, these people weren't all terror supporters. In fact, exit polls showed that a shocking 40% of Hamas voters supported the peace process, and over 1/3 thought that the best path forward was the Two State solution. They saw Hamas as an antidote to the spectacular corruption of the Palestinian Authority. But Hamas and its rival party, Fatah, were unable to share power. Their attempts at a unity government ended in a civil w*r. By 2007, there was only one ruler in Gaza, Hamas, and they had one goal, targeting Israel. - So they poured their considerable resources into expanding the tunnel network. Billions of dollars earmarked for aid went instead to building a fully equipped w*r machine, with tunnels carved from solid rock more than 20 stories underground. For many Gazans, the tunnels still served a practical purpose, alongside weapons, they continued to deliver essential goods like food and medicine. But Israel and Egypt had imposed blockades to curb the flow of weapons and weapons making materials, and the blockades meant the demand for smuggled goods skyrocketed. Smuggling was lucrative, particularly for those who controlled the operation. Known as snakeheads, these individuals invested heavily to build the tunnels and then rented them out to groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. In return, they earned a cut of every shipment. The prophets were staggering. By 2010, snakeheads could rake in up to $200,000 a day. It was a fortune in a region plagued by poverty. But for the ones doing the digging, the story was starkly different. Thousands of Gazans had once worked in Israel, an economic lifeline for a region plagued by poverty and unemployment. But that lifeline soon dried up. Hamas had refused to give up on its goal of eliminating Israel, launching more and more attacks on Israeli cities. And so Israel rescinded the work permits that had allowed Gazan men to feed their families. Without other options, Gazans turn to the backbreaking, dangerous work of digging tunnels. But the burden often fell on children who were small and nimble enough to chisel away at the tight crevices in the bedrock, dozens of feet under the ground. A veritable army of kids risked their lives every day just to bring home a few dollars. - For many children in Gaza, digging tunnels has been a grim rite of passage. But the work was deadly. Cave-ins, electrocution, and exposure to toxic gases were constant threats. - By Hamas' own admission, at least 160 people had died digging tunnels by 2010. Yet the practice continued. Perhaps the most heartbreaking part is that these children understood the dangers before they ever picked up a shovel. - But with no other options, the risk wasn't enough to stop them. For many, it was their only chance to put food on the table. - The tunnels offer a devastating glimpse into Gaza's increasing desperation. For many, they provided essential income and supplies. But for Israel, the tunnels represented an existential threat. Eliminating them became a national security imperative. The Israeli government wasn't interested in cracking down on the smuggling of food, cigarettes, and other goods. It mostly cared about the terrifying prospect of the tunnels being used to launch attacks within Israeli borders. This wasn't just paranoia. - In 2006, Hamas fighters emerged from an underground tunnel and kidnapped an Israeli soldier named Gilad Shalit. For five years, they held him in a two-room complex lined with explosives, 50 feet underground. So the Israelis built a 20-foot high, 10-foot deep border wall equipped with sonar sensors to detect underground activity. But Hamas adapted, digging tunnels deeper, sometimes hundreds of feet below the surface, rendering the wall ineffective. In 2014, the IDF destroyed over 30 tunnels in a major military campaign. And on the other side of Gaza's border, Egypt flooded the tunnels with seawater from the Mediterranean. But the problem persisted. For every tunnel Egypt and Israel destroyed, Hamas just built more, deeper, stronger, and more sophisticated. Israeli engineers developed high tech detection systems and implemented a systematic process for locating and destroying tunnels. Dubbed the Steel Dome, this initiative aimed to neutralize the underground threat. In 2021, Israel announced significant progress, claiming to have destroyed 62 miles of tunnels. But Hamas was quick to counter, asserting that much of the 350 mile network remained intact. - These are no longer the narrow, rudimentary tunnels of the 1980s. Today's tunnels are fortified with concrete and steel rebar, designed to last. Some even resemble luxury living spaces, complete with toweled floors, air conditioning, plumbing, and ventilation systems, and they've grown in scale. Some wealthier Gazans have even used them to smuggle in luxury cars. This vast underground network is more than a military asset. It's an entire infrastructure hidden beneath Gaza's surface. Building hundreds of miles of deep, fortified, and well-equipped tunnels doesn't come cheap. Estimates suggest that constructing Gaza's underground cost nearly $1 billion. That's an extraordinary sum, especially in a region devastated by poverty. So where did the money come from? Much of it was stolen from the very people Hamas claims to represent. Israel approved construction materials to enter Gaza for civilian projects, like rebuilding homes, roads, and schools. But instead of improving life on the surface, Hamas diverted these materials underground, redirecting them to expand their network of terror tunnels. The cost to Gaza civilians was staggering. Homes crumbled, schools and hospitals were left unfinished. Communities in desperate need of support saw their resources vanish into the ground, literally. When Israel discovered this blatant misuse of resources, they stopped sending construction materials, a logical step to protect their own security. Unfortunately, this also made life harder for ordinary Gazans who were caught between Hamas' ambitions and the resulting restrictions. - Gazans lacked basic supplies. But they did have a sprawling, fully operational underground military base, complete with communication systems, storage facilities for weapons, training areas, and even weapons manufacturing sites. Hamas can move personnel, vehicles, and arms anywhere in Gaza without exposing themselves above ground. For over a year, they've been waging w*r from below the surface. But the most critical and dangerous function of the tunnels is their ability to shield Hamas from Israeli surveillance and airstrikes. The subterranean tunnel network presents a serious challenge to the Israeli Air Force. Many tunnels are buried so deep that surface attacks have no impact. The sandy soil, which made the tunnels easy to dig in the first place, now absorbs much of the force from the strikes. And then there's the simple but crucial advantage of concealment. No satellite, drone, or advanced technology can detect targets hidden beneath layers of earth. This isn't a side benefit of the tunnel system, it's a core feature. Hamas values the tunnels because they give them the ability to operate in complete secrecy, outmaneuvering even the most advanced military technology. - Meanwhile, Hamas officials refuse to let ordinary Gazans shelter inside, leaving them exposed to Israeli airstrikes. Hamas leaders shelter beneath schools, hospitals, and homes, turning Gazan civilians into human shields. The international community is quick to blame Israel when civilians are caught in the crossfire. - Gross violations of the human rights of civilians. - We believe that w*r cr!mes are being committed there. - But they conveniently omit the fact that Hamas intentionally places its terror infrastructure directly beneath civilian populations for this very reason. Hamas has been explicit about its willingness to sacrifice civilians. - So Israel is left with only bad choices. Should they sacrifice young soldiers to the booby traps inside tunnels and homes, or should they target Hamas' infrastructure with drones and bunker busters, knowing that civilians and Israeli hostages might be inside? When Israel has chosen the latter, it has been at a very high price for civilians. When Israel has chosen the former, it has been at a very high price for its soldiers. Meanwhile, Hamas exploits its remaining tunnels to move undetected and ambush IDF soldiers. This has dragged the conflict into a prolonged w*r, and that's part of Hamas' strategy. By forcing Israel into a drawn out conflict in a civilian heavy area, Hamas is betting on fierce international backlash. So far, it's working. Israeli citizens are fiercely critical of their government. While the rest of the world claims Israeli tactics are tantamount to genoc!de. - Madam Speaker, we are witnessing the Israeli government carry out a genoc!de in Gaza. - This w*r is unlike any of the world has ever seen before, but Israeli military is clear in its purpose. It's not waging a w*r against Palestinian civilians, it's not waging a w*r against Gaza, it's fighting Hamas, an internationally recognized terror organization that for years has treated its own people as cash cows and human shields. For everyone's sake, they must be defeated. Only then can the people of Gaza live the safe, dignified, prosperous life they deserve." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="- The Mossad has executed some of the most audacious spy missions on earth, going deep undercover into hostile territory, catching terror masterminds who seem untouchable and duping militant groups into buying rigged electronics through a ruse so elaborate no one suspects a thing until they explode without warning. The Mossad waits until terrorists feel safe, and then it reminds them that they aren't. - We are a global production company. We write the screenplay. We're the directors, we're the producers. We're the main actors. The world is our stage. - So how has the Mossad managed to take down some of its most elusive targets? Successful spies are masters of tradecraft. Strategies that help them gather intel without getting caught. It can take months or even years. But a good spy is patient. A good spy can wait over a decade for the payoff, and then when the target least expects it, the Mossad sends a little message. We're watching. We're waiting. There is no escape. No one is out of reach. Not even a ghost. Even when he was alive, Imad Mughniyeh was a ghost. And not the friendly kind. He'd always been extreme. As a teenager in Beirut, he controlled a savage gang that prowled the streets enforcing Islamic law, mostly by beating up drug suppliers and female escorts. But he had bigger ambitions. By the time he turned 21, he was second-in-command of a new shadowy terror organization, Hezbollah. Within months of assuming the position, he masterminded two blasts that claimed hundreds of lives. - 191 Marines dead in the explosion at their headquarters at the Beirut Airport. - He oversaw some of the most barbaric abductions the West had ever seen. And his reach extended well beyond his home turf. Mughniyeh ruthlessly targeted Israelis and Jews around the world. Israel had to eliminate him. But Mughniyeh was crafty, really crafty. All Israel had to identify him was one washed out photo. For over 20 years, no spy agency could catch him, not even the Mossad, which employed some creative strategies to lure him out of hiding like assassinating his brother, another Hezbollah operative. Mossad waited for Mughniyeh at the funeral. But Mughniyeh was too crafty to show up. His brother was buried without him, and the Mossad seemed to be out of luck. He was a ghost, a puff of smoke that no one could pin down. Until Hezbollah made a mistake. In 2004, Israel took out Ghaleb Awali, a senior Hezbollah commander. In a touching show of sentimentality, Hezbollah's propaganda department memorialized him in a short film. Bad move. Because the Mossad got their hands on the video, analyzing every frame for new information. They didn't expect to spot a ghost on camera, but there he was, standing next to Hezbollah's leader, Imad Mughniyeh in the flesh. It was the first sighting of Mughniyeh in decades. Now, Israel knew what he looked like, and they knew that if he was near Nasrallah he was probably somewhere in Lebanon. Where? And how would they get to him? As they pondered ways to reach Mughniyeh, Mossad pulled off a huge win. They hacked into the Iranian government system, which kept files on its allies and proxies, including Mughniyeh. And that's how the Mossad found out he'd been living in Damascus under an assumed name since 2006. It was the breakthrough they'd been waiting for. It was also a problem because Syria was a target country, an enemy state where undercover operations are especially dangerous. Organizing an assassination attempt would require lots of reconnaissance trips into Syria. But Syrian security was vigilant and sophisticated, and everyone knew what they do to a captured Israeli spy. It was too risky for Israeli agents to make the trips into Damascus. So the Mossad did something highly unusual. They ask the Americans for help. But the CIA has a strict policy of not picking fights with neutral countries. And at the time, Syria and the US had diplomatic relations. They couldn't just carry out an assassination on Syrian soil willy-nilly, or could they? Turns out they could. The US had their own reasons for wanting Mughniyeh gone, including the fact that he'd been sending men into Iraq to carry out strikes against American troops. So the CIA agreed to help under two conditions. One, the Israelis could target Mughniyeh and only Mughniyeh. That meant that if anyone else was in the vicinity, the whole operation was off. And two, US agents would help find Mughniyeh, but the Mossad would be the ones to take him out. The Israelis agreed. It was time for an exorcism. As American agents tailed Mughniyeh, they found the pious family man had a weakness. Syrian security services had supplied him with three women to be his special friends. He would drive to see them on his own, a surprising lapse in security for someone who was otherwise totally obsessed with staying out of danger. Because Mughniyeh was no dummy he knew he was a target, and he and his bodyguards were careful to check often for detonators inside and under his car, but they didn't think to check the case holding the spare tire in the back of a slick silver SUV. Bingo. This was it. If the Mossad could get some kind of blast material into the tire cover, Mughniyeh was going down. For months, Mughniyeh had a constant tail, watching and waiting for the right moment when his car was unattended. One night, while Mughniyeh was getting cozy with one of his lady friends, Mossad agents swooped in. They exchanged his tire cover for a new one, which had a special device that would eliminate Mughniyeh without causing any other casualties. The weapon was ready. Now they just needed everything else to fall into place. For weeks, Mossad operatives waited on edge. They almost detonated the charge 32 times, stopping at the last minute when Mughniyeh got into his car too quickly or when he got too close to another person. They didn't forget their agreement with the CIA. The target was Mughniyeh and only Mughniyeh. The 33rd time was the charm. On chilly February evening, Mughniyeh left the meeting with Syrian intelligence and other Hezbollah officers alone. This was it. As they drew closer to his car, the agents detonated. Mughniyeh was finally gone. After 30 years, they'd gotten the ghost. This wasn't Israel's first time executing a daring mission in enemy territory. They'd done it before and they would do it again, but the results would bring some unanticipated scrutiny. Dubai is the so-called playground of the rich in the Middle East. It's home to some eye-wateringly tall skyscrapers, improbable indoor ski hills, and the pristine turquoise waters of the Persian Gulf. It's also where some of Earth's most notorious militants conduct their business. Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh was one of these militants. Israel had wanted him for two decades, ever since the '80s when he and an accomplice had kidnapped and murdered two Israeli soldiers. Mahmoud was cold as ice. He admitted that his only regret was that he hadn't shot the gun himself. 20 years later, Mahmoud was coordinating weapon shipments for Hamas, running the network that moved Iranian weapons into the Gaza Strip, weapons that Hamas used to attack Israelis. It was time to get rid of him. The question was where and how? Mahmoud spent a lot of his time in countries like Syria, China, Iran, and Sudan. Not exactly Israel's buddies, but Mahmoud was a frequent flyer to another destination, Dubai. In 2009, the Emirati government was none too friendly to Israel. Dubai was risky, but it was the best of bad options. Tons of foreigners passed through the Emirate, which meant Mossad operatives could easily pose as tourists. And Dubai security wasn't as sophisticated as Iran's or Syria's. The Israelis figured that no investigation would get very far. Mistake number one. In 2009, Mossad deployed a hit squad to spy on Mahmoud and learn his habits. They entered the UAE undercover using false identities and foreign passports, passports that in some cases belonged to real people who had no idea that the Mossad had borrowed their documents. A few months later, they broke out those same foreign passports and returned to Dubai, this time to eliminate Mahmoud by poison. The mission was a failure. All the poison ended up doing was making Mahmoud feel a little unwell. The good news was that he never realized it was the Israelis that were the source of his illness. The bad news was that he was still at large and the Mossad was determined that the next time they tried to eliminate him, nothing could go wrong. So in January 2010, Israel's hit squad landed in Dubai for the third time, using the same foreign names and passports as before. Mistake number two. The hit squad wasn't sure where Mahmoud would stay, so they broke into small teams and checked into different hotels. Some paid in cash, but other agents paid with debit cards issued by one specific company, a company that was run by an Israeli. Mistake number three. Because the team was scattered around the city, they had to communicate with each other in real-time, so they used cell phones. But cell phones are very easy to track. So they didn't call each other directly, instead, the agents called a central switchboard in Austria, which connected them automatically to each other. Mistake number four. Any well-trained spy knows the part of successful tradecraft is switching up their look, new wigs, different hats, glasses, and even a costume or two. The hit squad had this technique down pat. They came prepared with disguises. Some posed as tennis players. One guy even entered a bathroom bald as a cue ball and left it with the head of luxurious hair. But even if they could evade the attention of other people, there were silent eyes watching them all the time. Dubai's hotels were absolutely chock-full of security cameras. Cameras that saw and recorded everything. Mistake number five. Just six hours after Mahmoud landed in Dubai, the hit squad broke into his hotel room. It took 20 minutes to accomplish the mission. After locking the room from the inside, the hit squad hightailed it outta the hotel and onto the flights. Mahmoud lay in bed after what looked like a heart attack. At first, the hotel security officers who found him thought they had just stumbled on a random tourist who had the misfortune to croak on vacation. The authorities didn't know it was Hamas' weapons guy. They only knew Mahmoud under the false name he traveled under. His body went to the morgue, and nobody thought about it again. Until Hamas started to get suspicious. You don't just ignore Hamas when they call. So when Mahmoud stopped picking up his phone, they knew something was off. One of their agents searched police stations and morgues until he found Mahmoud. And now the Dubai authorities were in for a nasty surprise. That random tourist not actually a tourist. That heart attack wasn't a heart attack at all, but the work of the Mossad. Dubai Security Services were furious at Hamas for using Dubai as a base for illegal activity, and at the Mossad, which had just assassinated someone in their city. They scoured airline passenger lists, looking for anyone who had traveled to Dubai around the same time as Mahmoud. A series of foreign names kept appearing and reappearing. Authorities crosschecked these names against hotel guest lists. And those silent eyes, Dubai's huge network of security cameras, gave them another piece of the puzzle. The faces of the agents. With the names of the agents in hand, investigators looked at data, a lot of data. Data like debit cards that were traced back to a company headed by an Israeli, phone calls that were all mysteriously routed to the same switchboard in Austria. Information that made it glaringly obvious that a group of people seemingly scattered around Dubai had actually acted in unison. Dubai's lead investigator was able to cobble together all the security footage to retrace the footsteps of the hit squad, almost to the minute. This grainy, silent movie wasn't gonna win any Oscars, but the evidence was irrefutable. Dubai wasn't the only angry government. Had the Mossad used real passports or had forged them? To the countries involved, it didn't really matter. They felt manipulated. And Israel couldn't afford to alienate their allies. The diplomatic fallout from this episode was intense. - France condemns this assassination. Murder is no way to carry out international relations. - The Dubai passports incidents also constitutes a clear and direct breach of confidential undertakings between Australia and Israel dating back some years. - On paper, the mission was a success. They'd eliminated Mahmoud temporarily interrupting Hamas' flow of weapons, but the operation was a bust. The Mossad had burned a number of agents and exposed its tradecraft secrets, which weren't even that sophisticated to begin with. It was a mortifying episode, but a useful one, because Israel learned a lot about what not to do. And though it took over a decade, they eventually put those lessons to good use. Remember this video from June 2024? I'm not a betting guy, but I'm willing to put money on the fact that over the next few years, Israeli secret agents are going to go on some pretty wild missions. After all, the Israeli government has vowed to take down every single person who planned the attack of October 7th. Turns out that was a pretty safe bet. Here's the story of how a broken air conditioner almost foiled Israel's operation to get rid of a top October 7th Mastermind. Ismail Haniyeh had been involved with Hamas since he graduated from university. By the time the terror group wrested control of the Gaza Strip in a bloody coup, he was in charge. For a decade, he ruled Hamas with an iron fist. But by 2017, he traded the Gaza Strip for Qatar, one of the richest countries in the Middle East. As millions of Gazans struggled to put food on the table, Haniyeh lived in the lap of luxury with a net worth of $4 billion. What a leader, right? As for why Haniyeh was enjoying the good life in Qatar, well, it's complicated. Qatar has hosted Hamas' leadership since 2012 at the request of the United States, which wanted an easier way to talk to the terror group. Israel agreed to respect this arrangement. That meant attacking any Hamas operatives on Qatari soil was absolutely out of the question. And Israel was not about to repeat the Dubai debacle and risk alienating its most important ally, the United States. If they were going to get Haniyeh, they'd have to wait for him to leave Qatar. Problem was, Haniyeh spent most of his time in Turkey, Russia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, highly dangerous countries for Israeli operatives. And when he was visiting Iran, Haniyeh wasn't exactly couch surfing. He stayed in one of Tehran's most heavily guarded hotels, the guest house of the Islamic Republic's notorious military, the IRGC. The IRGC is powerful, dangerous and sophisticated. But even they weren't immune to Israel's tradecraft. In May 2024, an unexpected event sparked one of the Mossad's most ambitious assassinations. On a cool spring day, Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi's helicopter unexpectedly crashed into a remote mountainside. No one in Israel or most of Iran was shedding any tears over Raisi. He was a monster, responsible for executing several thousand political prisoners in Iran. But right away, Israel realized they had a golden opportunity. The helicopter crash meant Iran would hold the state funeral, and shortly thereafter, the inauguration of a new president. And as a key figure in Iran's terror proxy network, Ismail Haniyeh would undoubtedly attend both events, which left Israel with just weeks to plan the assassination that would finally take Haniyeh out. Someone working for the Israeli smuggled the device into the IRGC guest house carefully positioned in Haniyeh's room. Some news reports say the device was placed soon after Raisi's crash, while others claim it was placed a couple months later, just moments before the detonation. We still don't know who or how or when, but we do know this, as the inauguration festivities wound down and Haniyeh made his way back to his room, a team of agents was waiting on tender hooks for go time. And then, the AC broke down? July in the Middle East is hot. Even the bad guys need to stay cool. So when Haniyeh left to get his air conditioning fixed, the team feared he was switching rooms. A twist of fate which would have led to a very different ending to this. But after a while, Haniyeh came back, but he didn't have long to enjoy the room because in the early hours of July 31st, 2024, a boom shook the IRGC guest house. And the man who had mastermind of the 10/7 attacks, the man responsible for tens of thousands of de*ths was finally gone. But the w*r was far from over. Since that horrific day in October, Israel had been fighting on multiple fronts. At first, they focused on Hamas, but as Hezbollah rockets reigned down on Israel's northern communities driving 60,000 Israelis from their homes, it was clear that the situation couldn't continue. It was time to take down Hezbollah. Back in 2014, Taylor Swift had just dropped her hit single, Shake It Off. Russia was hosting the Winter Olympics. And Israel, usually known for its high tech, was in the business of making clunky walkie-talkies for a very special customer. That customer was Hezbollah who were in the market for walkie-talkies for their fighters. They're the perfect method of communication on a battlefield, instant and secure. So Israel seized on the opportunity. Their plan was simple. Copy a popular Japanese design Hezbollah liked, replace some of the battery components with tiny blast devices, and convince Hezbollah to buy them. Easy-peasy. Using a complex network of shell companies, Israel sold 16,000 walkie-talkies to Hezbollah operatives. And then, for 10 years, they sat back and waited. Like KGB sleeper spies from the Cold War, the walkie-talkie seemed innocent. In reality, there were deadly weapons ready to activate at a moment's notice. Fast forward a few years, a female Mossad agent had a bright idea. Why not do the same with pagers? Rig some unassuming looking pagers, and voila, you have a handheld, remote controlled, exploding device. Pagers are the dinosaurs of communication devices. For the most part, they're a museum piece. - That belongs in a museum! - But for a terror group like Hezbollah, pagers had a lot of appeal. Pagers don't have much function other than receiving a message. But their limited utility also means that they can't be electronically hacked, perfect for a group that doesn't wanna be tracked. Initially, the Mossad said, nah, not enough people in Hezbollah were using pagers to warrant the effort it would take to make and distribute them. But over time, Hezbollah's higher ups were getting antsy about using cell phones, which could be hacked and tracked. It was too big a risk. So Israel jumped. They even got a team to flood Arab social media with fake news. about Israel's amazing ability to hack cell phones, trying to fool Hezbollah into looking for more secure alternatives like pagers. The Mossad knew that Hezbollah would be suspicious of new technology companies trying to sell them products. So Israel had to work within their existing supplier system. But the suppliers couldn't know either. Everything had to seem above board, which meant Mossad had to go deep. Hezbollah got its devices from a Taiwanese technology company. So Israel set up a shell company based in Budapest, which bought a licensing agreement from Gold Apollo to manufacture a new line of beepers. This new product line was bigger, more rugged and more durable, and it came with a little surprise embedded in the battery. - What a surprise. - Israeli engineers spent months testing and tweaking the pagers, which were designed to maim rather than kill. The blast radius was tiny. Only the person carrying the beeper would be injured. It was the most targeted attack the world had ever seen. The Mossad left nothing to chance. They tested which ringtones would be most compelling and how long it would take for someone to check their beeper after being paged. To convince Hezbollah that the pagers were a worthwhile investment, Israel tapped again into the power of social media, creating slick ads that played on YouTube. Even legitimate customers were interested, but the Israelis dissuaded them by quoting absurdly high prices. Of course, these customers had no idea they were really talking to the Mossad. Meanwhile, the sales team made Hezbollah an offer they couldn't refuse. The first batch of beepers were free, and they'd offer a discount if they bought in bulk. Hezbollah fell for it, hook, line, and sinker. By the fall of 2023, they'd handed out thousands of pagers to their operatives, but Israel was on borrowed time. One of Hezbollah's top technicians was starting to get suspicious that the walkie-talkies Hezbollah had bought 10 years earlier might actually be incendiary devices. He was asking one too many questions. So Israel shut him down permanently with an airstrike. And mid-September 2024, the now or never moment came. Israel's military intelligence learned that Hezbollah had asked Iran to examine the pagers, worried they might contain explosives. It was time to act. Five days later, in the middle of the afternoon, an encrypted message went out to the rigged pagers triggering the hidden detonators. Seconds later, a wave of explosions sounded all across Lebanon. The country was in shock, but Israel wasn't done yet. A few days later, they activated the walkie-talkies. 10 years of waiting were over. Hundreds of Hezbollah's fighters were taken out of action. Their communications network was shattered. And in one of the biggest blows to the terror organization, Israel capitalized on Hezbollah's weakness to finally assassinate its elusive leader, Hassan Nasrallah. It was the stuff of spy thrillers. So unlikely, it seems impossible. But that's the Mossad's MO, they have to remain adaptable, they have to think outside the box, they have to strike when they're least expected. Not every mission succeeds, but when they do, they remind Israel's enemies that Jews fight back, and that the Mossad is always watching, working overtime to protect their tiny nation." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="the talk of a ceasefire in Gaza is it real or just political theater if it's the latter why do news organizations keep falling for it we get the Hamas perspective on the negotiations the pitfalls and the patterns ukraine Russia drone strikes on both sides of the border and peace talks there that have gone nowhere plus the logging off club young people checking out of social media for their own good it is a recurring pattern in the ceasefire negotiations the ones aimed at ending the carnage Israel continues to inflict on Palestinians in Gaza proposals surface hopes rise then the talks collapse and the responsibility for that along with the eyes of international news outlets all land in the same place on Hamas israel agreed Hamas rejected it is a framing that is so familiar it rarely gets questioned but behind that characterization lies a deeper imbalance and it goes beyond military power it's about the narrative one that casts the Palestinian side as irrational obstructive inherently violent while somehow portraying Israel even at its most brutal its most genocidal as credible reporting the story that way has a suffocating effect on what news consumers are looking for the truth and it happens over and over again international news organizations should have it figured out by now but it's not as though they're being played by Israeli propaganda it's more like they're playing along when ceasefire talks fail as they did in the latest round of negotiations involving Israel Hamas and the United States the question that news consumers want answered is a basic one why and there is a journalistic urge to assign blame point fingers hamas has rejected a US proposed ceasefire deal for the Middle East conflict now it's Hamas uh that has uh issues uh with the plan uh when examining the headlines coming out of the international media the sound bites produced in various news studios the answer couldn't be simpler there's multiple articles and headlines that speak of how Hamas failed in the negotiating table where Hamas's position and the Palestinian position more broadly is discarded and Israel's position is basically advanced and trying to always blame the victims blame the Palestinians for their own undoing this is this is a a a trajectory of a policy that has been uh going on since the outset of the war and continues on all major news media in the west specifically when in fact by Israel's own admission by the Israeli media's own admission it's Israel that has often torpedoed a lot of these processes to obstruct even coming close to something of a ceasefire agreement israeli media had themselves disclosed that is that Netanyahui himself had torpedoed nine different attempts where Hamas were asking for something as basic as handing all hostages over in exchange for just preventing a ground invasion but it has been very convenient for both the US and Israel to blame the resistance when things have gone wrong when Israel has tried to torpedo any process of serious talks hamas had image problems internationally long before October 7th 20123 often framed as a barbaric terrorist organization the resistance movement reinforced that reputation through the brutality of its attacks on Israeli civilians that day and Hamas's strategy of capturing those atrocities on video for the world to see that imagery also had an eradicating effect on the context of the larger story in Gaza decade after decade of Israel's illegal occupation more monstrous and often misleading labels were then attached to Hamas terms that are seldom applied to Israel and the genocide it is inflicting on Gaza war crimes on a scale that dwarfs what Hamas did on October 7th it is a moral disparity a colonial mentality that taints the international news coverage of the ceasefire negotiations including the most recent talks where the third party at the table was Israel's closest and most important ally the US in this latest round I think the fingerpointing was mostly on Hamas largely because of the spokespeople that we heard speaking to it steve Wickoff the main negotiator from the US who essentially framed it that way saying Israel agreed to this hamas said no and changed the terms it is true that Hamas said no to the deal because it was a deal that made more on Israel's terms than through a process that would lead to an end of the war hamas's demands within um these ceasefire agreements are not outside the remmits of international law the full withdrawal of Israeli forces allowing for the uninhibited entry of of aid into Gaza and a permanent sessation of hostilities yet for some reason Western media insists on presenting these as unreasonable illegitimate demands how this narrative has been able to persist as long as it has is completely unfathomable as a spokesperson for Hamas Basam Naim has appeared on multiple media outlets albeit less often than Israeli spokespeople do naim has been privy to the ceasefire negotiations including the latest round of talks involving the Trump administration and Steve Witoff although Hamas's side of the story is usually given less credence and less airtime than the Israeli version it is one that news consumers could use considerably more of especially those who depend on American and international media platforms to understand what is happening in Gaza witkoff certainly contributed to reinforcing this negative portrayal we spoke to him in the last round of these negotiations and agreed on a plan to end this war he said our talks were positive and constructive but when he spoke to the Israeli side he came back with another proposal saying it was the only one available so this is the second time or even third that Witoff agrees with us on something and then makes a U-turn this prejudice towards Hames and the Palestinians is reflected in the American and international media because his voice carries weight within Gaza Hamas has been out to control the narrative it has suppressed journalists at times and even abducted some the movement was voted into office in 2006 and polls taken since the October 7th attacks have persistently shown that only 20 to 30% of the population supports Hamas censorship is common however during times of war and Gaza is no exception so Palestinians expressing dissent and those reporting on it don't have it easy many people in Gaza are very reluctant to openly speak out against Hamas many said that October 7th whatever anyone thinks about a right to resistance that Hamas had not prepared the population for it they had no plan for how the population was going to be impacted but there's also a lot of musling within Gaza by Hamas of journalists critiquing Hamas for those who are outside there's an idea that uh criticizing Hamas is somehow counter to being in solidarity with Palestinians many people off the record will be very critical but are very hesitant to be on the record as criticizing uh Hamas at least while the war is still ongoing there's no free flow of information necessarily hamas did crack down on some of the journalists and pressured them sometimes through imprisonment these oppressions that happen against journalists which are a problem in their own right are overblown to actually legitimize the daily violence and massacres that are happening in the Gaza Strip we should not overblow these violations as a as a means to completely discredit Hamas or exclude it from the political space uh more broadly Hamas is far from the biggest threat to journalism in the Gaza Strip unlike the Israelis it has not banned the international media from entering the war zone to bear witness document a genocide nor has it targeted journalists the way Israeli forces have killing more than 200 of them one would think that the casualty figures alone the slaughtering of so many reporters would generate more empathy among Western journalists and the news outlets that provide their paychecks the fact that it doesn't is a story in itself another measure of what Palestinians in Gaza are up against there is an enormous global media machine that's run by the Americans and the Zionists they pump out large amounts of media material to lie distort and fabricate we keep trying to present our position but journalists don't really engage and even if they do our statements will be at the bottom of their report the mainstream media is not impartial on the contrary it's been directly involved in this war and the negotiations in favor of the Israeli enemy and since the beginning of the war the mainstream media have adopted the Israeli narrative even though it was false hamas is not under represented hamas is over represented but as a profane barbaric actor that is irrational completely out of the realm of human possibility this is the dominant representation of Hamas this goes to tell us that this mainstream western media is is completely complicit in the ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip backing the government's policies in their countries in the UK in the US in Canada and other places of complete backing and political cover for Israel as it conducts in the war therefore the media is basically reframing what is happening in negotiations in a way that serves the continuation of American UK European policy of diplomatic cover and of course of material support for this genocide that is going on in the Gaza Strip moving further east now where negotiations to end the war between Russia and Ukraine have also come up short an audacious Ukrainian drone attack on multiple Russian airfields has revived the spectre of a possible nuclear confrontation tarak Nafa has been tracking the messaging around this story as a second round of direct peace talks between Moscow and Kiev ended this week without a major breakthrough Ukraine's security service posted and heavily publicized footage of a huge drone attack on its neighbor called Operation Spiderweb the coordinated drone strikes took place deep inside Russian territory reportedly damaging or destroying more than 40 military aircraft including bombers capable of dropping nuclear weapons that provided Ukrainian officials with a shot in the arm for their war narrative domestically and globally news outlets in the country have been running wall-to-wall coverage of what they called an historic operation ai generated videos paying tribute to the head of Ukraine's security services Vasel Maluk have since gone viral he's being hailed as a national hero operation Spiderweb has also boosted President Vladimir Zilinsk's image in international news outlets which had taken a serious beating as his popularity in Ukraine has tanked over in Russia the muted media coverage of the drone attacks tells a story of its own initial reporting featured short official statements from regional officials who failed to explain how Ukraine was able to pull off such an extensive attack since then the story has vanished from Russian news broadcasts president Vladimir Putin hasn't directly addressed the drone strikes but did accuse Ukraine of terrorist acts putin made no mention of Russia's own drone attacks on Ukraine the largest of which took place last month including on civilian areas thanks TK there is a trend emerging in mobile phone and social media use it's about logging off the need to be offline and it's gaining popularity particularly among younger millennials and Gen Z after decades of increased connectivity and screen time more and more young people now acknowledge how harmful that can be social media platforms plead not guilty they argue they have safety measures built into their systems like content monitoring and screen time limiters some governments have even proposed restrictions on young people signing up to social media however to combat loneliness mental health pressures and what seems to be an inability to function IRL in real life a less top-down more community-based movement has sprung up people who meet put away their devices and commit to living offline even if it's just for a bit the listening posts Ryan Kohl's now on why so many young people are logging on to the logging off club gen Z has a problem their families know it their co-workers know it most of all they know it i'm sorry to have to tell you this but we think you might have brain rot when you're saying my brain is cooked it's cooking the touch grass challenge go outside and touch some grass like I'm doing right now go go go stop doom scrolling if you have an issue with doom scrolling listen up for a generation that was born into an internet enabled mobile phone connected world screen addiction is a serious problem tackling it has required reintegrating into the society that exists in real life and that's where the clubs come in so at Logging Off Club we host our events around three main themes connection curiosity and wellness those are three things that we lose out in today's digital age and on social media we've collaborated with a walking club a crochet club and then essentially we just bring people together ask them to leave their phones in a bucket with us and just get talking to each other and get involved in the activities usually people feel lighter when they hand out the phone as if some sort of responsibility or obligation was put away and I think that comes from that sense of hyperconivity but of course there's other people that have a more difficult time and might experience some anxiety at first so this is why we provide some gentle guidance and usually through time they all reach that joy of being offline we felt like we were living our lives on super speed never really taking the time to stand still reflect and be off of our phones and actually be present with ourselves but also with the people around us we always say we want to become the third space for people to come relax and also translate it into different ways of enjoying being offline a third space is an environment in which people meet each other in person they can be churches they could be cafes they could be shopping centers gyms swimming pools libraries is a big one as well one of the things that younger generations have probably recognized is that these spaces are less accessible sometimes they've been shut down sometimes uh they don't operate in ways that are necessarily conducive for social interaction and as a result the attempt to start third space adjacent groups logging off clubs running clubs and dinner clubs but the whole point is that they're trying to kind of create social experiences that older generations may have taken for granted around the world screen time is skyrocketing modern urban life is packed full of screens but the The most addictive one fits right in the palm of your hand the bright display the notifications your email messaging apps and fitness trackers all in one device and most alluringly the possibilities of endless scrolling on social media phone addiction affects people of all generations but it's a particular scourge for Gen Z it is eroded attention spans anxiety over body image has spiraled and loneliness has become something of an epidemic it's paradoxical because the social media platforms that a majority of experts blame for Gen Z's isolation make big claims of creating social connection while most other tech companies focus on how people interact with technology we focus on building technology so people can interact with each other snapchat was built to enhance relationships between friends family and the world without Tik Tok I personally would lose that sense of community that I found within the app increasingly governments are responding to this crisis starting in December this year Australia will be implementing a ban on social media for children under the age of 16 many other countries have similar legislation under consideration governments need to recognize that social media addiction and technology addiction is a real phenomena and they should treat it more like a public health issue they need to also recognize that social media platforms and technology interact with every aspect of our society they are utilities and in the same way that governments regulate water electricity other types of utilities we use dayto-day these types of social technologies should be considered to be regulated in a similar way i definitely understand where the policy of regulating the use of social media comes from however it is rather a more sustainable approach where we educate people and provide them with tools to become more aware of what they need the technology for and have alternatives to scrolling by having offline habits reading a book and and experiencing the the benefits of that legislation like social media bans is definitely more of a reactive and band-aid solution to a bigger systemic problem that we have i mean I totally understand why governments and parents might feel like that is the solution to the immediate risk of many of the harms that we face online but what would actually be impactful is banning addictive algorithms because that is the problem here and that is why so many of us experience these types of harms while some governments grapple with the impact of phone addiction on young people older generations especially those with money aren't waiting around don't you want to take a break from emails notifications noise in the past few years a market has opened up for luxury getaways retreats to green resorts where people can put away their phones and immerse themselves in a wellness routine at Unplugged we help busy city folk like you get away from your devices so that you can recharge our off-grid cabins are nestled in nature i think it's important that when we talk about digital detoxing we recognize that there is a class divide and on one side there are very rich people CEOs or company executives who can afford to spend thousands and thousands of dollars going on these retreats and outsourcing their digital activity to people so that they can have um device free experiences but on the other side the people who often work for them are zero hour contract workers or gig economy workers for whom being online determines whether they get to eat that night or not i think it's definitely a privilege to to be able to log off and be offline uh especially because our lives are built around technology these days if you're working with a laptop or studying online course you do need to log in every day you cannot just put the laptop or phone away and live off grit and same if you're living away from your loved ones it is your only way to to keep connected to them so this is why they they call it the luxury like being offline is the new luxury because most of us I would say cannot really afford that tech companies can see there's a problem the lucrative young users they're all chasing want to live at least some part of their lives offline everyone has that one annoying app that they're most addicted to you know that one i hate these notifications how do you monetize someone's need to get away from you you say you are part of the solution but great technology should improve life not distract from it we came up with a range of ideas to help people find a balance that's right for them i do think that there is this irony in tech companies trying to use technology to solve the problems that they themselves have caused and so with these apps that are designed to reduce the amount of time that people spend on social media it doesn't solve the underlying problem what it says is that there are bad apps and there are good apps and if you subscribe to the good app then we can give you a better online experience rather than tackling the underlying problem which is that a user is spending too much time on their phones and not enough time in their social lives and it's really interesting to see now that AI is being sold to us as the solution to that very loneliness that has come as a result of this type of technology we're building this meta AI um it's our we call it personal AI that should like get to know you and like what you think is funny and like what you ate right so that way you know it can like or you know what your hobbies are so that way it can kind of relate to you there is this real push back and awareness among all of us that these are not true and that technology is not the solution and finally a revelation from one of Washington's former frontmen as the State Department spokesperson under the Biden administration Matthew Miller was the face of its diplomatic messaging operation miller made a name for himself and not in a good way good afternoon everyone day after day he defended the US's support of Israel by either dodging questions about all of the evidence coming out of Gaza or flatout denying that Israel was committing war crimes we continue to support uh Israel's right to defend itself when it comes to um uh potential violations of international humanitarian law we have our ongoing assessments um and they have not concluded recently Miller went on a podcast produced for the UK broadcaster Sky News where he admitted without hesitation or a trace of shame that he had been lying that the war crimes were and are real do you think what's going on in Gaza now is a genocide i don't I don't think it's a genocide but I think the um I think it is without a doubt true that Israel has committed war crimes you wouldn't have said that at the podium yeah look because I when you're at the podium you're not expressing your personal opinion you're expressing the conclusions of the United States government this is not the first such Maya moment politicians public figures even news outlets are now repositioning themselves in most cases it has more to do with protecting reputations than seeing the light people complicit in this genocide pretending they were always against it" />

The 37-mile long barrier was completed in 1996 and is outfitted with cutting-edge surveillance tools, a deep underground concrete layer to block Hamas tunnels, and remote-control machine guns above ground. After a billion-dollar upgrade in 2021, Israeli officials dubbed it &quot;the Iron Wall.&quot; &gt;&gt; (speaking Hebrew): (explosion booming) &gt;&gt; SWAINE: But in a matter of minutes, Hamas was able to breach the fence in around 30 locations-- the start of what would become the deadliest assault in Israel's history. At least 1,200 people were killed; 240 were taken hostage. ♪ ♪ The attack triggered a catastrophic war in Gaza that has killed thousands of Palestinians so far. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas, which has controlled the territory for years. &gt;&gt; Broadly, the fighters entered at 6:40 A.M. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Uh-huh. And that's the same incident, just from the other side of the street. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; SWAINE (voiceover): Soon after the Oct 7 attack, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; began investigating how the so-called Iron Wall could have failed so spectacularly. Our team of reporters analyzed hundreds of videos, photos, and audio recordings from before, during, and after the attack. With &quot;Frontline,&quot; we spoke with witnesses on the ground. &gt;&gt; We got hit with the first RPG. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: And examined maps and planning documents recovered from Hamas fighters. We took the visual evidence from October 7 and mapped it across southern Israel and inside the Gaza Strip, sometimes using the position of the sun to estimate when key events occurred. What we found was a fragile barrier that gave Israel a false sense of security. leaving it blind to its own vulnerabilities and to the meticulous plan taking shape on the other side of the fence. (indistinct shouting) &gt;&gt; SWAINE: The attack began at dawn, around 6:15 A.M. Videos recovered from Hamas fighters show them setting off from Gaza, and heading toward the fence, which has long been resented by Gazans who've been penned in by it. (Hamas fighters shouting in Arabic) &gt;&gt; SWAINE: People along the road cheered them on. (explosion booming) (shouting in Arabic) (rockets firing) &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Around 6:30, as fighters made their way to the fence, Hamas began firing a barrage of thousands of rockets at targets across the barrier. ♪ ♪ In just the first five minutes of the attack, there were red alerts for more than 30 communities near the Israeli side of the wall. In Kibbutz Erez, less than a mile from the barrier, Ben Sadan, a member of the community security, had just woken up for an early morning bike ride. &gt;&gt; (speaking Hebrew): &gt;&gt; SWAINE: So over there, we can see Gaza. &gt;&gt; (in English): There. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Yeah. And the, the security fence... &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: You can see it running along there, and there's the towers with the machine gun. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

(in Hebrew): &gt;&gt; SWAINE: From this hilltop, the next wave of Hamas's attack became visible. Reconnaissance fighters on paragliders, soaring over the wall under cover from the rockets. Videos we obtained show them landing in communities inside Israel, the culmination of a plan that had been years in the making-- and that, as we discovered, had been brewing in plain sight. &gt;&gt; When I first saw this video, I was like, &quot;Oh, this is video from day of.

Some were posted on social media before the attack, visible to all. We found videos of militants training for attacks on mock-ups of Israeli compounds. Videos posted soon after the attack showed they had also been practicing the use of paragliders. Hamas had also been expanding their training camps, activity that was visible in widely available online maps. But this evidence was largely ignored or dismissed by Israeli intelligence and the military, our investigation found. ♪ ♪ Michael Milshtein is a former head of the Palestinian department for Israel's military intelligence. He has been strongly critical of their missteps leading up to October 7. Israel knew about, about the whole plans, because, you know, Hamas didn't hide them. It was on public, on their internet sites, on their TV, everywhere. From the operational tactic point of view, October the 7th, we-- Israel, IDF-- didn't... face any, any surprise over there. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Were there specific warnings that something like this could be coming? &gt;&gt; Well, according to reports in the Israeli media, there was very focused reports about the whole plan, the, the whole offensive plan, that promoted... and actually the data, the reports itself, were known, even to senior ranks, senior figures in IDF intelligence. But the basic assumption, the basic assessment in the intelligence, was that those are only trainings or theoretic... theoretic attempts. But we are not speaking about something which is very feasible. ♪ ♪ (Hamas fighters speaking Arabic) &gt;&gt; SWAINE: The heart of Hamas's operation on October 7 was the stage that their videos call &quot;the blinding plan,&quot; aimed at severing the connections to Israel's surveillance and security system. ♪ ♪ Israel uses seven &quot;Skystar&quot; surveillance balloons to monitor hotspots along the Gaza fence. The balloons carry a long-range, 360-degree camera. But the model of camera that Israel uses on the balloons is relatively old and is no longer made. On the morning of October 7, we found that three of the seven balloons had been shut down for maintenance. (indistinct shouting, weapons firing) Video from the attack shows one of the remaining balloons. A source told us it had been cut loose by the militants. The balloons are part of a system that includes surveillance and weapons towers. Visuals and other data from the towers are fed into monitoring centers inside Israel, including one near Re'im. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how many combat soldiers they are. If they don't know where the enemy is, they can't fight the enemy. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Rotem Horowitz spent two years monitoring the camera feeds at Re'im before completing her military service last spring. Three of the balloons were out of service on the day, they weren't working. &gt;&gt; Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: The cameras needed to be repaired, but they're old and out of production. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So... &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Is that a big problem? &gt;&gt; I personally think it is. They were first brought into use in 2006, and... ever since then, it's kind of been the same system. It doesn't work very well during rough weather, like, only when weather conditions are perfect. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Do you remember people sending up warnings that, you know, these balloons are getting out of date, some of them aren't working, they're not working in bad weather? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know that the surveillance operators on the balloon have... as long as I've been there, you know, I served there-- we've been complaining about how the balloons see and, like, in general, their quality. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Mm. &gt;&gt; Ever since I can remember. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: The balloons are supplemented by surveillance towers containing HD cameras, laser and infrared sensors, and radars, and can see people for almost six miles away, according to the manufacturer. Other structures, called Sentry Tech towers, are topped with Samson weapons stations, which feature machine guns and sensors. They're positioned every few hundred yards along the barrier and outside key military facilities, and are nicknamed &quot;Roeh-Yoreh,&quot; Hebrew for &quot;Sees Fires&quot;. Once the sensors send an intruder alert, IDF personnel can fire the 50-caliber machine guns by remote control. &gt;&gt; We have to really make sure that we can firmly see a weapon and a threat before we can actually do anything with it. So usually, like, if someone's getting close to the fence, we use it to kind of-- not shoot at them, but shoot near them to kind of, like, scare them away. Like, &quot;Don't come close.&quot; You know, we're not going to touch them if they don't come close. The moment they're showing they're a threat and they're coming close, that's when we start to act. &gt;&gt; (speaking Hebrew): &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Video from one of the sentry towers on October 7 shows it firing on a group of Hamas fighters as they approached the fence near Kissufim. But that's not what happened elsewhere. Hamas fighters had come prepared to evade the towers, and documents recovered after the attack reveal a deep and detailed knowledge of Israeli defenses. In this one, they specifically note the locations of surveillance systems. Fighters also carried with them open source satellite imagery annotated with coded locations of key structures along the wall. Armed with this information, Hamas carried out their blinding plan using unmanned drones equipped with cameras, to drop explosives on installations like this surveillance tower in the community of Be'eri. Of the sentry tech towers marked on the map, we verified videos of at least two of them being attacked. This one, located near Kfar Aza, was attacked twice by Hamas drones. Incendiary explosive devices with fuses were dropped on the camera and weapons system. Some of the training videos we found posted online show that these drone maneuvers had been well-rehearsed. (bomb bursting) Other videos from the 7th show towers being attacked with rocket-propelled grenades and gunfire. It's hard to tell just from the video evidence how badly damaged the installations were. Hi, thank you so much for your time, I really appreciate you coming and seeing us tonight... (voiceover): But retired Colonel Dany Tirza, the former head of the Israeli military's fence administration, told me Hamas's blinding plan drastically undermined Israel's ability to respond to the attack. &gt;&gt; That was a real failure, because they succeeded to cut the command system. The command system of all this area... &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; ...was built on one control system, and they succeeded to cut it. And therefore, we couldn't use helicopters, because according to the Israeli system, the helicopters cannot shoot if there is not someone on the ground that show them where are your forces, where are the other side forces. So they came, but they couldn't shoot, because they didn't know who and what is going on there. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: In 2021, when the latest upgrade... was unveiled, some of the political and military leaders made very firm, quite bold, claims for the barrier. They said, &quot;This will protect &quot;the residents in the south. Hamas will not get in.&quot; And... Was that a mistake, to promise those things? &gt;&gt; Of course it was a mistake. We really thought that we are building a very good infrastructure that will help to save the lives of the Israelis. Unfortunately, it didn't work. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: He said the attack exposed a fundamental misconception about the fence. &gt;&gt; It was built against people that will try to cross it. It wasn't built against army or against a lot of people that are coming in one time. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Were you surprised-- you, personally-- surprised at how quickly they were able to blast through and make it into the bases and beyond? &gt;&gt; I myself was not surprised that they crossed it so quickly, because defense is not built for such fighting. It was built for another thing. If you want to stop an army, you are doing it with army tools. If you want to stop one, two, three terrorists, you're doing it with soft tools, like what we did. We didn't thought that there will come a terror army from the other side, that were crossing at the same time, big groups, and we were not prepared for it. ♪ ♪ &gt;&gt; SWAINE: The Israeli government says Hamas broke through the fence in around 30 locations.

Did Israel not see this? &gt;&gt; I mean, we're looking at what exactly transpired before the 7th of October, and there will be a time when the IDF will be doing that soul searching that is required, and the IDF will review that, and those that need to take responsibility will have to take responsibility. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: What do you think October 7 says about the integrity of that barrier? &gt;&gt; So, the barrier itself is a concept that was perceived to be a strong line of defense. And any line of defense can only withhold a certain amount of pressure. I think the question is not necessarily what is the barrier, but what was the threat assessment? And these are the types of questions that we will be asking. These are the types of questions that, that the answers to the residents of those towns of the Kibbutzim, we owe them... clarification, and, and... accountability for the failure of not the fence, but the whole concept of operations.

AMBASSADOR, GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE. ALL RIGHT. ALL AT, YOU KNOW, PUNS ASIDE AND PAULINE MARKET THINGS ASIDE. THIS CLASH BETWEEN GRATIS FLOTILLA AND THE IDF COULD CREATE AN INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT. THEY BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS ASKED ISRAEL TO MAKE SURE NOTOTHING TERRIBLE HAPPENS TO THIS GROUP. WHAT IS THE IDF PREPARED TO DO WHEN THIS FLOTILLA GETS CLOSE TO GAZA. GOOD TO BE WITH YOU, ELIZABETH. I MEAN, SHOULD BE OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM. OKAY. WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF HUGE WAR IN GAZA WE'VE GOT THAT FIGHTING GOING ON THE NORTH OF LEBANON. WE'VE GOT QUITTING MISSILES. &gt;&gt; TO TEL AVIV, I LIVE IN SOUTH TEL AVIV. EVERY NIGHT WE RUN TO A BOMB SHELTER. WE HAVE THE SITUATION IN SYRIA WHICH IS VERY UNSTABLE AND WE HAVE THE IRAN NUCLEAR ISSUE IN THE MIDDLE OF GRETA THUNBERG COMING WITH HER BOAT. OK? BUT LET'S ADDRESS IS NOT THE FIRST LOOK TELE ISRAEL'S HAVE FACED PROBABLY THE MOST FAMOUS OR INFAMOUS WAS IN 2010, THE MAVI MARMARA. A NAVY SEALS TRIED TO INTEEPT ABOUT THAT WAS FILLED WITH VERY LARGE THUGS WHO THE SKIES, THIS PAD DEMONSTRATORS THEY IN FACT WERE WERE ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS WERE ARMED AND NAVY SEALS LANDED ON THESE BOATS WITH PAINT GUNS AND THEY WERE SET UPON AND BEATEN AND STABBED AND SHOT. SO WASN'T IT WAS REAL, REAL, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE INCIDENT AND THEY SHOT BACK. I'M ACTUALLY KILLED SOME. SO THEY HAVE MORE THAN PINK. THAT SAID, DON'T KNOW. THEY DOWN WITH WITH THE WITH, WITH, WITH WITH SIDE ARMS, ALSO WHIPPING CUTS. SO I THINK WE LEARNED A LESSON FROM THAT THAT THAT IF YOU'RE SO WHAT'S THE IDF GOING TO DO WHEN THEY GET CLOSE? SO IT BY THE WAY, THEY CALL IT THE SELFIE FLOW. TELL THAT THE WHOLE THING SEEMS RIDICULOUS. IT'S IT'S A PLUS OF THE PUBLICITY. SOMETHING FOR HER, IT'S LIKE WHAT KEEPS HER NAME IN THE NEWS, RIGHT? MAYBE WANT SOME THINKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE THE WAY THEY USED TO. AND THERE SHE'S USED TO HAVING THE INTERNATIONAL SPOTLIGHT. SO HERE SHE GETS TO RETAIN THE INTERNATIONAL SPOTLIGHT FOR A WHILE. AND OF COURSE, SHE'S NOT. BUT FLOTILLA TO THE SEDAN. NOT GOING FALL TO LEAD TO A CONDO OR OR TO OTHER PLACES WHERE THERE WAS MORE ISN'T AFFECTING MUCH, MUCH BIGGER AND MUCH MORE DESTRUCTIVE. AND THAT'S GOING ON IN GAZA. NOTHING ABOUT THE UKRAINE. NOTHING ABOUT THE MILLION MUSLIMS PUT IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS IN CHINA'S. SHE'S NOT SENDING A FLOTILLA. THERE'S YOU'RE SENDING IT GAZA. OKAY. WHAT IS THE ISRAELI NAVY GOING TO DO IS PROBABLY GONNA STOP STOP THEM BY MIDDLE GETTING VOTES TO CUT OFF THE ROOF. TAKE DO OUT OF IT. BUT I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING. AND, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT REPRESENTED ISRAELI GOVERNMENT ANYMORE. NOT JUST MY PERSONAL THINGS.

THE U.S. NAVY TRIED TO BUILD UP HERE. IT FAILED U.S. AIR FORCE TRIED TO AIRDROP IT FAILED BECAUSE WHAT GOES ON IN GAZA IS THE MANY TRY TO BRING IN GATE. 2 THINGS HAPPENED AT EITHER OTHER PEOPLE 1000 PEOPLE JUMP ON THE AID AND MAKING THE POSSIBLE DISTRIBUTE. BUT MORE LIKELY HAMAS WILL GET AND HOW MUCH WILL TAKEN AT GUNPOINT. THEY'LL SHOOT PEOPLE TRY TO GET THE AID THEY SHOT. BUT ROUGHLY 50, 60 PEOPLE IN THE LAST WEEK TRYING IF THAT'S A LITTLE I MEAN, THAT IS DISPUTED. AND I IDEA HAS RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING THAT IT DID OPEN FIRE, WARNING SHOTS AND THEN SHOT AT PEOPLE WHEN THEY DIDN'T STOP. BUT NOWHERE NEAR THAT AREA. &gt;&gt; NOWHERE NEAR THAT AREA AND I HAVE IT FOR MY OWN INFORMATION. THAT IS THAT ISRAEL'S NO WAY CULPABLE FOR THOSE 50, 60 PEOPLE, WE ACTUALLY HAD VIDEOS OF OF HAMAS, PEOPLE SHOOTING PALESTINIANS TRYING TO GET &gt;&gt; SO TELL IT'S GOING TO TAKE IT'S GOING TO 2 THINGS WITH THAT'S GOING TO FEED ITS OWN TERRORIST WITH THAT AID AND THEN IT'S GOING TO SELL IT BACK TO PALESTINE IS A GROSSLY INFLATED PRICES.

          <attvalue for="7" value="let's go to the latest developments in Gaza and the West Bank where the UN is struggling to get aid into the enclave while the IDF has fired warning shots near foreign diplomats in the West Bank david Sedfield is the director of Rise University's Baker Institute and is a former US envoy for Gaza aid he joins me now from Houston uh good to have you with us David appreciate your time now first to the news you know that the IDF had fired these uh what it calls warning shots at a group of foreign diplomats d touring in Janine in the West Bank how could this possibly have happened and and what you know would those diplomats be thinking you were one yourself uh in in the area i think the answer to this is a very simple one but it's also complex the simple answer is it's it's fog of combat fog of engagement the IDF is is heavily involved in operations in the West Bank as it is in Gaza um there is obviously a deconliction mechanism that's necessary in these kinds of circumstances my understanding is the diplomat's visit had been pre-arranged uh on a cleared route with the IDF what happened there will be the subject of investigation uh but there is obviously no justification uh for any form of risk uh or firing in the vicinity of diplomats yes i mean uh you mentioned fog of war the IDF says that you know this delegation had deviated from an approved path i mean is that is that a good enough excuse for the IDF well it's not a question of excuses it's an issue of of how to ensure that anyone uh who is conducting business that has been cleared by approved by the IDF is able to do so safely if the route was one that was not authorized by the IDF then that needs to come out in the form of investigation but we've seen many many cases in Gaza uh where humanitarian actors following completely approved routes no deviations uh still came under fire from or adjacent to fire by the IDF this kind of of problem deconliction problem uh has to be addressed at the highest levels okay let's uh look at the aid front you know we are still getting reports that the desperately needed food supplies are not really getting into those who really need them they're desperate for for them from your assessment where's the hold up look there there are two issues here first the population of Gaza approximately 2 million people has been denied uh humanitarian assistance since March 2nd uh the need is extreme a few trucks entering a few dozen or even a few hundred on a oneoff or two off basis won't address this need and because the need is so severe you have two problems the aid is inspected and moves to a platform a loading platform just inside Gaza it then has to be moved by the humanitarian agencies to their warehouses and from the warehouses to distribution points this has always been a difficult issue because those aid movements once they're within Gaza are subject to extraordinary security threat whether from lutters criminal gangs or what the humanitarian community calls self-distribution a desperate people taking the aid off of trucks off of lries as they move through my understanding is that the aid that's moved in over the past 72 hours a significant quantity has now been moved to the warehouses of the humanitarian actors away from that Gaza border platform but the point here is not what happened to a 100 trucks or 200 trucks you need hundreds of trucks a day 300 400 every day they're going to suffer predation initially and to keep it going yes and if Israel knows that in uh you know that the people in Gaza Palestinians there do need these hundreds and hundreds of trucks that you're talking about you know just to get by as well is there a a sense that you know this is a deliberate strategy to starve a population when Israel as a matter of declared state policy as it did at the beginning of March halts all movement of food humanitarian assistance that's state policy it started a clock ticking a powerful political international clock ticking which had to be addressed but the difficulty in Israel now and its political problem uh is you have two circles that need to be squared the recognition and I'm quite certain there is full recognition at the highest political levels and certainly within the Israeli Defense Forces they've got to get food in before actual starvation and famine appears that's one imperative the other imperative is purely political it's within the coalition it's within the cabinet of how do you meet that requirement to move assistance without triggering the threatened departure from government uh of two uh extreme nationalist parties from uh Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition it's the attempt to combine both of those imperatives that have created the difficulties but frankly unless the volume of assistance by the international humanitarian community increases and increases rapidly there will be at a point in coming weeks where famine and starvation do appear it's not a controversial point it's well understood it needs to be addressed now while there is time remaining and what's we've seen uh you know international pressure on um on Benjamin Netanyahu we'll speak about that later but can you give us a sense you've been to Gaza of at this moment how Palestinians are then viewing um Hamas as it is because it's it's still a force where it is there is little doubt that the Palestinian population of Gaza does not have strong support for Hamas hamas has brought this disaster this miserable uh situation of suffering onto the Palestinian people no question about that at all indeed the popularity of Hamas is lowest in Gaza if you take polling throughout the Arab world but still Hamas on the ground possesses the gun possesses the ability to influence the population and that's the difficulty where the IDF is not physically present in force hamas is the effective presence it has not been eliminated and and I'll make the point here elimination of Hamas i put the phrase in quotes how do you achieve that it's a goal everyone supports it's a vicious terrorist group it has agency it has produced this suffering it sustains the suffering of the Gazin people but you need both military pressure and you need a political framework and it's the political framework which has been absent uh during these past 19 months who might be responsible for the political framework i we are looking at actors beyond Israel and Gaza here well we are looking primarily at the government of Israel and I don't listen to analysts such as me on this listen to the public calls of the most senior Israeli national security leadersh who said the ability to eliminate Hamas through kinetic through military means only uh that can't be done you do need military pressure absolutely but you also need a framework and that framework is not just important for any resolution in Gaza that addresses Hamas it's critical to bringing in stabilization reconstruction assistance from the Arab world it's vital to the conclusion of the so-called Saudi deal that needs that political commitment from the government of Israel to a negotiated permanent status resolution those are hard words to hear in a traumatized Israel and I fully understand that but hard words are sometimes necessary to be spoken and that political framework is an essential element of anything in Gaza other than a continuation of desperation radicalization and misery and just briefly um are sanction sanctions against Israel or the threat of sanctions by some countries uh going to make any difference i do not believe those threats or application of sanctions are a useful tool in this situation look Hamas as I said has agency hamas created this in the massacre that occurred on October 7th 23 it could end the suffering of the Gazin people tonight this afternoon if it elected to do so it hasn't and it won't why because it believes it will win and a victory by Hamas its survival is a threat first and foremost of course to Israel and Israelis but also to the region as a whole so no I don't believe sanctions are appropriate what is appropriate is continued counseling which I have no doubt is coming from the United States as well as other friends of Israel partners of Israel that this situation needs to change and it cannot change solely through application of military force okay Dr david uh David Satderfield thank you so much for your insights into this thank you so much thank you" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Iran's most famous ski destination is tol Resort it overlooks the capital tyan you can get there on a 7 km chairlift from the tyan suburb of tajrish and on the way up the chairlift if you turn around at just the right time you can see something interesting a giant walled off area filled with lush green trees in amongst the trees is the Palace of the former Sha of Iran his majesty liked skiing hence the convenient chairlift these days it's where the president of Iran holds big events and meets with world leaders right on the edge of the palace grounds is a concrete building five stories high and if you happen to be on the chairlift at 1:37 a.m. on the 31st of July this year you would have seen the Western corner of that building explode windows were shattered and exterior wall crumbled and Rubble fell onto the Terrace below now that explosion was no accident it was the result of a bomb a bomb that killed an extremely high-profile Target Hamas leader Ishmael hania has been assassinated in the Iranian Capital tyan this attack appears to have been meticulously planned and carried out flawlessly probably by Israel as is its usual practice the Israeli government has declined to make any official comment the mozard simply never comments at all but if that's true it's wild killing a Hamas leader inside the compound of the Iranian president while he's under the protection of the Iranian revolutionary guard is an extraordinary statement the Iran supreme leader said Revenge was our duty and that Israel had prepared a harsh punishment for itself by killing a dear guest in our home there's some debate about the mechanic of how they pulled this off which I'll definitely be getting into later in this episode but no matter the methods they used the risk involved in this assassination operation is Extreme if it was Israel that did this why did they do it in such an extraordinary manner well the answer is fascinating and it tells us a lot about the incredibly complex political situation that Israel has found itself in where it feels the need for Revenge but only in a way that doesn't alienate its allies today the unbelievable assassination plot against Ismael Hanah and what it tells us about the escalating conflict between Israel and its enemies the world is on the brink of a fullscale war in the Middle East I'm Matt beon and this is if you're [Music] listening the Israeli intelligence agency mad was once considered to be one of the most terrifying ruthless spy agencies in the world known for its daring and brutal missions the kidnapping trial and execution of Nazi Adolf Aman the Israeli bombing of the Syrian nuclear reactor assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists the purpose of these plots was to communicate to Israel's enemies that there was nowh they could hide without mad finding them and yet for nearly a decade Ismael Hanah leader of Israel's number one enemy Hamas has been living in Qatar for safety security the Israelis would like to kill him he's not alone a bunch of Hamas leaders live in qat it's a weird setup billionaire gas princes the US Military and Hamas all living next door to each other on the Arabian Peninsula and they're not hiding there either they live out in the open Ismael hanas spent years there and nothing happened to him you might think that sending your spies to assassinate your greatest enemies would be easier to do in a country that you share a bunch of allies with but it's not and the reason for that goes back to a series of mad operations that went terribly terribly wrong Israelis once saw their foreign intelligence Service as Invincible not anymore throughout the '90s and 2000s mad bungled a few really high-profile missions the Mad used to have the image of working like a Swiss clock and now it is almost like a Swiss cheese but the biggest of all their screw-ups came in 2010 and that's because they screwed up in a very particular way this is the Spy story that could well spell the end of old fashion Cloak and Dagger Espionage this time the operation was in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates the target hamas's top weapons supplier a man named Mamud almu the Palestinian resistance fighter was known to mosad for buying weapons from Iran and notorious also for kidnapping and killing two Israeli soldiers in 1989 it was called operation plasma screen I assume mad had run out of intimidating operation names and had moved on to household appliances it involved more than 20 mad agents all traveling on non-israeli passports that's really necessary for the operation to work at the time more than two dozen countries including the UAE did not accept Israeli passports so while the CIA and MI6 can print Jack Ryan and James Bond new passports whenever they like Massad agents have to use foreign passports without those foreign passports there's no operation plasma screen not to mention operation DVD player operation Lazy Boy recliner and operation universal remote so how do you get hold of foreign passports well apparently Israel developed a system if you're in Israeli with two passports be that second passport British or Australian you can be approached by an official the official asks you if you need that second passport in the short term and if you say no you're asked if out of Duty to the country whether you'd be prepared to have your passport details borrowed borrowed best no one asks what they're being borrowed for operation plasma screen would require more than 20 of these borrowed passports using fake passports more than once is risky they'd have to get the job done with as few visits to Dubai as possible on visit one the agents followed elabo around Dubai observing his patterns on visit 2 they slipped poison in his drink but he inconveniently failed to die and went home to Syria thinking that he was just sick 2 months later alive and well he headed back to Dubai spies traveling on the same set of passports followed him again M arrives from Damascus midaf afternoon and is watched by several operatives the man in the baseball cap goes by the name of Australian Adam Corman virtually the entire operation is captured on CCTV Israeli operatives follow alabu from the airport to the hotel when he goes to his room two spies with tennis rackets manage to slide into the lift with him hate it when people do that one of the tennis players watches which room he goes into the operatives book a room opposite and still more agents move in and when the Hamas man leaves to go shopping he's followed every step it's quite funny watching these surveillance teams go about their business you can see them changing disguises into business suits pushing on doors that say pull endlessly wandering up and down Hotel corridors like weird business ghosts meanwhile while four of them break into albo's room the Hamas official arrives back from his shopping trip and into the ambush of four assassins they use a special ultrasonic device to anesthetize him without a needle and lower him to the floor waiting for his heart to stop but they aren't out of the woods yet once a team like this starts working it is very easy technologically to trace them at each and every point of the whole of the whole maneuver unlike in the movies they don't have a guy in a van who hacks into the security system and erases the CCTV footage the whole thing is caught on camera their only hope is that nobody will ever bother to check it so they take off albo's clothes and Tuck him into bed it'll look like he died in his sleep in the absence of signs of a struggle for days police thought he' died of natural causes and with agents safely out of the country it seemed the perfect hit it was the passports that blew their cover after Hamas notified duai police that their man was dead it was simple for investigators to check immigration logs for anything suspicious they discovered that the same group of people had clearly been following al-mu in and out of the country Dubai Police say Mahmud al- mau's Killers tracked him from the moment he arrived in the country warrants are now being issued for their arrest which was a bit of a nasty surprise for the people who the passports belong to imagine waking up one morning only to find out that apparently you've traveled to an exotic Middle Eastern location and assassinated an alleged arms dealer the Australians Brits Irish French and Germans whose passports had been used were not very happy I'm angry why is this happening to me does this mean I can't visit my parents because someone used my name it's like a movie the governments of the countries the passports came from were also not very happy they were all friendly with Israel and here was their Ally using their passports for international assassinations such misuse of British passports is intolerable the fact that this was done by a country which is a friend only adds insults to injury this was not the act of a friend this is this is not the first occasion where there has been misuse of an Australian passport by Israeli agencies needless to say Dubai was angry too that is a deplorable and unacceptable method of operation it was extremely embarrassing and damaging for Israel Israel relies on the support of its allies well for its very existence they couldn't risk doing this again in a place like Dubai that's why hamas's headquarters are now in Qatar the Americans had an agreement with the qataris and the Israelis that you don't kill Hamas leaders in Qatar this has provided a challenge for Israel which previously pledged to eliminate Hamas leaders when those leaders aren't in Qatar they're other highly developed Western Allied countries like Egypt and turkey if you Aspire for a country that's pledged to eliminate Hamas leaders it might be easier for you to get them there logistically but diplomatically it's Kryptonite when those Leaders Travel to meet their allies in Iran though well the Palestinian militant group Hamas says its political leader isma hania has been assassinated in Iran so how'd they pull it off mad couldn't get is Hana in Qatar where he lived so they'd have to get him while he was traveling mad knew that Hana traveled regularly to tan mad also knew that he stayed in the guest house of the Iranian revolutionary guard Corps on the edge of the presidential Palace complex at the foot of the mountains it seems they had also managed to bribe two of the building's guards offering them cash and asylum in Europe in exchange for attaching a brick-sized bomb to the bottom of hania's bed they had the where and the how but they were missing the when you can't have a crew of Massad agents hiding in the hills of tyan endlessly staking out the building waiting for your guy to arrive but on the 18th of May this year something happened to help with that third thing I've seen vision of it already there's a huge plume of smoke coming from that site the Iranian president Ibrahim REI was killed in a helicopter accident we did a whole episode about it at the time give it a watch after this one the president's death opened up an opportunity for mad it knew that hania would be invited to the inauguration of the new president in July what happened next is still a little unclear there's at least three versions of the story The New York Times and the Jerusalem Post report that the bomb was planted soon after Rey's death and sat there for 8 weeks waiting for hania to visit for the event the Jewish Chronicle in Lon reports that in fact the bomb was planted on the afternoon of hania's arrival But whichever version turns out to be true we know that by the time hania turned in for the night on the 30th of July the bomb had been planted and it wasn't on a timer it could be detonated when the time was right luckily for Mad the building was unbelievably easy to spy on you can see it clearly from anywhere on the hillside that stretches up behind the palace you can see get from the chairlift on your way up for a ski or you could dress up in green camouflage and climb any of the several hundred trees surrounding the building which is what the Jewish Chronicle reports that Massad agents did hania attended the inauguration of Iran's new president met with the country's supreme leader and then went to the guest house the agents watched hania's car arrive they watched him go into his room watched him turn off the light waited a few moments and then pressed the button two assassinations 14 years apart the differences between them tell us a lot about Israel's position in the world in 2010 mad's operation in Dubai really irritated Israel's allies in Europe and Australia but in 2024 Israel needs those allies more than they've needed them in decades by carrying out assassinations in Iran they're operating in a way that is far more risky for their but much less likely to anger their friends what mad does though it's it's different from the CIA or MI6 CIA people they don't like they don't like this stuff you know it's it's messy while British and American spy agencies do assassinate people they do it in war zones and they tend to do it with military operations or drone strikes and they tend to tell the public about it why don't they do sneaky James Bond St sty assassinations because it was believed to be counterproductive you're just creating martyrdom you're creating that feel of persecution and in the long term that's negative and top it off it usually doesn't achieve anything all terrorists are replaced sooner or later the point of these assassinations is to create fear to terrorize your opponents to make your enemies constantly worry that you've planted a bomb under their bed that the places that they think are safe aren't really Israel's basically sending a message to the Iranians can kill any one of you anywhere anytime it's the same reason Russia kills people by poisoning their underpants or their tea or their door knobs isma hania was the chief negotiator in the peace talks aimed at ending the war in Gaza and now he's been replaced as Hamas Leader by a far more fanatical islamist Yaya sinoa hania's death potentially indicates an Israeli desire to prolong the war and it's part of a series of tit fortat attacks in recent weeks that could signal an escalation of the conflict the thing is though when Russia pulls stunts like this they're condemned by the Western World Israel thinks it's found the guard rails for how to carry out crossborder assassinations without losing friends but right now their friendships are quite stretched they cannot afford to make any mistakes [Music] [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="Watch the second episode:    • How is Israel’s military tech marketed abr...  &#10;&#10;Uncovering how Israel profits from surveillance technologies using occupied Palestinian territories as a testing ground.&#10;&#10;Israel punches way above its weight when it comes to arms sales. The 97th country by population, it is the ninth largest arms dealer in the world with a $13bn military-industrial complex.&#10;&#10;&quot;Plenty of countries sell weapons,&quot; says award-winning journalist Antony Loewenstein, &quot;but what makes Israel's industry unique is the mix of weapons, surveillance technology and architectural techniques that combine to create a comprehensive system for controlling 'difficult' populations and are based on years of experience in Palestine.&quot;&#10;&#10;In this two-part series, Loewenstein goes on a journey to investigate how these weapons and surveillance technologies are used to control and repress Palestinians in Palestine before being sold all over the world.&#10;&#10;Antony Loewenstein is a Jewish, Australian journalist and author who for more than 20 years has written unflinchingly about Israel and its relationship with the Palestinians, even though it has often put him at odds with many in the Jewish diaspora and Israel.&#10;&#10;In Episode 1, Loewenstein returns to Israel to investigate how cutting-edge military and surveillance technology is being used on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip, before being marketed to international clients as &quot;field-proven&quot; and &quot;battle-tested&quot;.&#10;&#10;Hearing from Palestinians and Israelis, he uncovers how a pipeline of personnel and research from the Israeli army feeds into semi-private arms companies which form a crucial part of Israel's exports to the world. He also investigates the Israeli army's use of targeting systems that utilise artificial intelligence during the Gaza war after October 7, 2023.&#10;&#10;Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe&#10;Follow us on X: https://x.com/ajenglish&#10;Find us on Facebook:   / aljazeera  &#10;Check our website:  https://www.aljazeera.com&#10;Check out our Instagram page:   / aljazeeraenglish  &#10;Download AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile&#10;&#10;#TheTruthUncovered #documentary #ThePalestineLaboratory #AlJazeeraEnglish #palestine #israel #technology #westbank #gaza #surveillance #aljazeera" />

Firefly Israeli companies hint that their products may have been battle tested in Palestine so how does being a major armed supplier impact Israel's diplomatic position could it give the country a measure of impunity when it wants to undertake its own [Music] Wars I've just got a stash of books from my publisher today uh my book and other books mostly related to Palestine and uh Guerilla journalism just some light reading I'm about to do an event a Q&amp;A about my book The Palestine laboratory the book's been quite controversial it's a look at how the occupation of Palestine allows Israel to test weapons which are then sold around the world I wanted to do a book really not just about the whole concept of the arms indust industry which is an interesting subject but can be a bit dry but what Israel is testing and selling and promoting is not just Weaponry it's an idea it's a concept and it's a very appealing concept to many other countries Israel sells the idea of getting away with it to find out how tiny Israel has managed to develop this huge military and surveillance machine I'm heading back to Israel and Palestine it's not really clear if I'm going to get in I haven't been there for a few years wish me luck although I'm Jewish I'm not a citizen of Israel and their immigration rules say they can refuse entry to critics of the country or those who have called for boycotts so they have multiple reasons for turning me away my arrival was surprisingly smooth so I'm heading straight to East Jerusalem Israel has been occupying the West Bank since 1967 and has developed a unique system of controlling the Palestinian population from checkpoints in the separation wall to increasingly Innovative methods of surveillance these walls are not just walls they can listen and they are listening to probably us right now I suspect it's it's in these population management technologies that Israel is a global leader so I want to see how they first use it to control Palestinians before being sold around the world I'm on my way to Mama a businessman in East Jerusalem to find out how all this impacts ordinary [Music] Palestinians you can see my office from this camera inside so the cameras are both looking into Damascus gate but also out in and out so I'm standing on a balcony literally overlooking Damascus gate it's osama's office his insurance office and all around behind me over there there's multiple surveillance Towers right behind me there's a camera watching me so I'm going to watch it Asama wants to show me the very physical reality of the occupation the restrictions on the movement of Palestinians his daily commute from the West Bank to Jerusalem is through the Candia checkpoint AMA how do you feel when you cross kandia checkpoint you're crying I 24 hours about my my daughter my son if he need me I am here and this is traffic I need 3 Hour 4 hour to go to to help my son you understand that I do I can understand why this would make you nervous you can see Soldier here any mistake you lost your life and that's happened many times yes the soldiers have the power to detain people like aama for hours question them and place them in administrative detention without charge or trial [Music] should ask that's it I can go I ask him it's almost like you have to ask permission to go into Jerusalem to get back to your own City but this physical infrastructure is just the beginning Israel has a vision of a seamless future where technology minimizes the interactions between Palestinians and the Israeli Army Israel says it's safer but it's quite dystopic my hi a meeting Palestinian digital rights campaigner monaa to find out more explain the growing Trend within Israeli thinking of a so-called frictionless occupation well the whole automation aims to eliminate the the direct interaction between the Israeli as occupying force and Palestinians as occupied people and to make the main interaction between Palestinians and the technology so it could create this idea that our problem is not with the occupier but rather with a technology heon is the testing ground for many of these supposedly frictionless Technologies the city is split into two zones H1 with a population of nearly 200,000 in H2 355,000 Palestinians live under the Gaze of the 750 settlers and 800 soldiers who have taken over the center of the city Palestinians living in H2 face the heaviest surveillance in the West Bank and the strictest travel [Music] restrictions fore fore cat for under the so-called frictionless occupation these cameras are linked to artificial intelligence systems watching for what Israel deames threatening behavior there's someone who watch you who knows what you are doing but you don't necessar know who's watching you Palestinians need to think about behaving at our best all the time sometimes you might be angry from something that happens with your family in your home or at your work and then you might look like angry and with a predictive policing you never know when you would be identified as a security threat by the Israelis so you need to fake your emotions if the frictionless occupation can't get a fixed camera on you it can send a flying one this was recorded just a few miles south of Hebron [Applause] Issa Amro is a human rights activist living in H2 this is a military post full of cameras and surveillance and they watch us for sure now so let's say hi I usually say hi to them we are in the main street in teda Palestinians are not allowed to drive here pal shops are closed by military orders and the street here is full of Israeli military surveillance let's see the Palestinian K kids in the window they are caged in the house look they they put fences in their Windows to be protected from the settler and army violence look surveillance for the military is up there and this is the surveillance of the Israeli settlers so imagine that the Israeli settlers they have their own systems here these checkpoints are where the latest frictionless technology is tested including this AI enabled remotely controlled gun which fires stung grenades tear gas and sponge tip bullets it's made by Israeli company smart shooter these checkpoints also boast Israel's most comprehensive data Gathering tool Wolfpack from 10 to 15 cameras are at the checkpoint this is where they use red wolf and blue wolf the Israeli military recently invented two systems red wolf and blue wolf blue wolf in the soldiers phones they take your photo then they know all details about you where you've been where you go what you like what you don't like your private things then there is another system the red wolf is set up in the checkpoints and in the control rooms and it's profiling Palestinians according to their political stands when the soldiers scan a Palestinian face they get a traffic light style indication of their supposed risk white for Palestinians who are not doing anything about occupation you have yellow and you have orange for example I'm a human rights Defender I am red it means check him make his life harder he's a suspect so the frictionless technology actually enables a lot more friction for some people they use us as simulation objects for their technology Israeli sec SEC solution companies they installed cameras sensors drones and they tested it on us without our consent do they sell it do they use it for other research what kind of data they collect it seems to be the often secret Partnerships between the military and private sector that have helped Israeli companies become world leaders in their fields in 2019 a report revealed that Israeli company any Vision had installed Styles in the West Bank and was collecting movement and biometric data from the tens of thousands of Palestinians forced to use them early investor Microsoft pulled their funding after this was revealed the company changed its name to Uso and says it works in 43 countries with clients including casinos airports and schools another Israeli company visites make behavioral recognition systems that watch CCTV feeds for any threats the company actually created the ability to take a realtime video stream and understand what's going on within the stream the company is supported by the Israeli military it's marketed for use in cities prisons and refugee camps around the [Music] world we're in abis in East Jerusalem and I'm standing next to a old but now derelict Hotel owned by Palestinians and during the second Intero in the early 2000s the separation wall was built and it's kind of surrounded now on all sides no one can access it the owners can't use it the guests are not coming but what Israel has done is on the top they've installed surveillance cameras the location is patrolled by police and private security 24 hours a day just a minute ago we saw the move probably to watch us minutes later four young Israeli police officers with machine guns approached us so what are you explaining about the situation this formerly Palestinian Run Hotel taken over by the military and turned into a surveillance post could be seen as a microcosm of the occupation but what is visible is just part of the overall picture of how the occupation surveils Palestinians first there is the physical infrastructure of walls and checkpoints the checkpoints record movement data and biometric information then they have CCTV cameras which are monitored by AI for perceived threats of violence and that in turn is hooked up to databases like red wolf which track everyone's political profile but there's also a more fundamental level of surveillance which is that most of the phone and internet system is routed through Israel Israel is controlling the ICT infrastructure in the in in the occupied Palestinian territory which means that Palestinians are not able to have safe access to the internet with control of basic Communications infrastructure the Israelis know every phone number and can tap any call Israeli intelligence also have teams monitoring all the social media platforms many Palestinians basically they don't share their political opinion online because they would be afraid of being interrogated or arrested by the Israelis I find it remarkable that sometimes blanket CCTV coverage analyzed by artificial intelligence and backed up by biometric movement tracking just isn't enough surveillance I'm off to meet a man who once presented such a threat to the authorities that they deployed the world's most invasive spye on him Anthony hithon lovely to meet you U alaboodi didn't look threatening to me he runs the bisan center which campaigns for the rights of Palestinians do you have any idea why you were targeted I think it has to do with the targeting of any kind of Palestinian Civil Society Israel sees us as part of a establishing that there is a Palestinian people how did you hear that your phone had been infected by Pegasus and why do you think that happened you're working with Palestinian human rights organization El haak right I was contact by alhak in late 2021 they found that one of their employees had Pegasus on his phone I had my device checked and they told me that my phone was infected by Pegasus spyware a couple of days later the Israeli uh Minister of Defense uh benig Gans designated six Palestinian Civil Society organization as terrorist organization including ban including ban Pegasus is unique spyware that can access every aspect of your phone it can take control of your camera your microphone and broadcast it to those controlling the software they can see your location access your data and see what's on your screen including encrypted messaging apps is there anything you feel like you can do or do you ultimately feel like there's not much you can practically do it was explained to me by a citizen lab that once a state actor goes after any citizen or small organization there's basically very little they can do Pegasus is produced by Israeli surveillance company NSO and is marketed to government agencies as a tool for fighting crime and terrorism in 2021 an investigation revealed that around 50,000 people worldwide potentially had it on their phones and a large number of them were journalists lawyers dissidents and human rights Defenders 1 2 34 we don't want your cyber War it's no accident that this spyware was developed in is much of nso's staff is drawn from the Army's cyber intelligence unit [Music] 88,200 this unit is tasked with Gathering intelligence from electronic communications and conducting cyber warfare against Palestinians it's known for being highly Innovative and spinning out successful cyber security companies like NSO to find out how 88,200 has helped Israel become a global leader in surveillance technology I'm meeting Yakov Perry a former director of the shined intelligence agency this one here was you dressed as an Arab in Gaza when do you think that was 88 1988 can you say what you were doing no okay that's um 68 yeah okay in ness okay so the first year after six day occupation yeah yeah here we have all kinds of of way to smuggle hangers what hangers also with explosives how has Israel sold itself really for decades now as a global leader in defense and homeland security equipment you cannot defend yourself only by a human uh sources you have to use also a technology in order to be on the uh pinning side Israel had to be very very very creative to find solutions that um you cannot buy in the market or the um around the world one of the innovators is unit 8200 it's been around for many years talk a little bit about based on your experience what that unit is we have developed a unique technology how to where to tape whom be be raped and the ability to reach to top secrets that usually are hidden we say that if a ruler wants to H do something it's is in his mind but he cannot do it alone he has to share it with at least one two three or four people who are close to him and we have developed Technologies that can reach the right persons that we will tap and know so 88,200 became a one of the secrets of Israeli intelligence I'm not asking you to reveal top secret intelligence but give a sense what are the kind of methods that Israel was using to try to get that intelligence if you want to follow a certain terrorist or a certain cell you have to be equipped with surveillance technology that gives you the advantage to watch him without him sensing you you have to develop ammunition which you can use in a remote control for a long distance so sometimes the you headquarters is in Tel Aviv and the terrorist cell is in Gaza Strip and you want to uh kill somebody you have to be very very accurate you have to be with a the best technology that you will not be accused by killing innocent people we are getting hits send the lanus Israel is a leader in remote control bombing with small drones like the controversial lanus systems presents lanus SE an attack in one new Innovative autonomous lethal solution they're part of the class of small highly maneuverable quadcopters getting extensive use for the first time in Gaza the high budget promo suggests it may have been battle tested in Palestine and the Drone is exactly what Perry is describing andity in a complex Urban environment a remote controlled explosive that can be put next to the Target Israel is now about the ninth or 10th biggest arms seller in the world it depends every year how does Israel become for a relatively small country one of the biggest arms sellers in the world yeah it's true that Israel is one of the biggest AR arms sellers we have been also selling a um all the technology that can help you to deal with terrorists I mean the whole world is dealing with terrorist activity so the market is big I would say that 80% of the technology that we have developed in Israel is not top secret it's something that you can share with other ER organizations mainly H security agencies and armies H for instance the most most common technology that we have developed here is the Iron Dome and now we can sell iron do to the whole world with a wave of its innovative wand Raphael has developed a first of its kind counter rocket artillery mortar cram system with pinpoint accuracy interceptors against asymmetric threats Iron Dome the Iron Dome is often used to refer to all of these Israel's anti-missile interception systems together they make Israel a world leader in anti-missile protection and are a showcase for Israel's weapons companies who are Keen to promote how Cutting Edge and Innovative they are aro3 the ARA system counters high altitude ballistic missiles and is made by Israel Aerospace Industries II also makes the cafir jet Heron drones and its own Jericho ballistic missiles they claim to offer comprehensive Solutions in all domains since Russia's invasion of Ukraine II are marketing their interception systems to European countries on us in 400 m exit right to find out more about Israel's military industrial complex I'm going to meet security and intelligence expert Yosi Melman Israel from the outset decid decided we have to build our own uh strong military industrial complex that realization has been always in the mind of Israel we have to be uh on top of our enemies from the scientific technological point of view Israel's been developing a range of new technologies and weapons certain kind of Robotics certain kinds of drones quadcopters explain a bit about what you understand is being used there has been a major shift in the focus of the Israeli Industries if 30 40 years ago Israel industries were still selling rifles pistols ammunition nowadays they have moved to more advanced technological equipment the logic is very positive to try to minimize Israel's own casualties it's safer to first move into the tunnels with a robot rather than sending your foood soldiers a formation of autonomous aerial and ground systems can provide unprecedented ISR capabilities to units on the Tactical Edge from 3D Legion X is the integrated combat system for controlling autonomous robotic vehicles and drones all made by Elbert Israel's largest private weapons producer Andy Legion is maximizing now worth nearly 10 billion Elbert promotes itself as leading the world in Automation and Robotics and this technical Mastery is key to how Israel has governed Gaza Israel directly occupied Gaza from 1967 to 2005 when the Israeli Army and settlers withdrew but Israel retained de facto control over the fundamentals of the territory Power Water who could enter and leave how far fishermen could go from the shore and even how many calories people have to eat eat every day the depth of this control was constantly updated with technology in 2021 defense minister Benny gance launched a smart fence stuffed with the latest tech including tunnel detection equipment in 2021 Israel unveiled a huge amount of new technology around Gaza theyd spent billions of dollars they claimed that it was going to keep Israel safe was going to keep Palestinians essentially in Gaza what exactly was being put in place around that time well all sorts of equipment Israel surrounded Gaza with all these Technologies facial recognition hacking telephones visual intelligence from drones reconnaissance flights reconnaissance balloons Israel had the phone numbers of many Hamas members and not only Kamas members also innocent people that information came from bugging and listening and Observatory equipment so so Gaza was surrounded by the equipment and Israel believed that they can control the population and they control above all Hamas the domestic security service shinb and the military intelligence mistake they almost adored worshiped technology but on October the 7th 2023 as part of a highly coordinated offensive hummus drones attacked the watchtowers disabling the CCTV and automated guns with few soldiers on the border the Army claims they were effectively blun to what unfolded Hamas Fighters quickly overran multiple bases which were sparsely manned and not prepared it is said that thousands of hamus Fighters and other Palestinians broke out of Gaza by land sea and air it was the most deadly single day in Israel's history Israel claims that 1,200 people were killed nearly 800 of them civilians and most of them Israeli and that another 250 were taken back to Gaza as hostages according to Hamas and international organizations these numbers have been inflated hamas's attack begs the question of how this multi-billion dollar smart fence armed with radar CCTV and surveillance drones could miss an assault that took years to plan and rehearse so I'm on my way to see Israel Z who's a former Israeli General and he used to actually had the Gaza command for the Israeli Army and o on October 7 he grabbed a gun from his home near Tel Aviv and went down to near the Gaza border to try to as he says kill Hamas terrorists and rescue hostages so let's go see him explain what happened to you on October 7th I've learned that I'm still good even with the pistol I had a chance to to to rescue quite a few people you know some of them were hiding in the area that theas control what do you think as far as we know went horribly wrong everything it's the system collaps I think Israel took one step too far rely in too much on technology which in area like Gaza was very convenient to put all those visual toys you know and and it gave the feeling that we are protected but maybe it wasn't the technology that failed we know that IDF soldiers monitoring Gaza reported increased Hamas activity in the months leading up to October the 7th we saw the Maneuvers we saw the preparations we have listened to the plans we have photoed the terrorist coming I know but for sure that in the Israeli Secret Service and the Israeli intelligence Army intelligence service they uh information was there before October 7 before October yes but nobody thought that it's really going to happen everybody thought you know the Kamas would not there maybe they do a terror act but not such an operation the biggest failure starts from the higher level of command which actually refuses to to to believe or or to see it coming despite the supposed failure of the technology to stop the October the 7th attack 2024 is predicted to be the best year yet for Israel's arms industry and while the Israeli Army may have been slow to react on October the 7 they quickly announced their intention to unleash hell on [Music] Gaza what Israel calls the swords of iron War has resulted in unprecedented levels of death and destruction [Music] I've come to one of the few places in Israel where you can see that with your own eyes I'm in the Israeli town of sto and behind me is Gaza we're pretty much as close as we can get all these religious Jewish people who were behind me gathered as the sun is going down many of them actually want to settle Gaza occupy Gaza build settlements in Gaza and and they're treating it almost like a family get together they're are kids they're having fun they're smiling taking photos it's pretty surreal seeing Gaza here and knowing what's happened since October 7 the mass destruction the mass killing it's yeah pretty overwhelming the war has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians and seen more than 80% of gaza's buildings rendered unusable it might look like random destruction but Israel would claim these are all valid targets and they're all generated by the latest Innovation from unit 88,200 a new system powered by artificial intelligence I've come to Tel Aviv to meet the investigative team who first r red her AI is being used in Gaza some in the military felt that the systems that existed were not giving them in previous Wars enough targets talk a little bit about what that meant practically in previous war what is called in Israel the target Bank was very swiftly was was empty previously they would produce 200 300 targets a year now they can produce sitting an hour the AI targeting systems are only possible because as we've seen Israel collects data on every aspect of Palestinian life the system called The Gospel also takes in historical and Geographic data to generate infrastructure locations that the AI thinks are probably linked to hamus these include tactical targets like military bases and tunnels but there's another category called Power targets that include residential Towers and Civic buildings like schools and medical centers an alifer hospital they are being hit in order to create a psychological effect on the gazin pushing them to go against Hamas of course this didn't happen the Israeli Army says Al shifer housed the Hamas command and control center the bombing of it resulted in over a thousand people being killed injured or disappeared 25,000 people in the surrounding area were also displaced Israel never provided evidence that it had found the command and control center to identify individual Hamas members unit 88,200 created lavender this analyzes the key Behavior traits of active Hamas oper where they go who they talk to who was in their phone contacts and then looks for anyone in Gaza with similar characteristics what are they talking about what kind of words they're using uh all these kind of things you create a list of possible members of Hamas from the very low level or even people that are not really part of the military ring this is basically basically a death list once you are there you are Lely to meet tet the alel neighborhood known as the backbone of Gaza was hid in December 2023 the Israeli Army said it was because there were Hamas operatives concealing themselves there the entire area was devastated what the AI generates is not facts but targets with a statistically probable link to Hamas despite this the systems have led to another change a rise in the acceptable level of Civilian deaths prior to this war a very senior uh Hamas uh Commander there was a collateral damage of let's say five maximum 10 person in this war it was decided that for very Junior Hamas militant the collateral damage decided was between 15 and 20 his family and his neighbors could be killed in order to kill him and if it's a senior Hamas militant then the numbers over 100 sometimes 300 and we know it happened I wanted to know what someone close to the Israeli military thought about this use of AI it's really kind of a big step you know forward in terms of intelligence and also decision making because it's doing the right selection and and put in front of the decision maker much better and clearer picture in order to take decision we did of course ask former General ziv about claims Israel and its AI systems were perpetrating a genocide in Gaza his response the standard line that the Israeli Army is the most moral in the world so AI became a big factor in in in this whole component of Intel decision making command and control uh of the modern fight storing surveillance on an entire population generates a vast amount of data enter Google on Amazon who have been building cloud services and data farms in Israel since 2021 under a deal called project Nimbus After the War Began the Army's Computing division said they were collecting so much data that to move some of it onto the civilian Cloud A200 is using a cloud service by Amazon to storage huge amount of information about people in Gaza and that the This Cloud was used at least to help some of the attacks I've been looking at how Israel's Army and Tech sector benefit from conflict in Palestine but could it also be true of other countries and multinationals to find out more I met with Paul bigar the founder of a billion dooll tech company Google's motto used to be don't be evil and it seems like a lot of these big tech companies Amazon Google and others have no issue with working with Israel in fact they're often expanding their contracts do they not care about the reputational damage fundamentally they're about making money getting that cloud Revenue um you may have started as a $600 million contract but it is uh expanding massively over the years so we are talking uh at the stage where uh where they may be getting billions and possibly tens of billions of dollars from Israel via project Nimbus they're also setting themselves up as the de facto people to talk to when your government needs to uh needs to scale so there's a lot more governments that are a lot larger than uh than Israel and Google wants to be first in line for those contracts and more importantly they've realized there aren't any reputational consequences for what it does so it's not just Israel that uses the Palestinians to test their products on it's actually the whole world and there's no greater arena for testing weapons than a live War the iron sting is a guided mortar marketed as a Precision weapon the iron sting is so precise that it can even hit a specific room without causing damage to other rooms in the same building this is its first use in [Music] battle and looks like it might have damaged more than one room at least two Israeli companies have made drones stable enough to handle gunfire this is elbert's bird of prey seen here accompanying an armored bulldozzer into battle eyewitnesses in Gaza say these drones with guns are proving terrifying and deadly arms experts have told us the last moment of the life of Hamas leader Yaya sinoa were likely filmed on one of these drones his final Act to throw a stick at it talk about some of those things in Gaza that Israel has been doing militarily since October 7 and why you think that might be appealing to other nations everybody knows that that you know Israel is very advanced in in their technology but definitely after such a such a war in Gaza when when people see the demonstration in real life and it's working uh it creates uh you know the needs and the understanding how crucial those things are and and how critical for others to to hold it and to have it now Israel has physical access to Gaza they're rolling out many of the surveillance techniques used in the West Bank unit 88,200 is giving soldiers and drones AI enabled surveillance technology to search for anyone linked to Hamas or other rebel groups the system relies on technology from corite an Israeli video Analysis company and the Israeli Army is also using Google photos which can identify people from just a fraction of their face we are basically speaking about about a system where the government where the private sector producing and exporting the facial recognition technique they test those Technologies in Palestine in the occupied Palestinian territory so occupying people is profitable because it's not only you take the resources of the land now we are speaking about digital occupation where also your data is a new resource to develop a new technologies and to start selling that worldwide to profit from oppressing other people but perhaps the most advanced and gamechanging weapon being used in the Gaza war is the targeting of human beings by artificial intelligence so do you think that tools like lavender the gospel there's a decent chance of Israel could potentially be selling those tools to other militaries I think it's a very fair possibility that Israel will will sell it and this is I think one of the reasons they allowed our story to be published just explain a bit what you mean by that H you have to file any report that relates to the military the military censorship and they can allow disallow I suspect there were people in Israel who wanted the world to know that they have very very sophisticated AI surveillance methods that can collect and kill being here again I've seen how physical barriers and high technology divide this land in a way many human rights organizations call apartheid I've seen how this has allowed Israel to create World leading surveillance and arms Industries who export their products globally in the next episode I'm heading off to some of Israel's top customers I'll be asking if Israel is just selling its technology or if they're also exporting something else the ideology behind the occupation of Palestine

          <attvalue for="7" value="panic chaos a young girl tries desperately to shake her brother back to life an Israeli drone has just struck a busy street in Gaza City israel insists it only targets Hamas but so many it kills the civilians when grief is so raw how do you put it in words can I get rid of it may God take revenge on you this woman screams her child one of more than 54,000 victims of Israel's assault death is constant in Gaza but that doesn't make it any easier to bear for everyone here Israel is guilty of genocide but some direct their anger at Hamas too may God punish you this distraught man says of one Hamas leader i pray you are killed too back at the scene of the attack a man is collecting pieces of human flesh in a plastic bag all he can do to give the victims a dignified burial this part of Gaza City is crammed with families who've been forced to flee from elsewhere since breaking the ceasefire in March the Israeli military has displaced more than 600,000 Palestinians un data shows that 82% of the Gaza Strip is now a declared militarized zone or under evacuation orders the entire population is somehow meant to live in less than a fifth of the territory that's supposedly safer israeli officials have suggested their aim now is to push Gazans towards the south where three of the new Israeli backed aid distribution sites have been built this afternoon the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation resumed operations after multiple instances of desperate Palestinians being shot trying to reach their site today's distribution passed off peacefully but the scheme has been widely criticized by the UN major charities and those forced to scrabble for something anything to feed their families we almost died in there we almost died all this to get some food for our children this is all I could get a bit of flour a bit of lentils and two packs of pasta working alongside Israeli forces under this new aid distribution scheme a new armed militia led by an alleged former Gazen criminal Yasa Abu Shabbab has previously been accused of running a looting gang from inside Israeli military controlled territory now his men are openly working with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation he denies wrongdoing and insists he's helping his people today after a political rival accused the Israeli prime minister of arming Abu Shabbab Benjamin Netanyahu released this video admitting to supporting clans in Gaza to rival Hamas all the time Israel's bombing campaign continues targeted this morning a group of journalists in a hospital courtyard their colleagues reporting on their deaths as they mourn the Israeli army said it had killed a member of the militant group Islamic [Music] Jihad but the three victims were all known to have worked in the media prior to the war yet more families torn apart by suffering which shows no sign of ending well joining me now the former Israeli Prime Minister Ehood Almouth and first of all your reaction to this revelation that Benjamin Netanyahu has been supporting a rival militia to Hamas jihadist Israel hating and potentially arming them i don't know what to say in as long as this militia is uh helpful in distributing the uh needs of the population in an effective way in cooperation with the Israelis maybe this is a positive step but I I'm not familiar with the facts to be able to judge it from a distance again I think that it is incumbent upon Israel to make sure that all the humanitarian needs of the population are provided in an effective manner this is very important this is our moral obligation how to do it it's not simple and as you can see I mean in this chaos which is part of Gaza today and as long as the military operations continue it's probably very complic so if the this militia is helpful in providing the needs and actually effectively providing the needs then maybe this is one way of coping with this difficulty now you have argued that Benjamin Netanyahu should now face war crimes charges can you explain why well I'm here using a terminology that I didn't use but yes what I said and I keep on saying is that when a war is uh declared by a majority of Israelis is not a result of any national security interest of the state of Israel when it is obvious and is accepted widely that uh there is not a chance that as a result of these operations we will be able to save the lives of the hostages perhaps on the contrary we may risk them and we may lose them if in this process of a war which is not waged because of national interest but as people say because of the political interest of the prime minister we're losing soldiers we may lose the hostages and quite a few Palestinians not involved are killed this is a crime and now I don't know whether it falls within the legal definitions of a war crime whatever but it doesn't matter it has to stop right now we have to end the war we have to return all the hostages and we have to make the necessary arrangements together with Egypt and Jordan and America and the Emirates and others in order to establish a new government in Gaza that will take over from Hamas this is what we need to do instead of continuing an unnecessary war kama and Emanuel Macron have both said they are considering further sanctions against members of the Israeli government would you support that well you don't want me to give equivalence on something that I'm not familiar with i can say this if uh um Benvir and Smriidge these two outspoken extremist messianic uh fundamentalist uh supporters of terror ministers senior cabinet ministers in Israeli government will continue to be representatives of the spirit of this government that I will not be surprised if uh friendly countries and I consider President Mcron to be a friend of state of Israel i know him i know what he thinks i know that he is committed to the uh best interest of the state of Israel not of the government of Israel but if he will decide to take measures against the specific individuals because of what they say and what they do I will not be surprised ahood Alma thank you very much indeed for joining us well earlier today the Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson Orurin Marmstein offered an interview it was on the basis that our agreation of four minutes couldn't be edited more people have been killed today in Israeli air strikes the British prime minister has described what's going on in Gaza as appalling and intolerable and is considering further sanctions the French are also considering sanctions what's your response hi Christian it's good to be on the show first I want to share with you some of the sentiment in Israel it's a very emotional day in Israel two of our hostages were are back they are back in a military operation they are dead this is Gadi and Judy 73 years old and 70 year old those are two cup two people grandpa and grandmother went for a morning walk and they were slaughtered and I I will ask you about this but I'd be grateful if you question i will answer i will answer i just want to share with you something that I heard before coming to this show this is the last phone call of Judy crying calling the emergency in a line saying &quot;My husband is just been shot i've been shot my h my husband brain is spilled o over come and help me.&quot; Unfortunately no one helped her she was slaughtered gadi was slaughtered and 56 more hostages are still in the hell nightmare called Hamas we want to see them back and every day that passes by just makes it more urgent to have our hostages released yes but your response to the international condemnation of what you're doing is what we're trying to share the situation as is with international comm community and international organization and the the situation is the following unfortunately kamas is still a threat an immediate threat to the people of Israel we are not in a situation in which we cannot vouch that we won't have another October 7 and this is why this war is still going on so you carry on i mean you the former defense minister Avdor Lieberman has said that Israel has been supplying weapons to a jihadist rival militia uh operating in Gaza under areas of Israeli control how is that happening so first I think the one making those statements needs to be asked but it hasn't been denied by the prime minister's office i think what the prime minister office published is that Israel is doing everything possible to fight Hamas including arming other militia i don't think they had it in in their statement so I think this is the the word are you not denying it no I'm I'm saying that we are doing everything possible to fight this evil what kind of person killed a 70-year-old grandma in her morning walk what kind of person takes Ariel and Kir Bibbas two babies and kidnap him if you can explain this to me which kind of what kind of of cause justify taking babies as hostages I I would be astonished and it's the lesson of what has happened in bringing back these two bodies that armed conflict is the way to get the hostages back because many of the hostage families fear that more of those who are still alive will be killed if this war carries on i think first we should listen and respect the hostages families i would say almost in a sacred way they are going through living hell i can't imagine having my my daughter my my my mother in captivity in Kamas but the war carries on because we're very tight for time i can't imagine so we we should listen to them but on the same time we should also judge what what proved to be very effective it's the combination of military operation and diplomatic means and if you allow me I can explain about the diplomatic means i'm afraid our time is up uh so Orura Masne thank you very much thank you thank you" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="this is day 66 in the Kamas Israel war and the IDF has completed its takeover of Palestine Square in the Gaza Strip I'm Pinto reporting to you from Israel the IDF spokesperson's unit announced that AIA forces have completed the Takeover of Palestine Square in the Gaza Strip This Square includes governmental buildings of Hamas and a vast underground tear tunnel that reached all the way to the shifa medical center the IDF is focusing its attention in the southern part of the Gaza Strip in the area of kadel bad and kanun and the Israeli Air Force is investing efforts to locate and Target Hamas terrorists and installations in these areas it appears as if these locations have a strategic value for Hamas because its terrorists are fighting hard against these ready troops in and trying to hold their grounds after 24 hours of intense fightings the IDF was able to knock down a main communication route of Hamas this caused hamas's terrorists to give up on multiple locations and surrender to the Israeli troops it appears as if Hamas is concerned about the morale of its terrorists in the Gaza Strip because it sees so many of them surrendering to Israel and for the first time since the 23rd of November Abu abeda a Hamas official issued the statement praising the Hamas Organization for its military achievements against the IDF in the past 65 days since the war started he also stated that Israel failed in its attempts to release the Israeli hostages and failed in the ceasefire he made it clear that this statement was made in recent Days by stating the day of the war and mentioning the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas this is another lie that Hamas is telling this time to its own terrorists it's a pathetic attempt to twart the reality on the ground Israel is controlling the majority of the northern part of Gaza and more and more Hamas terrorists are surrendering every day the remaining terrorists are hiding in underground Terror complex without any ability to connect to the outside world and this is the future for the southern part of Gaza and for Hamas there the fighting against Hamas terrorists in Bia which is another huge Terr Hub of this organization is close to an end as Hamas terrorists are running out of ammunitions and weapons and many of them are surrendering but the IDF still is on high alert because Hamas terrorists can still pop out of underground Terror locations and hiding positions in the neighborhood of Kube south of Gaza the YF is engaged in Fierce battles against Hamas terrorists that are fresh because the IDF has not conducted operations in that area until now the IDF has been working hard in dividing the Gaza Strip into strips of land separating the terrorists from each other after the IDF is defeating Hamas in one area it is mobilizing his troops to carry out an attack against Hamas terrorists in another location that's why in the battle against the area of jabalia the IDF was able to bring additional forces from the area of beia in order to conduct a joint operation to neutralize Hamas terrorist s in that location as Hamas is withdrawing its forces from areas it cannot hold anymore it is always encountered by other IDF units in jabalia Hamas terrorists retre and were quickly engaged by Tank units from the coast of Gaza the IDF is stationed throughout the entire Gaza Strip and any attempt by Hamas terrorists to escape to the South is met by additional AA forces in the southern part of Gaza according to reports thousands of hamash terrorists are still hiding underground in underground Terror positions and pop out in order to carry out attacks against the IDF troops the battle in the south is going to be hard and it already is Taking Lives on the Israeli sides as more and more IDF troops are losing their lives in this war against Hamas and the majority of them are between the ages of 18 to 21 but the IDF is not giving up and their sacrifice is not for vain because we are not stopping until we will destroy Hamas and return our hostages in Israel's northern border in the battle against kisala the Israeli Air Force according to reports conducted aerial strikes that targeted kisala positions in Syria the Syrian defense Ministry stated that its aerial defense systems were able to neutralize the attacks but that severe damage was caused to the infrastructure the report further stated that the strikes targeted kisala and Iranian militias that were located next to the Damascus International Airport in Syria according to Lebanese reports unifil delivered a message on behalf of Israel to kisala stating that Israel sees any Target 3 kilometers from its border with Lebanon as a legitimate Target kisala responded by stating that if Israel will implement this new directive kisala will do the same on the Israeli side the situation on Israel's Northern front is very fragile and kisala and the IDF are on high alert because it appears as if both sides do not want to escalate into a fullon war but any wrong move can lead to another escalation the IDF spokesperson's unit released a recording of Yu elmi hamas's Communications minister in the Gaza Strip during his investigation in Israel he stated that Hamas is destroying the Gaza Strip and taking it back 200 years he also said that the people in Hamas are crazy and that they are following y Yousef stated that people in the Gaza Strip do not like y sin and that Hamas is responsible for the destruction of 60% of the infrastructure and buildings in the Gaza Strip when asked about Yas War hamas's leader he stated that nobody in Gaza likes him and that he only likes himself and takes actions without consulting with anyone Hamas is a terror organization that does not care about the well-being of its own people or the future of the Gaza Strip This is the truth I know that if you're not here in Israel it's very hard to understand the reality mainly because the international media is not telling the truth about what's going on and does not share a full picture and that's why I need your help I need your help in Sharing what is happening in Israel and if you have questions please research ask people I'm not afraid of the truth because I know that I am fighting a righteous war against the terror organization and I stand by the Army and the values that I grew up on in Israel so please join me in prayer and happy hanuka from Island" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] at this point in time all of you at least most of you have heard the statement Gaza is the biggest open prison in the world so today we're going deep into that story the story of the Gaza Strip its history its people its borders and who benefits from you thinking that it's the biggest prison in the world the Gaza Strip is a small piece of land on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea a borders Egypt on the Southwest and Israel on the East and the north people have lived in Gaza for Millennia but for for today's purposes were focusing on the history starting in 1947 in 1947 the entire land is inhabited both by Arabs and Jews and controlled by the British Empire it's already riddled with violence fueled by competing National aspirations then the UN proposes the partition plan a two-state solution with Jerusalem as its International City the Palestinians were to receive the Western Galilee the Samarian Highlands and the coastal plains south of jof including the Gaza Strip Jewish leaders accepted this plan reluctantly of course and the Palestinians along with the Arab countries around them opposed any partition leading to a Jewish State igniting the 1948 War following Egypt into war were Iraq Jordan that back then was known as trans Jordan Lebanon and Syria the Egyptians attack from within Egypt and this is important to note from Egypt they washed through the Gaza Strip and then up the coastal plains toward Wards Tel Aviv and with much effort this wasn't at all an easy battle the young state of the time pushes them back to the Gaza Strip establishing that first sliver as we know it today at the end of the war Gaza was occupied by Egypt what's interesting is they never annexed the Gaza Strip it forever remained even under Egyptian control an area controlled by military governance but not fully citizens or people with full rights Egypt maintained control over for Gaza for 19 years and in that 19-year period it's not like everything is peaceful in the Gaza Strip there's a ton of refugees that have sort of come in the Gaza Strip there's a lot of violence and they're under military control but not only that there wasn't no fence back then so those communities in the Gaza Strip continuously throughout the period go out and murder Jewish communities that border them in 1967 the 19-year control of the Egyptians in the Gaza Strip ends with a Six-Day War what was that war a quick reminder it's this incredibly Swift six day battle where Israel quadruples its landmass in a strategic attempt to push hostile forces further away from its borders and to gain some strategic depth this is when Gaza first came under Israeli control over the years tension between Gaza and Israel continued to rise but in 1993 things seemed like they could change for the best with the start of the Oslo Accords finally the time is approaching when there will be safety in Israel's house when the Palestinian people will write their own destiny so sidebar what are the Oslo Accords the Oslo Accords were a series of agreements starting in the early '90s that were supposed to gradually bring together the Israelis on the one side the Palestinians on the other side with the ultimate goal of having two states one Jewish State called Israel one Palestinian State called Palestine the Gaza Strip was part of that agreement the first Sao Accords is basically this general statement of we accept your existence as a people which sounds basic to us today but back then there was a lot the next set of Accords was 1995 and they go way farther into detail of where the borders are going to be what the future Palestinian state is going to look like and again all of this encompasses also the Gaza Strip at the same time as Israel government and the Palestinian leadership are negotiating there are extremists on both sides who are strongly opposed to these Accords in Israel an extremist murders are then prime minister isin in the Palestinian side you have the Hamas and the Islamic Jihad Palestinian terrorist organizations who do everything they can to stop the Accords and what does everything they can mean it means they're murdering Israeli civilians in the streets of our country in 2000 we have this big attempt to jump start the oso Accords in which the US of course the Israelis and the Palestinians come together in Camp David in the US to try and rekindle this ongoing discussion UD Bak is our prime minister at the time he shows up with whatever mandate he had from the government and Y Al Palestinian leader shows up and for whatever reason he can't or will not move on with the Accords if you look at the big picture timeline of history that last Camp David meeting is sort of the last ditch attempt attempt to restart the oso Accords after that we really never have an effective one in fact the Palestinians start what we now call the second intifada in late 2000 which is a 5year ongoing terrorist attack on the heart of Israel it was suicide bombers blowing up on buses in cafes in malls across Israel that is the reality I grew up to as a teenager the Palestinians did everything they could to sabotage the peace Accords and on the Israeli side our population strongly lost faith that there's a chance to really reach meaningful peace of the Palestinians many years down the line we find out that arafat's second in that was marketed as this Grassroots movement wasn't as spontaneous as it was pegged to be in fact it was meticulously planned by the PLO by the Palestinian Authority to sabotage the peace with Israel so how is all of this related to the god of strip and today's topic let's go back to the Gaza Strip so from the 9s through the early 2000s Gaza has a mix of Palestinian cities which are the vast majority of the population in Israeli communities that are spread out on the coast on the Eastern side and in the north of the Gaza STP in the absence of Peace negotiations with the Palestinians and in response to the ongoing threat of terrorism in 2005 the Israeli government led by Ariel Shon does something that no one has ever done in history we decided to pull out of the Gaza Strip with no agreement with no preconditions with nothing just with a point to stop the violence to stop the terrorism every Israeli Citizen and Soldier are pulled out of the Gaza Strip till the last one it's important to know that this was not easy for the Israeli people in fact till this day the 2005 disengagement from the Gaza Strip is considered to be one of the most divisive events in Israeli history till this day people talk back to that event as one of the causes for our current political conflict no more Israelis inside the strip no Israeli military presence the Israeli Gaza border crossings were to be used only for the passage of goods Aid and individuals with permits from within Gaza into Israel or Goods into Gaza control of the Gaza Egypt border was handed over to Egypt and the expectation was that this move on our end would allow the Palestinian in the Gaza Strip to finally have the peace to have the freedom that they wanted to have the control of their own land and to finally move away from violence so Israel withdraws from the Gaza Strip in 2005 leaves behind the Palestinians who a year later 2006 have national elections the Hamas wins they don't win all the votes but they win enough to overthrow the fat the PLO and they don't do this in the Democratic way they violently and murderously throw them out of the Gaza Strip there have been no other election since in Gaza so the Gaza Strip was now under Hamas control which openly called and still calls for the destruction of the entire state of Israel we continue to give them water we continue to give them electricity we continue to have tens of thousands of Palestinians work inside of Israel and the violence continues from the Gaza STP again and again and again the Israeli Gaza border has been the crossing point of numerous terrorist attacks abusing Israel's permits coming into the country to kill soldiers and civilians alike and the communities along the Israeli side of the Border have become so accustomed to the rocket attacks from the Gaz inside that everywhere you look you'll see bomb shelters with a hostile entity along its border Israel resorted to tightening the Border points between Israel and Gaza saying if you want open passage at least recognize our country's right to exist since 2006 that has not not yet happened I think if there was anyone who had any doubts about how much of a necessity having a strong border with the Gaza Strip is those doubts disappeared on October 7th with a vicious attack of the Hamas against the innocent civilians of Israel there's this claim that's constantly made that Israel is the one that controls all the entry and exit of the Gaza Strip but that's of course not true Israel controls the Eastern side and the northern side bordering with Israel but they have a whole big border that borders with the Egyptians and that border is controlled by the Egyptians since 2005 so who benefits the misleading statement that Gaza is a prison controlled by Israel there are ulterior motives at play here Hamas are a terrorist group that is part of Iran's Network it's Iran fighting through Hamas attacking Israel the biggest victims of the Hamas actions and the Iranian government behind them are the Palestinian people living in the Gaza Strip if you've seen any of the footage coming out of the Gaza Strip lately it's impossible not to feel empathy and compassion for the people of that strip the Hamas took the water pipes that were donated and they used it for Rockets they took the fertilizer meant for building the land and used it for explosives they took the construction materials continuously brought in to build tunnels to attack Israel because the Hamas policy has been destructive and devastating to the people of the Gaza Strip that is the reality of what's happening on the ground so where does this all leave us what do we do with all this information we have to understand how important it is to have a strong border between Israel and the Hamas in the Gaza STP the people of Gaza deserve a peaceful life they deserve Prosperity they deserve quiet as do the people of Israel and with Hamas control of the Gaza Strip that's simply never going to happen if Gaza is a prison then Hamas are the prison guards" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] hi everyone welcome to the 700 Club israel has taken a historic step to protect itself from future terrorist attacks and prevent the creation of a Palestinian state right on its borders hamas has reportedly rejected the latest ceasefire offer from the United States that allows Israel to continue to expand its military offensive in Gaza chris Mitchell brings us the story from Jerusalem israeli troops push further into northern Gaza warning civilians to get out of harm's way us Envoy Steve Witkov's ceasefire and hostage deal would reportedly lead to Hamas freeing 10 of the remaining living hostages in the first week of the 60-day ceasefire in exchange Israel would free more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners a major sticking point hamas wants guarantees israel won't return to fighting after the ceasefire but Israel's prime minister says he wants the fighting to resume and continue until Hamas is eliminated in Gaza meanwhile the Israeli government has made an historic decision to approve 22 new communities in the biblical heartland of the Jewish nation Judea and Samaria also known as the West Bank this will help block Palestinians from forming a state in this area and according to Defense Minister Israel Katz it also provides a buffer for the nation security as he put it Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria serves as a vital security barrier for Israel's major population centers we must do everything in our power to expand and reinforce this protective shield it was the first volley in the government's effort to head off another unilateral move for a Palestinian state by some Western powers including France next month France's president at a summit in New York City will push for most of the world to altogether recognize a Palestinian state israeli foreign minister Gedon Sar warned that such a declaration would reward the Hamas terrorists who committed the October 7th atrocities he added &quot;Unilateral moves against Israel will be met with unilateral Israeli measures we will not get any dictates from outside with regard to our national security.&quot; This fits with the foreign minister's statements this week that if outside nations push to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state in Judea and Samaria Israel will respond by declaring sovereignty over more and more of the area all right Chris Mitchell joins us now from Jerusalem a lot to talk about chris how does Israel approving these new settlements help block the creation of a Palestinian state well one of the main things is this uh Andrew it actually creates facts on the ground it it strengthens Israel's claim to the land and what will happen is that more Israelis will be moving and living in Judea and Samaria uh and it would make the withdrawal that happened 20 years ago uh unlikely what happened 20 years ago Andrew is uh what's called the Gaza disengagement uh Israel unilaterally pulled out of Gaza and five communities in northern Samaria that was uh that was as we see right now we see the effects of what happened uh Gaza became one of the biggest terror bases in all of the world and so this is designed to help prevent a Palestinian uh state it's really a strategic shift really historic move uh Andrew away from a two-state solution and the next step as we mentioned in that report maybe declaring sovereignty over Judea and Samaria so what are Israel's biggest concerns about a potential Palestinian state well one of the main concerns Andrew is security and they looked at what happened after the disengagement in 2007 as I mentioned what Gaza became the biggest terror base in the world and then we had tens of thousands of rockets since then and then of obviously what happened on October 7th a Palestinian state would be in the heart of Israel and it would be close to Tel Aviv the Bengorian airport and Jerusalem and people are concerned it could be another terror base uh we also see a terror hub so to speak in places like Nabis and Janine and we also see that after October 7th many of the Palestinians in Judea and Samaria they actually supported October 7th and they believe that if you look at places like Palestinian Media Watch which monitors Palestinian media uh there's really anti-Semitic anti-Israel uh anti-Jewish propaganda almost every day so this marks uh no more uh going back to the Oslo style negotiations and a belief for many that this is really the land promised in the Bible to the Jewish people all right Chris let's talk about the war in Gaza there's a new way to distribute humanitarian aid to the Palestinians there what impact does that have on Hamas well it's a major impact Andrew and actually this is a dramatic uh development and what it does is it bypasses the ability for Hamas to steal the humanitarian aid uh and feed their own terrorists and then actually they often sell it back to the population and they've been doing this since the beginning of the war so what this new humanitarian effort which is called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation it really undermines Hamas's control over the population hamas is warning the people no don't go to these areas and get the humanitarian aid but many are ignoring Hamas uh and so Hamas wants to stop in any negotiations wants to stop this because it really represents a threat to their control uh and to their authority and weakens them dramatically all right Chris while I have you let's talk about another layer in all this there ongoing reports of worries in Israel about a possible Trump administration nuclear deal with Iran what are those concerns Israel has well here uh over here Andrea they don't trust Iran uh Iran violated the uh 2015 JCPOA that was an agreement that was designed to limit Iran's nuclear program and uh over here they believe that a bad deal by the US and Iran would allow Iran to continue to enrich uranium and they believe over here that Iran is committed ideologically and theologically to nuclear weapons part of their belief in the return of the Shiite Messiah the Mahi and they believe diplomacy really is not going to stop Iran uh and while this window continues there seem to be going towards a nuclear weapon an existential threat to Israel all right Chris always appreciate your great reporting thanks for being with us today thanks Andrew all right everyone in other news President Trump has won a victory in court on his top tariffs john Jessup has that story and more from our CBN News Bureau in Washington john that is right Andrew a roller coaster legal battle for the White House over the president's major tariffs over the course of just a day first on Wednesday a three judge panel at the US Court of International Trade block the president from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency powers law the panel ruled the president exceeded his authority with his liberation day tariffs the administration quickly appealed then on Thursday a federal appeals court temporarily halted the trade court's order and allowed the president to continue collecting the tariffs under the law for now the case is expected to go to the Supreme Court well turning now to the spiritual world in a time when churches are closing Christian leaders from across Europe met in Berlin at the European Congress on

          <attvalue for="7" value="through all the chaos in the Middle East there is one big unanswered [Music] question how did Israel not see this coming we have breaking news out of Israel this morning where Hamas has launch a surprise attack a surprise attack a surprise attack a surprise attack how did one of the most well-resourced intelligence communities in the world specifically designed to prevent this exact thing from happening failed to detect an operation that involved months of planning meetings in multiple countries and thousands of militants in part two of our series on the Israel Gaza conflict we're looking at Israel's Security operation an operation that's maintained nearly full control over the borders and movement of people in Gaza for a decade that suddenly saw a rag tag bunch of militants flood through literal holes in the wall and threaten Israel in a way it hasn't been threatened before I'm Matt Bon I'm a little bit Husky and this is if you're listen it was October 1973 in London and an Egyptian man named Ashraf marwin called a meeting marwin was well connected he was the son-in-law of the previous Egyptian president and now the top Aid to the new president bit of a nepo baby what is bosses in Egypt didn't know is that he was also a spy marn's meeting was with the head of the Israeli spy agency mad you see Egypt was planning to attack Israel and marwin was giving Israel a warning they had 18 hours before Egypt and Syria would invade but the Israeli were a little bit sick of marwin you see he'd warned mad twice before that war was imminent both times it had been a false alarm thousands of troops had been mobilized for nothing it was a classic boy who cried Invasion scenario and now marwin was telling them that the war was going to kick off again this time on yum kapor the holiest day on the Jewish calendar a massive national holiday in Israel news of the invasion was slow to reach the top levels of the Israel government time was wasted and Israel was not prepared but marwin was right the war's outbreak took the World by surprise Egypt and Syria launched a simultaneous surprise attack Egyptian forces are at present engaged in military operations it caught Israel off guard and led to thousands of casualties the armies of Egypt and Syria are still battling with Israeli troops on the Sinai Peninsula and the Goan Heights it was seen as the biggest intelligence failure in Israeli history that is until exactly 50 years and one day [Music] later Israel's main method of Defending themselves from Hamas is to literally contain them in the Gaza Strip no one goes in and no one goes out without the express permission of the Israeli government to achieve that they've built what they refer to as the obstacle from a distance it looks like a fence but it's so much more than that the fence is 6 M high and under it is a deep underground concrete wall which will be very difficult to Tunnel through but that's not all that bario is not standing alone and it won't stand alone it's part of a cocktail the main ingredients of the cocktail are a concrete wall and two fences but it's the garnishes that are really interesting remote control drones remote operated cameras remote operated gun turrets with AI assisted targeting remote seismographs to detect any digging nearby it's all Wireless with solar panels and battery backups to save it from power outages it can be operated from a central location and doesn't need thousands of troops patrolling up and down the Border it's 65 km long and gives Israel confidence that they can decide who comes to their country and the circumstances in which they come on top of that Israel's installed the high-tech Iron Dome missile defense system which can automatically detect rockets and shoot them out of the sky Israel is very proud of it the military says hundreds of rockets have been intercepted so far and in any case the Israeli government was increasingly convinced that Hamas was less extreme dream now and weren't as much of a threat besides they were trapped behind an impregnable Ultra Hightech border fence and so Hamas slipped down their priority list a long way down with their new sense of security the Israeli government focused on expanding and protecting settlements on the West Bank now it's crucial to understand what a settlement is if you look at the West Bank on a map it looks like a kidney bean but if you look at it properly it's actually more like a piece of Swiss cheese the Palestinians live in the holes the cheese bits are controlled by Israel on nearly every Hilltop around here are Israeli settlements gated communities of Jewish residents in the middle of the land Palestinians want for their future state so pockets of Palestinians surrounded by Israelis this has not yet led to peace and Harmony and so the Israeli security Services have been deployed to keep the peace Israeli soldiers occupy more than 60% of the West Bank there are checkpoints patrols military posts and noo zones throughout the whole area we'd save a heck of a lot of money if we could disand if we could disband the Army it's there to protect us according to international law these Israeli settlements are illegal I believe in the right of the Jews to reestablish our home homes in our villages in areas which were for thousands of years uh part of the Jewish history one of the long-term residents of these settlements is itamar Ben who has been making news for decades as a member of the radical Jewish kak movement branded a terrorist organization by the US government he's been arrested hundreds of times and spent more than 9 months in jail benav is an ultra Nationalist and a violent activist a convicted criminal with a WRA sheet that includes inciting racism and supporting a terrorist organization go home anti his politics are so extreme that he was disqualified from compulsory military service for years he had on his wall a photo of Jewish terrorist Barak Goldin who killed 29 Palestinians and injured more than 100 in 1994 in court he likes representing himself he's done this so often that judges started suggesting that he probably should just go and study law to give himself a better chance once he became a lawyer he specialized in defending Israeli Jews accused of hate crimes and terrorism he was elected to the Israeli parliament in 2021 that didn't stop him from getting out into the streets to to defend the rights of Israeli settlers in October last year he was filmed at the sight of a violent clash between settlers and Palestinians in East Jerusalem as he's pulled away from the scene by police he urges them to shoot Palestinians who throw stones then he reached under his suit jacket and pulled out an actual handgun and started waving it around that's at the time he was a minor party backbencher prone to trolling and don't we all know and love those guys but the following month he got a massive promotion Benjamin Netanyahu desperate for Coalition Partners signed a deal with Ben gavier in exchange for his party support Ben gavier would become the minister for National Security in charge of keeping Israelis safe and protecting them from Hamas but he had other things on his mind Benjamin netanyahu's six term as Israeli Prime Minister has been dominated by right-wing parties in his Coalition that want to Annex the entire West Bank just days into his tenure Ben gav decided it would be a good idea to go and visit the AL AXA mosque at Jerusalem's Temple mount in Israeli politics this is the equivalent of waving a gun around in the street for extremely complicated reasons that go back literally thousands of years is Israeli leaders visiting the mosque tends to make many Muslims extremely angry and has on several occasions in the past led to violence a surprising Unity ticket formed with Hamas the United Nations and the United States government asking benier not to do it Hamas called it provocative the UN and US said it risked inflaming tensions and the Israeli opposition said it risked the nation's security and the safety of its citizens keep in mind Ben is the national security minister the Temple Mount is open for everybody Muslims Christians and yes also Jews we make it clear to Hamas we don't give in we don't surrender we don't blink sure I mean what are they going to do about it right the Israeli government meanwhile ramped up the establishment of settlements in the West Bank benav personally ordered several unauthorized Palestinian homes to be bulldozed to make room for more settlements with that violence increased around the settlements as well according to the United Nations 2022 was the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank since they began recording fatalities in 2005 2022 was bad but 2023 has been worse Ben has expressed little interest in doing anything about this what he's very interested in doing something about is attacks on Settlers the Palestinian gunman shot dead seven people near near a synagogue in a settlement in East Jerusalem except now he's not waving his gun around he's encouraging Israelis to arm themselves I want weapons on the street I want Israeli citizens to be able to protect themselves benav made Law and Order in the West Bank his top priority deploying more troops and police to defend settlers and raid the homes of suspected terrorists it's one of a series of Israeli raids that have killed dozens of Palestinians in the last month alone with the high-tech but lightly manned Gaza border fence Israel's strategy was based on the idea that they would deploy troops there if they were alerted that something was coming picking up warnings was vital so were there any warnings [Music] well 25 days before the attack Hamas released a video of their Fighters training for a massive assault on the border Defence and Israeli Army Camps the video was highquality propaganda of what looked like a very well equipped operation with drones flying around and large groups of well-armed men moving quickly through a training course I've watched the video of this rehearsal and video of the actual attack and they're difficult to tell apart aside from the blood in the real version this is the kind of thing that should have triggered an alarm in Israel I mean Israel has spy agencies surely they would hear or see something concerning and then send troops and guards to the fence to deal with it and yet it seems that the system didn't really work the thought of 2,000 Hamas terrorists overcoming a multi-billion dollar security system I don't think was on anybody's radar screen in terms of possibilities so so the propaganda video from Hamas was warning number one 10 days before the attack came warning number two the Egyptian intelligence agency which is now a friend of Israel called Benjamin netanyahu's office to tell the Prime Minister that Hamas was planning something unusual a terrible operation and yet it seems this was ignored too six days before the attack the Israeli National Security advisor Zaki HBY was confidently telling the Israeli Defense Force radio station that Hamas had pivoted to a position of unprecedented restraint three days before the attack Egypt called to warn Netanyahu again according to Egyptian officials Netanyahu wasn't concerned and was more focused on the West Bank Netanyahu denies that he ever got a call itar benier began planning another another visit to the alaxa mosque when Israeli officials went to bed on the 6th of October exactly 50 years after the Yum kapore War Began they slept soundly with no clue of what was going to happen in the morning it started at 6:30 small drones packed with explosives flew out of Gaza they flew directly to their targets the mobile internet Towers which enabled the entire Gaza border security system to operate and the observation towers with AI targeted machine guns they dropped explosives on the towers taking them out they also dropped explosives on the tanks stationed along the border the billion dooll remote control defenses were offline paragliders took off covered by rocket fire and flew over the fence attacking any troops nearby then then Hamas Fighters charged at the fence with bulldozers explosives motorbikes and trucks they were able to drive right up to it and take it down the fence no matter how many senses at the end of the day it's effectively a metal fence right the militants attacked the headquarters of the Israeli border security operation they killed the soldiers inside many of whom were still in bed for the entire morning they rampaged almost unchallenged across Southern Israel before the Israeli Defense Force was able to arrive and fight back 1500 Hamas Fighters were killed which is an extraordinary number and it's indicative of how big an operation this obviously was from hamas's perspective in the days after the attack Hamas gloated about how successfully they'd fooled Israel they've openly said they wanted to lull Israel into a false sense of security something which appears to have worked perfectly you got to call spade and Spade and this was a massive costly failure and Israel knows that it was a failure almost identical to the 150 years beforehand Hamas has specifically cited increased settler violence and itamar Ben's visits to the alaa mosque as their reasons for the attack which they called operation alaxa flood benav hasn't accepted any responsibility despite the fact that the border of police are his responsibility as the minister of National Security he says now is not the time for investigations but it does seem that his role in this debacle has been noticed he's been excluded from the war cabinet formed by Netanyahu and opposition parties to deal with the current emergency it's worth noting that in 1973 Israel did eventually win the Yon kapore War we'll see if the parallels continue

          <attvalue for="7" value="the IDF's Gideon's Chariots military operation in Gaza is now expanding idf chief Aal Zamir was with the troops in Gaza and said more territory will be captured unless Hamas agrees to release the Israeli hostages tv's Steve Lieuits reports the army says that combined ground and air force operations struck over 100 terror targets in the past 24 hours gazin officials say 19 were killed among the kamas operatives that were killed was the aerial commander for northern Gaza moata Deeb was responsible for planning and directing attacks against Israeli aircraft as well as launching drones that targeted Israeli civilians the army confirmed that Deeb was killed this week in an air strike other targets hit include terror cells a terror compound an observation post and underground facilities used by Palestinian Islamic jihad the Givati Brigade has now joined the fighting beginning a ground operation in Bethlehey idf Chief Aal Zamir was in Gaza where he said that the army will capture more and more territory until Kamas agrees to a hostage and ceasefire deal zamir said that the IDF was aware that a ceasefire could come at any time zamir took aim at those who have made accusations against the IDF conduct of the war amid the fighting the IDF announced that Staff Sergeant Danilo Moano was killed in South Gaza the 20-year-old from Cologne was killed in a building collapse after an explosive device was detonated thank you Steve for that report and Israel says around 93 trucks filled with humanitarian aid including baby food and supplies was brought into the Gaza Strip on Tuesday a significant boost from the five trucks that entered on Monday here's what else you need to know more aid continues to flow into Gaza although the United Nations is saying the aid has not yet been distributed after an 11-week blockade of humanitarian aid into Gaza with Israeli officials saying the aid helped Hamas the resumption of aid was made for diplomatic reasons five trucks entered the Gaza Strip on Monday and 93 trucks entered on Tuesday all which entered through the Karum Shalom crossing an official from the UN said the next step is to collect and distribute the aid through the existing system which uses several international organizations for distribution meanwhile the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation mechanism is set to open later this month for months testimony from Gazins has revealed Hamas steals aid and resells it at an extremely high value making it almost impossible to buy former Israeli officials tell ILV they worry there's no mechanism in place to prevent Hamas from stealing aid again the UN said on Tuesday they have not been able to secure the arrival of supplies into their warehouses and delivery points in Gaza the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Aid spokesperson said insufficient supplies is at a greater risk of being looted but does not mention Kamas's past involvement in stealing aid although the spokesperson did tell reporters looted products end up being sold at exorbitant prices on the black market and the US and Israel are reportedly facing differences in policy relating to both the Gaza war and a potential Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities iltv's Devo Klein has the latest cnn is reporting US officials saying that Israel is preparing for a possible strike on Iranian nuclear facilities on its own even as the Trump administration has been pursuing a diplomatic deal with Thran the official told CNN that such a strike would be a brazen break with Trump and could risk tipping off a broader regional conflict in the Middle East cnn said that new intelligence obtained by US suggests Israel is preparing to strike Iranian nuclear facilities it was not clear whether Israeli leaders had made a final decision and there was disagreement inside the Trump administration about whether Israel would ultimately decide to carry out the attack turning to Gaza where according to Axios US President Donald Trump is feeling quote frustrated by the ongoing war in Gaza and feels that ending the conflict is needed in order to bring prosperity to the Middle East a Trump administration official told Axios that the US pressured Israel to open the crossing for humanitarian aid after assistance had been blocked since early March and was reportedly upset by images of suffering children and babies axios reported an Israeli official responding that Prime Minister Netanyahu does not feel pressured on the matter by Trump the official went on to say that if the president wants a hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza he needs to put more pressure on Hamas thank you Devo for that report and as Netanyahu presses forward with an increased ground offensive inside of the Gaza Strip reports suggest Trump is frustrated with the war and wants Israel to wrap it up joining us now to discuss is former Israeli ambassador Yuram Edinger who served as congressional affairs liaison in the Israeli embassy in Washington and is a leading expert on USIsrael relations and the Middle East thanks so much for joining us today thank you it's my privilege so it seems as if the tone did a 180 degree flip after Trump visited these Arab countries last week when it comes to the war in Gaza what is making Trump so frustrated right now well I I suggest not to assess President Trump's position based on his talk uh it's much more important to judge his position in accordance with his walk and the walk has been very very positive on USIsrael relations while Biden withheld essential military systems and ammunition from Israel um President Trump uh provided has provided uh this items uh President Trump also uh did not react negatively uh when Israel uh took care of 11 of Kamas top leaders while he Trump was in the midst of his visit to the Persian Gulf supposedly it could have embarrassed him supposedly it could have undermined his visit but I have no doubt that Trump inside his hotel suite probably told his staffers finally Israel acting just like Trump would uh would do uh at the same time we cannot ignore we cannot ignore uh the worldview of President Trump uh which is not exactly compatible with the Middle East as he assumes that Middle East conflicts such as the conflict with the Houthis and with the Ayatollas and with Hamas uh are very similar to businesslike negotiation and while money talks uh in the west when it comes to business negotiations it's ideology that walks when it comes to the Middle East and negotiation that President Trump is eager to to conduct with the Ayatollas are perceived by him to be a step towards reconciliation but that Ayatollas view it as a step uh which is designed to bolster their capabilities and get ready for another assault on the so-called infidel west the great American Satan and the infidel Jew and last and not least we have seen President Trump being very much impressed with the Syrian leader with the Qatari uh leader and and again we should be very careful uh not to assume that you can approach the Middle East through Western lances the west welcomed uh Humeni back in 1978779 supposedly as a leader who wants human rights for the Iranian uh people uh a leader who is anti-communist and therefore would be very pro- US and we know that uh that leader became the number one epicenter of anti-American war terrorism uh the US also welcomed Bashar Assad in 2000 in a very positive way because Bashar Assad spent few years in Britain he's opthalmologist he was president of the in Syrian internet society married to a very modern Syrian lady educated in the US spoke few foreign languages and we know that he became a butcher a real butcher now Trump may be right about El Golani from Syria but I would suggest that before rushing into suspending economic sanctions and declaring El Golani a potentially peaceful leader I would expect American president to require the president of Syria to uh uproot all hate education in Syria before he uh gets those privileges from the US to uproot hate sermons from the mass to uproot hate uh media from the official uh media and introduced a United Arab Emirat like peaceful conduct once the Syrian does that obviously he deserves to be uh accorded a real generous uh treatment but not before that we have run out of time but thank you so much for your perspective today thank you and now President Donald Trump revealed plans for what he's calling the Golden Dome which he says is a cuttingedge missile defense shield that would protect the United States from foreign attacks similar to the Iron Dome in Israel the selected design comes with a hefty price tag ilv's Devoc Klein has the details at a press conference inside the Oval Office surrounded by space and defense officials President Donald Trump announced he selected a design for the Golden Dome missile defense shield system which he says would protect the United States from foreign attacks once fully constructed the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space and we will have the best system ever built as you know we helped Israel with theirs and it was very successful and now we have technology that's even far advanced from that trump said the system would cost a total of $175 billion and said it will be completed and fully operational by the end of his term calling it a state-of-the-art system trump says it will be utilized across land sea and space and will integrate with existing defense capabilities he says the Golden Dome aims to create a network of satellites to detect track and potentially intercept incoming missiles uh ultimately this right here the Golden Dome for America is game changer it's a generational investment in the security of America and Americans in a blow to bilateral relations with the leading ally the UK has announced a freeze on a trade deal in protest over the growing Israeli offensive in Gaza the government also placed sanctions on Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria itv's Steve Lee Woods has the latest we must coordinate our response because this war has gone on for far too long we cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve and the foreign secretary will come to the house shortly to set out our response in detail after the British prime minister's announcement British foreign secretary David Lammy announced the pause in trade talk the Israeli foreign ministry responded to the announcement of the trade freeze saying this even prior to today's announcement the free trade agreement negotiations were not being advanced at all by the current UK government the agreement would serve the mutual benefit of both countries if due to anti-Israel obsession and domestic political considerations the British government is willing to harm the British economy that is its own prerogative additionally the UK placed sanctions on a number of Israeli individuals and groups in Judea and Samaria who it said had supported incited and promoted violence against Palestinians in the territories the foreign ministry responded saying the sanctions against the settlers in Judea and Samaria are puzzling unjustified and especially regrettable after the recent deadly terror attack the British mandate ended exactly 77 years ago external pressures will not divert Israel from its path in its struggle for its existence and security against enemies working to destroy it israel bonds the heartbeat of solidarity the powerhouse of support when the Israeli Hamas war hit Israel bonds stood tall proving we're more than just an investment we're a lifeline israel bonds pledges to ensure Israel thrives and flourishes investing in Israel bonds isn't just a financial move it's a declaration for resilience strength and a better future for Israel join us and let solidarity echo through generations and the family of hostage Matans and Calker said they received a troubling sign of life from their son after they learned he was held with American former hostage Don Alexander while in captivity according to Israeli media reports new information suggest Zenalkker is struggling to stand on his own and is suffering from severe stomach pain and intestinal problems they described his condition as barely being able to stand mute and starving zincalker suffers from muscular distrophe and experiences muscle tremors and weakness so severe he cannot stand and testimony describes him as refusing to eat or speak and isolating himself as his mental health continues to decline reports say he is believed to be held by senior Hamas terrorists and is and is experiencing a lack of oxygen flea and rat bites and is eating moldy bread and contaminated water his mother told one Israeli outlet the IDF discovered a handwritten note from Zancauer in an underground Hamas compound the note included his full name in Hebrew and English his ID number and text in Arabic his mother confirmed it was his handwriting and speaking of tunnels as reports continue to detail the horrific suffering of Israeli hostages in them an Alazer reporter tooured an underground tunnel with Hamas terrorists in a video released on Tuesday al Jazer reporter Mustafa Sethan was led through a narrow tunnel by Hamas terrorist armed and with their faces covered in the video the reporter was guided with a blindfold on by armed terrorists into the narrow tunnel and is heard saying it was it was difficult for him to breathe they arrive into a small room where you can see the reporter barely being able to stand up completely in the tunnel he interviewed the armed terrorist who told him the tunnels are for quote temporary stay until Israel attacks them however one terrorist did say if Israel expands the fighting they quote will be found throughout the entire Gaza Strip now the terrorists say they had no shortage of weapons and that they're quote preparing ambushes to kill Jews and expel them from our land end quote that was all heard on Alazer and a unique educational movement is taking root in Israel's north and south where fields stretch wide and communities grow resilient the Adamava Adama schools translated as man and woman uh man and land are redefining what it means to uh learning by doing supported by Jewish National Fund USA these schools are cultivating more than just crops they're growing a new generation of young leaders grounded in Zionism sustainability and a deep connection to the land today we are joined by two students um Adho and Shahar Stalber to take you inside the classrooms and green houses where Israel's future is being shaped by one student at a time thank you guys so much for joining us thank you for being here i have seen one of your amazing uh campuses before tell me why you decided to join this program um I can tell about myself that I grew up my grandparents they met in the agricultural school Mikv is they've been together for almost 50 years now and I've always grown about their stories i've always learned about I have always seen their excitement when they're talking about their experiences from waking up in 5:00 a.m to go to work and agriculture or um being in a room with 10 other people always the the light in their eyes when they're speaking about those experiences is always something that brought me so much joy and I always knew that I will go somewhere that is similar like that and I started looking in in 10th grade I started looking for agricultural schools for something that will expand my eyes expand my seeing of the Israeli culture and I came for Danma amazing now you told me you're from Ramatan which is nothing like where the school is located which is in Arava literally right next to Jordan what do you enjoy so much about this program i love I usually I do nothing at home i used to go to school where you work you you don't work you learn from 8:00 a.m to 3:00 a.m to 3:00 p.m and you don't do nothing at all here in this school we wake up at 5:00 a.m we go to work we work in the fields with the farmers and after this we finished something like 11 11 and a half a.m and in 100 p.m we start learning we're doing the whole we're studying till 6:00 a.m and after it we uh have study groups we have dinner and study groups and there I remember both of you told me before we went on set you can't believe how much day you typically wasted before going to this program now you're farming in the mornings tell me uh briefly just one life lesson that you learned from this program and how it might have shaped um how you envision your life in Israel uh like I said you said earlier I'm from Ramadan which is a city and I've never even thought of going to a gap year before the army and doing something meaningful for the country for our people not only like joining the army straight after school doing something that makes the next to the people i never even thought of going to a gap year so now now in this school I thinking of it and I want to do it in my school again i want to be here till like five years not four years of of learning of high school oh it's amazing to see uh how much you you have learned and grown um tell us just how old you guys are um I'm 16 i'm in 11th grade i'm 15 15 15 and uh 10th grade wow and and for anyone out there who's interested just give me a brief sentence of what you would tell them about this program um like what you what your biggest takeaway so far h how much connection we how much the land especially in Israel means for our culture how much without the without the farmers how much without the community that it brings to us i remember David Benuan said where the that agriculture should be a part of the school system it teaches us so much about our life our work ethics it brings so much peace and connects us to nature so much more i think agriculture has so many different aspects big bring so much positivity into our lives and I think I know about myself that it really changed my my aspects a lot of aspects of my in my life we do important things we help the farmers that's something that goes and it last it won't last long if we won't help them and we're doing it and we're happy for it and we chose it thank you both for

          <attvalue for="7" value="Israel has a reputation for freeing hostages it's a reputation they've built up over decades with some extraordinarily daring rescues but this time it's different as Hamas militants rampaged across Southern Israel killing 1,400 people they also captured almost 250 hostages it was a core part of their strategy to give themselves a bargaining chip during the war they started they're bargaining hard demanding around 20 Palestinian prisoners be released in exchange for every hostage despite their reputation Israel seems to be struggling to get the hostages out I'm begging the world to bring my baby back home I'm Matt Bon and this is if you're listening I want to welcome the right honorable Benjamin Netanyahu the prime minister of the state of Israel in Israel there's a famous story there's movies and books about it it's told over and over at special events ladies and gentlemen like this one that Benjamin Netanyahu went to in 2016 this is a deeply moving day for me it's like the Israeli galipoli their watero their Gettysburg we have gathered here to mark an event that inspired the world and lifted the spirits of my people it's the day Israel rescued 100 and two hostages from the heart of Africa International terrorism suffered a stinging defeat and a legend was born the rescue mission proved that good can Prevail over evil that hope can triumph over fear and it's personal for Netanyahu because it's also the day his brother died I learned from my brother and from others that two need things are needed above all to defeat terrorism Clarity and courage he see the late 1960s and early 1970s were big for plane hijackings there was very little security in airports no x-ray machines you could take liquids on the plane nail scissors a gun even a bomb a couple of sticks of dynamite sitting in the seat next to him he told us right from the start that he meant business and he was going to throw us all up usually when someone hijacked a plane they would just trying to get into or out of communist Cuba but the era of high stakes poit iCal hijackings began in 1970 when Palestinian militants took four planes with Israelis on board the hijacking in a single week of four jet airliners by one of the more extreme Guerilla organizations the popular front for the liberation of Palestine one plane was taken to Cairo the other three to a runway in the middle of the Jordanian desert the Palestinians claimed they'd blow up the planes with passengers on board if certain European governments and Israel refused to release Arab Commandos held in their jails after 6 days in the desert heat the terrorist Dems were met and the hostages released though the people were spared the planes were not $24 million reduced to ashes giving into hijackers demands was not something Israel was Keen to turn into a habit so when another Plane full of Israelis was hijacked they decided to do something about it it was 1972 and Palestinian militants had taken control of a plane they landed at Tel Aviv airport and demanded the release of 315 Palestinian prisoners who were being held in Israeli jails after 24 hours of negotiations the Israeli government appeared to give in they told the hijackers they'd concede to their demands and bring the prisoners to the airport and they could use the plane to fly everyone off to Egypt the hijackers were delighted they were so happy they cracked open the plane's emergency doors a little bit to let in a breeze but the Israelis said they'd have to fix the plane before it could take off because the tires were flat because the Israelis had punctured them 16 mechanics in white overalls approached the plane in baggage carts among the mechanics were two future Israeli Prime Ministers ahood Barack and Benjamin Netanyahu sorry to be clear the men weren't actually mechanics they were Special Forces soldiers and in their tool boxes were guns watching from the sidelines was netanyahu's older brother Yoni also a Commando Commander Barack had refused to let both brothers join the operation in case both were killed the mechanics arrived at the plane and I don't know donked the side of it with hammers and spanners a bit before pulling their guns out and ripping open the emergency doors Netanyahu pounced on one of the militants and demanded and did she' tell him where the bomb was there was a scuffle people started shooting Netanyahu was hit in the arm two hijackers and one hostage were killed in a matter of seconds it was all over the hostages were released the story of bib netanyahu's daring rescue mission became famous and a part of his personal mythology but an even more famous and far more dangerous Mission the one spoken on in reverent tones to this day was yet to come and now the big one see 4 years later Israel was put to the test again and it was Yoni netanyahu's turn to go this time the hijacked plane wasn't in Israel it wasn't even in the Middle East we were really at the ends of the Earth we could have been on the moon the Air France plane took off from Tel Aviv and was supposed to land in Paris instead the hijackers diverted the plane midair Cynthia zega and 250 hostages were taken to the old terminal at uganda's International Airport on the shore of lank Victoria if you look at a map you realize that even if you escaped from that building where would you go the plane had been hijacked by Palestinian and German extremists but the hostages were now under the control of someone even scarier they now the virtual hostages of the Ugandan president Ed AR mean yes idam me the brutal dictator of Uganda the world's favorite evil buffoon idaman made no secret of his hatred of Israel but is it true that you said the Hitler didn't kill enough Jews during the war and of his support for the Palestinian C the year before the hijacking Palestinian leader yasa Arafat had served as best man at one of am's weddings when idaman found out about the plane he saw an incredible opportunity to get a bit of international attention he came every day with a television crew with a radio crew the non-israeli passengers were released leaving 103 passengers and crew still in the terminal building there was Terror constantly we were always surrounded by men with guns men with grenades we also were surrounded outside the building by the Ugandan army with heavy arms with Bazookas with machine guns the terrorist demands were the same as last time releasing Palestinian prisoners in Israel the families of the hostages protested outside government officers to demand the trade the Israeli governments understood to be under heavy pressure from Jews with relatives being held in Uganda earlier there had been emotional scenes when some of the relatives marched on the cabinet building to plead for the lives of the hostages Yoni Netanyahu by this stage was a battle hardened and highly decorated soldier a veteran of three Wars and several special ops he was put in charge of a rescue operation that was so insane that the terrorists never imagined it was possible the main problem was to get to the terrorist with the biggest surprise possible we used several tricks to do that the hijackers have been holding the hostages for a week when finally the operation began on July 4th 1976 Israel launched the most daring rescue of all time to save our captive brethren in the heart of Africa Israeli planes flew at an altitude of less than 30 m for thousands of kilometers before approaching Uganda over Lake Victoria they landed in the dead of night in a country led by a brutal dictator who gave Refuge to terrorists when the plane landed the Commandos rolled out in a black Mercedes identical to IDI ain's car flanked by Land Rovers they were dressed in ug Ugandan army uniforms Ugandan soldiers thinking it was their terrifying president let the cars approach the terminal it took less than an hour the Commandos burst out of the car and blasted their way through the airport killing seven hijackers and 45 ugandans most of them did not understand until the last moment what really happened they blew up 11 fighter jets to make sure they could Escape safely three hostages were killed and also a senior Israeli officer was killed shot in the back my beloved brother Yoni who led the force that stormed the old terminal overcame the terrorists and freed the hostages was the only soldier who was killed the operation immediately became legendary when the hostages returned home there were parties in the street it was retroactively renamed operation yonathan in net Yahoo's memory by the end of the year production had begun on eight separate movies about the raid Warner Brothers victory at nby starring Bert Lancaster Elizabeth Taylor and Kirk Douglas will premere in Sydney in a few days time the movie starred Richard dfus as Yoni Netanyahu we've got the terrorists we can start moving the hostages out there have since been questions raised about netanyahu's actions leading up to and during the rain with some reports suggesting that he was on the verge of being relieved of command just beforehand but that's not the narrative spread by the Netanyahu family Benjamin Netanyahu became internationally famous appearing regularly on American television to talk about his brother and I think it grew inspiration from the Bible from the biblical Heroes Benjamin Netanyahu is the brother of the Fallen Jonathan and he is now a ambassador from Israel to the United Nations and be the editor of a new book called terrorism How the West can win books have been written about y Netanyahu including the publication of his private letters this is a book uh that our guest has written the letters of Jonathan uh his brother netu self-portrait of a of a hero this is something you might enjoy reading around the world military forces tried to replicate Israel's success in fighting against terrorists they failed in Iran the is one of national delight at America's disastrous failure to bring home the hostages but this only added to Israel's mistake the idea that they were the only ones up to the job in the following decades other successful though admittedly less spectacular hostage rescues solidified this image and retaliatory attacks by Israel against Palestinian targets sent a clear message if you take israeli's hostage we'll get them back and then we'll kill you people ask for Revenge we determined to settle the account now Israel's reputation is being put to the test Hamas has 239 hostages being held in their vast network of tunnels dug into the soft Sandstone under the suburbs of Gaza Hamas claims the tunnels are more than 500 km long there so many hostages in so many different places that Hamas took a while to figure out how many they had hopes of a rescue operation are slim at least in previous operations they knew where the hostages were this time they're spread across Gaza so option b is a trade the hostages families are pleading with Benjamin Netanyahu to get their loved ones back I'm begging the world to bring my baby back home the families are desperate some are mourning the death of loved ones while they hope for the release of others the family is broken can their father saki is being held hostage in Gaza their 18-year-old sister Mayan is dead Hamas says that they are willing to do a trade Hamas declared this that they are ready for immediate exchange so that all civilians Israeli civilians will come home and in exchange for Palestinian prisoners being released I think that's fair but it's expected that to get them all released it will take a massive release of Palestinian prisoners potentially thousands in 2011 Israel had to release a th000 prisoners in exchange for one single soldier who was being held hostage in Gaza so far Hamas has only released four hostages two Americans and two Israeli grandmothers 85-year-old Israeli grandmothers yav lifshits and 79-year-old nurit Cooper are given treats and tea before being released one reaches her hand out to her armed guard and says Salam which is Arabic for peace one Israeli soldier who is being held hostage in Gaza has been rescued the families of the other 239 hostages have asked Netanyahu to trade all 4500 Palestinian prisoners for all 239 hostages in what they're calling an all for all deal and we the families will not stop until everybody is back nyaho says he's considering it but he'll find it difficult to persuade his hard-right political allies that it's the right thing to do Israeli defense minister says an all for all deal is impossible and the only solution is for the Defense Force to destroy Hamas sometimes in Gaza the living look like the Dead Israel said it hit more than 400 Hamas Targets in 24 hours Hamas says that Israeli bombings have already killed 50 hostages the question is will there be any hostages Left Alive by the time Hamas is
