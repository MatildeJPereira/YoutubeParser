          <attvalue for="7" value="israel has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians since October 2023 Gaza's infrastructure has been decimated Famine persists and yet the bombardment and destruction continue with no end in sight despite countless attempts at reaching a ceasefire deal With a besieged enclave now incapacitated and in ruins why hasn't Tel Aviv ended its assault israel's stated goal of eliminating Hamas may not be the driving force behind the war For Netanyahu it may well be about staying in power and possibly even staying out of prison Before October 7th 2023 Netanyahu's popularity among Israelis was beginning to wne and he was set to stand trial Since 2019 the Israeli prime minister has been facing three separate corruption cases including charges of bribery fraud and breach of trust These aren't minor scandals They go to the heart of democratic integrity in a country that touts itself as the only democracy in the Middle East A conviction could end his political career His war has however been a lifeline for his survival as it has allowed him to not only delay hearings related to a trial that could put him behind bars but also distract public attention away from his scandals including what many Israelis see as an unforgivable failure in preventing the Hamas attack on October 7 Can we say that Netanyahu is using this war as a shield against his internal crisis including her corruption trials absolutely uh there are two main reasons why Netanyahu is trying to prolong this war One of them is to uh prolong his own political career to save himself from the consequences of the failure on October 7th Um but that is a secondary reason The main reason is Nitnya who's trying to create his legacy as the Israeli leader who expanded the boundaries of Israel who finished the job in Gaza once and for all who managed to accomplish what Bengory failed to do in in 1948 drive all Palestinians out from their homeland And that is what concerns Netanyahu more Netanyahu isn't alone in his genocidal quest to flatten Gaza He's supported by the most far-right government in Israel's history His national security minister Itamar Bengavir leads Odsma Yehudit a far-right ultraist party that calls for harsh crackdowns on Palestinians and full Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank His finance minister Bezal Smatri heads the Religious Zionism Party which also advocates for the annexation of the occupied West Bank and rejects the creation of any Palestinian state However Netanyahu's liquid party is losing support from within As internal divisions deepen continuing the war may be the only way for Netanyahu to keep his fragile coalition from falling apart and for his notorious ministers to stay in power Furthermore in a Channel 12 poll conducted in March 70% of Israelis indicated they didn't trust the Netanyahu government with 68% saying Smotridge was doing a poor job while both ministers have gained a certain amount of notoriety among Israel's allies over their inflammatory statements Is Netanyahu a hostage to his coalition as he sometimes claims to be or is he willingly and willfully embracing the rhetoric of his extremist ministers um I think the idea of Smutri and Beng pushing Netanyahu to the far right is inaccurate Netanyahu is the far right um he hides behind those two ministers as a convenient cover as a fig leaf to tell his European enablers his enablers in Washington to say &quot;Look I'm I'm I'm hostage to those two crazy ministers [Music] Netanyahu might have victory set as his main objective but when it comes to a post-war plan for Gaza he's got nothing but destruction on his agenda with proposals that don't take Palestinian rights or rebuilding the ruined enclave into consideration Netanyahu and his coalition partners they have a crystal clear plan for postwar Gaza Uh basically Gaza becoming completely uninhabitable So people would have to leave or would be forced to leave and the rest that are staying will perish to death It's always changing There's no one single plan here But the best plan for them would be the you know sending the guns away because of the you know demography issues and uh this is important I [Music] think Netanyahu may have hoped that the war on Gaza would be a useful distraction to steer attention away from his scandals and boost his image as a strong leader and it seems to be working so far But the March Channel 12 poll shows that he's losing the support of the Israeli public with 72.5% believing he should take responsibility for October 7th and resign and others frustrated that he hasn't led Israel to a clear victory A lot of Israelis are feeling sort of fatigued about the war that it's not accomplishing it its objectives that they were promised a decisive victory and that never came As the war fails to conclude without any progress is Israel's closest ally also starting to lose patience in a surprise move the US held direct talks with Hamas in early March and Israel wasn't invited And on May 19th the United Kingdom France and Canada warned for the first time since Israel launched this devastating onslaught that they may take concrete actions including sanctions or formally recognizing the state of Palestine if Israel doesn't halt for war and the lift is blockade of aid right now He lost Trump's support He lost United States support Uh he's not you know he cannot and he could not end the war He could not bring back the hostages and the economy is worsening Uh even if it's enduring and resistant uh there are a lot of problems for you know the situation Netanyahu's ongoing war on Gaza doesn't seem to solely be about defeating Hamas or even returning the Israeli hostages to safety Many critics agree that it's largely motivated by political survival That of Netanyahu and his coalition and of Israel's expansionist goals and extremist ideology also projects of Netanyahu and his cohorts Bengavir and Smotrich The cost of a prime minister's political gamble has already been devastating not just for the more than 2 million Palestinians trapped in Gaza but also for the Israeli hostages still in captivity As the war drags on with no clear end in sight the question remains how many more Palestinian lives will be taken for Netanyahu and his far-right coalition to stay in power [Applause]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="rabbi David Feldman thank you so much for sitting here with us today and we're filming this interview at a time where student activists across the US are being arrested for their pro Palestine activism with claims that they're being anti-semitic what's your take on all of this well accusing people who stand up for the oppressed people who say something when they see crimes taking place uh this is not this is not anti-semitic you know doing what's right and speaking up for the press is not anti-semitic in any way um when these people when these students it's not only the students it's so many other people are being attacked with the with this false accusation of anti-semitism uh this is disturbing because in in the time as you say in the time that we we see this genocide going on in Gaza so many people tens of thousands of people are being mass murdered innocent people uh this is something that us people in the free world should say something this is injust this is unjust for the people of Palestine that that this voice is attempted to be silenced but it's not only doing injustice for the Palestinian people this is doing injustice for the Jewish people as well because when you conflate Judaism and Zionism you conflate anti-Zionism with anti-semitism you're making a statement as if all Jews support all what's going on and as if all Jews are accountable to what's going on but we always need to know better than that and we try to educate people to understand that anti-ionism has nothing to do with anti-semitism because Judaism and Zionism are not the same judaism is a religion zionism is a political movement should never be conflated yes and New York is one of the hot spots shall we say of Judaism with over 2 million Jews living in this city and as you say some of them are anti-Zionist but meanwhile some of them are support the state of Israel and you know identify as Zionist and sometimes we see them confronting you because of your stance what's your take on them well f first of all as you say New York is a very good example uh yes there are a lot of Jewish people in New York many of them support Israel but there's a massive community who is anti-ionist and people might not know because the mainstream media would never show you that like for example there was a couple of years ago there was a huge mass uh anti-ionist rally a Jewish anti-ionist rally in front of the Israeli consulate on 2nd Avenue Manhattan and then CBS would announce that there is a traffic jam on Second Avenue and they would not say what the reason is in other words they purposely intentionally ignore what is going on so many people have no idea but there there is a massive uh religious Jewish anti-ionist community who are outspokenly uh against Israel um but but uh what's what what's important to understand is that these not not everyone comes out in each and every occasion as you say intimidation is massive uh pressure is enormous uh I I I always tell this story uh I had a very close friend of mine comes over to me once and and tells me I'll do everything I can to support you to support your activities but there's no way I can come out in person i run a huge business i come out in person they take a picture of me I close down the business the same day but uh but still the the anti-ionism is is is strong our communities are very strong and you can you can imagine if it wouldn't have been for those massive communities but that will be behind us we would not be able to be out there in these numbers and this uh so frequent and do so much yes you have huge numbers behind you but also we're seeing Zionist groups like Betar recently becoming more emboldened and seeking to confront you can you speak on the activities of Zionist groups such as Betar well Betar to begin with I'm not sure how large they are how strong they are uh they might be very uh uh wild they might be very uh aggressive uh we didn't see them in large numbers uh but yes they are very aggressive they're coming out uh in public intimidating harassing demonstrators happens to be peaceful demonstrators you know these these demonstrations taking place in New York City that that we all attend uh these are not dangerous demonstrations and uh these people will always claim that the pro Palestinian solidarity movement is dangerous uh and so on yeah and sometimes they approach you they tell you things like &quot;You should go to Gaza you won't be safe in Gaza.&quot; How do you respond to that oh that's that's that's a good point what they say is &quot;Yeah go visit Gaza.&quot; And they always they also say you know go to the Arabs they will kill you first and I always respond to that and usually these these arguments end up with nothing because they they they don't know what's going on whatsoever and and I try always to tell these people and people who who are willing to listen and some people are willing to listen and I tell them you know why are you so scared from these Palestinian people they don't hate you they don't want anything they just want their freedom we can live in peace with them we lived in peace with them before Zionism came they were always respectful for Jews and they still are but in the same time they are deeply upset and against the crimes being committed to Palestine which doesn't make these people anti-Semitic doesn't make these people dangerous for Jews while in the same time yes those people are vehemently opposing this uh occupation of Palestine now when when you find when you find people on the street uh protesting the genocide in Gaza this is not about protesting the Jewish people this is not about protesting the Jewish religion this is about crimes and they which which they are opposed to and we as Jewish people share their uh frustration and we share their pain of people who are disturbed when all of this is taking place what about what do you say to those who maybe agree with what you're saying but also say that um Jews Jewish people need a strong Israel to be safe this is this is one of the arguments that the the Zionists are using that uh Jewish people suffered in the Holocaust uh we were in we are in exile for the past 2,000 years it's about time for us to have a safe haven uh and most of the time this is being uh religion is being used into these conversations they are trying to use religion some concepts of the Jewish religion to justify this claim but what one needs to understand is basically two points first of all this is not Judaism according to Judaism we are forbidden to create this so-called safe haven for the Jewish people according to the very basics of Judaism there's a concept of Jewish exile which is a divine decree which we are forbidden to end by any physical means even if we find that this building is a safe haven would be in our favor according to our religion this is forbidden we accept the decree of God whether it is comfortable or it isn't we accept the word of God that we should not end this exile by any physical means and we leave this up to God for him to end our exile this is exactly what Judaism teaches us that it's only God god himself that will bring the ultimate redemption where all humanity together will serve the one God in peace and brotherhood zionism is forbidden safe haven is Zionism but I have to add this other point all of this would be true even if this would have been the safe haven for the Jewish people even if this would have been the favor of Jews um but it happens to be that the state of Israel is the greatest danger for the Jewish people while we lived in Palestine in peace it is the occupation of Palestine which has destroyed this peace and and in in addition we have to I have to add that coming back to the previous point even if this would have been in the favor of the Jewish people we should never oppress another people we should never harm another people because it might be in our interest certainly very interesting points you're making there philosophically and religiously very interesting arguments but uh Zionists often use religious arguments to justify the existence of Israel how do you respond to those claims and also uh Zionists equate Judaism together with Zionist Zionism and how what's your take on that zionists are conflating Judaism with Zionism because they need Judaism to support their movement of Zionism but what happens here is something very ironic and very hypocritical you have a movement of Zionism which is officially a secular movement it's not only secular because the founders of Zionism and the people to Zionists today are not only secular they basically many of them hate Judaism they hate God and his religion for example I have a friend of mine uh who grew up in Zionist education grew up in Jerusalem and he told me that what he was taught is that we the Jewish people have two enemies now guess who the two are in who the first is the first is the religious Jew and the second is the Arab now both of this is wrong the religious Jew is not is is is basically the Jew uh but this is how they hate religion the Jewish religion and they hate religious Jews and and and which which just shows you how far away they are from Judaism but that movement the movement of Zionism who is secular and who refuses to follow Judaism they misuse this very same religion they refuse to follow and they misuse it to justify crimes which are forbidden in this very same religion because killing and stealing oppressing an entire people all of this is forbidden in Judaism and as I said before the whole concept the idea of Zionism to build a sovereign homeland for Jews is in total contrast of Judaism now see seeing a secular movement misusing the religion doesn't make sense in the first place but what my response to those people is we can only explain and educate that while you are misusing the Jewish religion the Jewish religion in each and every way is in total contrast to this movement of Zionism and when we take a take a look at what's happening right now overall in the Middle East with President Trump taking office he ran as being a president for peace and he promised that he can bring peace not only to the Middle East but to Ukraine and many other regions how is your take on how his administration their policies have been so far and do you have hope for peace now I I I'm not a politician now i'm not sure exactly uh what can be done in each and every conflict around the world uh but when it comes to Zionism it comes to Palestine uh what we are presenting is we are presenting the view of Judaism of our religion and yes we do uh see the approach that our president of the United States has has taken uh we always say to politicians we appreciate when politicians or individuals extend the hand for the Jewish people we definitely appreciate but we try to educate and to explain that supporting Israel is not in favor of the Jewish people supporting Israel is is is doing so much harm to the suffering people of Palestine and so much harm for the Jewish people we do everything we can to explain to educate that Judaism is not Zionism and in this climate when some are afraid of speaking out as you said they're worried about losing their businesses how important is it for Jewish voices like yours to speak out for Palestine well it it is extremely important for us to speak up for many reasons first of all the people the oppressed people of Palestine deserve that people in the free world should speak up and without Jewish people coming out the rest of humanity is being intimidated of being anti-Semitic this is one of the reasons why it's so important for Jewish people to c to come out and to uh help people overcome this propaganda and and understand that this is a human uh cause this is a righteous cause this is a cause that uh needs to be addressed uh and we all share this uh this very important cause mhm and in addition to this this is so important because we have to break this stereotype people should should know that not all Jews take part in this no Jewish people who are right-minded people disagree with all of this the state of Israel does not represent us is certainly doesn't represent our religion if there is a group of people supporting these crimes you know that's that's their that's their own decision but this is not the voice of the entire Jewish people when you speak to Jewish people who are kind of on the fence they're not Zionists but maybe when they see you they see that there's an alternative path they can take can you speak to those conversations maybe not some who are set in their ways but some who you can actually change their perspective there there are many people especially since October 7th so many people are waking up so many people are seeing something new that they didn't realize until now you know until now everything was like okay but now they they are waking up to see that something is wrong and and these people are willing some of them are willing to listen in my experience the Zionist propaganda is so strong and so massive that even if you would find some people who are not supposed to be Zionist who people who in essence are not Zionists but the movement of Zionism has managed to confuse the masses the Jewish people are in danger it's those enemies of ours who seek to destroy us all and they want to drive us into the sea from the river to the sea people are so uh h um disturbed by this slogan from the river to the sea and I speak to people and I try to explain them what do you think is the second half of this slogan from the river to the sea kill all the Jews and people say yes people believe that from the river to the sea Palestine wants to see all Jews killed which is which is so ridiculously wrong it doesn't make any sense and I always explain to people Palestine doesn't want to see Jewish people dead they don't even want to see all Jews expelled from Palestine that's not what they are saying all they want is total freedom for their people and freed their land and we have we we spoke to so many uh political leaders of the Palestinian groups so many religious leaders so many individuals layman people nobody says otherwise but unfortunately people following Zionist propaganda are so misled to the point that they even lose their mind to be able to figure out what's in the best interest for themselves let's let let's put the oppressed people of Palestine aside which is something that everyone should think about but even for their own interest like they they are fighting for the Jewish people and by doing so they are endangering all Jews like by supporting what Israel is doing this is not in favor of the Jewish people but I'm pleased to see that people are listening and we we do this already for decades but especially since October 7th people are opening their minds and you know they see that they have to rethink what they were programmed until now and they slowly open their minds and can you give a bit of a more personal perspective your family ha uh escaped Europe back in the days they escaped genocide so being a sort of a survivor of genocide what kind of responsibility does that put on you on your shoulders to speak out when it's happening we always say it's because it's our communities who suffered in the Holocaust it's our families who suffered in the Holocaust that's a lesson for us that we should not want to see this happen to anyone when we are seeing what's happening in Gaza this reminds us of the stories that our elders told us just a couple of decades ago uh uh one a number of my teachers were Holocaust survivors uh and and you know they they they were telling stories terrible stories and unfortunately we we hearing similar stories now this is something that should the the the Jewish history and the Holocaust should be a lesson for Jewish people how to refuse this genocide taking place in Gaza so turning to the future of Jewish and Palestinian solidarity what do you need what do you think needs to happen in the US so that more Jewish people support the Palestinian cause like you do basically they need information they need education they need to uh realize not only that what's being done to Palestine is wrong but even more importantly they need to know that Palestine is not the enemy of the Jewish people and they never were uh there there's a massive propaganda that is ingrained in their minds from their very young age but this needs to be uh corrected mhm and once this will be corrected we can we can get quite uh we can proceed further and going forward some people are very unhopful for the future of Gaza what do you see happening now that the ceasefire has been broken again the Netanyahu government seems to be uh seems to want to keep pushing to exterminate the Palestinian people from the land what do you see happening i'm not sure exactly what's going to happen in Gaza i hope for the best but generally speaking with Palestine uh I I I I see I see a better future why because we see at least since October 7th even before people are waking up the general public is changing their views public opinion is shifting uh maybe we have to give credit to Netanyahu for waking up the people i always say uh it's so sad when we have to pay this terrible price for people to wake up so many people so many tens of thousands of people need to be murdered for people to finally wake up but this is what's happening but while they're waking up on one end but also on the other end here in the US there's a lot of crackdown against pro Palestine demonstrations as we mentioned earlier people are getting snatched of the street do you have any worries for you for your community because you're standing up for Palestine could something happen to you well it can happen it can happen but but to be to be clear here this is not showing uh that that it's not being successful on the other on the other way around we see this a success if there is no response to the pro Palestinian solidarity movement other than physically cracking them down then this is an achievement in other words there's no other uh reasonable response and how has this response been has there been threats against you against your community well we have threats from time to time we have physical attacks from time to time it's okay it's okay you know we we expect this to happen we expect that the other side is strong and aggressive uh but again this is encouraging because this is all they can respond with uh they have no logical or reasonable or religious argu proper religious argument to make so in the face of threats you're actually saying that this means that your activism is working because now people are getting worried and they're taking backlash against you but we're also seeing backlash to students such as the Turkish student who was recently arrested Romesa Mahmud Halil a student from Colombia who perhaps you demonstrated with very closely what's your message uh to these students out there who are maybe worried and who are looking for guidance on what to do in this time well all we can say is yes it's difficult yes it's challenging but in the same time we all of us know that what we are doing is right uh I cannot necessarily advise people exactly what to do what not to do that's the choice of the individuals uh in the face that we can face uh backlash but we are doing we are speaking up for humanity we are doing a righteous deed we please God by our acts and this is what needs to be done now who should be those doing it that's up to the individual and can you talk about a bit about your experiences when you went to Gaza or when you've been to other countries in the Middle East how were you received by the people there perhaps like you can explain it in a way for other Jewish people who've never been what would their experience be if they went this is a this is a very important question because our personal experience is shocking for general Jewish people we visited Gaza and this was after the beginning of the siege this was in 2009 uh Gaza is the most affected people from this conflict from this war and people were questioning before we went whether it's going to be safe because after all you know these people should uh be dangerous to people who harmed them but this wasn't the case they knew exactly who we are who we were they knew that we're not enemy they had no problem with us as Jewish people we visited we met Ism Khan who was the prime minister of Gaza at the time and uh he said to us privately in a meeting and then publicly in a press conference he said &quot;We have nothing against the Jewish people neither against the Jewish religion we are against the occupation.&quot; This makes simple sense i always take these stories back to our communities and I tell people Palestine is not dangerous to the Jewish people i visited Gaza i visited many other Muslim countries frequently I visit Muslim or Arab conventions and guess what i came home alive it's not dangerous at all people need to know this and people who only follow mainstream media or Zionist media generally speaking they don't have even a chance to interact with any Palestinian or Muslim to to have personal experience which is it's very unfortunate because their information is being built on fabricated propaganda versus facts on the ground" />

world and have people come and listen to me recite the quran [Music] for the walk but i'm not as passionate about it as i used to be wed was raped by the headmaster of his quranic school to preserve his anonymity we have changed his name he hardly ever leaves his house he lives in seclusion out of sight surrounded by his family after daring to break the law of silence when he had the courage to report his attacker to the teachers wahid was punished his phone was confiscated and he was forbidden to leave the mudrasa he managed to escape a few weeks later taking advantage of a moment of inattention he tells us his story 2 months after his attack it was the middle of the day the headmaster came to the madrasa he said he wanted to take me to clean his house i was studying i got on behind him on his motorbike and we went to his house there he told me to go into a room and start cleaning a few minutes later he came in and locked the door he grabbed me and threw me on the bed he started assaulting me then pulled down his trousers and forcibly removed mine i started to scream but he put his hand over my mouth and he did horrible things to me i couldn't stop crying he wouldn't let me go then he threatened me if you tell anyone your teacher or your family i'll kill [Music] you in pakistan quranic schools are largely privately funded and operate completely independently [Music] for millions of children they are the only access to education there are not enough schools in the country where the state invests just 2% of its gdp on education this madrasai in northern punjab is part of a large network of 3,000 religious establishments across pakistan pupils spend their day deciphering the quran letter by letter in arabic a language they do not speak the method has not changed for centuries lau mosin agreed to open the doors of his school to us as deputy headmaster he is one of the most liberal voices in the local clergy [Music] sheen shin rainha nearly 250 boys study here they come from all over pakistan none of them go to public school god sent the holy quran as the last book for the good of humanity it is therefore extremely important to protect this book to preserve its words god inscribes them in the hearts of young children who memorize them and in that way they're passed on from generation to generation we believe that those who send their child to a madrasa to learn the quran will be crowned on judgment day and their crown will shine brighter than the sun memorizing the quran is one of the most important things in our religion pakistan where 97% of the population is muslim is one of the poorest nations in asia there are 35,000 madrasas in operation only half of which are registered with the authorities here students are aged between 8 to 25 and all have the same responsibilities it's lunchtime for the children we prepared some rice for them for all the daily chores we asked them to help us because we can't afford to employ staff to do this work okay the majority of madrasa students come from families living below the poverty line meaning with less than €2 a day most of the students we have here come from very poor backgrounds and we don't charge them any fees in our country poor families often have a lot of children but they can't afford to feed them or look after them for them the madrasa is a great support we provide food accommodation clothing and education there are also parents who send their children here when they're not doing well at school or are causing problems the students daily routine is punctuated by lessons meals and prayers from the first at dawn to the last late at night there are around a 100 borders they are cut off from their families whom they see only once every fortnight and only have access to their telephones on thursday evenings lau mosen denies having been confronted with any case of assault on minors on his establishment however he has put in place certain rules which he justifies in his own way this is where the younger ones sleep the older ones sleep separately on the floor below the youngest are between 10 and 15 and the oldest are over 15 we don't mix young and old because there are a lot of bad influences in society this could encourage forbidden relationships that's why we're very careful to avoid temptation temptations for the cleric means homosexuality which is illegal in pakistan but he plays down the cases of rape reported in quranic [Music] schools however a former student of the school says the opposite this man aged 27 has studied in various quranic schools before becoming a teacher he describes a system which isolates exploits and exposes children to constant danger i was 12 i was the one who wanted to go to the madrasa i wanted to do he memorizing the quran my family didn't force me we were so scared of the teachers that all they had to do was stare at us once to make us want to sink into the ground we were often beaten up if they called our name we had to run straight away if we were sitting down we had to get up straight away if they gave us an order we had to obey without delay it was as if they were the masters and we were their slaves after a few months i started seeing things i didn't understand i didn't even know that such things could happen or be done one night it was about half midnight i was going down the corridor to go to the toilet a bedroom window was open and i looked in i saw a boy lying on the floor the teacher was on top of him and they were both naked i said nothing to anyone i went back to my room without making a sound i've seen this a lot the same teachers with different boys once my teacher called me into his room and ordered me to massage his feet i started to do it he told me to massage higher and higher so i went up his legs massaging him then he told me to hold his penis i said no he told me he was going to expel me i'd worked really hard and i was afraid of having to repeat the year again so i said okay and he held out his penis to me [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] after seeing these things several times i started committing the same sexual acts there was always a pupil with me whom i exploited whenever i wanted i was his elder he was a junior i was the class supervisor so i threatened to go and tell the teachers that he wasn't learning his lessons if he didn't do as he was told the first time i abused him was on the mat where we slept i continued to do these things after i finished my studies at the madrasa when i lived with my parents for a year this happened when i was playing with boys i would force them to lie down and abuse them i did that with 15 to 20 boys i had no idea it was rape or abuse because i'd seen it so many times it seemed normal to me i just copied everything i saw no one ever stopped us there was never a complaint to the police nobody said anything i said to myself &quot;this happens in madras it's nothing new it's not bad nothing will happen to me [Music] back in kalahar wid goes to court today to appear before the judge i want justice to be done if he is severely punished all the madrasas will be afraid of abusing a child today my family and i are fighting i'm not afraid anymore [Music] the boy is guarded by his uncles who form a circle around [Music] him in the absence of his father a soldier on a mission in an other province they are the ones who accompany him bringing a case against a religious authority in pakistan requires exceptional courage they know it will be an uphill struggle i spoke to the lawyer and he told me he would be in court at 9:00 will the culprit be there maybe he'll be there the case will go on for years hearings are held every month or two or the judge goes on holiday so the case drags on the accused is very strong he has a lot of influence that's why we all have to be united to be strong and if we are faced with a problem or a threat we will protect each other people try to hide these incidents but we will fight as one family whatever happens the culprit must not be released on bail he must not go free and tell people you see nothing happened to me in pakistan sexual crimes against children are punishable by up to 25 years imprisonment however the judicial system is overburdened and sometimes corrupt and struggles to be effective less than 1% of cases of violence against minors result in a conviction wahed's lawyer is reassuring [Music] the public prosecutor's office has completed its initial investigation and they will be presenting him to the court in the next 3 to 4 days i've had a look at the report and in my opinion there is no doubt that the müller is guilty i'm confident we will win this case [Music] over to circumvent local pressure the boy's family had to find a lawyer outside their town when i see the accused it makes me angry it hurts me and i feel sad because he has hurt us but we're relying on justice the chain of madrasas to which they belong is very close to the highest islamic clergy and they also have a strong local influence if we had hired a local lawyer they might have put pressure on him and tried to weaken our case so we called in a lawyer from outside the town the accused remains in prison for the duration of the investigation wuhed's relatives leave the court slightly reassured in the district of kasour a berieved father could not get justice for his son [Applause] muhammad salim's son died on 21st of june 2023 summer was 8 years old he was thrown off the roof of his madrasa after being raped [Music] this is my son samar when i saw him in hospital blood was pouring from his mouth and ears he was in no condition to speak or open his eyes i can't bear to look at this photo all i can think about is killing that cleric or killing myself this is the monster a stain on the name of islamic scholars [Music] muhammad salim is living a walking nightmare the death of his son was followed by divorce and separation from his two other children whom he sent to live with his sister he denounces the corruption of the police who he says botched the investigation he also questions the doctors whom he suspects of falsifying the autopsy report the investigator asked me for money he said &quot;your case will be handled there will be no problem just give me 300,000 rupees i don't even have 10 rupees.&quot; the culprit's relatives in the village threatened to kill me on the way to court and make it look like an accident if i kept fighting seeking justice has become extremely difficult when i go to court i have to go like a criminal hiding my face ping that no one will see me for fear that someone will recognize me catch me and kill me i live with that [Music] fear muhammad salim did not get justice according to his lawyer he finally accepted to sign an agreement with the accused who was later released in pakistan the courts drop charges against the accused if they obtain forgiveness from the victim or his family a principle enshrined in islamic law i try to visit him at least once or twice a week i talk to him my son how are you where are you do you miss me but he doesn't answer so i leave heartbroken so many people have been through this but none of them got justice our society in pakistan is rotten it has become extremely difficult to protect children's lives [Music] few voices dare today announce sexual violence against minors in this conservative and traditional country in islamabad the angel sahil has been systematically documenting cases of abuse reported in the local press since 1996 from the 2025 look at this one let me see this is the says that was not mentioned every year the ngo publishes a report called cruel numbers according to their data around eight cases are reported every day but the organization estimates that the real numbers could be 10 times higher and look cruel numbers is what we uh monitor newspapers up to 80 to 85 daily and we collect all the cases that are that come up in the newspapers of child sexual abuse abduction missing children early marriages pornography prostitution because all those are forms of sexual abuse we put it onto an excel sheet and at the end of the year we do a complete analysis these cases will not include a number of other sexual abuse cases that can be reported like oral like touching kissing because these could never be proved so the fact remains is that you will have many more cases according to the ngo at an institutional level the greatest number of complaints are lodged against religious teachers or clergymen more than against the police teachers or close family members madras as we know we know are uh what what we call in udu a gur means a real uh powerful hold and where abuse is happening all the time we know that but it is very difficult to make a breakthrough there in all the 70 years of pakistan the religious groups were very small and not influential but we have let them grow and become more influential and now they are they have a big sway and people uh i think all our governments are um a bit wary of doing anything that might disturb them the whole thing is such a rotten rotten uh setup that there's really nothing we can do not an enjoy the government could but they haven't done anything like it in the south of punjab one woman dares to break the silence sidra ilas revolted by the widespread sexual abuse in the society she's waging a grassroots battle by raising awareness among isolated rural communities is everything ready yes it's ready do you want to check yes is this one okay yes that's good to you let's go this activist has chosen to devote herself entirely to the prevention of sexual violence for the past 3 years she has been tirelessly crisscrossing the most isolated regions in the country where illiteracy affects almost 60% of the population with no support from any organization she works with her only allies her brother and sister the roads are difficult here yes the road is broken that day she has an appointment with a civil society activist in the village of [Music] pakshawala this woman has gathered dozens of mothers and their children to attend sidra's presentation everything is done by word of mouth with utmost discretion you've all heard about many cases of child rape recently where are most of these incidents reported i think it's in the mad addresses you send your children there to get a religious education to learn the quran but it's your responsibility to know what's happening to them there you have to ask them if anyone is abusing them or touching them in an inappropriate way it could be a teacher or a classmate the law on this is very strict if something happens you have to make a complaint everyone will support you i will support you so children these are your private parts you mustn't let anyone touch them if anyone touches you who do you tell your mother and your father if that happens would you say so [Music] what did i explain to you what's a bad touch what's a good touch where else is a bad touch okay are there any other places okay here yes if someone touches you here what is that bad touch okay what is a good touch [Music] okay good what are the other touches bad touch yes here most cases of abuse go unreported by doing what i'm doing here i'm threatening the status quo because i'm telling the villagers to take action against such acts and to report them in fact the perpetrators usually settle these problems by reaching an agreement with the victim's family so my work is seen as a threat to their power sometimes men come to the gathering and say to me &quot;why are you doing this?&quot; i try to be discreet i always wear a veil in the villages i go to because i could get into trouble house the news is not great his attacker has been released on bail my dear you must be confident don't think too much about what happened don't worry too much about it you have to think that nothing has changed that we will continue to fight he will be punished god will help us everyone is still praising your courage he took advantage of me my whole life is at stake and it's destroyed i can't even go out if i go out i have to be accompanied by someone now they're going to come after me they won't give up we find wahed's alleged attacker in the same madrasa where he was studying we film him with a hidden camera the cleric is still there in direct contact with the students neither the government nor the network of chronic schools to which the madrasa belongs has taken any steps to suspend him from his duties while an investigation is carried out the matter seems to have been ignored as if nothing had ever happened [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] is Israeli intelligence funding humanitarian aid in Gaza and why israeli opposition leaders say some 140 million a month is flowing from the Ministry of Defense and Mossad into the Gaza Humanitarian Aid Foundation the prime minister denies it but is Israel financially profiting from and deliberately creating more deadly chaos in Gaza i'm Andrea Seni and this is the Newsmakers [Music] when Israel banned ENRA's crucial humanitarian work in the Gaza Strip it claimed other NOS's could replace it but didn't quite specify which eventually the newly created Gaza Humanitarian Foundation took over operations it's backed by a private US company and partly based in Switzerland where it's often tough to discern exactly where funding is coming from the GHF's opacity and abysmal performance have led to a number of resignations and ultimately the suspension of desperately needed aid so who and what is really behind this organization here's a look june 5th NASA Day an annual commemoration the day of the setback marking Palestinian displacement after Israel's 1967 victory in the 6-day war now catastrophic setbacks are hampering the delivery of food destined for the besieged enclave israeli opposition leader Ya Laid as far back as the start of May questioning the origins of funding for the new Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the cabinet approved the expansion of the operation in the Gaza Strip last night no one yet knows what the actual war plan is or what the words conquest of the strip really mean but there is one thing we do know this war is costing a great deal of money the question is who is paying for it enra the UN body traditionally responsible for delivering supplies to Palestine is no longer permitted to do so the Israeli government banned it claiming it had been infiltrated by Hamas and thefts of supplies were being used to prolong the war the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation an umbrella name for a private organization has taken over the task this direct aid to the population in Gaza bypassing Kamas is already changing the situation on the ground providing food directly to those civilians in need breaking Kamas hold over the population and has the potential to seriously harm the terrorists and the and to shorten the war but increasing questions of the source of money have grown into even larger concerns about whether the entire GHF is designed to fail on purpose it's been widely criticized by professional humanitarians because of its limited reach because of the limited nature of the supplies that it is going to provide now senior opposition politicians have alleged in Israeli news publications that the Israeli government even Mossad itself may be among the biggest financial backers of the private fund the GHF's mode of sending aid only to a small number of aid hubs within the territory forcing Gardens to travel long distances has also been criticized as ineffective as you can see all that's left here are body parts israeli forces tell people to move to so-called safe zones but the reality is there are no safe places shots fired by Israeli soldiers towards crowds in Gaza in recent days people desperate for food and medicine gazans say that the rush was because people were starving and wanted food for their children israel denied shooting into the crowds merely above their heads to control the crowds and just last week the American head of one of the foundations involved in helping create the GHF stepped down leading to sources claiming that the foundation would struggle without them in the last 24 hours Israel has suspended the GHF's operations june the 5th is Knax Day and history often repeats and rhymes is the private organization tasked with delivering supplies to gardens a serious attempt at private management of a humanitarian cause or a shadowy Israelibbacked organization designed to cause engineered scarcity a setback on the road to war's end yet again for Gaza so is the chaos of GHF's aid delivery by design and who is actually funding it well joining me now to discuss that and more are from Exit in the UK journalist Jhan Alfara from London research associate at SOASS University and author of an army like no other how the Israel Defense Forces Made a Nation Khim Rashid and from Washington visiting scholar at Georgetown University Center for Contemporary Arab Studies and author of Blind Spot America and the Palestinians from Bour to Trump Khaled Elgindi thanks all so much for being with me him I'll begin with you what is the government of Benjamin Netanyahu doing here and how cynical should the world actually be about how Israel is managing aid in Gaza now after banning ENRA well let's be practical about it the Israelis have never said anything that proved correct every single time that they um release a message to um the media it's a pack of lies so this is also a pack of lies this is not about feeding the gazans this is about reducing the pressure uh on the US and the west um when uh people all over the world are so angry about what they see happening in Gaza so um they have created a company uh in a number of countries uh by the Mossad the MSAD has created a company and is financing it uh and this was actually told us by Israeli politicians of the opposition uh they are not better than Netanyahu because they say Netanyahu is feeding the Palestinians uh with our money he should not do this and he should continue the war so in a sense um both the opposition and the government in Israel are about destruction are about genocide are about getting the Palestinians out of Palestine and first out of Gaza um and they use every lie that they can um and this system this this system is terrible as we can see yeah you were you were alluding to I mean mainly Avidor Lieberman member of the Knesset who's who's been trying to kind of spin this against Netanyahu by saying Israeli taxpayer shekels are paying to feed Gazins but when you say that that Mossad is behind uh this operation to what end is Mossad actually financing this it's it's not to make lives better is it does it make any any life better i mean basically more than 150 Palestinian were already killed probably more than that um waiting for to get food uh people who are um unable to walk great distances and and wait in the sun are not even able to get there most gazins will not be fed by this this is a PR exercise by Netanyahu to show that um this is not a starvation um campaign but it is a starvation campaign it is part of the genocide uh so um both the opposition and the government are just as nasty and just as responsible uh for what we are seeing okay i guess they can try to argue though oh that you know what it's well-meaning we're trying to provide age it's We're trying to provide aid we're trying to feed starving people but the logistics are incredibly complicated now you have these massive crowds uh that can't be managed people are storming uh the the distribution sites so they mean well they're trying to take the place of Anra but it's just logistically very difficult well ANRA and the UN said all the time that this is what will happen everyone every expert said this will be a killing machine um at the uh at the food aid um distribution and and now we see it happen um we were warned UN warned Israel uh that they shouldn't do it and they did it because that's what they want to do they want to create chaos yeah jan I mean do you believe that there is any intention at all via the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to help Gazins absolutely not um your guest just said that it was a PR campaign and that it is uh a way to reduce pressure on Israel and while I agree completely I think it's it's even more cynical than that it is actually being used as a lever to reshape Gaza's demography in general by force and it is a way to actually further their goals and to complete this genocide this new aid mechanism uh potentially involving Mossad uh which is entirely plausible is not just flawed it's actually dangerous it fundamentally violates the core humanitarian principles of neutrality um and uh and you know Smutz uh Smatri in his uh latest speech actually laid it bare you know uh he said that these aid corridors are not humanitarian at all they are strategic tools to ethnically cleanse Gaza by engineering displacement you know if you are creating aid dependency and only allowing aid to be controlled in specific strategic locations in the south so it's not even entire uh across Gaza uh while uh destroying homes you know refusing the return of people to their homes and now planning uh for the transfer of these people that get eventually concentrated in the south to third countries it's it's not aid it's it's an expulsion plan dressed in humanitarian language frankly and Israel has already set up an official body actually a directorate the directorate for the voluntary immigration uh of Gaza residents as they called it they don't they don't hide their intentions the question is will the world let them carry on uh with this genocide and empty Gaza out and and even the people of Gaza they don't see this as a they see it as another layer of domination and of control m Khaled you are in the United States part of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is is run by a somewhat shady at best I guess US company so try to explain if you can who in the United States is actually gaining from this what is the US gaining from this is it is it just an effort to undermine Hamas or is there something more cynical at play involved well I I agree with everything that both uh Haim and Jihan just said this is not about uh this is not well-meaning i think it's pretty clear israel's record in Gaza and frankly anywhere uh is has been pretty clear there is a you know in the words of most human rights organizations Israel has shown a blatant total disregard for civilian life um it cannot it's just strains credul to believe that after 19 months of destroying all of the sources of life uh all of the institutions and infrastructure uh that sustain life uh in Gaza um that now they're interested in in helping the the civilian population in Gaza um it is not about that it is about as Jihan said it is about facilitating their broader aims which is to move the population what remains of the population in the northern part uh to the south uh and eventually we can expect uh to to points outside of Gaza this is uh clearly a weaponization of aid in the same way that Israel has weaponized starvation um and uh if this were about uh uh the well-being of human beings well there are existing institutions and networks that have done quite a an amazing job of delivering humanitarian assistance all we have to do is look at the the uh the the weeks uh in which the first phase of the ceasefire plan um in uh in February and March until March 18th uh in which there were up to 600 trucks arriving a day uh and and there was no one going hungry during those weeks why the United States uh is backing this has to do with with Israel um the Trump administration like the Biden administration defers heavily to Israel israel's preferences uh are the most important consideration and so if Israel says they don't want Anoa or other UN or international agencies to operate uh then the United States uh reflexively goes along with that he let me come back to you though because you know the original foundation chief here Jake Wood was his name he resigned in May just after the the organization was actually founded then the Boston Consultant the Boston Consulting Group actually pulled its participation then you have Swiss diplomats dozens of them complaining about the Geneva branch of the GHF being non-compliant so as a writer yourself I mean do you expect all this to kind of unravel and eventually expose something even far more sinister than than what's been exposed so far it is already unraveling we don't need to wait it it is um um we can see that this is something set up by the Israeli Mossad to actually undermine the um UN ANRA and the Palestinian um um and and the Hamas and the Palestinian Authority because what happens here is first of all you can see on the screen u all the food is supplied by Israeli suppliers so this is a way of giving them some work and money um the money goes from Israel to Israel you know um the other thing is um that um the person John Moore um the evangelical Christian who is now the new um leader of U G GHF uh is um someone uh who is been a um a soldier for hire um for many years with links to the contraair this is all u a mafia um operation uh in order to um undermine the UN and as suppliers uh and to um make sure that they cannot supply there are thousands of uh lorries waiting to deliver food to everyone in Gaza and Israel will not allow it because uh as Jian said they want the um the concentration camp with biometrics that they have built in four areas of Gaza as part of removing the Palestinians from Gaza this is all about ethnic cleansing and and and about uh continuing the genocide uh it's not going to help anyone uh people some people the minority in Gaza will get food once or twice u people will know not get any food because they cannot get the whole way and wait because they are old they are ill uh they are babies you know this is really a way of decimating Gaza okay okay i' I'd like to speak uh further in just a minute about the the biometrics the iris scans that that you mentioned there but but Jana let me come back to you because if you can I mean tell us how this total failure of aid distribution now and all the corruption and you know to hear him describe it time again now as a mafia organization all of that how does it feed into your history as a Palestinian and correspond with you know today marking Naka Day yeah uh I mean look Nexa Day isn't just something that Palestinians commemorate on a day or another it's something that they continue to endure it's really the daily reality and what we're witnessing in Gaza today it's the sequel shall we say the the force displacement the military control the denial of very basic rights it's the same story just uh different tactics and when you know when Israeli officials like Smotri uh openly speak of um pushing Gazans out of their homeland and when uh these aid corridors double up as tools to force people further south uh then it is the NAKa and the Nakba all over again it's just now it comes with rebranded language it comes with 2,000 uh pound bombs and it is live streamed for the whole world to witness um from behind their phone screens yeah it's I don't have words anymore because the depths of the the destruction of of everything we've seen here is just it's now so far beyond description but Khaled now as as Kim mentioned Israel is looking at the use of biometrics those those iris scans we've heard about to to check those receiving aid what kind of door does that open here once that that technology is introduced well it's it's extremely dangerous uh we've already seen instances uh I think on the very first day u in addition to people being killed there were people who were abducted and disappeared uh people who were waiting in line uh for uh to receive their uh meager rations and uh they are clearly you know they are as part of the process they're inquiring about certain family members uh other members of their household uh of people who uh who are waiting in line um and trying to leverage that to to use the the the food distribution as intelligence gathering um and of course when you have a massive biometric surveillance operation in place that is tracking the movements of of every man woman and child uh in Gaza um that is not for the safety of those individuals uh or even uh Israel's security that is for control and that is uh ultimately for uh I believe disposing of of the population and and I think it's pretty clear and and frankly it's not even just you know fanatics like Smatri uh and Ben Prime Minister Netanyahu is saying it openly that there will not be a ceasefire uh until the world agrees uh to the Trump plan the Trump plan being the removal of the entire population of Gaza so he says it openly um they don't hide it anymore and and I believe this uh very cynical food distribution is is in furtherance of that uh ultimate objective yeah him you know the uh government spokesperson David Menser very articulately frighteningly articulately explained why uh Israeli security forces shot at crowds that were heading to a distribution center for for those meager rations you talked about he said that there were you know people remind us all among among these giant crowds of hungry people that were deviating from the crowd and then moving kind of toward Israeli troops and that they were warned to back off from these distribution sites but they did not and then here the Israeli troops had to fire in self-defense how is that playing out in Israel itself is is it still being bought as the narrative that every killing of a Gazin civilian is somehow in self-defense i think that uh less and less people in Israel believe this but unfortunately uh the Western media buys into this and and gulps it um as uh as truth um we've he we've heard him this is the official liar of the Israeli government um and he had been lying for 19 months and he continues to do that and they still invite him to speak and actually some of the people who interview him tell him that he's lying but he continues to lie uh this is about breaking the Palestinian people breaking their bodies breaking their morale uh making them um easier to export as packages uh to other countries uh other countries that didn't come and and offer it either so uh this is about continuing the Naka and the Nakba in uh a different more nasty way uh when uh yesterday in this interview of Mercer um he was asked um about the shooting uh and uh did these people that uh advanced towards the soldiers as he said um were they armed he didn't answer of course they none of none of the people we see on the screen are armed these are uh you know people that are trying to find food um they don't uh actually um fight um Hamas they fight the whole of Palestine which they want to empty not just Gaza but the rest of Palestine everyone understands it apart from the Western media you know Jan most aid workers in the region complained I mean dating years back now that these were almost impossible conditions to work in to try and get aid fairly to Gazins even when it was only described as you know an open air prison even before the October September 7th attacks but now you have countless people in need they are starving so how can any logistical operation even go smoothly enough to save the number of lives that need help right now is there a way do you believe do you have hope that there is a way to conduct such a logistical operation and that gazins can be saved if conditions were to change i think we do need to support a return to principled civilian humanitarian leadership un has done this really well un agencies there are many NOS's uh that used to do this um but more importantly we really do need to deal with the root cause the siege the occupation the repeated dehumanization of Palestinians because even before this you know this blockade of the past few months um I mean it makes you wonder like 80 and you know a year and a half of bombing Palestinians of children being obliterated to pieces was something that the world was able to tolerate but now suddenly after a few months of blockade of people going hungry the world is kind of shifting it's kind of saying this is a red line so bombing people and destroying their homes destroying the infrastructure destroying schools houses universities everything is being obliterated everything is being destroyed in the Gaza Strip that is all tolerated but now that people are hungry and we need to bring aid in that's the the the final red line i I Yeah I'm so sorry to interrupt but we're actually over time uh for this edition of our program but I'd like to thank all three of you sincerely so much for joining me so much appreciated and join thank our viewers for being with us

          <attvalue for="7" value="Hello. – Hi. Do you speak English? – Yes. Can I ask you a question? We're looking for the green line, do you know where the green line is? It doesn't exist. – It doesn't exist? All of Israel is our land. All of Israel is yours? – Yeah. Did the the green line used to exist? – No, never. You don't recognise the green line, there is no green line? God gave us Israel, all of it. Reporting in the Middle East for over 20 years, I've seen the conflict between  Israelis and Palestinians deepen, shift and return to the same painful questions again and again. At one point, there was hope for a resolution based on the green line. Drawn in 1949 to separate Israel from the West Bank in Gaza, it was seen as the boundaries of a possible two-state solution. But today, amid Israel's devastating war in Gaza and the occupation of the West Bank, that vision feels more distant than ever. The green line still exists on maps, but on the ground it's been blurred, physically, politically and in  ways that continue to inflame the conflict.   How can you have your next door neighbour saying,  'I want to have a safe house right next door to you and also I want to kill you and I want to drive you into the sea.' In this series, I'm travelling along the green line, meeting  Palestinians and Israelis living just kilometres apart, but shaped by vastly different realities, to discover whether peace is still possible and what future they envision. Now in this moment, I'm looking, and I see the Dome of the Rock, and I see the al-Aqsa, and I know things are going to change in Jerusalem.   In episode one, I begin in Jerusalem, a city at the heart of the conflict, and where divisions run deep. Excuse me, do you know where the Green Line is? It used to be here somewhere, I think. I don't know. It's not here any more? – No, I don't know. All right, thank you. Do you know where the green line is? This way? – Straight. OK, shukran. Do you know where the green gine is? No idea. – Do you know what the green line is? No idea. I don't know anything about it. Go from there, all the way to the right. Is it a border, do I need my passport? [Laughs] No? – You don't need your passport. OK, thank you, shukran. I'll go find it, thank you, thank you. For most of those I ask, the green line no longer exists in Jerusalem,  and hasn't for a long time. In many ways, the erasure of the green line began in 1967, when Israel occupied the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including here in East Jerusalem. Sorry? We didn't occupy the Gaza Strip, it's ours. What did – What did the gentleman say? He's saying that Israel never occupied the Gaza Strip or the West Bank,  that these territories belong to Israel, they're theirs. years after the occupation began, Israel  annexed the eastern part of the city, expanding Jerusalem and declaring it as the complete and united capital of Israel. For Palestinians, many of whom were displaced from western Jerusalem during the creation of Israel in 1948, the ongoing occupation is a painful reminder  of the loss of their most important city. Why? Today does the green line  still have any meaning for you? This is 'bullshit' in English. For me, this is my past and it's my future, and for you, when you come here, it's a story. For us, this isn't a story. It's our life and it's our survival. As the the Arabs express themselves, they're saying, 'no Jews should live in Israel', and they say it openly. They have an open agenda not a hidden – But I think the official position of the Palestinian government in any case has been of one of two states. Is that not something you would support? One of the three characteristics of a Jew is that they're compassionate, and we're compassionate until they're standing with rifles at us wanting to kill us and kill our children. Then we say, hang on a second, a two-state solution? Before we can talk about a two-state solution, we need to say, 'are you willing to live in peace?' The majority of those living in East Jerusalem are Palestinians but since the occupation began, an increasing number of Israeli settlers have crossed the Green Line and moved into Palestinian areas of the city. Shalom. Tziporah Piltz is one such settler. A mother of 10 and a tour guide, she's chosen to raise her family in the Arab neighbourhood of Ras al-Amud. Her home is located in the middle of a Jewish cemetery and overlooks one of Islam's holiest sites, al-Aqsa Mosque compound. We'll walk around over here, we'll see the view of the Temple Mount. Let's do it. – OK, let's go. We've lived here for 23 years. This is a very special cemetery because in the redemption, we're going to have the Messiah, we're going to have the temple, and all the dead people are going to become alive again so it's going to start from here, from the Mount of Olives. That's why people – – This is where going to where it's going to – Exactly, it's going to start from here. – OK, interesting. This is East Jerusalem and I like to talk about the Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem. You see there's a wall at the end of the the trees over there? – Yeah. They have 10 families living over there. Now all the mountain over there, that you see there now, is empty, that's going to be a big Jewish  neighbourhood of 300 families. So who makes that? The Jerusalem municipality, the Israeli government?  The Israeli government, yeah. That will be the eastern neighbourhood of of Yerushalayim What does it feel like for you, living, as you described, surrounded by Palestinian Arabs from this community in East Jerusalem. Well I feel it's a privilege, OK, living here,   because the first reason is as making  all Yerushalayim, all Jerusalem to be Jewish, that's like one of our aims, and to live overlooking the holiest site, overlooking the Temple Mount. This is the reason why I live here, you see this is my house over here. Wow, I have never seen the old city from this perspective. Yeah, this is amazing, amazing. The world was founded from this spot, OK, because over here is still the first temple of King Solomon, over here is the second temple of King Herod, and I believe where is going to be the third temple. So tell me about that, you say you want to build the third temple, why is that important to you? After the destruction of the second temple, we were all separated to Poland, Germany and Morocco and Yemen. What kept the Jews in all of these countries is the coming back to our nation, to our homeland, and rebuilding the Third Temple. Now, in this moment, I'm looking and I see the Dome of the Rock and I see the al-Aqsa and I know that it doesn't have to be in this spot. So, is there a place for both of them to exist or do you have to actually destroy one of those Islamic sites in order to build the temple?   We cannot have a mosque together with the Third Temple together, it doesn't go together. Meaning one of those structures, the al-Aqsa mosque, has to go in order for the temple to be built? Yes. My daily music. Instead of hearing the muezzin calling people to pray, I know that I'm supposed to hear the levites playing their instruments in the temple. I know it's music I'm supposed to hear, this is something temporarily,  it's not supposed to be in Israel. Do you ever see a solution based around two states –  one for Israelis one for Palestinians – based on the Green Line?   Definitely not. To give the Palestinian state, it means to give away, to give up, my homeland. The more settlements we'll have in Judea and the more settlements we're going to have in Samaria, that will solve our side because we need Jews, not only living in Tel Aviv and Haifa, we need two million, three millions Jews living in those in our original homeland. Now you're asking what to do with all the Arabs, and uh – That's a logical question to ask next, I mean, what about all the Arabs that are living already in East Jerusalem in these neighbourhoods that you mentioned. OK, so first of all, we have to know that Jerusalem is the capital of the state of Israel. If other people want to live here, they're welcome, they could live in Jerusalem, but they have their obligations what to do, OK. If the Palestinians you mentioned were to to stay  in Jerusalem, what would they need to do exactly?   First of all, recognise that things are going to change in the Temple Mount, we're going to have the Third Temple, OK. Things are going to change. Look, we have a lot of Arab countries all over the world, and we have only one homeland.  Everybody has to accept that this is our homeland But for Palestinians like Ramzi Abbassi, whose roots to Jerusalem trace back generations, this is the only homeland he's ever known. Like Tziporah, Ramsey is also a tour guide of Jerusalem. With a large following on social media, he creates videos about the issues facing Palestinians in this ancient city. Hi, Ramzi. – How are you doing, kefak. How's it going, nice to meet you, Matthew. The green line was here. – Yes, here, exactly. If a Palestinian from  the Gaza Strip or the West Bank, they want to come to Jerusalem, are they able to? and you have a lot of soldiers  and police walking around, I guess? in 2023, Ramzi was convicted by an Israeli court for communicating with a person affiliated with a terror group and for working with a banned social media platform, charges he vehemently denies. I've been noticing, we've been trying to talk with a lot of Palestinians here in East Jerusalem and a lot of people they're scared to say anything political, why is that? You're not worried about yourself to talk about these things? After taking me on a tour, Ramzi joins his  family for a meal at their favourite spot,   on the rooftops of the old city,  overlooking the al-Aqsa compound. How is it to live in Jerusalem? The Israelis will say they're doing all of this because they're worried about attacks from Palestinians, that they need to do all this for self-defence, what do you say to that? So, what's the solution then? As we eat, a group of a few dozen Jewish  Israeli women turn up on a tour of their own.   Leading the group is Tziporah. How's it going, we're filming. I'm giving a tour. – Are you? We've been going around the Old City  today just meeting all kinds of people   and it's funny we came across you here. So what are you doing? It's a tour that the whole aim of it is, first  of all, a connection between mothers and daughters. None of the women over here are from  Jerusalem, all of them are out of Jerusalem to increase the rebuilding of the temple, that's the whole aim of the tour, this is what we do. In the next episode, I'll travel north along the green line to the city of Tulkarm, meeting Palestinians  displaced from their homes and speaking with Israelis living in towns just across the wall facing the edge of the West Bank." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="one sure sign that the narrative the tide is turning on Israel's war on Gaza when a former Israeli prime minister describes the war as genocidal enough is enough medics getting the story out the doctors and nurses filling in the vacuum in the news coverage and taking a look under the hood of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the agenda never has been to provide humanitarian aid to the Palestinians an organization that does not do what its name implies more than 600 days into its horrific war on Palestinians in Gaza even Israel's most loyal allies from foreign governments to news organizations have been forced to confront reality from Berlin to London Paris to Ottawa support for Israel is turning into disapproval verging on condemnation over the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in the strip starving Palestinians have been lining up for food aid supplied by an organization that is the brainchild of the American and Israeli governments and looks more like a PR exercise than a humanitarian response the external political pressure along with rising dissent within Israel over the Netanyahu government's waging of this war is having an effect on the media narrative there and fracturing a consensus that goes all the way back to October 7th 2023 try as the Israelis might it will take more than a trickle of humanitarian aid to silence their critics more than propaganda to hide the war crimes it is committing when they talk about Israel and its genocidal ways in Gaza European politicians choose their words carefully particularly German ones like the chancellor Friedrich who went on the state funded broadcaster where he said finally and more than once that Israel has gone too far we have been hearing more and more international criticism germany's is probably the most significant one because of the historical baggage that guilt of the Holocaust that brought Germany to just accept and support whatever crime Israel has been committing so the fact that even Germany can no longer whitewash Israel's crime is extremely significant at the same time the foreign minister said &quot;But you know what we will not ban the weapons to Israel we reject an arms embargo so the European government is saying &quot;We condemn a killing spree but we will give the killer a sharper knife.&quot; Telling Israel &quot;What you're doing is morally wrong and might lead to negative consequences but we're not going to implement those consequences yet.&quot; With the European governments you can see stronger statements at the moment but statements basically bounce off Israel's iron dome of impunity from mers of all people it is truly too little too late and I await to see whether Palestinian solidarity activists students who have been calling out this genocide and facing brutal policing in some cases deportation i look forward to Meltz welcoming all those people back to Germany and telling them that they were right all along chancellor Meritz added Germany's name to a growing list of Western countries including France the UK and Canada that have criticized Israel over this war threatened it with sanctions but have not yet acted that effectively buys the Israelis time which they are using to keep punishing Palestinians cloaking their war crimes under the cover of organizations like the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the GHF after consistently blocking aid from getting into Gaza and attacking the agencies trying to help Palestinians including the UN's the Israelis teamed up with American military contractors mercenaries to create the GHF whose first foray into Gaza proved disastrous crowds of hungry Palestinians were herded like animals into an aid depot in Rafa humiliating scenes worthy of a concentration camp the crowd surged overwhelming those contractors shots were fired at least three Palestinians were killed the government media office in Gaza called it a deliberate massacre a full-fledged war crime committed against civilians suffering siege induced starvation people in Gaza are literally starving especially children because their bodies are not able to to withstand that that level of malnutrition even some of Israel's staunchest allies are now coming out to criticize Israel for its starvation campaign because this war has gone on for far too long we cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve it's not because they're having these big epiphies that that mass slaughter of Palestinians is wrong there's a great liberal centrist tradition of standing on the right side of history only when the relevant moment to do so has significantly passed we are seeing that grand liberal tradition be repeated now by Kama Emanuel Macron Mark Carney and other leaders who are only willing to condemn but indeed not stop Israel's activities at this point i think future proofing of reputation to say &quot;Oh but we did indeed speak up might very much be in play here.&quot; But those of us who have been paying any attention at all for the last year and a half plus are all too aware that these very governments have been funding and ideologically enabling uh Israel's actions throughout its war on Gaza Israeli officials from Benjamin Netanyahu on down have routinely dismissed allegations of war crimes as inherently anti-semitic the anti-semitic decision of the international court in the H is a modern driver that argument is more difficult to make now since more and more of those accusations are coming from Israelis including a former prime minister what is it if not a war crime ehood Ol first made that argument in a liberal Israeli paper Harets before repeating it on CNN golan a former army chief of staff turned opposition leader is another who has strayed from the path there have also been shifts in coverage in the Israeli media although limited and more common in the print sector than the broadcast side they are notable in that they reflect what is occurring politically almer is one of the earliest founders of Netanyahu's party Lioot so he's known left-wing pro Palestinian peace he's the guy that carried out one of Israel's most atrocious wars on Gaza Operation Gas so to see him now condemning what Israel is doing in Gaza as a war of annihilation as genocide it is extraordinary it speaks basically of how far Israel has gone this moment is ripe for the likes of Yer Golan and and other opposition figures in Israel because Netanyahu is facing increased pressure and leaders around the world will be happy to scapegoat Netanyahu as the perpetrator of this genocide in Gaza rather than face the reality that this was a genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian people by the state itself and so this moment presents an opportunity to put all the blame on Netanyahu both internally and internationally israel is now panicking realizing that their strategy of repeated atrocities to exhaust the global attention did not work that's why you had saying our propaganda is collapsing our legitimacy is over and you had Israel Hom saying the world is talking less about us and more about Gaza and their solution is not to end the genocide but to propagandize more to whitewash the genocide even more to double down on the failing strategy that didn't work without a doubt there are media outlets and journalists who are reassessing their position regarding this war and Wet is a good example they're showing more pictures of what's going on in Gaza speaking through the angle of starvation referring to it more and more overall however Israeli media coverage that allows for empathy for Palestinians remains the exception not the rule [Music] [Applause] 600 days into this war there have never been more lives at risk in Gaza where day after day GHF aid depots have produced nightmarish scenes of desperation and violence politicians overseas out to salvage their legacies could be enough to save some of those lives but as Israeli journalists well know there will be no saving of reputations on the Israeli airwaves the moral standing of news channels that too many citizens there still use as their primary source of information if you're only consuming Israeli media in Hebrew you will know less about what the Israeli army is doing in Gaza than probably any given citizen in the rest of the world the Israeli media has been a collaborator with this genocidal mindset and actually promoting it and by concealing the Holocaust of Gaza from the eyes of the Israeli public when the day comes that the criminals responsible for this genocide will stand on trial i think next to them on the bench the Israeli media should be located there's a reason that um experts in genocide studies and humanitarians are using terms like final solution for this stage of the genocide in Gaza we're seeing images of children burnt trapped in schools the reports we're hearing from the imperiled hospitals has prompted certain world leaders to speak up but that shouldn't lead any viewers to think that this is because there's been some sort of uh dramatic aberration by the Israeli military this is a continuation and an escalation in Gaza after so many many months of this kind of genocidal warfare throughout Israel's war on Gaza health care workers have become key voices in the reporting of this story and over the past couple of weeks the dispatches coming out of hospitals there have grown more and more desperate minakshi Ravi has been tracking this story gaza's health care system and the Palestinians who work in it have been systematically targeted by Israel for nearly 20 months now at least 94% of all hospitals in the strip have been damaged or destroyed more than 1,400 healthcare workers have been killed with thousands of doctors and nurses arrested the few who have made it out of prison say their Israeli captives reserved specific brutal torture for medics international doctors who have traveled in with aid groups now say their mission goes beyond medicine the main thing is to come here to bear witness because you're not seeing what I'm seeing because there's been a complete block to all media i am getting very sick and tired of having as as are all my colleagues of having to go onto the the news programs because journalists aren't allowed in etc to to point out what is happening here physicians returning from Gaza have also been outspoken on how dire the situation there has become the starvation the particular nature of the burns and injuries they are seeing and the targeting of Palestinian medics people need to understand that civilians their families uh healthare workers are are being intentionally and deliberately killed and I just want to say that the IDF have said in their statement regarding this uh attack in Kunis they've said that the IDF evacuated civilians from this area you don't ask the perpetrator of of of genocide we have to Dr hassan we have to ask the Israeli government if you also in addition to that response mentioned that Amn A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A amnesty international doctors without borders human rights watch the international court of justice would all beg to differ this past week American trauma surgeon Dr firo Sidwa delivered testimony to the United Nations Security Council i'm not here as a policy maker or a politician i am a physician bearing witness to the deliberate destruction of a health care system the targeting of my own colleagues and the eraser of a people these doctors are not isolated voices they have formed a network of sorts a valuable one to fill the void in reporting on this story caused by Israel's refusal to let journalists into Gaza and its killing of so many Palestinian reporters more than 200 of them thanks Mina in our lead story we touched on the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the GHF formed just months ago it is an American Israeli coalition that includes ex CIA and military personnel it is a shadowy group that started distributing aid in the southern end of the strip this past week there is not a single international aid organization that has endorsed or cooperated with the GHF instead from the UN to Oxfam to Medsan Frontier warnings have been issued that the GHF is militarized privatized and politicized an exercise in quote aidwashing when a pretense of aid is designed to cover up something else entirely one of the news outlets tracking the GHF closely with reporting from Palestinian journalists in Gaza is Drop Site News its co-founder Jeremy Scill joins us now jeremy let's start with the name of this organization now handling aid in the war zone the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the GHF out to do what its name implies not in any way shape or form i mean f first of all let's just get one basic fact straight the amount of so-called aid that it's distributing is is a pittance relative to what is needed in these starvation conditions in Gaza that are being enforced as an act of war by the USbacked Israeli regime it's incredibly cynical to use the term humanitarian in this name because Netanyahu himself has been very clear that this is a scam a scheme that is intended to kind of quiet some of the criticism that Netanyahu has received primarily from Republican senators who have said &quot;We don't like the appearance of starvation in Gaza so if you can create the facade that you're actually doing something then we're going to make sure that the weapons keep flowing and our support for your war of annihilation continues i mean Richard you couldn't get uh a a sort of uh starker symbol of what the agenda is here that you have a circumvention of an existing program that was effective that you have American mercenaries deployed on the ground that you have Israelis opening fire at desperate starving Palestinians and that it's all actually out in the open that the intent of this is to be uh just sort of a facade of humanitarianism to enable a genocide the GHF's aid distribution got off to a bad start this week the images that have come out of this the Palestinians in those caged pens lining up for food when you looked at those images what went through your mind well look I've been speaking to sources on the ground we have reporters inside of Gaza and my understanding is that there was almost no coordination whatsoever with uh local aid organizations to even inform people where they would be able to go to pick up these parcels or what would be inside of the parcels people just heard through text message WhatsApp word of mouth there's going to be aid dropped in this location and so because the population is starving and you have acute malnutrition among thousands of children people started to trek through incredibly dangerous terrain and they arrive at these sites and and it was very chaotic in some cases they were using biometric identification systems or interrogating people in others they forced or almost like cattle Palestinians into barbed wire fencing apparatus um on the first day that they started getting uh this aid distribution underway um we heard from sources inside of Gaza that a man had been kidnapped when he was interrogated by Israeli intelligence they got his family on the phone they were supposedly looking for some relative that the family hadn't been in touch with uh since the start of the war and when he didn't provide information that they were demanding from him they disappeared him that family has no idea where he is we've heard of at least a dozen or so more uh other people that were snatched when they went to go and get aid also the Israelis uh opened fire at one point they say that it was warning shots um but Palestinians were killed you know Israelis compare Palestinians to animals and this is part of what the plan is they want to essentially bait them into a cage shut the door behind them and then they either get killed in this killing cage or the ultimate plan which they call Trump's plan is to take that cage filled with Palestinians of Gaza and ship them to another country what we are witnessing here right now is is a a completely disgusting trap that Palestinians are being forced to as part of what Netanyahu has described as the final stage of his war to conquer Gaza now its backers say that the GHF is specifically designed to bypass the UN its relief agency ENROA why do the Israelis and the Americans involved in this say that that's even necessary the bypassing of established tried and tested systems of aid distribution richard it's because the the agenda never has been to provide humanitarian aid to the Palestinians um UNRA was established uh around the same time as the state of Israel was imposed on Palestine and and the reason that Israel has always stood against UNRA is because it is perhaps the most powerful symbol that uh that makes it clear that Palestinians have a right of return to their land have a right of return to their homes what we saw from the the the the moments after the October 7th operations happened inside of Israel was a very intense campaign to try to demonize the United Nations as a whole but UNRA specifically and the Israelis began planting stories that said that scores of UNRA employees had participated in the October 7th attacks and perhaps the the chief launderer of this narrative in the media was the Wall Street Journal and those stories were actually published with a by line uh of one of the reporters who herself was a uh a former IDF soldier and they they essentially portrayed UNRA as a Hamas front organization the United States and other countries responded to this propaganda and they admitted that they didn't even do their own independent review by moving swiftly to try to defund UNRA when the United States and major US media outlets began serving as conveyor belts for the lies of Israel about UNRA this was a devastating uh series of events and UNRA has been fighting for its life and so by creating an alternative pathway that circumvents international bodies that essentially seeks to to disintegrate UNRA what Israel is doing is saying &quot;We want to always be in control of the calorie intake of Palestinians we want to be able to shut off the water we want to be able to shut off the food we want to be able to block the medicine.&quot; The intent of this is to create the appearance of some alternative that would be viable to UNRA while at the same time ensuring full spectrum domination of Israel over the lives of Palestinians in Gaza you and Dropsite have done extensive reporting on the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation how difficult has it been to do that how transparent is this organization what kind of challenges are you facing in trying to tell this story you know as someone who's done a lot of reporting on mercenary organizations um and CIA front organizations it looked like what we would call a cutout that it's not actually intended to be what the public is being told but that it was set up for an alternative purpose sometimes intelligence agencies or governments set up fake companies uh to try to cover their employees as they do espionage other times they try to set up a company that has some legitimate front to it but the agenda is different i think we can safely say that the fact that there's very little information that's been released that we know the connections to both Israeli and American intelligence that this was intended to be a cutout uh that would serve the purpose of uh allowing Netanyahu to continue his war of annihilation while claiming that they're actually giving aid to people um in Gaza but Israel has been very effective with its propaganda in part because of its allies in the Western media particularly American and British news organizations that have promoted these lies or have not pushed back hard enough in demanding evidence so you know at some point uh all of these governments and officials are going to come out and pretend like they were always against the genocide we're seeing more and more media outlets coming out and taking that position we're seeing more and more academics and scholars taking that position you're seeing former Biden administration officials taking that position well history is full of people who want to be right uh through hindsight courage means speaking out in real time and so this should serve as a very serious lesson for journalists and governments when it comes to Israel you cannot ever believe the first draft of what they say you know Ronald Reagan used to say trust but verify in the case of Israel you have to assume it is lying and then check the facts jeremy Scill Drop Site News always great to have you on the show thanks again for speaking with us here today thank you Richard" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="The Israeli army confirmed the death of one soldier and the serious injury of another in an ambush by Hamas' al-Qassam Brigades in Northern Gaza’s Shujayeah neighbourhood. This follows three other soldiers killed in Jabalia a day earlier, bringing the toll to four in two days. The mounting casualties intensify pressure on Israel’s government, with growing domestic calls to end the war amid concerns for both soldiers and remaining captives in Gaza. Meanwhile, Hamas demands permanent ceasefire guarantees, asking for guarantees that a 60-day truce would result in a permanent ceasefire. Further complicating matters, ultra-Orthodox parties in Netanyahu’s coalition are resisting military conscription, threatening to collapse the government.

          <attvalue for="7" value="the Israeli armies confirmed the death of a soldier and the serious wounding of another in the Shuaya neighborhood east of Gaza city on Tuesday they've reportedly been killed in an ambush by Alcasam brigades the armed wing of Hamas it comes a day after the Israeli army said three soldiers were killed in Jabalia well let's speak to our correspondent Nidita Ibrahim who's here in the studio with me so Nidita another Israeli soldier killed that's four in two days i mean how will that be received in Israel given the mounting pressure from many there to end the war and concerns not only for the safety and security of soldiers but also of the captives still in Gaza indeed and that is the fourth soldier as you say in just two days of course tomorrow this morning the Israeli army has made the official announcement about the killing of the soldier but it comes exactly a day after three Israeli soldiers were killed in combat in Gaza as the Israeli forces are pushing into their ground operation inside the Gaza Strip as a way that they say that they're putting pressure on Hamas to kind of accept the uh uh US envoy Steve Wkov's proposal for a ceasefire now Hamas has been saying they want more guarantees that this ceasefire would be permanent and not just a 60-day one that would guarantee basically the continuation of the end of the war but as you see here Israel is not really finding it easy to push forward inside Gaza and four soldiers in two days is also mounting pressure on the government that has already been struggling not only because of the pressures of how many soldiers have been wounded how many have been announced traumatized so basically they cannot be called as reserveist but also because there are families of captives who are saying not only are we losing uh uh time now with captives being subject to danger because of the Israeli military pressure inside Gaza but we are there there are also concerns that they might lose even more captives as these soldiers are uh crossing further into the Gaza territory and regarding pressure on the government there's also pressure coming from within Israel from the ultraorththodox community as well tell us more yes the ultra orthodox community now represented in the kesset the Israeli parliament par parliament in two uh uh uh parties have been saying that they want to draft a law to enshrine a law in the Israeli parliament that prevents the conscription of these Jews the ultraorththodox Jews and this issue comes at a time after the 7th of October where the Israeli prime minister cannot really advance and push for such a law as his army is really in need for so many soldiers especially as we have been talking about the numbers of losses and the numbers of uh people who cannot serve because of injuries so you are talking about a situation where Netanyahu is being really pressured by these ultraorththodox parties that are part of his coalition now they are saying that they will be demanding the uh Knesset to pass legislation to bring the government down now this is something for next week but it's something that is really irking the Israeli prime minister putting him in a very difficult position and these killings of these four Israeli soldiers for in just two days further complicates the scene the Heredi Jews the ultraorthodox Jews are firmly against serving the army because they believe it's against their fundamental beliefs is that right anita many thanks to Anita Ibraim there make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from Alazer" />

The 97th country by population, it is the ninth largest arms dealer in the world with a $13bn military-industrial complex.&#10;&#10;&quot;Plenty of countries sell weapons,&quot; says award-winning journalist Antony Loewenstein, &quot;but what makes Israel's industry unique is the mix of weapons, surveillance technology and architectural techniques that combine to create a comprehensive system for controlling 'difficult' populations and are based on years of experience in Palestine.&quot;&#10;&#10;In this two-part series, Loewenstein goes on a journey to investigate how these weapons and surveillance technologies are used to control and repress Palestinians in Palestine before being sold all over the world.&#10;&#10;Antony Loewenstein is a Jewish, Australian journalist and author who for more than 20 years has written unflinchingly about Israel and its relationship with the Palestinians, even though it has often put him at odds with many in the Jewish diaspora and Israel.&#10;&#10;In Episode 1, Loewenstein returns to Israel to investigate how cutting-edge military and surveillance technology is being used on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip, before being marketed to international clients as &quot;field-proven&quot; and &quot;battle-tested&quot;.&#10;&#10;Hearing from Palestinians and Israelis, he uncovers how a pipeline of personnel and research from the Israeli army feeds into semi-private arms companies which form a crucial part of Israel's exports to the world. He also investigates the Israeli army's use of targeting systems that utilise artificial intelligence during the Gaza war after October 7, 2023.&#10;&#10;Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe&#10;Follow us on X: https://x.com/ajenglish&#10;Find us on Facebook:   / aljazeera  &#10;Check our website:  https://www.aljazeera.com&#10;Check out our Instagram page:   / aljazeeraenglish  &#10;Download AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile&#10;&#10;#TheTruthUncovered #documentary #ThePalestineLaboratory #AlJazeeraEnglish #palestine #israel #technology #westbank #gaza #surveillance #aljazeera" />

Israel Aerospace Industries and missile makers Raphael in the main hall Israel's largest private weapons company Elbert has a huge stand they need it to Showcase their worldclass drones and missiles despite its tiny population Israel is the world's ninth largest weapons producer aom this High budget promo is for the trophy anti-missile system made by Israeli company Raphael it's the kind of advanced technology Israel specializes in and makes the Israeli MK for tank one of the best on the market automatically activated only when enemy fire is sure to hit the vehicle both tank and anti-missile Systems sell around the world to undisclosed clients overall Israel exports more than $13 billion of weapons and surveillance equipment a year and with adverts like this for the spike Firefly Israeli companies hint that their products may have been battle tested in Palestine so how does being a major armed supplier impact Israel's diplomatic position could it give the country a measure of impunity when it wants to undertake its own [Music] Wars I've just got a stash of books from my publisher today uh my book and other books mostly related to Palestine and uh Guerilla journalism just some light reading I'm about to do an event a Q&amp;A about my book The Palestine laboratory the book's been quite controversial it's a look at how the occupation of Palestine allows Israel to test weapons which are then sold around the world I wanted to do a book really not just about the whole concept of the arms indust industry which is an interesting subject but can be a bit dry but what Israel is testing and selling and promoting is not just Weaponry it's an idea it's a concept and it's a very appealing concept to many other countries Israel sells the idea of getting away with it to find out how tiny Israel has managed to develop this huge military and surveillance machine I'm heading back to Israel and Palestine it's not really clear if I'm going to get in I haven't been there for a few years wish me luck although I'm Jewish I'm not a citizen of Israel and their immigration rules say they can refuse entry to critics of the country or those who have called for boycotts so they have multiple reasons for turning me away my arrival was surprisingly smooth so I'm heading straight to East Jerusalem Israel has been occupying the West Bank since 1967 and has developed a unique system of controlling the Palestinian population from checkpoints in the separation wall to increasingly Innovative methods of surveillance these walls are not just walls they can listen and they are listening to probably us right now I suspect it's it's in these population management technologies that Israel is a global leader so I want to see how they first use it to control Palestinians before being sold around the world I'm on my way to Mama a businessman in East Jerusalem to find out how all this impacts ordinary [Music] Palestinians you can see my office from this camera inside so the cameras are both looking into Damascus gate but also out in and out so I'm standing on a balcony literally overlooking Damascus gate it's osama's office his insurance office and all around behind me over there there's multiple surveillance Towers right behind me there's a camera watching me so I'm going to watch it Asama wants to show me the very physical reality of the occupation the restrictions on the movement of Palestinians his daily commute from the West Bank to Jerusalem is through the Candia checkpoint AMA how do you feel when you cross kandia checkpoint you're crying I 24 hours about my my daughter my son if he need me I am here and this is traffic I need 3 Hour 4 hour to go to to help my son you understand that I do I can understand why this would make you nervous you can see Soldier here any mistake you lost your life and that's happened many times yes the soldiers have the power to detain people like aama for hours question them and place them in administrative detention without charge or trial [Music] should ask that's it I can go I ask him it's almost like you have to ask permission to go into Jerusalem to get back to your own City but this physical infrastructure is just the beginning Israel has a vision of a seamless future where technology minimizes the interactions between Palestinians and the Israeli Army Israel says it's safer but it's quite dystopic my hi a meeting Palestinian digital rights campaigner monaa to find out more explain the growing Trend within Israeli thinking of a so-called frictionless occupation well the whole automation aims to eliminate the the direct interaction between the Israeli as occupying force and Palestinians as occupied people and to make the main interaction between Palestinians and the technology so it could create this idea that our problem is not with the occupier but rather with a technology heon is the testing ground for many of these supposedly frictionless Technologies the city is split into two zones H1 with a population of nearly 200,000 in H2 355,000 Palestinians live under the Gaze of the 750 settlers and 800 soldiers who have taken over the center of the city Palestinians living in H2 face the heaviest surveillance in the West Bank and the strictest travel [Music] restrictions fore fore cat for under the so-called frictionless occupation these cameras are linked to artificial intelligence systems watching for what Israel deames threatening behavior there's someone who watch you who knows what you are doing but you don't necessar know who's watching you Palestinians need to think about behaving at our best all the time sometimes you might be angry from something that happens with your family in your home or at your work and then you might look like angry and with a predictive policing you never know when you would be identified as a security threat by the Israelis so you need to fake your emotions if the frictionless occupation can't get a fixed camera on you it can send a flying one this was recorded just a few miles south of Hebron [Applause] Issa Amro is a human rights activist living in H2 this is a military post full of cameras and surveillance and they watch us for sure now so let's say hi I usually say hi to them we are in the main street in teda Palestinians are not allowed to drive here pal shops are closed by military orders and the street here is full of Israeli military surveillance let's see the Palestinian K kids in the window they are caged in the house look they they put fences in their Windows to be protected from the settler and army violence look surveillance for the military is up there and this is the surveillance of the Israeli settlers so imagine that the Israeli settlers they have their own systems here these checkpoints are where the latest frictionless technology is tested including this AI enabled remotely controlled gun which fires stung grenades tear gas and sponge tip bullets it's made by Israeli company smart shooter these checkpoints also boast Israel's most comprehensive data Gathering tool Wolfpack from 10 to 15 cameras are at the checkpoint this is where they use red wolf and blue wolf the Israeli military recently invented two systems red wolf and blue wolf blue wolf in the soldiers phones they take your photo then they know all details about you where you've been where you go what you like what you don't like your private things then there is another system the red wolf is set up in the checkpoints and in the control rooms and it's profiling Palestinians according to their political stands when the soldiers scan a Palestinian face they get a traffic light style indication of their supposed risk white for Palestinians who are not doing anything about occupation you have yellow and you have orange for example I'm a human rights Defender I am red it means check him make his life harder he's a suspect so the frictionless technology actually enables a lot more friction for some people they use us as simulation objects for their technology Israeli sec SEC solution companies they installed cameras sensors drones and they tested it on us without our consent do they sell it do they use it for other research what kind of data they collect it seems to be the often secret Partnerships between the military and private sector that have helped Israeli companies become world leaders in their fields in 2019 a report revealed that Israeli company any Vision had installed Styles in the West Bank and was collecting movement and biometric data from the tens of thousands of Palestinians forced to use them early investor Microsoft pulled their funding after this was revealed the company changed its name to Uso and says it works in 43 countries with clients including casinos airports and schools another Israeli company visites make behavioral recognition systems that watch CCTV feeds for any threats the company actually created the ability to take a realtime video stream and understand what's going on within the stream the company is supported by the Israeli military it's marketed for use in cities prisons and refugee camps around the [Music] world we're in abis in East Jerusalem and I'm standing next to a old but now derelict Hotel owned by Palestinians and during the second Intero in the early 2000s the separation wall was built and it's kind of surrounded now on all sides no one can access it the owners can't use it the guests are not coming but what Israel has done is on the top they've installed surveillance cameras the location is patrolled by police and private security 24 hours a day just a minute ago we saw the move probably to watch us minutes later four young Israeli police officers with machine guns approached us so what are you explaining about the situation this formerly Palestinian Run Hotel taken over by the military and turned into a surveillance post could be seen as a microcosm of the occupation but what is visible is just part of the overall picture of how the occupation surveils Palestinians first there is the physical infrastructure of walls and checkpoints the checkpoints record movement data and biometric information then they have CCTV cameras which are monitored by AI for perceived threats of violence and that in turn is hooked up to databases like red wolf which track everyone's political profile but there's also a more fundamental level of surveillance which is that most of the phone and internet system is routed through Israel Israel is controlling the ICT infrastructure in the in in the occupied Palestinian territory which means that Palestinians are not able to have safe access to the internet with control of basic Communications infrastructure the Israelis know every phone number and can tap any call Israeli intelligence also have teams monitoring all the social media platforms many Palestinians basically they don't share their political opinion online because they would be afraid of being interrogated or arrested by the Israelis I find it remarkable that sometimes blanket CCTV coverage analyzed by artificial intelligence and backed up by biometric movement tracking just isn't enough surveillance I'm off to meet a man who once presented such a threat to the authorities that they deployed the world's most invasive spye on him Anthony hithon lovely to meet you U alaboodi didn't look threatening to me he runs the bisan center which campaigns for the rights of Palestinians do you have any idea why you were targeted I think it has to do with the targeting of any kind of Palestinian Civil Society Israel sees us as part of a establishing that there is a Palestinian people how did you hear that your phone had been infected by Pegasus and why do you think that happened you're working with Palestinian human rights organization El haak right I was contact by alhak in late 2021 they found that one of their employees had Pegasus on his phone I had my device checked and they told me that my phone was infected by Pegasus spyware a couple of days later the Israeli uh Minister of Defense uh benig Gans designated six Palestinian Civil Society organization as terrorist organization including ban including ban Pegasus is unique spyware that can access every aspect of your phone it can take control of your camera your microphone and broadcast it to those controlling the software they can see your location access your data and see what's on your screen including encrypted messaging apps is there anything you feel like you can do or do you ultimately feel like there's not much you can practically do it was explained to me by a citizen lab that once a state actor goes after any citizen or small organization there's basically very little they can do Pegasus is produced by Israeli surveillance company NSO and is marketed to government agencies as a tool for fighting crime and terrorism in 2021 an investigation revealed that around 50,000 people worldwide potentially had it on their phones and a large number of them were journalists lawyers dissidents and human rights Defenders 1 2 34 we don't want your cyber War it's no accident that this spyware was developed in is much of nso's staff is drawn from the Army's cyber intelligence unit [Music] 88,200 this unit is tasked with Gathering intelligence from electronic communications and conducting cyber warfare against Palestinians it's known for being highly Innovative and spinning out successful cyber security companies like NSO to find out how 88,200 has helped Israel become a global leader in surveillance technology I'm meeting Yakov Perry a former director of the shined intelligence agency this one here was you dressed as an Arab in Gaza when do you think that was 88 1988 can you say what you were doing no okay that's um 68 yeah okay in ness okay so the first year after six day occupation yeah yeah here we have all kinds of of way to smuggle hangers what hangers also with explosives how has Israel sold itself really for decades now as a global leader in defense and homeland security equipment you cannot defend yourself only by a human uh sources you have to use also a technology in order to be on the uh pinning side Israel had to be very very very creative to find solutions that um you cannot buy in the market or the um around the world one of the innovators is unit 8200 it's been around for many years talk a little bit about based on your experience what that unit is we have developed a unique technology how to where to tape whom be be raped and the ability to reach to top secrets that usually are hidden we say that if a ruler wants to H do something it's is in his mind but he cannot do it alone he has to share it with at least one two three or four people who are close to him and we have developed Technologies that can reach the right persons that we will tap and know so 88,200 became a one of the secrets of Israeli intelligence I'm not asking you to reveal top secret intelligence but give a sense what are the kind of methods that Israel was using to try to get that intelligence if you want to follow a certain terrorist or a certain cell you have to be equipped with surveillance technology that gives you the advantage to watch him without him sensing you you have to develop ammunition which you can use in a remote control for a long distance so sometimes the you headquarters is in Tel Aviv and the terrorist cell is in Gaza Strip and you want to uh kill somebody you have to be very very accurate you have to be with a the best technology that you will not be accused by killing innocent people we are getting hits send the lanus Israel is a leader in remote control bombing with small drones like the controversial lanus systems presents lanus SE an attack in one new Innovative autonomous lethal solution they're part of the class of small highly maneuverable quadcopters getting extensive use for the first time in Gaza the high budget promo suggests it may have been battle tested in Palestine and the Drone is exactly what Perry is describing andity in a complex Urban environment a remote controlled explosive that can be put next to the Target Israel is now about the ninth or 10th biggest arms seller in the world it depends every year how does Israel become for a relatively small country one of the biggest arms sellers in the world yeah it's true that Israel is one of the biggest AR arms sellers we have been also selling a um all the technology that can help you to deal with terrorists I mean the whole world is dealing with terrorist activity so the market is big I would say that 80% of the technology that we have developed in Israel is not top secret it's something that you can share with other ER organizations mainly H security agencies and armies H for instance the most most common technology that we have developed here is the Iron Dome and now we can sell iron do to the whole world with a wave of its innovative wand Raphael has developed a first of its kind counter rocket artillery mortar cram system with pinpoint accuracy interceptors against asymmetric threats Iron Dome the Iron Dome is often used to refer to all of these Israel's anti-missile interception systems together they make Israel a world leader in anti-missile protection and are a showcase for Israel's weapons companies who are Keen to promote how Cutting Edge and Innovative they are aro3 the ARA system counters high altitude ballistic missiles and is made by Israel Aerospace Industries II also makes the cafir jet Heron drones and its own Jericho ballistic missiles they claim to offer comprehensive Solutions in all domains since Russia's invasion of Ukraine II are marketing their interception systems to European countries on us in 400 m exit right to find out more about Israel's military industrial complex I'm going to meet security and intelligence expert Yosi Melman Israel from the outset decid decided we have to build our own uh strong military industrial complex that realization has been always in the mind of Israel we have to be uh on top of our enemies from the scientific technological point of view Israel's been developing a range of new technologies and weapons certain kind of Robotics certain kinds of drones quadcopters explain a bit about what you understand is being used there has been a major shift in the focus of the Israeli Industries if 30 40 years ago Israel industries were still selling rifles pistols ammunition nowadays they have moved to more advanced technological equipment the logic is very positive to try to minimize Israel's own casualties it's safer to first move into the tunnels with a robot rather than sending your foood soldiers a formation of autonomous aerial and ground systems can provide unprecedented ISR capabilities to units on the Tactical Edge from 3D Legion X is the integrated combat system for controlling autonomous robotic vehicles and drones all made by Elbert Israel's largest private weapons producer Andy Legion is maximizing now worth nearly 10 billion Elbert promotes itself as leading the world in Automation and Robotics and this technical Mastery is key to how Israel has governed Gaza Israel directly occupied Gaza from 1967 to 2005 when the Israeli Army and settlers withdrew but Israel retained de facto control over the fundamentals of the territory Power Water who could enter and leave how far fishermen could go from the shore and even how many calories people have to eat eat every day the depth of this control was constantly updated with technology in 2021 defense minister Benny gance launched a smart fence stuffed with the latest tech including tunnel detection equipment in 2021 Israel unveiled a huge amount of new technology around Gaza theyd spent billions of dollars they claimed that it was going to keep Israel safe was going to keep Palestinians essentially in Gaza what exactly was being put in place around that time well all sorts of equipment Israel surrounded Gaza with all these Technologies facial recognition hacking telephones visual intelligence from drones reconnaissance flights reconnaissance balloons Israel had the phone numbers of many Hamas members and not only Kamas members also innocent people that information came from bugging and listening and Observatory equipment so so Gaza was surrounded by the equipment and Israel believed that they can control the population and they control above all Hamas the domestic security service shinb and the military intelligence mistake they almost adored worshiped technology but on October the 7th 2023 as part of a highly coordinated offensive hummus drones attacked the watchtowers disabling the CCTV and automated guns with few soldiers on the border the Army claims they were effectively blun to what unfolded Hamas Fighters quickly overran multiple bases which were sparsely manned and not prepared it is said that thousands of hamus Fighters and other Palestinians broke out of Gaza by land sea and air it was the most deadly single day in Israel's history Israel claims that 1,200 people were killed nearly 800 of them civilians and most of them Israeli and that another 250 were taken back to Gaza as hostages according to Hamas and international organizations these numbers have been inflated hamas's attack begs the question of how this multi-billion dollar smart fence armed with radar CCTV and surveillance drones could miss an assault that took years to plan and rehearse so I'm on my way to see Israel Z who's a former Israeli General and he used to actually had the Gaza command for the Israeli Army and o on October 7 he grabbed a gun from his home near Tel Aviv and went down to near the Gaza border to try to as he says kill Hamas terrorists and rescue hostages so let's go see him explain what happened to you on October 7th I've learned that I'm still good even with the pistol I had a chance to to to rescue quite a few people you know some of them were hiding in the area that theas control what do you think as far as we know went horribly wrong everything it's the system collaps I think Israel took one step too far rely in too much on technology which in area like Gaza was very convenient to put all those visual toys you know and and it gave the feeling that we are protected but maybe it wasn't the technology that failed we know that IDF soldiers monitoring Gaza reported increased Hamas activity in the months leading up to October the 7th we saw the Maneuvers we saw the preparations we have listened to the plans we have photoed the terrorist coming I know but for sure that in the Israeli Secret Service and the Israeli intelligence Army intelligence service they uh information was there before October 7 before October yes but nobody thought that it's really going to happen everybody thought you know the Kamas would not there maybe they do a terror act but not such an operation the biggest failure starts from the higher level of command which actually refuses to to to believe or or to see it coming despite the supposed failure of the technology to stop the October the 7th attack 2024 is predicted to be the best year yet for Israel's arms industry and while the Israeli Army may have been slow to react on October the 7 they quickly announced their intention to unleash hell on [Music] Gaza what Israel calls the swords of iron War has resulted in unprecedented levels of death and destruction [Music] I've come to one of the few places in Israel where you can see that with your own eyes I'm in the Israeli town of sto and behind me is Gaza we're pretty much as close as we can get all these religious Jewish people who were behind me gathered as the sun is going down many of them actually want to settle Gaza occupy Gaza build settlements in Gaza and and they're treating it almost like a family get together they're are kids they're having fun they're smiling taking photos it's pretty surreal seeing Gaza here and knowing what's happened since October 7 the mass destruction the mass killing it's yeah pretty overwhelming the war has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians and seen more than 80% of gaza's buildings rendered unusable it might look like random destruction but Israel would claim these are all valid targets and they're all generated by the latest Innovation from unit 88,200 a new system powered by artificial intelligence I've come to Tel Aviv to meet the investigative team who first r red her AI is being used in Gaza some in the military felt that the systems that existed were not giving them in previous Wars enough targets talk a little bit about what that meant practically in previous war what is called in Israel the target Bank was very swiftly was was empty previously they would produce 200 300 targets a year now they can produce sitting an hour the AI targeting systems are only possible because as we've seen Israel collects data on every aspect of Palestinian life the system called The Gospel also takes in historical and Geographic data to generate infrastructure locations that the AI thinks are probably linked to hamus these include tactical targets like military bases and tunnels but there's another category called Power targets that include residential Towers and Civic buildings like schools and medical centers an alifer hospital they are being hit in order to create a psychological effect on the gazin pushing them to go against Hamas of course this didn't happen the Israeli Army says Al shifer housed the Hamas command and control center the bombing of it resulted in over a thousand people being killed injured or disappeared 25,000 people in the surrounding area were also displaced Israel never provided evidence that it had found the command and control center to identify individual Hamas members unit 88,200 created lavender this analyzes the key Behavior traits of active Hamas oper where they go who they talk to who was in their phone contacts and then looks for anyone in Gaza with similar characteristics what are they talking about what kind of words they're using uh all these kind of things you create a list of possible members of Hamas from the very low level or even people that are not really part of the military ring this is basically basically a death list once you are there you are Lely to meet tet the alel neighborhood known as the backbone of Gaza was hid in December 2023 the Israeli Army said it was because there were Hamas operatives concealing themselves there the entire area was devastated what the AI generates is not facts but targets with a statistically probable link to Hamas despite this the systems have led to another change a rise in the acceptable level of Civilian deaths prior to this war a very senior uh Hamas uh Commander there was a collateral damage of let's say five maximum 10 person in this war it was decided that for very Junior Hamas militant the collateral damage decided was between 15 and 20 his family and his neighbors could be killed in order to kill him and if it's a senior Hamas militant then the numbers over 100 sometimes 300 and we know it happened I wanted to know what someone close to the Israeli military thought about this use of AI it's really kind of a big step you know forward in terms of intelligence and also decision making because it's doing the right selection and and put in front of the decision maker much better and clearer picture in order to take decision we did of course ask former General ziv about claims Israel and its AI systems were perpetrating a genocide in Gaza his response the standard line that the Israeli Army is the most moral in the world so AI became a big factor in in in this whole component of Intel decision making command and control uh of the modern fight storing surveillance on an entire population generates a vast amount of data enter Google on Amazon who have been building cloud services and data farms in Israel since 2021 under a deal called project Nimbus After the War Began the Army's Computing division said they were collecting so much data that to move some of it onto the civilian Cloud A200 is using a cloud service by Amazon to storage huge amount of information about people in Gaza and that the This Cloud was used at least to help some of the attacks I've been looking at how Israel's Army and Tech sector benefit from conflict in Palestine but could it also be true of other countries and multinationals to find out more I met with Paul bigar the founder of a billion dooll tech company Google's motto used to be don't be evil and it seems like a lot of these big tech companies Amazon Google and others have no issue with working with Israel in fact they're often expanding their contracts do they not care about the reputational damage fundamentally they're about making money getting that cloud Revenue um you may have started as a $600 million contract but it is uh expanding massively over the years so we are talking uh at the stage where uh where they may be getting billions and possibly tens of billions of dollars from Israel via project Nimbus they're also setting themselves up as the de facto people to talk to when your government needs to uh needs to scale so there's a lot more governments that are a lot larger than uh than Israel and Google wants to be first in line for those contracts and more importantly they've realized there aren't any reputational consequences for what it does so it's not just Israel that uses the Palestinians to test their products on it's actually the whole world and there's no greater arena for testing weapons than a live War the iron sting is a guided mortar marketed as a Precision weapon the iron sting is so precise that it can even hit a specific room without causing damage to other rooms in the same building this is its first use in [Music] battle and looks like it might have damaged more than one room at least two Israeli companies have made drones stable enough to handle gunfire this is elbert's bird of prey seen here accompanying an armored bulldozzer into battle eyewitnesses in Gaza say these drones with guns are proving terrifying and deadly arms experts have told us the last moment of the life of Hamas leader Yaya sinoa were likely filmed on one of these drones his final Act to throw a stick at it talk about some of those things in Gaza that Israel has been doing militarily since October 7 and why you think that might be appealing to other nations everybody knows that that you know Israel is very advanced in in their technology but definitely after such a such a war in Gaza when when people see the demonstration in real life and it's working uh it creates uh you know the needs and the understanding how crucial those things are and and how critical for others to to hold it and to have it now Israel has physical access to Gaza they're rolling out many of the surveillance techniques used in the West Bank unit 88,200 is giving soldiers and drones AI enabled surveillance technology to search for anyone linked to Hamas or other rebel groups the system relies on technology from corite an Israeli video Analysis company and the Israeli Army is also using Google photos which can identify people from just a fraction of their face we are basically speaking about about a system where the government where the private sector producing and exporting the facial recognition technique they test those Technologies in Palestine in the occupied Palestinian territory so occupying people is profitable because it's not only you take the resources of the land now we are speaking about digital occupation where also your data is a new resource to develop a new technologies and to start selling that worldwide to profit from oppressing other people but perhaps the most advanced and gamechanging weapon being used in the Gaza war is the targeting of human beings by artificial intelligence so do you think that tools like lavender the gospel there's a decent chance of Israel could potentially be selling those tools to other militaries I think it's a very fair possibility that Israel will will sell it and this is I think one of the reasons they allowed our story to be published just explain a bit what you mean by that H you have to file any report that relates to the military the military censorship and they can allow disallow I suspect there were people in Israel who wanted the world to know that they have very very sophisticated AI surveillance methods that can collect and kill being here again I've seen how physical barriers and high technology divide this land in a way many human rights organizations call apartheid I've seen how this has allowed Israel to create World leading surveillance and arms Industries who export their products globally in the next episode I'm heading off to some of Israel's top customers I'll be asking if Israel is just selling its technology or if they're also exporting something else the ideology behind the occupation of Palestine

          <attvalue for="7" value="and we are also joined in studio by actor Liam Cunningham a very special guest to have in studio this week Thanks very much sir It's a delight to be here Yes you have been in the headlines this week You are lending your voice to a very important uh situation Tell us about that Uh I've just come back from Katana Sicily where we were seeing off uh a small boat called the Madlin uh and its mission is to uh leave with a hold full of humanitarian aid and it's going to head to um Gaza to try and break the blockade Mhm Um and that's what we were doing for the last few days And there was a lot of press there and um and celebrations and and uh flag waving and protests and and these beautiful hum of humanity people who are on this boat are um doing what the international community should be doing What's on board the vessel i mean people will see Greta Tunberg is of course probably the most prominent name on board But in terms of actual aid on board there are uh the stuff that the IDF want to lay in crutches um there are antibiotics baby formula um uh I think there's morphine because a lot of people in extraordinary pain mostly medical and there is also which I find kind of heartbreaking there is a a 3D printed prosthetic baby's arm that they're bringing as well uh um and um and hoping they their voyage won't be impeded Uh you well on that topic of being impeded you mentioned the blockade Um at this point in the abstract what is the likelihood of your colleagues being able to land that flea well we have no idea Uh because you're you're if you're dealing with a sane government um there would be some predictability and there would be some sort of um diplomatic at very least um conversation Um but these uh uh people in power in in Tel Aviv uh we've seen what they can do They've already although they didn't admit it who else could it be they did destroy a boat or ex damage it heavily in Malta and they sent in two uh drones um to take out the the ship So this is a replacement boat uh that unfortunately only takes 12 crew and eight volunteers Um so um basically anything can happen We've there's already been threats There's already been um drones in the air at nighttime Uh so the intimidation has begun But what they will do the closer the guys get to the off the coast of Gaza is is uh is anybody's guess I mean it is a very brave endeavor in terms of the individuals who are traveling on the flutella You mentioned at the start there though it's something that governments should be doing Well 100% according to international law and I've even thrown myself into having a look at what the G Geneva conventions require of a government This is not suggestions if there is a uh a visible genocide and t-sh Martin used the word in in in government and uh to use that word um uh leads you down the path of necessary legal uh obligations And one of them is is that it it's very specific even if it's not in your state You are obliged legally to intervene in in a genocide And this uh legislation came on the back with the International Court of Justice and the ICC on the back of the horrific Holocaust and genocide of uh the Jewish people in World War II So um uh legally and I said this yesterday in an interview we should be sending the navy filled our navy with on a humanitarian mission uh to to deliver this stuff and uh and if we don't do it then it not it it not only brings shame on ourselves it brings um a a sense of destruction on the international rules based order which is we are responsible for We are the caretakers of international law until it's handed on to the next generation and it's falling apart in front of us It's it's appalling It's clear to see that the public here is very much on board with this in terms of support for the Palestinian people All of the polls we've seen in the papers even over the last number of weekends show that the government has said they've done things like they recognize the state of Palestine They said they're pushing forward with the occupied territories bill Now people will dispute how much impact that's going to have particularly because services may not be included in that but it is when you put it like that when you see international law and what it says when you see wrong happening in terms of breaches of international human rights law you have to intervene it almost makes it difficult to understand for people out there why why aren't we doing more why are we only doing this here and that here I mean is that what you think that's where you think the public is at with this is that we're very good at saying that there's a problem there Ireland has been as I described previously one of the least worst countries in terms of speaking out about it But in terms of action do you agree that we don't feel to be or seem to be able to get that next step forward in terms of sticking our necks out the the the words aren't working That's uh obvious because of the damage that we've seen to to the the Palestinian people since we've recognized Palestine since uh since ME Martin has said it's genocide Um it's not enough We we need action in the time But I'm I I'm not sick hearing the words and uh and we're on the side of the oppressed and blah blah blah If you do nothing then the words mean nothing Um so I prefer not to hear them talking about it at all because that just reflects their actions and we really need to do we need to step up We are we're in a wonderful position We're a small country We're not militarily aligned with anybody uh um and we can be an honest broker and especially from a country that suffered occupation for 700 years Um we we feel it we know the game you know we're also a country that it's very easy to look at it that we suffered two genocides here I mean don't forget that you know and these are British establishment figures uh when Oliver Cromwell was here for the 9 months he was here and left his new model army for an additional 3 years the the figures are from the British that 40% of our population was slaughtered that was the first one and you can be in no doubt that we although we give it this magnificent romantic phrase the great hunger that was a genocide I mean they did the same thing in India there was 50 ships a day leaving Ireland filling the shops in in in England while our famine was going on and they had Lass say fair let them get on with it Nothing to do with us They were occupying our country They were in charge of that and we lost the estimates are a million people and a million and a half or two two million went you know left the country For for Ireland not to have sympathy with the plight of the Palestinians would be the bizarest thing on the planet if we weren't sympathetic at the very least Well the government would say that it goes beyond because of the government not here to represent itself I'm going to re relay its view which would be that it's effectively from a European standpoint it's almost bestin-class that it has recognized Palestinian statehood that it has at least taken a cabinet decision to progress with a version of the occupied territories bill that it's one of the first governments to call for an outright suspension and a outright review of the trade association deal there between the European Union and Israel You obviously don't feel that's enough the government would say that it's kind of it's wedded to this kind of multilateral worldwide view of trying to move in concert and trying to bring the rest of the world along with it Uh well the one one provisor that I believe is in the EU is that each country is responsible for its own foreign affairs right it's with trade and stuff like that it's different uh this is very much about foreign affairs uh with a with a country that is committing genocide um when you compare to hold us up as a beacon in in the EU and yesterday and today uh when the French dockers um have impounded or thrown to one side 14 tons tons of uh munitions and machine gun parts whatever they are going going to is supported by the ditch Yeah And Yeah And then today they found more containers So one of the leading lights of the EU is supplying arms to a genocidal regime So to hold us up as a beacon when you've got that standard below us doesn't make us look too good Liam what's your read on what's holding us back then from from doing this what like Well it's fear obviously but I mean the Americans are incredibly powerful and I'm sure there's been a few whispers in the year ears of we'll take this away or we'll repatriate our large businesses or whatever it may be It's been reported I mean the ambassador said that to to the last year wasn't it that you know this will impact a thousand US companies if you go forward with the OTB Yeah So the thing is if you well the OTB is one thing but what about you know as you mentioned there the Navy going out with aid Well that would be a legal obligation It's not a case of you know let's go gung-ho and let's break this thing we if we don't do it we're breaking international law and because everybody else is not doing it doesn't make it all right Um we really I mean look that would be a huge step to to do that but the very least we should stop doing business with a country that's committing genocide I mean this is not a big ask And if you're putting a spreadsheet or or the success of Q4 ahead of the dismemberment of children then then you you're you're morally bankrupt That's it On the aid situation because obviously the flatillaa is going to bring in a small amount of aid That's that's the objective of this While there are thousands and thousands of trucks currently sitting outside Gaza not being permitted to go in One of the things I've seen you be quite critical of over the last number of months has been news coverage of this um the situation in Gaza particularly around aid has been there's been it's been so noticeable to see Western news organizations for example with regards to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation as it's been described Yeah It's just been it's just disbanded hasn't it they've just cut it off They say that they're restoring the aid distribution as they put it to centers this evening there But it's been interesting that there was all these headlines around the world of the blockade has been lifted It's the end of the blockade It certainly hasn't by anyone's measure So I mean do you think that that's actually creating a level of distrust generally in Western media because if we can't call a spade a spade in this country or in Britain or in the states when everybody can see clearly what's happening in their own eyes they can see what's being live streamed from Palestinians there as well Then what are we doing here as journalists uh we're bathing in fear It's not it's not a case of if we do something It it what people are worried about here and specifically in the government is what are the repercussions if we do something It's kicking the can down the road and we've seen it with with many of the difficult decisions that government when they set up the community whatever it is those uh uh those gettogethers to uh deal with the poison chalice Uh and it's one of those uh there's it's it's uh it's dealing with the obfiscation Um and I mean for instance what you were talking about that that MOSAD funded according to drop site news I think they they discovered that that what are they called GFD or something ghf humanitarian foundation Yes Yes So they are somebody some there is a report that they have traced the money back to a MOSAD uh operation and either way it's Israeli sanctioned anyway which goes against the general principles of how a absolutely and if you look at it none of the aid agencies including the UN will have anything to do with it because these people are totally inexperienced there's been what 460 shot at these at these centers and they're calling them in and when they called them in yesterday the Israeli head stated that those centers have now become combat zones So anybody comes into them is going to be shot after beckoning them uh to to get their limited aid there So they can't be on the ground there and communication is difficult Then you don't know which center you're going to which is a target and which one is a safe zone Well they were queuing because they were given the word that the that the centers were going to open up at 7:00 a.m I think it was 8:00 a.m and there was a huge amount of people at 3:00 a.m So as soon as they opened there was a huge rush They panicked and just opened fire on on unarmed people scrambling for food We can't allow that to continue It's the it's the it's shooting fish in a barrel as the Americans used to say about it in Iraq Speaking of the flotilla itself you were telling us on the way in that the original plan was for it to hopefully land on Sunday or at least to make it to the gas and coastline on Sunday Um you were telling us that there's a bit of new development which might at least weigh that timetable Yes So I just had a call just before I came in I was sitting in the car and uh the wonderful Queever Butterly who's a huge part of the flotilla um uh she gave me a ring and uh they got a distress call this morning from a sinking uh inflatable rib uh with uh migrants from Libya on it They were the closest vessel So under international law is their duty as a ship to go and uh to go and rescue them Uh the um rib was uh uh deflating rapidly uh to the extent that uh four or four or five uh of the occupants of the rib craft dived into the sea and had to be rescued by the maline the boat we've just been talking about H and they are now in in in possession of these uh unfortunate sudin who are trying to escape the madness of Libya Uh and they are now in a bit of a quandry about what to do with them They they want them picked up They are also in uh very uh tense about if they do head for Cree to to uh uh deliver these uh unfortunate migrants that they may be impounded The Greeks are have a very very questionable relationship with the Israelis at the moment Um and uh they're worried that the ship might be uh impounded but that's ongoing You can't stop in Libya on the way back because if that's where the Sudin people have come from you can't state they've come from if if we handed them over to cuz the Libyan Coast Guard was there Yeah Uh and they would uh return them to Libya which for people seeking asylum is is highly illegal under Bringing them on their mission an option No I shouldn't I shouldn't think so I'm not sure they have the capability The maximum they could keep on the boat with the amount of humanitarian aid was eight volunteers It's it's quite it's a smallish boat Yeah we we saw some of the overhead pictures People might have actually seen them in our reports earlier in the week Actually some overhead drone footage as it was disembarking from from Sicily It is a relatively small boat Yes it is And we were buzzed Just before they took off a military helicopter came down incredibly low into where people were bathing in the harbor and stuff and and basically buzzed buzzed the boat just before they came in just just to let them know we were being watched I mean how juvenile can you get it's just it's pathetic Just by people like yourself and by Greta Tunberg taking part in this Obviously it does help to get word out about these situations when you do have high-profile people putting themselves forward like this I've seen people have been very critical of Greta Tunberg you know a young woman of course who has you know put herself and put the planet first in many ways before Have you faced any repercussions from your stance on Gaza no You know what's funny and I completely understand the question uh especially uh because I do a fair bit of work with with companies from the states Um it really is the king is only the king as long as the people think he's the king Uh and if anybody has put me on a list because they don't like my humanitarian pro approach to our beautiful species um they're not people I want to work with anyway So uh and I've said this before whatever shadowy list that I might be on or some of my fellow mouthy people uh might be on the list that I have is a hell of a lot longer than the list I might be on Yeah So no I'm no impediment to work at this point There's no there's no The only impediment is to work with people I didn't want to work with in the first place That's fine It's a good position to be in isn't it yeah I think it's good Stand by your principles You got to Yeah Taking this forward I mean because this has been something which is ongoing It's now in a real deep humanitarian crisis this point in time 600 trucks a day need to need to get in I think the last reckoning by the International Red Cross was that 600 boxes at a max we're actually getting into Gaza 2 million people starving And the five trucks put the put the hair up on the back of my neck The five trucks that got in after Israel broke the ceasefire two of those trucks had death shrouds in them That's was all that was delivered of those five trucks the two of them were were I think a Saudi Arabian um gift and they were shrouds for the dead But we're all sitting here and we're all watching this I actually spoke with Mary Robinson about this recently that she worries about the mental health aspect on on on us which is almost a luxury to be in a position where we can worry about that Yes But you look at the situation that is unfolding before our eyes on a daily basis where you're seeing a people being starved on a daily basis kids dying of malnutrition literally starving in the streets at this point in time How do you think we're all going to look back at this period in the world's history when there are there's so much enormous wealth there's so much you know we talk the talk in terms of international human rights and with regards to the West being a leader and we respect international law all of these things And yet here we all are going back to October of 2023 and we we've let this happen Uh yes we haven't We haven't The impunity is well the impunity have been going on forever So the reason they're doing it is because they weren't slapped on the wrist for doing it before with Operation Castled with all all the various um uh batterings that Gaza has had And let's not forget about the West Bank what's going on there And and even in my profession the guy who just won the Oscar Yeah Um his uh his village has been raised to the ground Um and and there's an Irish woman in her 70 years old is in is in detention at the minute Uh I'd like to know what our government is doing about uh getting her Uh and very interesting uh that Israel holds the deportation meetings You know where they hold them at the airport Like you're going to win that case aren't you that's where the that's where the uh the deportation uh um cases are held at the airport Yeah But how do you think this is going to be looked back at this period it's it's a shameful period It's going to be a shameful period And as I've said before uh one of the things that's important I mean my kids are grown up now and they and they are very much um about the haters of injustice I should hope I battered that into them Um but I am not having my grandkids growing up and when they're reading about this saying uh what did you do during there i at least I can throw my social media at them and and stuff like this uh and say look I I I did what I could I roared about it I tried to um get more people to speak Um it's the people who are saying nothing Have you got your answers ready for your kids or your grandkids when they're hitting secondary school and they're reading about this uh and as I said before in World War II you could say we didn't know about the Holocaust We didn't The vast majority of us this genocide is in 4K on your telly Uh and uh your only answer you're going you're not going to be able to say &quot;I didn't know.&quot; The only answer you're going to be able to give to your kids is &quot;I didn't care.&quot; And that is not uh is that something you want your kid to think of you that you did nothing when that was happening right I'm not prepared to to to give that answer to my kids or grandkids For Irish people who have spoken out I just saw a column in the spectator of all places today by Brendan O'Neal Ireland has been consumed by hatred of Israel He says &quot;A new religion blights the Republic of Ireland Catholicism has been supplanted by a far more cultish creed Uh he goes on to say its name is Israel phobia He says he knew Ireland was hostile to Israel but I had no idea how bad things had got Everywhere you go he says you see the swirling animus for the state The political class speaks of little else The media media are ferventishly obsessed Uh the cry goes out that Israel is evil It's inescapable He says it's all over Dublin along a hotbed of leftish activism he says I'm not sure I'd agree with that necessarily but this this targeting of of of Ireland internationally but the point would be by the British media or American media We've seen it on Fox and Friends where they describe Miho Martin as a socialist and very left Um this is something which is you know it's been is being described and it has been thrown around at Irish people for speaking out about humanitarian issues in Gaza I mean what do you make about the way that Ireland has been targeted miho or Michael Higgins excuse me says that it has been a slander effectively on our nation It's absolutely right But listen it's bully boy tactics and most of the people you quote there and the people in in the states you have to remember they're to the right of a tilla the hon they have no credibility at all I mean anybody in the in the states in the political system over there has has completely lost any uh right to speak about a healthy political system I mean it's it's incredible I mean the the uh the J1 visas the students have all been told scrape your social media go in This is like McCarthyism is back in the states So anything any of these people say is not worth the uh the bribery check it's written" />

relationship between the United States and Israel in one sentence how what would you say let's get Trump back in because he let's keep this broader let's keep I'm going say need the support of both parties they got to start thinking a little bit more like the enemies I mean the United States in Great Britain their forces are being shot at uh in the Middle East also and what are they going to let that happen we we have to we have to draw the line and say enough they don't understand restraint they don't understand negotiation they understand force and power so you smack them punch them in the face and knock them down it's different mentality in the middle eag we have children who are fighting for the IDF and and that puts us in a little different position as well since the Hamas attack on October 7th when at least 1,139 were killed and 240 people taken hostage Israel has carried out one of the most intensive bombing campaigns against a populated area in history so far killing at least 33,42 people and displacing 85% of the population there's been a lot of coverage about accusations of war crimes that have been committed by members of the Israeli forces do you think that there is an issue there for American Jewel Nationals to be in an army that has this accusation put against them the Israelis you know we're accused of war crimes whether whether we commit them or not we have suffered so many so many more losses of our guys and of our men and women in in in battle because we don't go in and carpet bomb the way they think we do why should that building who a death trap why should we send our guys in there just knock it down knock it down [Music] human rights groups accuse the Israeli military of collective punishment arbitary executions torture and starvation Israel continues to blame Hamas for its actions while the US vetoed multiple calls by the UN for a ceasefire and despite Biden's executive order Palestinians living under occupation say they face increasing restrictions on movement while settlers accused of violence enjoy near impunity settlers are Israeli citizens who live in the West Bank in East Jerusalem Palestinian territory which has been occupied by Israel since 1967 there are now around 700,000 settlers the 3 million Palestinians there are ruled under military law since October 7th more than 430 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or settlers in the occupied West Bank 29-year-old zachar Adra lives inaf Arata a collection of Palestinian Villages which have faced years of attacks and systematic Force displacement by Israeli settlers and the military on the 13th of October a settler shot him in the stomach he now has trouble walking and eating and is in constant pain there's a cell phone video of the [Music] attack for can you describe that moment did you know what was happening to [Music] you [Music] for Zacharia says the shooter came from the direction of havat on and legal Outpost in the southern Hebron Hills rights groups say it has a history of violent harassment of Palestinians yet according to recent media reports has received private us funding this isn't uncommon us residents have funnel millions of dollars of tax deductible donations into illegal settlements which violate international law and play a significant role in the expulsion of Palestinians from their land around 20 km North is heon City one of the starkest symbols of the occupation it's home to around 200,000 Palestinians and 1,000 settlers hagit ofran monitors settlements and their expansion for Israeli campaign group peace now in order to protect this small group of settlers inside the Palestinian City the Israeli Army sealed a whole neighborhood from the presence of Palestinians the heart of the Old City where you had all the shops are closed for 30 years already for Palestinians and there are parts of the streets that they are not even allowed to walk since October 7 the whole area became even more restricted for instance as I was walking up here I saw a Palestinian house where the roof of it is taken as a military post well so they just take over the roof of their home and they have a a military order it's called the seizure order and the commander is say I need this property for the security of the area and I take it temporarily so this family has to eat sleep go about their day while there is an occupying force on their roof sometimes it's not only on the roof sometime it can be in in the Next Room all of it is for the security needs suddenly our interview is interrupted so every time we do an interview we're met with soldiers they're sent here I believe to check if we're a threat or whatever I need to see your ID please you have authorization from the Israeli government to be here they know that we're here it's okay that you're telling me but we need authorization yeah but I'm just as well just so you the guy here not to film us they sent here a terrorist from El jazer we have to make sure you're not where's your accent from Michigan Michigan okay after checking our documents they finally left what was really interesting is I just spoke to one of the soldiers and he told me that he was from Michigan and a duel National how many of these settlements that you're talking about are funded by us residents we cannot really know uh how much money is going directly from funds or Charities American Charities to settlements there are many settlements that get funds from charities in America you can also look at you know the Americans give Israel x amount of of billions for our security so it frees ex amount of billions for other causes for Israel so you can say that it's indirectly support the the settlements do you think that there's any desire to try and limit people living on land that is deemed illegal internationally I don't see this still in the United States any big opposition to the very settlements what we saw is like the first step and I think it's not insignificant it is an important step and it puts a lot of political pressure within Israel and it's bringing the issue of settler violence to the headlines in Israel which is something very very very significant but of course this will not end the occupation the soldier we met isn't the only American in the West Bank according to a study by Oxford University released in 2015 60,000 settlers living in the occupied Palestinian territory are also American citizens they're playing a significant role in enforcing the occupation as we traveled through the city to meet Palestinians we witnessed just how difficult it was to move around there are many many Israeli checkpoints some denied us entry we're trying to find a different route to get to the Palestinian that lives in this area of heon high can we see the ideas please yes where do you how do you guys get in through the gate over there yeah is that an issue so this is the situation in heon now there's a lot of security and it's very difficult to move around over there it's called the red area but there's no signs on the gate there's literally none this is Asa he lives on the other side over here he's a local resident of Hebron told us that he was attacked after October the 7th he's now trying to communicate with the Israeli soldiers to see if we can pass through we didn't expect this to be the fast meeting sorry this is the reality so this is the reality of heon uh I am living here since uh almost 17 18 years you literally have to get through a dozen soldiers just to get to your home and people can't just come and visit nobody can come to visit me only the people who are living inside the area are allowed to come here so this is an occupied Palestinian Land by the Israeli settlers and they usually attack Palestinian families here and here they attacked us ASA Amro says that on October 7th he was attacked and detained by both settlers and Israeli soldiers and that in the days after his release he was also forced out of his home for weeks we put asa's claims to the Israeli military but we didn't hear back I was tortured I was almost killed I was coming from here to my house the way you you came and settlers in an arm uniform who are my neighbors I was kidnapped by them I was kept for 10 hours handcuffed blindfolded gagged beaten sexually assaulted they pointed the the gun and they put it on my head in count to 10 I fainted two times without any medical treatment spitting at me seeing B bad things to me they were celebrating torturing me for 10 hours continuously and you thought you were going to die I I said goodbye to everything you know I thought that it's my last moment and recently we've been hearing from the United States from some European countries that they are going to impose visa restrictions on settlers who were convicted of carrying out attacks what did you think when you heard this I can say that it's a kind of uh public opinion uh satisfaction the sers are attacking Palestinians are only four now in the West Bank there are 10 Palestinians killed by settlers directly what are they and many American citizens here that many American citizens they live here illegally inside heon as settlers they should take them to American courts and treat them as war criminals to be very honest they should be brought to the IC nobody was accountable for what happened to me and to many other Palestinians and the sers are not the only one who are attacking Palestinians the Israeli soldiers who are siters in an army uniform there are many siters joined the army and they kill Palestinians if you want really to make them accountable make Israel accountable the settlers they are backed up by the Israeli government they are supported by the Israeli government they are financed by the Israeli government so let's go after the Israeli government and stop them and dismantle all the Israeli settlements according to the international [Music] law the White House recently reversed Donald Trump's policy on Israel's settlement expansion declaring them inconsistent with international law yet organizations like the one Israel fund an American not for profit exempt from federal tax claims it's raised millions of dollars for settlements Kamas sent us a message on October 7th never again is now one of its prominent ambassadors is Gabriel boxer who regularly promotes and fundraises for settlements and Israeli soldiers boom shaka in February he also accompanied the Israeli military as it bombed Gaza wow that's all I can say right be behind me is hostile enemy territory that we learned what really they believe after October 7th we are now approaching the Cave of the M this huge structure is the burial place of the Patriarchs and matriarchs of the Jewish people it's also a holy site for Muslims the ibrahimi mosque in order to get around the Region's strict military control we met with David an American Israeli tour guide so what do you say to those in America who say that there should be more sanctions on even the funding of settlements by private us residents I think that the people who claim that they support the Palestinians are not aware of the facts on the ground are either being fed misinformation intentionally or imagining events that are not actually happening David takes us to ma alh its rare access to a highly secured and gated settlement which has received donations from the one Israel fund around 700 settlers live in the sprawling Suburban style luxury Community we're met by Gideon Ariel an American Israeli settler who's lived here for 11 years of different places here's my home watch watch your head when you uh pass by the flag that my kids fo up I'll let you leave the way this this is the view that uh that sold me on Mal my wife has a cousin who lives here and we would come from time to time for the holidays and uh one day her husband took me outside and said you see this house next door you can have it for 250,000 shekels which was a pittance in the time why is it important to live in a community like this well first of all why is it important to live anywhere a person lives where they want to live and this is as you can see a beautiful place historically God promised Abraham this is the land that is going to belong to you and to your children forever more right here in my backyard well it's h Shabbat tomorrow is Shabbat so my wife debah here is uh preparing for Shabbat deah BTO are you also American yeah every time I hear an American accent it's like I what's going on where am I we have people here from all different places of the world we have people here from United States from Russia from India from Germany from Ethiopia you it's just a small community of 100 there going be people watching who are going to say what the hell is a American doing in this land because they are all Jews we are all Jews who were exiled from this land about 2,000 years ago we kept that connection to the land all throughout those Millennium and now thanks to God we are coming back to our [Laughter] land if the United Nations says that there has been a significant increase in attacks from settlers and then also as this area was called by the United Nations an occupation that is a legal under the Geneva Convention then it is only right for the United States to take action how do you respond to that it is not illegal for me to raise my children here I'm not bothering anybody else this land never belonged to anybody else it was always state land we're going to decide what's best for us we've established a state which is thriving which is helping people all over the world and nobody's going to tell us what we can do or what we can't do I'm sorry Israeli rights groups say part of the settlement is built on private Palestinian land in a AUST around 500 M away settlers from an unknown location armed with M16 rifles were filmed physically assaulting a Palestinian farmer how would you feel about potentially having Palestinians live here this specific a community is a small community and it wants to stay a small community and we're also all religious Jews over here so not here but in other places yeah yeah in general however it's very important that Jews stay the majority and we even though we believe in democracy very much so we believe in the only place for Jews to live and call it their own the UN describes settlements and the displacements of Palestinians as a major obstacle to peace in the region at the heart of this obstacle are American citizens and groups like the one Israel fund one of the settlers accused of violence and sanctioned by both the US and the UK is by YF shown here on the one Israel fund website thanking them for donating a drone these are the guys who are really responsible for preventing Terror and saving lives and fighting the bad guys funding is often used to support Israeli paramilitary groups with surveillance equipment like drones vehicles and helmets missing a lot of equipment they needed before but now because of all the donations they've been able to receive a lot of stuff they wanted and thank God we will be improving the security of all Jud and Samaria so thank you all thank you very much in the US there's increasing pressure to explicitly ban the funding of settlements by groups like the one Israel fund who did not respond to our repeated requests for comment for now American dollars continue to fund settlements and soldiers while Palestinians like ASA bear the brunt of the occupation there's a drone up here just now do you think they know we're doing an interview what what is this Israeli settlers they have drones to film us to intimidate us to spy on us and now it's only on us they so they're filming us they are filming us now it happens almost every day whenever I have visitors I have uh uh journalists who are are here it's a kind of that we are watching you what do you think America needs to do America needs to uh work hard to punish the Israeli government government to punish the Israeli uh settlers leaders and to punish the Israeli uh settlement organizations and Nos and even to start with themselves first to stop the 3.8 billion dollar uh Aid to the Israeli military every year H and make it conditional on ending the Israeli occupation and ending the Israeli sitler violence and ending the Israeli AAR tide here and they should start with their own people to stop them from funding the Israeli settlers terrorist here it's really important that they should start first in their own countries according to their legal system [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="democracy depends on a free press please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org/give this is democracyow democracynow.org i'm Amy Goodman we go to get an update from the Freedom Flotilla boat the Madlin sailing to Gaza with vital humanitarian aid the Freedom Flotilla Coalition initially planned to sail from Malta last month but their ship was damaged after it was bombed by drones in international waters earlier this week the Madlin received a Mayday call directing them to a boat that was rapidly deflating with about 30 to 40 migrants on board for more we go to the Freedom Flotilla where we're joined by Thiago Aila he's a Brazilian activist and steering committee member of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition he's among 12 activists sailing to Gaza the mission also includes the renowned Swedish climate activist Greta Tunbury whom we spoke to earlier this week thiago welcome to Democracy Now israel has threatened to raid your ship we know what happened to the Mauvi Marura more than a decade ago when uh the Israeli military raided the ship and killed nine people on board um how are you where are you now in the sea what's happened with these migrants and um how do you plan to challenge the Israeli blockade of Gaza thank you so much for having the plotilla here on democracy now for us it's an honor you do a very important work we are here somewhere in the Mediterranean actually 500 nautical miles from Gaza if we would go to the north we'll be going to Cit in Greece if we would go to south we would be going to Egypt right now and we are on the sixth day of a a day of a journey that will end on Monday likely on the morning to get to Gaza that's our estimated time of arrival and we are right now with 12 people spirits are high and we are carrying life saving aid food medicine crutches prosthetics for imitated children water filters and we're doing our best here to be useful for the solidarity movement for Palestine we are nonviolent direct action mission that not only wants to break the siege the legal siege that Israel has put Gaza for 18 years but also wants to create a people's humanitarian corridor so that all countries all organizations institutions and the social majorities of the world can help and can be in support of the Palestinian people people cannot stand anymore seeing children starving to death and it's in their hearts the idea of doing something and we're part of this doing something collectively all the demonstrations all the global uprising doc workers blocking the cargo vessels to through to through Israel so many people doing amazing things disrupting arms factories creating breaking the media blockade and spreading true information about the genocide of eight decades so we are part of the same thing and yesterday we received a Mayday call from a boat that was rapidly defiliating and we managed to rescue four four of these people unfortunately the rest has been taken and illegally deported back to Libya from uh li Libyan so-called coast guard but the four of the ones that we managed to rescue they were sent to the coast guard and they we are asking for refugee for them in Greece so this was something that happened that we did not expect we sailed for two and a half hours doing search and rescue operation despite the fact that only a few of our members here are trained in search and rescue operation but life comes first so we changed our course completely yesterday to do and attend to this Mayday call and in the end we did what we could and we were very happy that we managed to rescue four people from the water and the Mediterranean being on the water means death very very fast so we're glad that Thiago we just have another minute but I wanted to ask you about Latin American solidarity with Gaza you're a Brazilian activist why you decided to come from Brazil yes oh I come from a place where imperialism always play always plays a decisive role my country suffered two two military coups and and both of them had the support of the United States and so it's important that we understand that imperialism and Zionism they are the greatest evils of our generation and we need to defeat them wherever we can and Palestine is now the strategic place for all peoples to unite and fight against oppression exploitation and the destruction of nature they have been threatening us for many many years for 17 years any flotilla mission that tried to reach Gaza has been threatened by them but we will not bow to their threats we do not need their permission this is international waters and we're going to Palestinian territorial waters so we're going not with their permission but with the help of millions and billions of people that know that starving pe children to death is wrong that bombing hospitals shelters and schools is wrong and that's what we are counting on we they cannot defeat us by force if they attack us we'll have thousands of people on the next flotilla and they will understand like all oppressive regimes understand in the end that they cannot beat the people's true force that people's power is the ultimate power and love and solidarity can beat any hateful racist and supremacist ideology like Zionism and if Israel raids uh your boat um they have pledged not to allow the ship to dock uh or to even approach Thiago yes they did this before like you mentioned 15 years ago they killed nine executed nine of our participants and and another 10th died six months later and one month ago they just bombed our boats and they've been sending drones every night here for three nights in a row so we can expect violence from them and we do our preparations we train our participants in nonviolent direct action so that even facing extreme violence we remain nonviolent because there's no military victory for us here we're a humble boat 12 people that 18 meters boat so we only can win through solidarity making sure that the whole world knows that Gaza has been under siege for 18 years leaving eight decades of genocide and ethnic cleansing and this is how we also move the structures for a safe passage so spread word of what we're doing guarantee us a safe passage because if they understand that they cannot afford to attack us and that will be even worse for them in the attack we have a chance thiago Avila we want to thank you for being with us all safety to you brazilian activists among 12 activists sailing to Gaza to deliver humanitarian aid on the Madlin ship named for the first Gazen Fisher woman uh the ship launched by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition you can also see our interview with Greta Tunbury also on that vote at democracynow.org democracy Now is funded by viewers like you please give today at

Mahdawi's detention has led him to reflect on the &quot;interconnectedness between injustices,&quot; as multiple members of his family in Palestine have been &quot;unjustly&quot; incarcerated in Israeli jails. &quot;Now I can feel their pain,&quot; says Mahdawi.

first live interview welcome to Democracy Now congratulations on your freedom Mosen thank you Amy it's a pleasure to be with you and good morning to your audience as well so if you can start off by telling us what happened why you ended going ended up going back to Vermont uh for this final what you thought immigration interview what happened i mean I was waiting for this uh interview which is my naturalization uh process to receive a citizenship for over uh over over a year um and the reason I had to go to Vermont because my residence my uh permanent residence is in Vermont uh therefore um I went to basically what I thought should be um a normal um you know u naturalization interview um I expected at the same time that there might be a trap set up for me just seeing and witnessing what happened to other students including Mahmud Khalil and Romesa um and therefore I was prepared for that interview that I might come on the other side with full rights or no rights we interviewed um Vermont Congress member Becca Balant um at the time because you had written to her she's the sole Congress member in Vermont as well as to Senators Peter Welch who visited you in prison and Senator Bernie Sanders you wrote them all because you were so concerned about what would happen this is exactly right i mean uh I prepared for many different on many different levels part of why I stayed in Vermont is because of the support that I received from uh official representatives such as the senators and the congresswoman who I'm very grateful for but at the same time also uh I I had to arrange with my lawyers uh in order to have everything drafted ready to go just prepared for the worst case scenario so I prepared with the lawyers contacted my uh representatives and contacted my community members who are very close to me and we saw the aftermath of this is I was able to stay in Vermont something that other students did not have the luxury to do they were uprooted from their communities and from legal support so what happened you go to the naturalization interview what day was that uh it was on the 14th of April and you went with your lawyer i went with one of my lawyers an immigration lawyer we go into USCIS office this is the immigration office where I'm supposed to have my interview and uh everything looked kind of normal there were some signs um the officer who interviewed me inside was waiting for us and after being in the lobby for a few minutes the lobby was emptied from any other uh applicants so I it was only myself my lawyer and my friend and they looked at them and they said this is the calm before the storm and so you had your interview did you sign any documents yes I went through my regular interview for citizenship uh to the point I thought that I am going to receive the citizenship that same day because I was I I was asked the questions that I had to answer i answered the questions correctly and then I was asked if I am willing to take the pledge of allegiance when the officer asked me if I am willing to do so I said of course and he asked me to sign a document saying that I am willing to actually protect and defend the constitution of this country and shortly after that moment just within a minute uh the DHS agents storm the office separate me from my lawyer and they say that I am under arrest masked i mean were they masked they were masked uh they had hoods on uh you could not you could not recognize them and they had guns on them as well and they masked around you did they handcuff you yes directly actually there there was not any space or room to show us documents or to explain anything and they said &quot;You're under arrest.&quot; So I gave them my my hands and I said &quot;I am a peaceful man i am not going to resist.&quot; And so you were taken where was your lawyer they prevented my lawyer from being with me so I was taken through the back door to into the lobby outside of that building into an unmarked SUV and my lawyer did not know what's happening with me in fact at that time all of what was going in their head is to basically execute the premeditated plan that they had in mind which is to ship me to send me to Louisiana they had the tickets the airplane tickets printed and ready the agents had the tickets ready so they drove you to Burlington well the airport the Yes so before they took me to the airport they took me to a building to process me and the processing which we expected to take place at the in St albins at the prison did not actually take place there so we I was surprised very surprised they processed me in a different building separate building only 10 minutes away from the airport and then they drive me to the airport and they hand me to two other agents who are supposed to fly me on a commercial flight and what happened at that moment um I asked the agents I said &quot;Are we going to Louisiana?&quot; And they said &quot;Yes.&quot; And I asked which direction so I clarified that it's going to stop by New York City then to Louisiana we went into the airport um and uh we realized that the flight was uh basically we were late the flight was about to take off it the the airplane was being taxied during that time I also uh was not feeling well so I had to use the restroom for a brief time and the moment I get out of the restroom while we're walking towards the gate we see the airplane being taxied away so your stop in the bathroom saved you from this plane i don't know if that is the the reason but some people think that this might be the reason when you got to the airport you saw the plane pulling when you got to the gate you saw the plane pulling away yes and what did the lat allow time for for your lawyer i mean um if you think of it that has changed the path of my legal uh my legal fight for justice it allowed my lawyers to fight on fair ground and to free me within 16 days something that other students as you saw weeks and months they've been in detention so you were held in detention in a prison in Vermont correct with other migrants that's right um in this prison in fact uh basically ICE rents a section of the prison and the section where I was it was a mixture of three quarters of people who have committed crimes before and one quarter of migrants who come in and out and I was uh my sill was uh C38 the first cell in that section where the migrants are so I saw waves of uh of uh the migrants those are not just migrants those are the people who feed us who plant our food who harvest our organic delicious Vermont produce like the dairy workers the dairy workers as well so I I was able to uh meet the first wave which is farm workers who you know worked on farms and the second wave was farm workers who worked on the dairy uh on in on sorry in dairy farms describe the conditions of your uh detention and what that brought to you um what that reminded you of uh fabric is of injustice you see them everywhere um I was prepared for worst case scenario so to be honest with you being in this prison uh was not as bad as I thought mentally um but the difficult parts was realizing this interconnectedness between injustices it reminded me of my uncles and specifically my uncle Abbid at some point when a guard shined the light through the squared window in the door and the light was so strong in my eyes and they remembered my uncle who had bloody eyes permanently um and then I thought where was your uncle my uncle was imprisoned in the Israeli prisons and now he he he he's no longer alive he was in two years ago that's correct he was born raised and died in a refugee camp the same refugee camp where I was born al yeah yeah and I had this realization when I was there i am now interconnected to three generations of my family my grandfather who was unjustly imprisoned my father and my uncles who were unjustly imprisoned and my cousins who were also unjustly imprisoned and now I can feel their pain you also lost your brother as well as other members of your family talk about where you were born talk about your family in the West Bank and in the Gaza what I am doing here in America this is exactly um the question that I hope for the government to ask and to look into rather than just labeling me uh what I've been protesting for is related to my firsthand life experience uh as a child um I buried my own brother when I was 8 years old he was 6 years old and my brother faced serious issues he was paralyzed because the Israeli army prevented my father from taking him to uh receive medical care the camp was under siege and then in the second inif when it started in 2000 I was 10 years old and I witnessed my best friend getting shot and killed in front of my eyes and the pain of injustice that you feel when you see just a kid who you loved so much be his life being taken away in a second is a painful experience but that wasn't it too my uncle on September 12 2001 after September 11 my uncle there was killed on the hands of the Israeli army as well where in Tamoon in fact between between uh between Al Farah refugee camp and Tammoon um the same town that five people were killed it's only five miles away actually 5 kilometers away about 3 miles away from the refugee camp the five people were just killed in the last day so it hits home um everything that I am seeing and I am witnessing i mean in the second and follow also I lost two cousins i was shot in my leg when I was 15 years old and some people would say oh what was happening and why those people were killed this does not what matters is that children live in pain in suffering in trauma and we have to see that for what it is and we cannot just justify the killing the murder the continuous occupation the apartheite the genocide we cannot justify it anymore we either have to be pro peace or pro war there is no third option enough is enough so so many people are suffering and for me many family members in the West Bank since October 7th for cousins in Gaza more than 30 of my extended family and I come here to Colombia and what I do I share my pain with the world and I say this is so painful the war must stop children are suffering the trauma is unbearable and what they do the American government and the extreme groups the pro-Israel extreme groups they want to silence me they don't want me to grieve they don't want me to share the pain they don't want me to share the loss they don't want me to ask for justice it doesn't matter if I'm doing it in the most peaceful nonviolent way or not they want to silence me you were president of the Colombia University Buddhist Association for two years what made you become a Buddhist i discovered Buddhism when I came to America and um what made me become Buddhist is the the practice of meditation and empathy that helped me with my pain and the trauma that I buried as a child so when I came to America for the first time in my life I was provided with a level of safety to feel safe and when you have that level of physical and emotional safety the trauma starts surfacing and Buddhism has helped me to center to calm my emotions and to be able to connect with the other even my oppressors even people who cause me harm and this is how I started my journey and dived deeper into Buddhism um until I led the Buddhist association at Colombia over these last few months the protests that have taken place across the country calling for the release of the detained students uh like yourself um have been massive and on April 20th protesters gathered at Union Square to call for your release the protest was organized by Israelis for peace uh this is Josh Drill an Israeli American master student at Columbia University to deport someone like Men sends a chilling message that peaceuilders are not welcome here it derails the very path we so desperately need and it actively stops Israelis and Palestinians from meeting as a peace collective we cannot allow this to happen we cannot allow this deport these deportations to happen they threaten our future at that protest I also spoke to the New York City controller Brad Lander who is running for mayor right now this is somebody who grew up in a refugee camp in the West Bank uh saw a friend be killed by an Israeli soldier and yet rather than turn to vengeance when you pick up a rock or a gun turn to Buddhism and becomes a peace activist and comes here and goes into synagogue speaking about empathy controller running for mayor Brad Lander also Zoran Mandani who's running for mayor has come out in support of you what was that like how did you experience that in prison um it might be uh too cheesy to say that I have never felt as much love and support as much as I felt when I was in the cell i was not able to see the full spectrum of support and uh of love and of protests but I um I heed about some of the action that was taking place and I have to say I was deeply moved by seeing the everybody who has mobilized and protested but more specifically by the Israeli and Jewish community in New York City and in America really like moving and raising their voices against my detention um also Judge Crawford noted his court had received more than 90 statements and letters i understand now it's well over a hundred from Vermont community members academic experts and professors many of them Jewish vouching for your character what did that mean to you Mosen it meant that I am heed that I am being seen that my advocacy and work for peace and for justice did not go for nothing all of this is the Trump administration uh went after you um saying you promoted anti-semitism what did Secretary of State Marco Rubio uh claimed in a memo that the New York Times obtained that your actions could quote potentially undermine the Middle East peace process your response i am not sure if they actually have a peace process if they have a peace process let them show us what the plan is what we are doing is we are protesting and we are standing against war we're asking for um America and for the rest of the world to abide by international law and human rights as a first step this government has been violating the basic principles of human rights and the basic principles that international law was established on they're violating this country's own laws the Lehey laws and if they are accusing the former senator of Vermont exactly and and uh what they what they are doing they're gaslighting the American people and they are pointing the wrong direction um my response to this is listen to the peacemakers who we have Palestinians Israelis Jews Muslims Americans everyone and see the fact and the reality for what it is what they're trying to do they're trying to distract from the real issue and the real issue is funding and supporting a genocide and dehumanizing Palestinians and seeing them as less of a value don't deserve equal rights as everybody else mosen Madawi can you talk about your dreams for the future starting with next week class Day is Monday i don't know if it was time for the 100th anniversary of Malcolm X's birthday but that is Monday May 19th graduation is Wednesday what does it mean for you to be here in New York graduating with your classmates this is uh a long waited for a journey this is the seed of hope that my uncle the has planted in me when I was 11 years old and when I was in deep level of pain after the loss and horror and the trauma that I felt and he said to me he said after the Nakba the 1948 we lost everything but our minds and our souls and he said education and hope is your only way and your path moving forward because we have nothing left and in honor of my uncle's spirit I continued studying really hard until I made it to this point despite of all of the obstacles with the Israeli occupation and now what it means to me it means that I can share this light of hope not only with my uncle's spirit that might be hovering above us but also with the children who are living in painful conditions in Gaza the children who lost their parents who lost their friends their family members who have been terrorized with all of the pain and the destruction and the bombing i tell them that there is a way moving forward and that way is education education is light education is hope and education is the path to move forward you're not only hoping to graduate next week walking with your classmates um but then you want to go on to SEIPA to the Colombia School of International and Public Affairs graduate school where you've been accepted the judge in Vermont says you should be able to be here in New York to continue your educational activities yes um this is also to fulfill the dream that I have the dream of peacemaking of conflict resolution this is the whole point I came to Colombia and this is the whole point why I am going to study at SEAL um the American government as it seems to me they don't want me to continue my education they didn't want me to graduate and they don't want me to get my master's degree i also have to share that what happens at Columbia University matters for the rest of America the Columbia University administration as I have been witnessing it has been participating in the deterioration and destruction of the democratic system they are not listening to their students the students have like the majority of the student body have voted to divest from war any entities that are supporting the apartheid and the genocide colombia University administration is not listening and in a matter of few days I will be walking and I would be walking with a conflict mixed feelings the feeling that I love this university that has given me tools to express my thoughts and to yearn and to achieve my dreams for freedom and for justice and the other feeling is that I feel deeply disappointed by the Columbia University administration and I know that it's going to continue to be a struggle while I am going to be finalizing my master's degree as you and Raa Ourk the Tus University student um and Baranssuri the Georgetown scholar are released uh others remain detained like Mahmood Khalil a judge in Vermont among those determining his fate what is your message to those still behind bars and those whose names we don't know i say um the same message that don't give up and don't give up on the idea of justice justice is inevitable it's a matter of time and don't give into despair what we are seeing with my release with Rome's release and with Dr uh Khan release those are light of hope and you will be next and we will be able to celebrate you very very soon the same message that the Gazan people have been sending to us we're gaining strength from them to see all of the destruction almost no buildings left in Gaza no schools universities that I'm going to graduate no no more universities for students to attend or to graduate from in Gaza a painful reality they are sending us a message that there is so much more to hope for than giving up on the idea of justice and surrendering to fear and to violence so I say stay strong and we will celebrate under the sun in a matter of very short time democracy Now is funded by viewers like you please give today at democracynow.org/give org/g" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="the end of President Trump's friendship with Elon Musk was never really a question of if but when and now we know the answer except maybe we don't for all we know they could be back together before summer meanwhile in the real world Russia's war against Ukraine grows more dire iran gets closer to nuclear breakout israel slides further toward crisis and at home the rule of law is in real danger next this is Washington Week with the Atlantic corporate funding provided by Consumer Cellular additional funding is provided by Coup and Patricia Euan through the Euan Foundation committed to bridging cultural differences in our communities sandra and Carl Delay Magnus Rose Hershel and Andy Shrieves Robert and Susan Rosenbomb the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and by contributions to your PBS station from viewers like you thank you once again from the David M rubenstein studio at Weta in Washington editor-inchief of The Atlantic and moderator Jeffrey Goldberg good evening and welcome to Washington Week i want everyone to know that I take the Trump Musk breakup drama seriously in part because Donald Trump gave his former best friend Elon Musk access to enormous amounts of secret government data and there's no predicting what Musk could do with it but the world at large is in a state of seemingly permanent tumult and so it's a good time for a general checkup my guest tonight is Thomas Freriedman a three-time Pulitzer Prizewinning journalist and foreign affairs columnist for the New York Times tom thanks for coming in for our seemingly annual annual checkup um the uh I I I want to ask you about this Elon Musk uh business um and maybe we can put it into some serious context before I before we we jump to that I want to read something that uh my colleague Charlie Warzel writing in the Atlantic this morning um had to say uh the sun rises every morning spring turns to summer water is wet Donald Trump and Elon Musk's relationship has ended with a post about Jeffrey Epstein and then of course you know he he tweeted &quot;These guys really do escalate quickly.&quot; Um uh Trump Musk tweeted &quot;Time to drop the really big bomb real Donald Trump is in the Epstein files that is the real reason they have not been made public have a nice day DJT um so put this into some kind of context that makes sense for ordinary people what is going on here well I I confess Jeff on the way over I thought you'd ask me about this and um the first thing that popped into my mind was the Iran Iraq war what did we say about the Iran Iraq war if only both sides could lose okay so uh there's no hero in this story um what it really is is the latest manifestation to me of the central truth of the Trump 2 administration trump one was surrounded by buffers trump 2 was surrounded by amplifiers and therefore stuff that used to begin at the Mara Largo bar and then get muffled in the Oval Office now goes from the Mara Larago bar right to the Oval Office right to you and me and whether it's what he feels about you know Musk or his role he wants him in the government but to me the whole must phenomenon is part of a much deeper and more disturbing phenomena from an American citizen point of view which is nothing here is modeled nothing here is stress tested everything is a riff the country is being run like the Trump organization today not like the United States of America and so as a result of that Jeeoff there's no second order thinking all right what's second order thinking i'm going to put on tariffs okay uh 10% across the board including Canada and Mexico even though I'm violating an agreement I signed with them when I was president last time uh second order thinking is oh my god you mean the Ford F150 only onethird of its parts are made in America um and the other two-thirds now are going to be tariffed i will bet any amount of money no one told him that and that's true now of everything and so you know for the first trimester of this administration you think the first three months all of this was kind of entertaining but now he's running up against a wall it turns out he can't solve the Russia Ukraine war overnight turns out tariff wars aren't easy to win uh turns out you know Musk is not going to you know do the revolution in the government form turns out courts sometimes don't like what you do exactly and so I think the second you know uh three months are going to get very interesting as he runs into this reality and I I don't know where it's going to go but I it it leaves me disqu that's interesting i was think as you were saying this I was thinking about John Kelly General John Kelly being uh and along with General Mattis and and others uh being those buffers or filters uh there's literally no one in the White House or in the whole system who does anything but amplify is that fair to say yeah I mean I I just don't Treasury Secretary I I I just don't see it you I mean yeah you hear these stories that the Treasury Secretary had to wait you know for um uh one of the other you know economic guys Peter Navaro to be out of the room for him to come in to try to change the tariffs this is crazy stuff now I happen to be in China twice in the last six months i've watched a lot of this from China actually and and when you see it from China I mean they say a couple things one is you know we are never going to put our president in a situation like Zalinsky in the Oval Office where he can be embarrassed number one the second thing they say Jeff is that this isn't cute we just saw Donald Trump tear up a trade agreement that Donald Trump made with America's two closest neighbors and allies Canada and Mexico what is the value therefore of a trade agreement with him now and um you know the Chinese uh uh these are these are you like them or hate them these are serious people you know and they are not spontaneous no exactly so when Trump put the 147 um 44% tariff on them they said &quot;Uh you talking to me you talking to me do you realize that we control 90% of the rare earths that make the magnets that go in every car you make do you realize that?&quot; Which he didn't which is why Ford and GM and Stalantis had to announce this week we may actually have to uh curb some production because we're running out of Chinese magnets right stay stay with uh stay with this Musk question for a minute and and and this this this this issue of Musk as a as a radical isotope in a kind of way he's been given access to government secrets across the board in order to cut government agencies through the Doge operation um that seems like an operational security nightmare if he goes rogue surprising to you i mean how h where does this where does this relationship go can they bring it back from the brink is there anybody who's trying to bring it back from the brink or is this just more chaos well you know I think the best way to understand this is not with the analogy of political science but World Wrestling Federation right and and those uh uh in World Wrestling Federation there are breakups and comeback and new teams and and and whatnot i I put this all in the area of entertainment you know not in in something ser we're dealing with two extremely unstable characters but what really is is more important is what's the wider world audience saying what's the wider world audience saying they're saying you know for for all of our lifetime Jeff sort of post-war America if I had an extra dollar and I'm a foreigner I'm going to put it in America if I have a extra you know brain power and and a and a brainy person I'm going to study in America and if I have a little extra dollop of trust I'm going to trust America now you take all three of those things away and you end up with a a very different relationship between America and the world okay so I have to ask you and by the way it's interesting right miami is Miami because it's a safe place for people money harvard is or was Harvard because people want to come from around the world and and so on and the United Nations is headquartered in New York you know you know I mean everybody for for a reason we were the we were the we wrote the the rules of the road for the post-war international order so the question is you're an ally or an adversary and you're looking at at at this uh clown show by the way on the weekend that marks the 81st anniversary of D-Day noting just for the record um you you put yourselves in the shoes of an ally and adversary are you thinking that this is a midlife crisis America's having um a nervous breakdown or is this some kind of weird terminal illness um you know I don't know which all I know is I'm completely disoriented if I'm an ally and I'm completely disoriented if I'm the foreign affairs columnist for the New York Times because I've never covered this world and you know um uh our friend you know Fred Zakari wrote a book um uh uh 15 years ago or so called the postamerican world and Freed's book was really about a change in relative power right you know uh between that there'll be the rise of Brazil and India and other countries so we won't have as much power as we had before what really if if I were writing a book today uh Jeff would be called the post America world okay that's what I'm really worried about because America stood for some things it stood for universal values uh it stood for stability it stood for the rule of law it was a loyal ally we were always against the dictator versus the people seeking freedom what really worries me that at the end of my you know career basically I'm I'm dealing with the post America world the America I grew up and loved and was devoted to and as someone who lived abroad like you have know how important that America is to the whole world american optimism and stability makes the world go around you you take us out of the equation it's not like anybody else comes in i'm sorry you have you have a no superpower world right you know right but but come back to this is this do you think that this instability that we're experiencing emotional political all the instabilities that we're experiencing could it be temporary or is this can we not come back reputationally to start well the thing I'm worried about most is that and it may seem like a simple thing but you know uh Donald Trump came in and he told all the Democrats on the board of the Kennedy Center you're gone now traditionally every president sort of left the other party's people there and then he put in his people so when you enter into a kind of zero sum politics now in America when you fire the head of the an NASA uh after you appointed him because he made a donation a tiny don donation to a Democrat um you're into a kind of politics that I grew up with in the Middle East what was that rule or die okay you're either in power or you're it's zero sum okay i'm on top or I'm in and and so there's a book about African dictators called It's Our Turn to Eat you know and we're just going to eat everything so then no no if you're a Democrat and and guess what we do have God willing if we still have elections rotations in power do they come in now and treat all the Republicans in these traditional bipartisan forum you know the same way and if that happens we're really off to the races then the whole thing just starts to What country does that remind you of that vision you know you you you you I mean so many dictatorships just in general that I' I've I've covered over the years that's what you come in you wipe out all the other guys people well that's not how we do things in this country right right let's talk about a country that's not democratic for a second um you know the the I I want you to watch this it's the latest analysis by President Trump of the current state of play uh in in Russia's war against Ukraine and it's he's talking about Putin here he got hit he's been doing hitting so I understand it but he got hit hard and I don't think he's playing games i said &quot;Uh President maybe you're going to have to keep fighting and suffering a lot because both sides are suffering before you pull them apart before they're able to be pulled apart.&quot; But it's a pretty known uh analogy you you have two kids they fight fight fight sometimes you let them fight for a little while you see it in hockey you see it in sports not to Henry Kissinger but he's trying to impose his own real politique understanding of what is he misunderstanding from your perspective Jeff do you know how flatout crazy that is i mean that's like saying well you know I mean Hitler and Poland they fight they fight they come back you know what I mean um Trump came in and said I can end this war all right um uh there's one way to end this war you say to Vladimir Putin um if you don't stop the war um uh and and we agree to the ceasefire terms I dictate we are bringing Ukraine into NATO in 30 days which part of that sentence don't you understand now you want to mess with me test me that's how you end this war what you just heard of Donald Trump that sounded like a commentator on Fox TV he's not that commentator he's president of United States well he hit him and he hit them well he hit this guy invaded a country he's basically tried to rape a country that's what Putin did okay and the Ukrainians with incredible bravery stood up and defended basically the Western Alliance on something that's very important because if Ukraine were able to join the European Union Jeff then you have a Europe that's really whole and free that's actually a big deal for Europe and for us and this guy's talking about it like it's some schoolyard fight and they're morally equal it's nuts and it's it's disgusting right is there any issue from a foreign affairs columnist perspective is there any issue in which Trump is not transactional have you ever seen Have you ever seen a sign of um what we would think of as in a bipartisan way American idealism out of Trump um none comes to mind what I would say I where I thought you might be going is um uh you know some things are also true even if Donald Trump believes them and by the way his transactionalism sometimes can also be an advantage for instance I'm glad he's sitting down with the Iranians let's see what you got i'm glad he told the Syrian president um uh I'm going to give you a reputation to live up to i didn't mind him talking directly to Hamas if I can get the hostages out so there is that transactional side of him that I think could be an advantage but if not grounded in any moral you know framework of what we stand for as a country and what we've always stood for um if it's just a kind of free floating thing it it becomes very very dangerous yeah in in his non-sophisticated analysis of the current state of play uh in Russian and Ukraine uh he didn't really talk about the drone attack that Ukraine launched on Russian aerial assets deep in inside Russia does that change this war um you know you know Jeeoff I'd say two things and again it's part of the craziness of this moment let's start at 30,000 ft and then come down to the battlefield at 30,000 feet you and I are having this discussion on the eve of the greatest technological revolution in human history we are very close to uh birthing a new species not a new machine a new artificially intelligent species um and it's going to be with us under some sometime while Trump is president it is not going to change one thing it's going to change everything we are not talking about that at all so that's I would say number one under that technological revolution um and you know one of the things they say about AI it'll actually be mankind's last invention because once we invent that it will invent everything else that's going to be a big deal under that though we're seeing a revolution in military affairs basically Ukraine um spent $20,000 to to knock out you know uh $20 million planes $20,000 that was probably because they couldn't get Costco online you know from Kiev and they had to buy them from Amazon you know um so the the the asymmetric warfare world that we're entering now um wow i mean if you're the US Navy and you're sitting with 12 aircraft carriers and you just recovered from the fact that the Houthis you know you lost an FA Hornet cuz you had to swerve your aircraft carrier and the and the plane fell off the back because you were getting out of way of not not a sterling moment in naval history because you're avoiding a Hooty missile a bunch of guys in flip-flops basically um in a country that's bas water starved the asymmetry we're going to be dealing with right now um uh I think we have we these these events are really disturbing and and going to require a huge revolution in how we think about military as I'm listening to you about AI AGI and and drone warfare I I'm just thinking that the the the preoccupation this weekend in America is the emotionally fearal relationship between this ketamine taking billionaire and our reality TV star president and it's like there there's something that's so deeply unserious about Yeah and I think I think it's been true of our country that basically everything became politics um and so we don't have just ESPN now we have PSBN you know sort of politics sports network right and it's it's it's a testament to the the underlying strength of our country Jeff that our economy goes on we still invent amazing stuff and we we think we can afford this and and you know what Jeff we we can't afford it until we can right let me pivot uh finally toward the Middle East um and and ask you this and and you know I've read your recent columns on this subject you're a severe critic of Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli prime minister and the way he's conducted this war and of Hamas which is No no no and I want and I want to get there but what I don't understand from reading you is this so Hamas and its allies seek the annihilation of Israel they state that it's not a secret yeah um how does Israel end the war without totally defeating Hamas in other words In other words is it I understand the criticisms but h how do they how do they coexist in a with a neighbor who won't allow coexistence um they don't um I'm all for Israel completely defeating Hamas militarily uh what I am not for are the three alternative choices that u Israel had after that defeat that Netanyahu refuses to make one choice is we defeat them and we Israel the Jewish state occupy Gaza forever that will be the moral and economic end of Israel another choice is we just leave and we turn it into Mogadishu that will also be terrible for Israel the third choice the one I favor is you create an Arab international peacekeeping force in partnership with the Palestinian Authority and over time you build an alternative to Hamas i'm what my criticism of Netanyahu is not fighting Hamas um not even crushing Hamas it's not creating any alternative Palestinian structure and therefore leaving the Jewish people with the choice Jeff of permanently occupying Gaza or having Mogadishu there and permanently occupying Gaja we know what that's going to do that's going to create a world where your grandchildren and mine are going to grow up in a world where they will learn what it is to be Jewish in a world where the Jewish state is a pariah and that is a disaster and that's what I'm fighting but it there is a double standard obviously in in the world um when it comes to judging Israel's behavior um but I guess you're just saying that you have to live with that that's the world as it is that's the world as it is um you quoted a hood Oldm merit the former prime minister of of Israel a center-right prime minister saying that Israel is committing war crimes and this is why he needs the the war to start do you agree that Israel is committing war crimes you know I have not entered into that whole linguistic fight because my position has been from the very beginning I'm here to do one thing figure out how to end this thing you know I'm old Jeff 71 i covered the Hama massacre so chhatila the American embassy bombing i've covered all of them okay and I said to myself I'm not going to be the scorekeeper of this i'm focused on one thing not who shot who who did the worst thing to the because they all do terrible things at different times i want to figure out how to end it and that's where I put all my energy from the very very beginning and and my if you've read my stuff on Hamas it's the same thing what is Hamas's position today very simple we want a ceasefire and we want Israel out of Gaza oh really what did you have on October 6th before this war started that's what you had so you fought this whole war you allowed 40 50,000 people to be killed to get you back to where you started shame on you but I can't you know control them i can't figure them out all I know I am I I do believe that if we want to see a Jewish and democratic Israel that's what I do care about palestinians have to figure that out you've got to find a way to get out of Gaza in a way that will create also in partnership with the different Palestinian authorities let me ask you one last question because you're an expert on this for many decades several decades many sounds too dire uh what does Netanyahu not understand about American politics and about American Jewish politics well I think Netanyahu is shocked by what's going on here because Trump Netanyao always could go around any American president and now he can't because he's looking for the Republican base she's pulling that lever and it comes off in kind of looks like a little bit of a sucker thinking that Joe Biden was bad for Israel exactly you know it turns out there are other worse things right and what about um what does he need to understand about American Jews you know I I think what he doesn't understand about American Jews is that you know they're ready to be with him they want Israel that's successful democratic um and um uh if you they are really important to Israel standing in America and you abandon them for evangelical Christians you'll regret that one day right right well um it's enormously complicated as is Russia Ukraine as is everything

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] it gets very counterintuitive because if I understand you correctly Zionism is essentially a turning away from Judaism yet Israel is constantly employing or using their religious symbology of Judaism and so why would Zionism if it has this contempt or um even hatred for as you were describing earlier for Judaism why is it at the same time seemingly embracing this symbology as something that is very proud of it it seems like a mismatch three things thing number one the Evangelical C Christians the Evangelical Christians are Israel's biggest supporters and they're much more powerful and much more numerous than the Jewish zionists when you hear nanyu speak about biblical exegesis some interpretation of the Bible from experience I can tell you he's talking about Christian Evangelical interpretations and not Jewish ones that's one number two there are Jewish Orthodox Jewish zionists and these guys have developed a mixed up philosophy a mixed up ideology where they Incorporated Jewish nationalism into their religion settlers are the primary example we consider them regular normal Orthodox Jews we consider them Idol worshippers uh Zionism is idol worship because it phys physicalized a spiritual concept um the actual Jewish identity it spiritualized the whole Jewish religion uh they are like the olden day idol worship ERS in the days of the Bible that were religious Jews but on the side worshiped Idols as well that's the settlers as far as we're concerned so that's the second thing guys like benir guys like smotrich the settler rabbis that that's their thing third thing is that it's just an I question of symbolism it it's a question of um you know like they say that they no atheists in a foxhole it's a just a way to G the troops imagine Donald Trump for example like the least religious person in the whole uh Milky Way galaxy right imagine one day I know America would be at War and I know there would be Muslims against Christians or something and he would start quoting the Bible and Jesus and we would all know that it's a joke but it would have value in the sense that the trumpies his followers who are religious let's say evangelicals or whatever they would actually say whoa Donald Trump is quoting the Bible you know this is inspiring to us and Netanyahu is no more religious than Donald Trump and he's no and you know by the way Donald uh Netanyahu has a daughter who's religious an orthodox Jew he's ashamed of her okay yeah I know a rabbi that uh wrote an article about it um but Donald Trump has a daughter who's Jewish Ivanka I don't think he's ashamed of her maybe she's ashamed of him but I don't think I never heard that vice versa in any case Netanyahu is no more religious than Donald Trump and him quoting that it's just because he's in an environment where quoting religious symbolism um is Meaningful the whole idea of Zionism was to take the Jewish symbols and make them into Political tools to take the Holy Land itself and make it into a political tool so if they say Israel is the Jewish homeland right they're using Israel uh the Holy Land Jerusalem and the zionists came to Jerusalem when the zionists started Israel they weren't interested in Jerusalem Jerusalem was a place of Orthodox Jews but as Zionism the Zionist indoctrination succeeded increasingly in breeding these mixed breed Jews which are half Idol worshippers half zionists half Orthodox Jews there became an increasing connection between these Jewish symbols and the cooperation of uh Israeli citizens with people that invoke those symbols and that's why natany is doing it he has no idea even he has no idea what he's talking about he doesn't really mean it he doesn't believe in it it's just you know something he does kind of like a non-religious you know in the olden days even the non-religious Vikings would would talk about the name of Odin you know but it doesn't really mean anything that's that's that's just the way Israel is working and it is very confusing and it's designs to be confusing it's designed to be very confusing now there actually were zionists at the early days of Zionism that said well oh hey if Israel if being a Jewish is become going to become a nationality we can indeed have Jews who are Christians and the holy sepulture will be guarded by Jews who are Christians and the Omar Masque will be Ed by Jews who are Muslims but others disagreed with that now the zionists were creating some fantasy and they could make it anything they wanted they made it whatever worked whatever got people's Bard in even buying even if it didn't make any sense and today we have a Haj pod of unintelligible Babel that they call Zionist philosophy now here's more first there's the an there's the um idea that if you are not Jewish Israel is not your state which means that Israel can never be the state of its citizens it's the state of the Jews so as I was saying how they look at themselves they look at the Jewish people the way turk turkey looks at the Turkish citizens they don't think that they're discriminating against non-jews any more than turkey would think they're discriminating against non-turks non-citizens because in America in France um in Germany citizenship and uh nationality is together that're together not in Israel now listen to this about 10 years ago there was a Supreme Court case in Israel some guys uh wanted to make an Israeli nationality they petitioned the court because they said having a Jewish nationality and a Jewish state is discriminatory against Israeli citizens that are not Jewish and the court said no we do not want to make an Israeli nationality so well if we make an nationality and keep the Jewish nationality then you can only have one nationality so are the Israeli Jews Israeli or Jewish so you're talking about making an Israeli nationality and getting rid of the Jewish nationality which will be great that's the truth but they said first of all you know let me read it to you okay this from the Israel democracy Institute a think tank in Israel they're describing the the courts ruling if na the nationality of Jewish citizens of Israel were to be classified as Israeli the implication would be that Judaism is not a nationality for them but solely a religion this idea is anti antithetical to the fundamental doctrine of Zionism and its main thinkers from Herzel to benan who saw Zionism as the national movement of the Jewish people so here you have Zionism stating that we need to have an Israeli National a Jewish nationality because that's Zionism and I know the court didn't say that's why Jews looked at themselves throughout history they did not Israel's probably greatest political scientist schlom ainer in his book The Making of modern Zionism uh points out that gretz the historian was the first first one or he was more responsible than anybody else for making the Jews think of themselves as a nationality but that's Zionism it's not Jewish identity it's a new fangled identity for the Jews third if the nationality of the Jewish Israelis is defined as Israeli rather than Jewish then the national Bond We Believe binds together Jews in Israel and Jews in the diaspora will be severed the court dealt with this last Point extensively it adopted the position that one of Israel's essential characteristics as a quote unquote Jewish state is its responsibility for the fate of the entire Jewish people including Jews of the diaspora the responsibility of state of is of the state of Israel for World jury is an important expression of the fact that Israel is not an ordinary Democratic state but also a Jewish State though we may be divided by geography and citizenship Israeli and American Jews and their brothers and sisters around the world are members of One Nation so now we have clearly somebody submitted that a Jewish nationality this whole idea that Israel is not this country of its citizens but the country of this Jewish nationality is discriminatory and the the answer is well yes that but that's what Zionism wants a country for the Jews you either have Zionism or you have democracy and here by the way by the way there is no country in the world like this I cannot overemphasize this there is no other country in the world like this and if somebody understands this about Israel and about Zionism they'll understand a lot of things so for example I'm sure you've heard many times the talking point uh that well there's only one Jewish State and I don't know 25 Arab states or 25 Muslim states but I have news for you there is not a single Arab state in the world that's an Arab state in the sense that Israel claims to be a Jewish one because there's no Arab state that claims to be the nation state of all Arabs Saudi Arabia is the state of the Saudi Arabians but it does not claim to be the state of all Arabs all over the world there's no muslim state that claims to be the state of all Muslims all over the world there's only one country that claims to be my actually there are two two countries that claim to be my state United States of America because I carry their passport and I am the I am a citizen of America and Israel because I'm Jewish and they unilaterally decided that they are my country there was no other country in the world like Israel so somebody tells you well you need a Jewish State the Holocaust and all these things no excuse that Israel has no util utility value that Israel claims whether it's true or not no practical purpose that Israel claims is excuse or justifies Israel claiming that they are the state of all Jews all over the world as opposed to the state of their citizens the fact that Israel claims to be my state that it demands my loyalty there was no excuse for that now when I tell this to people they say you know you're right uh Italy doesn't demand the Loyalty or doesn't claim any uh status over the italian-americans why should my answer but I'm saying no that's that's not nearly the problem over here if I would be Israeli American then the analogy to Italy to the italian-americans would be a good analogy but I'm not an Israeli American my family's from Poland it's it's not that well yes it's like Italy doesn't claim any uh status over italian-americans it's that Italy doesn't claim any uh status over the Chinese Americans Israel arbitrarily decided that they are the country of the Jews who made them the spokesman for the Jews nobody they just unilaterally declared themselves such they declared themselves the spokesman of the Jews the speakers of the Jews the country of the Jews the nation state of the Jews their prime ministers the prime minister of the Jews and this is Zionism and if you want to get rid of the imbalance in Israel if you want to make Israel a normal country like all other countries you need to get rid of this law this idea of Zionism that Israel is the state of the Jews there are many people um who claim to be anti-zionist but they're not really anti-zionist they're really Pro Palestinian and I'll I'll tell you who those people are let's assume theoretically that there would be a two-state solution and let's assume theoretically the Palestinians and the Israelis would both be happy with it I know it's not happening but in theory and let's assume even that the Palestinians get 90% % of the land and Israel ends up with 10% of the negative desert but Israel's happy are these anti zionists now happy sure why not well I'm not happy because nothing changed about Israel in my theoretical scenario Israel still claims to be the state of the Jews Israel claims to be not the state of its citizens there are there will still be Muslims or Christians or Buddhists or whatever in Israel Israel is not their state if you're anti-zionist then you want Israel to be the state of its citizens not the state of the Jews because that's what Zionism is in a nutshell the Israel's own Supreme Court said it must be there that way only because Zionism says so because Israel claims to be the state of the Jews that you want to fight Zionism now I'll give you a Way Forward I'm wondering how this ties into a really interesting observation made on Katie Hal's show who we actually just had the sure interviewing here a moment ago Katie helper um so uh there's an issue you take now I have to get this right because there's so many qualifications uh there is an issue you believe with Jews who are denouncing Israel while partaking within Pro Palestinian solidarity movements um and what is the all the exactly there the reason why Israel isn't a one-state solution already right is because Israel is the state of the Jews and not the state of the Israelis if Israel would be the state of the Israelis like all other normal countries then you'd have Palestinian Israelis you'd have American Israelis you'd have I know Israeli Israelis and they one person one vote but that's not what Israel wants to be because that's when not that's what Zionism says it shouldn't be without Zionism Israel is a state of the Israelis with Zionism Israel state of the Jews when Israel says they're my country in the same breath the other side of the coin says it's not the country of the non-jews even if they're in Israel certainly if they're in territories therefore if you want to negate Zionism and that's really the problem over here you see this is the issue if Israel would be a normal country like Canada Australia or America we wouldn't have these issues it's because of the ideology of Zionism okay therefore Z since Zionism means that Israel is the country of the Jews any reinforcement or strengthening of that idea is strengthening Zionism and strengthening the problem I'm talking about the root cause of the problem you know Israel bombing Gaza you want them to stop bombing Gaza you can tell them stop bombing Gaza I got that so I can tell America don't bomb Afghanistan Israeli citizens can tell them stop bombing Gaza anybody in the world can tell America to stop bombing Afghanistan let's say right but if somebody comes and says well no an I'm an American and I'm Jewish and because I'm Jewish therefore I have special standing to tell Israel what to do even a Jewish guy says Israel is doing something bad tell me what do you mean even a Jewish guy if you don't like a particular act that Israel is doing you could be a Zionist and say you know I don't want I'm a Zionist I believe Israel is the state of the Jews because that's what Zionism means and I don't want Israel to bomb Gaza I want to ceasefire those are the leftwing zionists but if you want to fight Zionism if you want to negate Zionism not just make a ceasefire make peace you want to negate Zionism if you want Israel to be a country like all other countries which I wish it would be by the way this is much a fantasy as a two-state solution because Israel designist would never do this so it's not even on the table I'm talking theoretically I would love Israel to be like the United States of America anybody that comes and says because I'm Jewish therefore I have special standing and I'm using my special standing as a Jew to tell Israel what to do excuse me you're an American you're Jewish by religion or are you Jewish by nationality and if if you're Jewish by nationality is Israel the the state of the Jewish Nation if you agree with that then you're in you're a Zionist well yeah this what I'm trying to understand so is there like a subtext or an implication that when a person does that they're saying that Israel does represent the Jewish exactly because if you say look I say that all Jews should object to Israel's claiming to be the state of the Jews I say all the time I've done been doing it for decades Israel is no more connected to the Jews than China is that means not merely that Israel doesn't speak for the Jews you know people say not in my name not that this particular act that you're doing should not be done in my name even though you're the Jewish State wrong no Israel acting in the name of the Jews even when they're doing something good is like China is saying they're acting in the name of the Jews if we want to to end Zionism or everybody has to understand Jews and non-jews that Israel is the state of the Israelis not the state of the Jews Israel must become the state of the Israelis not the state of the Jews any implication any reinforcement any strengthening of the idea the subtext as you're calling it that Israel is the state of the Jews enforce reinforces Zionism and in the long run doesn't serve this the purpose of Peace ceasefire yes it may but and the truth is that Jews in America have an exaggerated sense of their importance to or their impact on Israeli policy but never mind that for now if you really want to negate Zionism you must negate this one factor Israel must become the state of the Israelis and stop claiming to be the state of the Jews if all Jews would get up and say I have nothing to do with Israel I'm an American you you want to act for the Palestinians as an American you can be on anybody's side you want you're an American taxpayer America is is supporting Israel I'm not talking about that politics you can be on whatever side you want but if somebody invokes their standing as a Jew to say look even a Jew is against Israel then that even a Jew only makes sense if you agree that Israel represents the Jews just this particular thing you say no don't don't represent me by doing that so that enforces Zionism and Israel loves when Jews these leftwing Zionist Israel loves it because it means that there's a connection between Israel and the Jews and Israel's own Supreme Court this is Zionism what Jews must do is to say and and by the way this will help peace more than anything else Israel you want to Annex the territories that you're occupying you on one person one state there is no reason why you should need a specifically a Jewish majority uh you're worried about security let's talk about it let's have a discussion give me studies let's put the energy that is used to discuss one state two State red state blue state which is going nowhere and figure out how to make to get rid of one law that Israel has this law that Israel is the state of the Jews as opposed to the state of its citizens you know people say all the time well you could be anti- Zionist Israel has a right to exist but you could still you don't have a right to say Israel shouldn't exist although you can uh criticize Israel policy no problem I'm going to criticize Israel policy one policy you're the state of the Jews as opposed to the state of the citizens change that one policy and everything's over the problem with Israel is not that it shouldn't exist the problem is it does not exist now meaning not as a nationality Israel exists as a country but it's only a doing business name it's a DBA Jewish the state of the Jews DBA Israel it has citizens but as opposed to United States of America Israel has is not a nationality it has no Israeli nationality as opposed to France there is no Israeli nationality let Israel exist like every other country does right now there's the Jewish state that exists there's this front called Israel you don't like the name you want to call it I don't care what you call it let the citizens decide what what to call it if you don't like the name Israel call it Herzel Stan I always say or whatever you want call it Charlie I don't care but what needs to done is Israel needs to become a normal country like all other countries and the way to do it is by changing this one policy of Israel and the truth is if people would know about this policy people would understand what Zionism is and what Israel claims there'll be a lot less zionists out there you know people say well so many Jews are Zionist but I've asked Jews you you you're a Zionist yeah you believe in Israel as the Jewish State yeah do you know what a Jewish State means it has a majority Jews well America has majority Christians is it a Christian State let me tell you what a Jewish State means it's not run according to Jewish law it's not run according to the talud it's run on contrary to all Jewish laws Israel's run according to more Roman Catholic laws uh more British laws than it is to American law to Jewish laws not run according to Judaism at all a je Israel being the Jewish State means and I'm talking to a Jew now Israel is your country and not America Israel is your nation state nanyu is your prime minister you don't have a right to vote see if you're a citizen but not a national of Israel you have a right to vote if you're a Jewish National but you're not a citizen you have no right to vote you're a Jewish you have no right to vote but Israel represents you do you think Israel is your country not America you believe that Japan is to the Japanese which is is to the Jews that America is to the Americans what Israel is to the Jewish Americans America is to the non-jewish Americans what Israel is to the Jewish Americans no I wouldn't believe that then you're an anti-zionist Israel's own Supreme Court said that one of the uh Mainstay of Zionism and it really is the main state of Zionism is that Israel is the state of the Jews as opposed to the state of its citizens any I agree all Jews should say not in our name but not merely this particular act I don't like you to do this in my name you you should do something else in my name rather we should say you're like China claiming to be the Jewish State we have nothing to do with you you're not the state of the Jews American Jews are the state of America when the Nazis came to the Moroccans and and told them to give them Morocco's Jews so the head of Morocco said we don't have any Jews here we only have Moroccans we are Americans by nationality I'm polish whatever however you are originally um American nationality now and I'm Jewish by religion that's it you want to be Jewish by bagels and locks that's your Judaism doesn't make sense to me but fine but Israel has nothing to do with the Jews the Jews are not a nationality and even if they would be Israel is not their country feel almost begs the question is Israel actually oppressing Jewish people yes and if so do you see any commonalities between that and how it oppresses the Palestinian people and this is kind of what I was getting at at the beginning of the discussion whether you see maybe a silver lining there um namely uh the potential for new forms of allyship i as a matter of policy look I obviously anybody who sees those pictures coming out of Gaza if he has human blood cells in him right you you you you can't be indifferent to it I mean it's just it keeps you up at night it's it no question about it but I will not do anything that promotes Zionism the Palestinians are suffering no question about it so are the weager Muslims tell me why I now yes anybody interested in human rights issues will be interested in what's going on in Israel and Palestine and with China and the weager Muslims and Indian Kashmir but I as an American by national it of Polish Descent of the Jewish religion why would I be more allied with any of these particular groups now again yeah Israel's doing it in your name well excuse me Israel says they're doing it in my name to me that's a joke it's like China doing it my I will not cooperate and I will not strengthen and it doesn't do the Palestinians any favors honestly in my view for Jews to do that I will gladly say Israel is not the Jewish State you're doing things you claim in the name of the Jews you're lying you don't you have no standing to do that uh you claim to be the state of the Jews no you claim to be acting uh for the sake of the Jews no don't do me your favors don't do me any favors nothing Israel is China any excuse that Israel has for doing whatever they do uh by invoking their jewishness I denounce that absolutely but for me to say this particular human rights issue it's not indifference to this issue it's saying that I have no reason to be more involved in this issue than any other human rights issue tell me this is worse now okay got it last year something else was worse that's not the point right the point is it's counterproductive really to the cause for people to perceive even that Jews are represented by Israel and this Ally ship yes it's true that they persecute Jews they persecute Orthodox Jews they don't like us they want us to disappear off the face of the Earth or they want to make us into zionists they used to want us to disappear off the face of the Earth more now they want us to become zionists because they see it's it's possible to to do that um I don't think I would be doing the Palestinians any favor by strengthening Zionism just because they have an ally that's Jewish I wish the Palestinian people would understand this I you know they're very happy when Jews Orthodox non-orthodox are on their side and I mentioned to you earlier today that I saw a interview he did with a very articulate uh Muslim uh who was saying that even Jews now are on are against Israel if I had an opportunity to speak to this this Muslim I would tell him when you say even Jews that presupposes that by default Jews should be supporting Israel why well Israel is the state of the Jews just like by default Americans would be supporting America but it's wrong that that's Zionism if you say that by default Jews should be supporting Israel and it's remarkable that they're not that means that you've you you're Zionist influenced it's so it's almost like there's an aspect of identity politics there yes I call it identity theft yeah identity theft identity theft almost reaches a level of superstition it's like yes the moment you say that or the expectation is the moment that you say I'm Jewish it must mean that he support Israel well of course if you say you're Turkish that means you must support turkey by defa not everybody does if you say you're American you support America remember Israel is to the Jews what America is to the Americans that's Zionism and if you think that by default Jews should support Israel then by default you're thinking that Israel is the state of the Jews the way Americans would support America that is what this Muslim guy is thinking in his head and if I had an opportunity to explain to them that I understand that they're looking for allies and I understand that they're looking you know I call it the Jane Fonda effect you've heard this from me they're looking for their Jane fondas but Jane Fonda was an American who was uh siding with the North Vietnamese you want Israelis I'm looking for ivp Israeli voice for peace that's what you should look for there were Jewish an there were excuse me Israeli anti-zionist organization there was matzen means Compass a communist organization a guy AA or who was absolutely not religious but he wrote books explaining this very well um if the Palestinians are looking for allies let them look for Israelis Israeli allies a Jewish guy in America as an ally yeah they got an extra Ally but the price they paid for that Ally is that they're now supporting Zionism in the long run they're promoting Zionism in the long run so yeah if you're looking for a ceasefire fine you you can be a Zionist and want to seize fire and you're looking for leftwing zionists cuz these are the leftwing Zionist that's that's the way they are fine but if you looking to end Zionism which is toxic for Israelis for Jews for Palestinians Zionism helps nobody and it hurts every Zionism is bad ideology I wish all the Israelis and Palestinians long life and health and peace and I'll do whatever I can but I do not believe in my my bottom from the bottom of my heart I have studied this for decades and I can bet a lot of money and I believe in my heart of hearts that strengthening Zionism is not going to bring peace and by Jews invoking their status as Jews to say by default Jews should support Israel but here I'm not in this particular thing I'm not long-term peace is not going to happen that's Zionism that means Israel's a state of the Jews that means it's not the state of the non-jews even citizens if it's not the state of the non-jews you need a Jewish majority if you need a Jewish majority you need to take steps to guarantee a Jewish majority and that's why Israel is not the same as all other countries in the worldi this has been such a multi-layered thought-provoking discussion quite honestly there's a lot I'm going to thinking about after it for days at least um but I'm wondering before we wrap up if there's any final thoughts or observations that You' like to share yeah I think that people need to learn about Zionism about Israel uh there are books out there akor is you can actually download his stuff uh the unwish State I think it's called in some other title that escapes me es escapes me for a second um there are books out there that explain this and we need to understand that Israel doesn't represent the Jews that understanding the more people understand that the closer we are uh to peace I'm not King Solomon and I can't solve all the world's problems but I do know that in reinforcing Zionism just makes us further away from peace and negating Zionism the idea that Israel doesn't represent the Jews that every country is the should be the country of its citizens is is the is the path to peace thank you again thank you for having me" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="if Israel hypothetically decided we want to be in full compliance with international law what would it have to do in general there needs to be an end to racial discrimination and the domination by one racial group over another from the river to the sea taking center stage today is Ralph Wild a professor of international law at University College London he is probably best known for serving as senior counsel and advocate to the League of Arab States before the International Court of Justice wild argued before the court that Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territories is illegal and must end immediately ralph Wild thank you so much for joining us on Center Stage you argued in front of the judges of the International Court of Justice on behalf of the Arab League that Israel's presence on Palestinian territory is unlawful and must end immediately and that legal presentation got quite a lot of attention online it was described in some corners of the internet as a master class so we'd like to get the benefit of that for people who don't have a grounding in international law but who still want to know what the law says and what the law doesn't say can you sum up your arguments before the ICJ for us so the question that the court was addressing ended up being focused uh on the situation uh of the territories uh captured by Israel in 1967 which is of course only 22% of Palestine so within that uh limited framework the issue was what are the legal consequences of Israel's presence in that territory so we're talking about the Gaza Palestinian Gaza Strip and the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the court was considering is the presence in and of itself lawful does Israel have a legal right to even be there and also in the way Israel conducts its presence the way it behaves in Palestinian territory including the way it treats the Palestinian people is that lawful and the court determined uh uh that in the negative on both questions that Israel has no legal right to be there in the first place and must therefore withdraw and also that the conduct of the presence the conduct of the occupation is also violating international law so the opinion of the ICJ was that Israel and Israelis cannot be on Palestinian land that's right illegal on the land occupied since 1967 which is not the entirety of Palestinian land yes is that now binding international law that everyone must respect it was already the position in international law um the court was interpreting the existing law and determining what that law means so it amounts to an authoritative determination of what that law means by the uh the most distinguished uh jurists uh globally i want to make sure I get this right the binding versus non-binding because when I interview people who speak in defense of Israel and I bring up this advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice invariably they tell me &quot;Oh that's not minding.&quot; Yes the inference being it doesn't need to be respected well the law needs to be respected the law that the court determined uh uh the meaning of which the court determined in the advisory opinion needs to be uh complied with you opened your presentation your statement by saying &quot;Palestinians have been denied self-determination through and I quote a more than centurylong violent colonial racist effort to establish a nation state exclusively for the Jewish people in the land of mandatory Palestine.&quot; When you say racist is that a legal determination or is that a political statement in international law uh racial discrimination is unlawful and in general and then the uh a particular regime of uh domination by one group over another in a system of government and authority uh on the basis of racial domination is also unlawful as apartheite you use the word apartheite yes in your arguments the court in its advisory opinion did not what is the finding there the court uh clearly established that there was a violation uh of the relevant areas of international law uh without expressly referencing a partite as a a violation but nonetheless uh covering that uh without mentioning it in terms likewise when it came to um aggression in my reading of the opinion they did call it discrimination though discrimination and then they didn't specify whether it was racial religious or ethnic but in the way I read the opinion it's one of those three it's relig discrimination on one of those three grounds so the the the way that we can understand the court's decision is based on the arguments that were put before it which were all rooted in not only uh religious um discrimination which is also um uh the the situation but also discrimination on the grounds of race now if I try to cross-examine you I'm not going to be very successful i'm not a topflight international lawyer but what I can do is I can I I have read Israel's uh legal arguments that were put forward by uh Israeli the Israeli ambassador it's one-sided because it overlooks well dominating the other the Palestinians are not occupying uh Israeli land so uh the the by definition if the court's going to be considering the question of domination it it isn't going to be need needing to address any issue of the other side peacemaking has been scuttled on various occasions by the Palestinians themselves irrelevant to the issue of whether Israel has a right to dominate the Palestinian people it's a nonsear that's a uh introducing a consideration that has no bearing on the question of whether one uh racial group has a right to dominate another israel has a duty to protect its own citizens again uh irrelevant to the question of occupying Palestinian territory yes a duty to protect but not a duty to protect which involves the indefinite subjugation of an entire other of the racial group israel has valid long-standing historical ties to the land no legally no legally no i mean that's the claim it it doesn't have any legal foundation in in the League of Nations um uh uh covenant that was part of the Versail treaty the Palestine mandate um uh was supposed to be provisionally recognized as an independent state a state for everyone a single state for all the people on that land not a state for a particular racial group so the idea and Jew Israel is a a Jewish state by definition and there is no legal basis for a specifically Jewish state on that land in international law what is or would be Israel's strongest argument before a court of law for what to dominate the Palestinians to there is no argument for for for committing genocide i mean what what would be the what needs to be justified these come up often when I interview people who speak in defense of Israel let me let me Okay self-defense self Thank you okay you took the words out of my mouth this is the first thing that comes up yes so so let's go back to 1967 so why is Israel there there was a war between Israel and three of its uh uh neighbors israel started that war and it was a war started preemptively uh illegally because states cannot uh uh use force lawfully in non-immed immediately imminent anticipatory self-defense as a result of that illegal war Israel captures the territory it has no right a state has no right to retain control over territory simply for security purposes and the right of self-defense therefore is inapplicable to that kind of action states have to deal with security threats nonforcibly when it comes to the extr territorial use of force unless they are at risk of an actual or an imminent attack and Israel was not in 1967 it used force anyway and of course the clue is in the name it was over in six days there was no longer any threat in so far as there was a threat it was it was removed at that through that action well they they of course would disagree that there was no longer any threat but what about in the context i don't think Israel would disagree that after the six- day war there was no then immediate threat of attack from the three Arab states so Israel should have withdrawn at that moment on the seventh day there should have been a retreat because there was no legal basis to maintain the control over the West Bank and the Gaza Strip what about in the context of Gaza today and I'm taking you beyond obviously uh the the remit of the ICJ's advisory opinion but Israel today yes says more than ever that it is acting in Gaza in self-defense following the attacks uh by Hamas in Israel on October the 7th so Israel has been using force in Gaza since 1967 continuously and on on uh the on October the 6th two years ago Israel was already exercising military authority over Gaza and as I say illegally in that situation when a state is using force illegally if there is violent resistance to that illegal use of force the state's use of force does not somehow then become lawful as a means of defense to that defense there is no defense against defense if Israel hypothetically decided we want to be in full compliance with international law what would it have to do in general there needs to be an end to racial discrimination and the domination by one racial group over another from the river to the sea it needs to be a the return of all of the Palestinian people who were forcibly displaced and and have been displaced from that land um over for for a century um that that's also a legal require displaced since when you're talking 1948 or 1967 no return since even before 1948 certainly from uh you know the Nakba and 1947 1948 and onwards a legal right of return uh in international law that is vested in all of those people and their descendants the the remaining uh uh non-Jewish Palestinian people who were not forcibly displaced in 1948 uh but who are treated in various ways as secondclass citizens within Israel around 17% of the citizenry of Israel um that's unlawful and that illegal discriminatory treatment that constitutes apartheite needs to end there needs to be equality and then when it comes to the extension of Israeli rule into the remaining 22% of mandatory Palestine the West Bank and including East Jerusalem and and the Gaza Strip there needs to be a complete withdrawal immediately um uh the removal of all settlements and settlers and the provision of compensation to the Palestinian people for all of the um uh the harm that they have suffered um since 1948 this part gets lost u in discussions about the advisory opinion it does mention compensation in so far as it addresses the occ uh the 67 onwards yes the requirement of compensation as well as withdrawal so land that has been taken again according to international law as it is laid out in this advisory opinion land that has been taken from Palestinians by Israel since 19667 needs to be returned to them and where that is not materially possible they need to there is no excuse for not um uh returning uh the control of the land so Israel doesn't have the option to maybe uh withdraw from some of the land and retain some of the land and then just provide compensation that's not uh ac legally permissible what I mean by compensation is compensation for all of the other loss suffered by the Palestinian people as a result of the unlawful occupation there are 15 judges at the International Court of Justice that um rule were that rule on these opinions 15 judges had to decide say yay or nay essentially they could provide a dissenting voice but my point is this decision was not close it the judges were overwhelmingly yes um in favor of saying that Israel's presence in Palestinian territory is illegal and must end this was not close it was not and likewise there was an overwhelming uh support in the UN General Assembly affirming the the the finding of the uh um the ICJ uh in all key respects so the UN General Assembly which represents all the countries in the world one country one vote passed a resolution at the UNGA demanding that Israel respect this advisory opinion and that means demanding that within a year Israel leave Mhm occupied Palestinian territory cease all settlements and remove all settlers that was voted in September of 2024 so we're we're about The clock is ticking yeah the clock is ticking nobody thinks this is about to happen and there are no signs that this is about to happen states were also told in the advisory opinion and in the general assembly resolution that the illegality uh involved in the occupation has important consequences for them because of the fundamental nature of the rules of international law that are being violated in international law in a decentralized legal system where there is no global sovereign who can enforce uh the law unlike in a national legal system the role of individual states becomes much more important as agents of enforcement if you are any third party not Israel any other country in the world yes whether it's the Fiji Islands France or Venezuela how are you supposed to put yourself in compliance with that opinion and with international law first and foremost they must take positive steps in so far as it's possible to bring the illegality to an end and then they also have negative obligations uh not to recognize the illegal situation and also not to provide any aid or assistance to it concretely what does that look like positive steps to bring the situation to an end would include sanctions against Israel aimed at influencing Israel's behavior uh non-recognition involves uh states uh uh for example uh not doing anything when it comes to their diplomatic relations with Israel uh which involves expressly or implicitly um uh recognizing not only that Israel isn't sovereign over this territory but even that Israel doesn't have any right to be there in the first place so states should not be engaging in diplomatic relations with Israel and so that includes for example uh the current practice of affirming that somehow a right of self-defense would justify Israel's continued presence any state who affirms that position is violating the duty that they have not to recognize the validity and the legality of Israel's presence in that territory but you're not saying that countries for instance are required by international law to shutter their embassies in Israel that's not what we're talking about they should not have uh embassies uh or any diplomatic representation to Israel on occupied territory for example in in East Jerusalem they shouldn't even have diplomatic premises in Jerusalem at all because the status of Jerusalem as a whole not just East Jerusalem but also West Jerusalem still is to be uh determined and Israel is not sovereign in West Jerusalem hence most states who recognize Israel as a state do not have their embassies to Israel in Jerusalem even in West Jerusalem because of that legal requirement that they cannot recognize uh a an invalid claim uh to sovereignty over that city what's international law good for if it doesn't protect people from abuses and doesn't work in the way it's supposed to or was was invented and was dreamed of so it's a limited system the new and the importance is not to make overblown claims for its potential but not to throw the baby out with the bathwater and say that it is worthless the better approach is modesty in the expectations um one has for um the significance of international law which I think then should have consequences in terms of um the extent to which time and effort should be spent uh utilizing um legal avenues of redress as opposed to other avenues which may include forcible revolutionary avenues news explain actually in international law um the Palestinian people have a right to resist a right of uh to defend themselves from their uh uh subjugation and oppression and to do so violently if necessary people are not of course cannot be expected to um simply put faith in a system that is not protecting them and be prevented because of the existence of that system the ability to take matters into their own hands including through violent means so that's the challenge if global society wishes to promote peace then it has to enable justice you're saying if international law isn't strong enough or effective enough in guaranteeing people's rights people will fight for those rights international law permits that actually so for example if we think about another situation the right uh of self-defense that a state the people of a state might have so if we think about the discussions around uh for example Russia's uh uh war in Ukraine um international law permits the rise of self-defense if the situation is dealt with peacefully and through the application of international law then of course the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian state would not have a right to use uh force against Russia the same logic applies to a non-state self-determination uh uh grouping of people the Palestinian people in an analogous situation so there is an argument that Israel makes and the US sometimes makes it too you're not going to like it which is in essence international law is getting in the way of resolving the Israel Palestine conflict it is because it is getting in the way of diplomacy politics and dealmaking and that's where a solution is going to be found in those arenas not in international law so says Israel so stop the lawsuits and engage in dealmaking yeah but I think the question is what is international law preventing when it comes uh to to the issue of um ending the uh uh subjugation of the Palestinian people nothing but what international law is preventing is for Israel um stealing more of Palestinian land and that's why Israel doesn't like it people within Israel or supporters of Israel are against international law because international law is against um Zionist domination uh on a on a racist basis of the Palestinian people and the theft of Palestinian land so of course they're against international law when it comes to deal making when we drill down on the question of these supposed deals what they usually involve is a further loss of um the land of of the uh the um the 22% of Palestine that was left after the proclamation of the state of Israel in 1948 that Israel somehow wants even more of that land like extending from 78% into some of that 22% and the idea idea being that the Palestinian people in rejecting that are somehow impediments to peace did you have any strong personal or political views about Israel Palestine before you became invested in this um as an international lawyer i think I approached the situation with an open mind but also perhaps with a um a fairly typical European bias through my ed the education that I'd had which had not taught me anything about the situation um and and in general or indeed it's more specifically the British role in it whereas I had been taught about the shower about the Holocaust and um the onesided nature of my education I think led to a situation where I um had to educate myself and what I uncovered was shocking in terms of the uh consequences for the Palestinian people of the establishment of the state of Israel and the role of the UK in that and the role of other western states in supporting it ever since ralph Wild thank you

back against President Trump's attacks on higher education this week the Trump administration said it's freezing $2.2 billion dollar in federal grants and $60 million in contracts to Harvard after it defied an order to eliminate all DEI initiatives further cracked down on palestinian rights protests including reporting international students to federal authorities among a number of other issues harvard President Alan Garber wrote in a letter to the school community Monday quote &quot;The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights no government regardless of which party is in power should dictate what private universities can teach whom they can admit and hire and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue on Tuesday President Trump posted on Truth Social quote &quot;Perhaps Harvard should lose its taxexempt status and be taxed as a political entity if it keeps pushing political ideological and terrorist inspired supporting sickness.&quot; &quot;Remember tax exempt status is totally contingent on acting in the public interest.&quot; exclamation point the president of the United States tweeted at a press briefing on Tuesday white House press secretary Carolyn Levitt was asked about Trump's threat to remove Harvard's taxexempt status this was her response when it comes to Harvard as I said the president has been quite clear they must follow federal law he also wants to see Harvard apologize and Harvard should apologize um for the egregious anti-semitism that took place on their college campus against Jewish American students as for the taxexempt status I would defer you to the IRS for any updates also this week Harvard joined a group of universities that sued the Department of Energy over cuts to federal research funding for more we go to Harvard Law School in Cambridge Massachusetts where we're joined by Professor Andrew Manuel Crespbow the Mars Waserstein Public Interest Professor of Law where he joins us now from he's the general counsel of the Harvard faculty chapter of the American Association of University Professors which last Friday filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the administration's funding cuts and that sought a court order to block them last year Professor Cresbow was one of dozens of Harvard University professors who staged a study in protest at the school's library in solidarity with students discipline for taking part in a pro Palestinian demonstration uh he was then banned from the Harvard Law Library temporarily we welcome you professor to Democracy Now can you talk about the stance that Harvard has taken which has surprised many yes and thank you for having me it's really wonderful to be with you um I think it was really encouraging and important to see the Harvard administration leadership here send the letter that it did to the Trump administration you know our chapter had gone to court as you mentioned a few days prior to file a lawsuit to block these cuts from happening because these cuts are unquestionably unconstitutional our constitution has a first amendment that protects freedom of speech and as the US Supreme Court has made abundantly clear academic freedom on university campuses is a central component of that right to free speech what the Trump administration is trying to do is use massive coercive pressure and threats to make universities across the country switch to talking about what the Trump administration wants them to say he wants to control what's said in our classrooms what's said on our campuses what we research about what we write about the questions we ask and the answers we give so that they fit the ideological agenda of the Trump administration that's dangerous and it's unconstitutional we went to court to stop it from happening and I was really glad to see our leadership uh here at Harvard a few days later follow suit and say that they are not going to acsem and professor Cres I want to congratulate the uh the AUP uh chapter there for taking this stance but I'm wondering why didn't it is since it appears to be so clearly illegal to do this why the university itself hasn't gone to court well we'll have to see what happens there you know the university is taking its own sort of deliberations into account it has big questions ahead of it these are hard questions you know no university should be in this position no institution in this country should be in this position it is dangerous and scary to see the president of the United States threatening law firms trying to bankrupt them when they dare to go to court and file suits that try to hold our government to account under the laws of this country it's dangerous and scary and authoritarian to see the president of the United States trying to bankrupt our leading research universities because he wants to control what they're teaching control what they're saying in the classroom i mean this is a critical point to realize in the demand letter that the Trump administration sent to my university Friday night that became public on Monday one of his demands was to have the school appoint or allow him to appoint a federal overseer who would audit every course on this campus every department to try to figure out if it met the ideological balance that's preferred by the Trump administration and that federal official would then require us to hire new teachers to teach the way that Trump wants us to teach to change our courses this is absolute outright efforts to take over federally what is taught on American campuses it it's it's it's a it's a move that we see in countries across the globe when dictators are trying to come into power we've seen it in Hungary we've seen it in Russia that is the exact move that the Trump administration is trying here right now i want to turn to uh well now Vice President JD Vance but this was him speaking in 2021 at the National Conservatism Conference in Orlando Florida i think if any of us want to do the things that we want to do for our country and for the people who live in it we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country we have to attack the universities of this country professor Crespro you have talked about Trump's demands and now Trump vance demands um saying that they're right out of the authoritarians playbook and you just talked about other countries in the world explain exactly what you mean and the many demands that the Trump administration has made of Harvard of course it did it of Colombia and you might have something interesting to say about Colombia caving to those demands making demands of Northwestern where one is in Chicago what saying that they'll cut $750 million Brown University they'll cut $500 million explain exactly what they're demanding Harvard do well I think it's so critical that you played that that clip from the now vice president from years ago because I think it really makes clear what this is all about you know the Trump administration is asserting and claiming in these most recent threats that it is trying to purge these universities of anti-semitism now look I am second to no one in making clear that anti-semitism is something that is vile i think of it as a form of racism and intolerance but that is not what these investigations are about as evidenced by the fact that JD Vance was talking about the universities as enemies years and years ago this is an effort to try to take over the ideological agenda of the country by taking over universities it's an effort when I say a play a page out of the authoritarian playbook I'm talking about what we learn from lessons of history and across the globe when people come into power and try to control and hold on to power contra the norms of a constitutional democracy they attack the critical institutions of a free and open society they attack the press they attack the courts they attack the legal profession and they attack universities and that is exactly what we have seen this administration doing relentlessly over the first months of its second term why is it putting all that energy into this at the beginning of its term because it knows that those are the institutions where open and free inquiry where dissent where protest where critical thinking where questioning are not only prized but treated as the core value of the institution this is a university like so many others across the country where diversity of viewpoints is celebrated and not only celebrated but central to our mission i teach at a law school every year I stand up in front of hundreds of students and try to get them to lean into all the different ways in which they disagree with each other in productive and exciting ways that's how new knowledge is formed when you try to suppress that type of differences of opinion and impose your own ideological agenda on a university from the government you're trying to suppress speech on a campus and I think the reason to do that is because people know that open free inquiry and free speech are some of the critical aspects of maintaining a democracy in the face of threats to it so that's why I say it's a page out of that playbook the demands that have been made of our university make that clear this demand list goes so far beyond even um anything remotely touching anti-semitism they're asking us to shutter all programs and offices related to DEI now look we know from experience in Florida and when Ronda Santis did the dry run of this with the universities there that the administration uses DEI as a code word for saying they want us to stop teaching anything about race or the American history with request with respect to questions about our racial history they want us to stop teaching questions about social inequality they want us to stop researching about the impact and the d the different and uh disperate impacts of different policies on different groups of people they want us to stop pursuing the truth when it touches on parts of our American truth that they don't want us to acknowledge or talk about or study or try to redress because they have a political agenda and they know that universities don't that universities are trying to pursue knowledge where we find it i want I wanted to ask you what your thoughts are of how other universities should be acting uh clearly Harvard is in perhaps the best position with more than $50 billion endowment to be able to withstand these kinds of cuts and and attack the tax uh but higher education institutions around the country especially even public universities have already started to cave in to a lot of pressure from uh the Trump administration what is your advice uh to uh to these other institutions it's such a critical point i mean you are right harvard is the best positioned to take this stand it's the most well-known and wealthiest university in the world and that's why so many of us here including our AAP chapter felt that we had a moral obligation to put take this stand in at the at the front of the line but the hope is that we are not going to be doing this alone there is no institution that by itself can stand up to the onslaught that is coming from the federal government right now it's a dangerous onslaught and the only way to resist it is in fact to stand together that's why I think it's so important and we're starting to see statements from other university presidents across the country from other leaders throughout the sector from former President Barack Obama standing up in favor of higher education explaining not just to the other members of this sector to our other you know faculty colleagues at other schools university leaders at other schools but to the American people just how critical higher education is not just for the people on these campuses but for the country i mean this is something we want to make sure everyone understands these billions and billions of dollars that are being threatened come directly from science and medical research that is trying to solve and cure diseases that is trying to invent the new technologies that will help us with climate change and other issues facing our country and our world everyone in the world benefits when the federal government partners with American research institutes to find these new solutions to the most challenging you know problems of our day and everyone in this country benefits going beyond scientific research when we have universities that study American history so that we don't repeat the problems of our past and so we can understand where we come from and what our values are when we have law schools that teach about the rule of law and how central it is to the ongoing existence of a constitutional democracy when we teach literature and art and dance and poetry so we remember why it is that we flourish as human beings these are essential aspects of a thriving society if you try to kneecap your universities you're kneecapping your country you're kneecapping the people across the world who depend on your research and your discoveries that's why this is so dangerous and that's why this whole sector has to come together i'm proud to be a chapter of a national organization the American Association of University Professors that has been leading the way of with faculty members across the country taking initiative to file lawsuits to organize on their campuses and to try to build that network of solidarity across the profession and across the sector what do you think was the reason Harvard took this stance i mean the reason so many people were stunned is the stances it's took taken before i mean first you have the ousting after a congressional hearing of Claudine Gay the president then you have the ousting of the head of the Middle East department it was really seen as a beginning of a way to deal with the Trump administration you yourself were banned from your own library for supporting pro Palestinian students but now this enormous turnaround well I think there's potentially a couple of uh of of factors to it Amy although I don't know I mean I haven't been speaking with the the the the leadership of the university directly and and and don't know their thinking on it um but I'm I'm I'm glad to see their actions you know the timeline here is when when these threats happened our chapter went into a real crisis mode and we decided that we needed to file this lawsuit and we had terrific help from wonderful law firms that rushed in to help us and within a few days we were in court and we were filing our complaint on behalf of our chapter on behalf of the professors here at Harvard who are harmed by this and on behalf of our students i wanted Friday night i wanted to quickly ask you I'm going to cut you off because I wanted to get to the law firms and we just have a minute a judge just ruled on behalf of Susman Godfrey that uh the Trump administration's executive order against this law firm uh can't stand for the moment we did an interview with Steve Sesman oh more than a decade ago amazing pioneering lawyer who represented an indigenous community in Alaska against big oil because of climate change but it's not just Susman Godfrey it's all of these law firms you're a law professor the significance of this attack on law firms the attacks on law firms are one of the most dangerous things we're seeing look one of the key checks that we have seen so far in the early days of the Trump administration on these authoritarian power grabs have been actions in court now the president keeps flirting with the idea of not obeying court orders but so far the courts have been holding and you need lawyers to bring those cases in court so instead of attacking the courts directly what he's doing is attacking the lawyers he's trying to intimidate the entire legal profession into standing down and leaving him a free open path to do whatever it is that he wants he understands that law can be a check on authoritarian

          <attvalue for="7" value="Hong Kong, late September 1997. All the world’s financial elite are flying in to come together for the annual conference of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. These two institutions were established at the end of World War II to promote smooth economic growth and to resolve crises quickly as they occur. When the heads of the financial world arrive in Hong Kong, they can look back on more than 10 years of strong stable growth. The demise of many communist economies and heightened growth in East Asia have created a boom. Meanwhile, the global economy has moved toward an increasingly intertwined division of labour. Southeast Asian countries have been contributing strongly to growth in recent years. But for the past few months, the currency crisis in Thailand is slowly turning into a massive economic crisis and now threatens to spread to other countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines. So the participants at the Hong Kong conference aren’t just there to pat each other on the backs. Delegates from Asia in particular are concerned and are pushing for a joint crisis team made up of all the major countries’ finance ministers. The heads of the financial world come mainly from the West — the kingpins of the new global economy. When they meet in Hong Kong, they can’t imagine that their perfect world of steady growth might be endangered. But in fact, the crisis that began in Thailand was to develop into a wildfire that would engulf the entire region and bring misery to millions. The Asian financial crisis is to be the first modern financial crisis in the globalised world. Yet the global financial elite is unprepared for the destructive elements that would come to characterise all future financial crises from then on. Fast forward only 10 years, and the world is literally on the brink of collapse when, in 2008 and 2009, first the banks in the United States, and then the financial system of the entire Western world, threaten to disintegrate. The heads of the financial system and Western governments had failed to learn the lessons of the Asian financial crisis. Had they understood the causes of the Asian bushfire and fought them decisively, they could have been spared the near-collapse of the financial sector 10 years later. The problem was: The speed with which the financial markets acted was out of sync with the speed of politics. Until the US financial crisis in 2007, the lessons from the Asian crisis hadn’t really been taken seriously and people thought that doesn’t affect us — it won’t affect us. And today? Where do we stand today? The world is currently facing many crises. How great is the danger that the global financial economy will crash again? Are policymakers better able to keep pace with the financial markets today? It’s surprising in retrospect how little was learned from the Asian financial crisis in 2008. I mean, in effect, much of the memory of 97, 98 was buried or it was somehow declared exotic. The developing and emerging countries in Southeast and East Asia had become important engines of global economic growth since the 1980s — aptly named tiger economies. When they are hit by the crisis — one after the other, the middle classes are almost wiped out, millions lose their jobs, hunger returns to countries that had finally been seeing prosperity, riots break out. It took five years to get back to the level of 1996. So it was a pretty deep and long crisis back then. Thailand was the model of the new global division of labour. It was one of the first countries in the region to see a lot of foreign capital flowing in, starting in the 1980s. At first, it was mainly Japanese companies investing, with components or entire products manufactured in the country. Labour was cheap, as were raw materials. I remember in in the mid-eighties, Thailand’s poverty rate was at about 30%. So 30% of the population were poor. Today it’s down to 9%, right? So it took time, but there were people who actually were able to benefit from this growth. Almost all the countries in the region were booming. More and more young professionals were coming out of the universities. Asian countries were allowed entry into the antechamber of sustainable prosperity. Bangkok grew very quickly at that time as well because a lot of money was flowing into Thailand through loans from overseas, primarily taken out by Thai companies who borrowed to invest. We mustn’t forget that in 1993 the World Bank published a hugely influential book that stirred up a great deal of controversy: The East Asian Miracle. So if the World Bank, a highly influential organisation, labels an entire region like this, then investors will be keen to get into that region. And that’s exactly what they did. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are headquartered in Washington. Their analyses and forecasts carry considerable weight in the international financial world. Their assessment for the region in the spring of 1997 is entirely positive. Joseph Stiglitz is the World Bank’s chief economist at the time, focusing on East Asia, and he shared this assessment. They put a more egalitarian policy at the centre. They were much more equal societies than the United States was. They had focused on governments investing in infrastructure, investing in technology, and investing in education policies that I thought were good policies for the United States, the kind of policies I had pushed when I was in the Council of Economic Advisers of President Clinton. In the 1990s, the same phenomenon could be observed again and again in Southeast and East Asia. Within the shortest time, an urban economic culture had evolved, with great opportunities for social advancement. In just one generation, farmers became engineers. Much of the money borrowed from abroad was invested in the future of these countries. These are in themselves the ingredients to a success story. But what was it that triggered the Asian crisis in the summer of 1997, bringing an entire region to the brink of the abyss? In the 1980s, the neoliberal restructuring of the international financial system had begun: First in the United States. Deregulation of financial institutions meant that the rules for granting loans became much more lax. A bank no longer had to keep reserves of the equivalent amount in its vaults for the capital it lent. This rule had previously acted as a brake on the volume of loans. From now on, Wall Street multiplied the amount of money that entrepreneurs in particular could borrow. The growth of the world economy owes much to this neoliberal financial policy. But the downside of the neoliberal monetary policy is that the mass introduction of new players in the game changes the financial landscape forever. They would borrow money from wealthy investors and invest it with the intention of making the highest possible profit with the fastest possible turnaround. The Asian markets with their above-average growth rates were extremely attractive to them. From now on, the world of money is unstable at its very core. It is a watershed moment, in history and our culture, that is kicked off in New York and whose consequences can be felt to this day. From now on, financial institutions and the global financial sector grow at a previously unimaginable pace. Investor anticipation drives bankers forward. Short-term profits are best made from short-term fluctuations in the global economy; from currency fluctuations, as in the case of the Southeast Asian countries in crisis; From fluctuating returns on oil, ores and wheat. Once you start deregulating in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the financial sector explodes in size. Financiers begin to get paid a lot more, relative to other professionals. And inevitably you start to have more financial crises. The new players work at a breathless pace. For many, the timeframe in which they trade money is no longer than two weeks, a month, or even a day. Finance has its own rules that are independent of developments in the real economy. So to pump out as much borrowing and lending and financial activity as you possibly can, to get paid is a bit like a nuclear power station deciding to pay its employees according to how much electricity they can generate, not how much electricity consumers actually need. And a new kind of banker emerges. He defines himself as greedy, because that is what is expected of him. He competes with others, he competes for the lion’s share of investors’ capital. This gives rise to a dynamic of its own. One of the factors is scale. It's just the scale. It's huge. The Thailand crisis is already a crisis of tens of billions of dollars. This is significant money. When the heads of the financial world meet in Hong Kong in September 1997, very few of them have an inkling of what is already brewing right before their eyes. The International Monetary Fund, the host of the conference, is the very institution that was supposed to oversee the global financial markets and ensure their functioning. If a debt crisis arose in a country, the Fund could extend loans, which were usually tied to tough restructuring measures for the affected countries. Of course, as if Spielberg had planned it, the conference in Hongkong in 1997 was perfectly timed. The IMF and the World Bank hold their Annual Meeting outside of Washington every five years, and in the midst of the crisis they met in Hong Kong. Companies and private investors in Thailand had borrowed a lot of money from abroad in order to be able to further increase their exports as well as to profit from the increase in property values. Just as later in the US financial crisis, the investment rush is based on the assumption of steady growth. Therefore, companies and private individuals take on short-term debt in order to be able to redeem their loans as quickly as possible from the projected profits. When Thailand’s export boom begins to falter due to an economic slump in Japan and the first companies run into difficulties, the Japanese banks are the first to become nervous and cancel loans. In Thailand, substantial investments were made in real estate and that real estate of course yields profits, but in Thai Baht. If investors accumulate debt in US Dollars in order to finance real estate projects in Thailand and the Thai Baht to US Dollar exchange rate plummets, then they have a problem. In order to avert the devaluation of the Baht, the Thai government then sent emissaries to Beijing and Tokyo in early June to ask both countries for bilateral loans in hard currency. Thai companies needed US dollars to repay their loans abroad. Both countries refused to provide the Thai Central Bank with enough foreign currency which they could have used to keep the exchange rate stable and counter speculation. The central bank can maintain a fixed exchange rate. At the same time, however, currency reserves slowly begin to dwindle. But slowly, we say. At some point, and it’s not so easy to predict when that point will be, all of a sudden enough people start saying maybe that’s not such a good idea. And then there’s a run on central bank reserves and suddenly they collapse and that’s when there’s an exchange rate crisis. The foreseeable downward spiral now begins to trigger activity among hedge funds and speculators in New York. Their figurehead is George Soros. The speculation process goes like this: An investor deposits a security of 1 billion US dollars with a bank somewhere in the world. Then he goes to a bank in Thailand and takes out a loan for 25 billion baht. This is the official equivalent of 1 billion dollars. He sells the baht on the open market. Immediately, other money traders follow suit, because they now fear that the price of the baht will fall. When the exchange rate of the baht to the dollar has fallen, for example, by 30 percent, the investor then buys back the 25 billion baht with only 700 million US dollars, thereby redeeming his loan. He has made a $300 million profit and then hightails it out of the country. I’ve been blamed for almost everything. I am basically there to make money. I cannot and do not look at the social consequences of what I do. You see herding. You see very large-scale private-sector activity directed against states which only very big states can actually survive. So Thailand is not big enough to resist a comprehensive leveraged run on its currency by the hedge funds of this world. The United States is. But Thailand isn't. So the Baht shot up from 25 Baht to the US Dollar to 50 Baht per US Dollar. And this put firms and companies that borrowed overseas into a lot of distress because they couldn't pay back, especially when their loans, which is now double the size it was when they borrowed it. So that actually had caused a panic among creditors overseas. So many of the creditors overseas actually asked for their money to be returned. But they can’t pay them off. On July 2nd the Thai Central Bank gives up the fight against speculation and releases the exchange rate of the Baht, leading to an immediate devaluation. This date marks the outbreak of the Asian crisis — but it is still considered to be just a local problem. On July 28, Thailand asks the IMF for loans. But the IMF is reluctant to step in and help. The problem was that the International Monetary Fund had committed itself fairly early on and had said that this crisis was mainly homegrown. The result is a massive recession for Thailand. It is a harsh psychological shock for the country that had so firmly believed in its rise into the league of prosperous countries. As foreign investors flee Thailand, there is no authority to control the panic. There would have had to have been a player who, during the speculative phase, provided dollars, ideally an unlimited amount, to the issuing banks, which can’t just simply print dollars. And no one did that. At the Hong Kong conference at the end of September, two very different realities clash. While the West is celebrating the victories of neoliberalism, a robust and growing world economy and the exponentially increased importance of the financial sector, Asia is experiencing rampant fear amongst its populations. The finance ministers of the affected countries have an inkling of the massive social upheavals they will face as a result of the withdrawal of international investors and the panic on the financial markets. But the kingpins of world finance aren’t listening as they convene in Hong Kong. The IMF came together to push even more deregulation, capital market liberalisation. They were pushing a set of policies that would have made things even worse. The IMF forced the countries to stifle investment of any kind, as well as consumption, at the height of the crisis by drastically increasing the base rates. And that was a mistake. In Tokyo, before the conference, people are worried that the economic power of the entire region could collapse. Trade with Southeast Asian countries has become steadily more important to the Japanese economy in recent years. When the Thai Crisis spread to Indonesia, we were afraid that the crisis may spread to other parts of Asia. But at that point we didn’t expect it to spread all the way to South Korea. In Tokyo’s government district, staff at the Finance Ministry are putting in long hours discussing how to avert the looming recession. The IMF’s strategy for Thailand and Indonesia is considered wrong. Both countries need new and long-term loans to reform their economies without bankrupting many of the country’s companies and banks. You don’t increase the capacity to grow, to repay debt, by causing a depression, which is what the IMF did. There were very clear alternatives. And I laid out very clearly why the high interest rates, tight monetary policy and austerity, predictably, would make things worse. And they did. The Japanese government develops a plan to set up an Asian Monetary Fund. This is to be endowed with 100 billion US dollars. This large sum would, on the one hand, calm the international financial markets and, at the same time, make large loans available to the affected countries. Japan is soliciting the support and participation of the governments of Singapore, China and Korea in particular. Up until November 1997, you know, international institutions didn't play any effective role in preventing that kind of crisis, even managing the crisis. That was a real problem. During the Hong Kong conference in late September, stock market news and exchange rates signal that the crisis is spreading unchecked. The Japanese government did propose the establishment of Asian Monetary Fund in Hong Kong. However, at that time, I know US government, particularly Larry Summers, who was representing the US Treasury, opposed the establishment of an Asian Monetary Fund. Behind the scenes in Hong Kong, both Sakakibara and Summers are seeking support from other key delegations. In the run-up to the conference, the US Treasury Department had informed all governments in East Asia that it was strictly against an Asian Monetary Fund. The approach prevails. No one dares oppose the United States. The Hong Kong conference would have been the ideal opportunity to avert the crisis. But the loans made available to the hard-pressed countries were too small. There is small-scale manoeuvring and waiting — meanwhile the crisis rapidly worsens. The Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and 2009 is ultimately defeated by the US government’s willingness to deploy the maximum amount of money, thus stopping panic and speculation. This political will was lacking ten years earlier in Hong Kong. Until 2007, there was this sense of arrogance that people said, well that’s the Asians and we can do it better. That’s a common pattern in the financial markets. Hong Kong is the most important banking and stock exchange centre in Asia. When, a month after the conference there, stock prices collapse, it is clear to everyone that the crisis is not over: it is only just beginning. Late November 1997 in Tokyo’s government district: The Japanese government knows that large amounts of money are needed to quickly save Korea from default and massive economic collapse. It urges the US Treasury Department in particular to act quickly and decisively. Korea was the 10th largest economy in the world at that time, as it is today. It had only $8.9 billion in its reserves. That amount of reserves would have lasted the government only a few days. President Clinton personally made a phone call to President Kim Young-sam about South Korea’s financial crisis. The US president intervenes, making it clear that Korea is of a different calibre than Thailand or Indonesia. Economically and, above all, geopolitically. It is the bastion of the West against North Korea and China. Korea successfully competes on the world market in important key industries such as electronics, car production, and shipyards. Its major companies, like Thailand’s, had borrowed heavily abroad in dollars. When the exchange rate for Thailand’s currency, the Won, plummets, they are unable to repay their loans. Only now, at the end of November, do the heads of the US administration realise that they must act. The factor changing their minds is the geopolitical dimension: If Korea had to declare insolvency, the reputation of the US as a guarantor power for South Korea would suffer massively in the eyes of the world. In Tokyo, the government urges the US Treasury to hurry. A large rescue package is to be put together, in which many participate. Korea has already agreed to many of the IMF’s conditions, everything seems ready for the deal. When finally the IMF director also flies to Seoul, everyone expects the Korean rescue package to be ratified. But Camdessus surprisingly demands further concessions. He demands that the interest rate on loans be raised to 25 percent in order to attract foreign capital. The Korean finance minister replies that many companies would go bankrupt as a result and the economy would collapse, and that is why no foreign financiers would invest. But Camdessus insists on pushing through his demand. Now, in 1997, Korea's stock market fell 49%, half of its value. But that's not the worst. The exchange rate between the Korean Won and the US Dollar dropped 65.9%. So if you combine the depreciation of the currency and the drop in the stock market index, you know that much of the wealth accumulated in the past 20 years were wiped out. The mood was gloomy. Of course, you know, many people were losing jobs. Companies were going bankrupt. So it was a depressing time. The loan package for Korea comprises 55 billion US dollars, the highest sum ever approved under the leadership of the IMF. The IMF itself wants to provide 21 billion, the World Bank 10, the Asian Development Bank 4. The remaining 20 billion is to come from the rich industrialised nations, especially the US and Japan, which had urged Washington to put together a large sum. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in particular, had long been reluctant to contribute any US budget funds. I think in the final stage, Summers succeeded in sort of persuading Bob Rubin in infusing money to Korea so that together with the US government, we were able to sort of infuse a fairly large amount of money to Korea to solve the crisis. Bob Rubin was a very difficult man at that time. IMF negotiators in Korea urge speedy financial help, predicting the country’s bankruptcy as the only alternative. When it becomes known that the US government did not want to pay out its participation in cash at all, but only to deposit it as collateral, they are disappointed. In the week running up to Christmas, a Plan B is feverishly discussed in New York, which is supposed to involve the banks of Wall Street in the rescue of Korea. The last resort: The banks must defer any loans due at the end of the year and accept longer maturities. But who should act as broker? That’s when the director of the New York Federal Reserve steps in. He heads the most powerful branch after the US Federal Reserve. He gathers the heads of the most important American commercial banks. The bankers are led into a room in the FED, where Bill McDonough begs them to give Korea more time to repay the loans that are due for repayment. Instead of adding fuel to the flames, he asks them to aid the return of confidence and stability to help the Korean economy recover. It’s Christmas 1997, and Times Square is full of shoppers. At this point, the major commercial banks on Wall Street agree with McDonough’s argument. Between the lines, he has threatened them that they have to cooperate or else risk writing off all their loans. There is now a good chance that European and Japanese banks will follow suit. At this point, if Korea had had to declare bankruptcy, the Asian crisis would already have turned into a global economic crisis. McDonough saved Korea. A sigh of relief is breathed in Washington, New York, Tokyo and other metropolises. The IMF staff also catch their breath. Many of them have worked through the nights over recent weeks, they are simply exhausted. Everyone hopes that the worst is over, but they are wrong. For with the beginning of 1998, the effects of the combined impact of the currency crisis, the banking crisis and the economic crisis are now becoming reality. In mid-January, Indonesian President Suharto signs a treaty with the IMF that instigates massive cuts in the economic system. Many interpret this as the subjugation of Southeast Asia. But by the time the agreements are signed, it is too late to avert Indonesia’s economic crisis. Riots break out, more than 1000 people die, and poverty returns to the country in full force. The International Monetary Fund has insisted that the government cancel many of its infrastructure projects as well as food and gasoline subsidies. It will take a decade for Indonesia to recover. South Korea recovers much sooner, as early as the end of 1998. Until then, however, society as a whole is going through a nightmare. So many people becoming homeless. You know, South Korea has a tradition of not having homeless other than in the immediate aftermath of the Korean War. But we begin having homeless in the parks and streets. And more than that great number of small and medium firms went bankrupt and there was increasing suicide. And kids could not go to schools. There was a total social trauma throughout Korean society. It was one of the most tragic moments in South Korean contemporary history. It’s intensely hierarchical. The costs and the benefits of the programmes which were imposed were hugely asymmetric. Absolutely. Some people are bailed out and other people have to pay the adjustment costs. It’s not for nothing. Some players in the US used the crash, in South Korea for instance, to buy up companies really cheaply after the country had slipped into crisis. But some of the structural reforms demanded by the IMF will actually benefit the Korean economy. The close ties between the state and the private sector are loosened, and the private sector becomes the motor of change for the better, once it can borrow money again and slowly regains the confidence of the international financial market. There was a collusive tie between the government and big business corporations. They were simply symbiotic. And then in the past when the corporation had financial problems, the government would always intervene and bail them out. The 1997 financial crisis was a curse to us. But at the same time, it was a blessing. One significant aspect of Korea’s renaissance is that the Korean government refuses to meet other IMF demands that would have required export-oriented companies to cut back significantly on their capacity. As world market demand once again looks to Korea, they manage to repay their loans faster than expected. From then on, the banking sector is efficiently supervised, and the formerly largest bank is sold to an investment group that includes Weijian Shan. He leads the negotiations at the time. They not only learn lessons from how they got into the crisis, but they fundamentally restructure the banking system. Broadly in the credit culture, they sold weak banks off to foreign investors like ourselves, recapitalised those banks, and then, more importantly, adopted a risk management system. So they prevented themselves from being exposed to a lot of loans, risky loans. And that is why, when 2008 came, the Asian banks were in very good shape. In late 1998, Hong Kong is attacked by hedge funds, led again by George Soros. They bet on falling stock prices and the devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar as a result of the severe recession in Southeast Asia. But Hong Kong is able to fight back, with the city government and Central Bank together erecting a firewall of hard currency with over $400 billion. Speculation collapses. It is exactly the same strategy that is used to restore confidence in the global financial system in the Western world in 2008, ten years later. In the aftermath of the crisis, the countries of Southeast Asia will take measures to protect themselves against instability in the financial markets. They are monitoring their banks more closely than in the West and are building up very large foreign exchange holdings to defend against new speculation. This is interpreted as East Asia decoupling from the West. But when the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 and 2009 causes large parts of the Western financial system to temporarily collapse, these countries have enough reserves to be able to keep their own banks stable. The 2008 financial crisis changes the International Monetary Fund’s perspective. Since then, the first priority has no longer been harsh austerity measures, which usually led to recession and poverty for many. Instead, the focus is on proposals as to how countries in difficulty could become prosperous economies again in the mid-term with the help of loans from the IMF. I think institutions like the IMF, international institutions, have a very critical role to play in this current environment of fragmentation, polarisation, because the challenges that we face, be it climate, be it digitalisation, be it inequality, the responses or the solutions have to be global, have to be multilateral. An independent institution that also has the relevant expertise would be a sensible consequence in view of the complexity of our global economy. However, the IMF can only take action if it is asked for advice and assistance by the governments of individual countries. If you ask me if it would be nice if we had a supranational institution capable of exerting far greater influence, then the answer is yes. The way the current international currency and financing system is organised is far from optimal because it’s too powerful and there is not enough cooperation and too few options. The consequences of one party’s actions affect all of the others. We know that the danger of global crises has not been averted for good. Nor has the danger of major financial crises. This is because the volume of the global financial system has more than doubled since the Asian financial crisis. In 2020, it comprised 463 trillion US dollars a sum moved by the global financial industry, annually. Markets are shortsighted. They don't price the cost of carbon, of climate change, but they also don't price risk. The result of that is that we have a society, economies that are not as resilient as they should be. I try to capture that in some of my writing with a metaphor. We build cars without spare tyres. The Asian crisis was the zero hour of all crises in the era of a globalised world economy. Only after the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 do people begin to think about possible precautions and regulations. This has not changed the basic paradox of global finance. The financial sector has a determining influence on the functioning of the global economy. And it still often thinks in terms of weeks or months. But I think the financial sector is really important. You can't function a modern, complex society without a good financial sector. So we not only have to restrain the financial sector from not imposing harm on the rest of us, so we have to take an active role in shaping our economy and then shaping our financial sector. So they do what they are supposed to do. The challenges facing the world we live in today are no longer regional, but affect all countries: Climate change, overpopulation, war. Alongside an escalating geopolitical battle between the US and China. The consequences of any modern crisis impact millions of people. In the Asian Financial Crisis, this was also a bitter lesson for the countries of Southeast Asia. Poverty and misery returned for many years. The Asian Financial Crisis contained all the lessons we needed to avert the crisis of 2008 and 2009. We now know that in our highly complex world, the bushfire — no matter how far away — will inevitably have an impact on us too." />

But more than five months later, Israel’s military was facing criticism worldwide, including allegations that it is committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and even genocide.&#10;&#10;This documentary will explore whether Israel is breaking international law and, if so, why are Western powers, in particular the United States, silent.&#10;&#10;Edited by: Jameel Hodzic&#10;&#10;Subscribe to our channel http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe&#10;Follow us on Twitter   / ajenglish  &#10;Find us on Facebook   / aljazeera  &#10;Check our website:  https://www.aljazeera.com/&#10;Check out our Instagram page:   / aljazeeraenglish  &#10;Download AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile&#10;&#10;#aljazeeraenglish #palestine #documentary" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] it's an extremely cynical moment for international law it's an extremely devastating moment for the Palestinian [Music] people there are rules under international law and no matter which way you look at this Israel is in violation of those rules as of the 7th of October there is not one Norm of international humanitarian law that has not been violated I never imagined that in my lifetime I would see a genocide taking place in real time before my eyes the fact that it is being protected by most western governments takes it to a level that I just never imagined would be possible I come to Israel with a single message you're not alone you are not alone Canada will always be a friend of Israel and defend its rights including its right to [Applause] exist and Israel has a right to defend itself in fact it has the duty to defend its people as your friend we will stand with you in solidarity we will stand with your people and we also want you to win if one looks at our political leaders today and all of our mainstream politicians they are the most mendacious the most mediocre the least talented group of politicians that I can remember during my almost 60 years on this Earth it it is astonishing just How Deeply corrupt materially and morally they are because many of them be through donations to their political parties donations to them personally donations to their organizations like the labor friends of Israel the conservative friends of Israel the Democratic friends of Israel the Republican friends of Israel and the multiple and Myriad other organizations like that they provide an extremely good living for that person and for those political parties thank you for having me and uh I'm looking forward to having a thorough discussion about where everybody goes from here every day in the depth and bread of cooperation the West is intimately involved in Israel's genocidal campaign in Gaza for months we have seen us officials affirm time and again that there are no red lines for Israel using exactly that language uh when of course we know that international law draws many red lines and yet the US has come out in Stark opposition granting Israel full authority to proceed and to create As Much Death and destruction as it sees fit battle it's America's battle I'm shocked by the lack of action of the International Community I'm shocked by the hands raised by the US ambassador in the security Council voting against Asis fire vetoing Asis fire I'm shocked by the lack of action of principled States who need to take again a principled concrete stand against this aberration and start thinking of [Music] sanctions what we've seen is that the laws of war are used against weaker parties but if your ally is the United States and if your ally can veto any Security Council resolution and if your allies are the European States then the chances that the IC will bring you to Justice are very very slim the international court of justice is a court that renders guilty the losers in a conflict it is a court of the victors and a court that has double standards for the allies of the powerful and for those that it thinks of as its enemies The View that South Africa's submission to the international court of justice is some sort of anti anti-semitic screed and blood liel this is nonsense that you couldn't make up and the nonsense that is being enunciated constantly not just by the Israelis but that is then parroted by the US government the UK government the German government the French government Etc and this is being done to defend the indefensible to defend the slaughter of tens of thousands of innocent civilians to to defend attacks on Health Facilities on residential homes on places of worship on places of work we are seeing a genocide taking place in Gaza well truth the matter is if there weren't an Israel we'd have to invent one the truth of the matter is that I believe that you as I went home and said got in trouble it's the time but it's true you know you don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist you don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist it's the International Community and it's powerful member states like particularly the the us but in general Western countries which is still pilot and it's evident in The veto power that some member states can exercise within the UN three of those member states are from the West it tells us something no African countries has a VTO power in the United Nations system it's the entire system which is not fully representative of where the world is today but I would like to see this changing we need to think of better mechanisms not only inside the law but how the law is applied to ensure that there is no double standards so it's both a changing of the laws to so so that they uh address the current circumstances but also the institutions the judicial institutions that apply the law so that they don't apply it with double standards and we will continue to actively engage in the hard work of direct diplomacy on the ground until we reach a final solution the destruction of over 70% of Gaza the killing of over 30,000 Palestinians including 13,000 Palestinian babies and children the injuring of uh around now 70,000 Palestinians and the destruction of almost all of the civilian infrastructure in Gaza international law prohibits this completely we have to remind the world that there are at least in theory rules which Israel must abide by and which it is violating the IDF is doing anything they can in order to minimize the uh culties when it targets the the military targets but again we are in a war in a war civilians got H you will never see the IDF Target shoots down a civilian you will never see a group of children walking on the beach of Gaza and Israel Target them specifically or an old lady crossing the street and Israel shoots the old lady Israel does not Target civilians Israel targets military targets Israel targets terrorists and when these terrorists surround themselves with civilians with this little children with this old lady with this old people these civilians might get hurt but it's not on the fault of Israel it's on the fault of the one who surrounded himself with these civilians the one that use them as human Shields [Music] the argument of the human Shields of Palestinians in general being uh eager to sacrifice their own children as human Shields has been used and dismissed over and over the first one to dismiss this argument was Richard uh Goldstone the the head of the first Commission of inquiry over the first war in Gaza and it has been disproven over and over where is the evidence [Music] Israel's instruction to the Palestinians first to move South and then to move west and then to move north but basically that instruction which has displaced 1.8 million people tells the Israelis that any civilians that remains in that area or Israel assumes that any civilian that remains at that in that area is either a participant in hostilities and therefore can be killed or a human shield namely someone that is being used to Shield a legitimate military Target and that allows Israel to relax the repertoar of Le lethal violence that it uses against these people and in a court of law that can be used to justify the wholesale killing of civilians Israel does more than even it's required it drops fly uh over Gaza to tell the people to vacate the area it makes phone calls to residential um civilians to vacate the area uh Israel calls to vacate the area once Israel took this precautions it's allowed to take down the building [Music] if civilians prefer to stay they take the uh their own [Applause] responsibility this is a complete Distortion of international law if you consider also the fact that Israel is an occupier which I think is the relevant legal framing here Israel has obligations under occupation law um not only to end the occupation which has now been ongoing for 56 years but also to protect the occupied people and we also know that Israel has no right to claim self-defense in accordance with article 51 of the UN Charter with respect to attacks emanating from a territory that it occupies and this notion was upheld by the international court of justice in its 2004 ruling on the legality of the wall and so regardless of which way you look at this there is absolutely no legal defense to committing a [Music] genocide andal and Mazon and [Music] M we have the president of the state saying there's no innocent civilian or there's no uninvolved civilian in the Gaza Strip so these kind of remarks do point at it intent and the if if it gets to a court of law then these kinds of remarks become very important in terms of the genocidal aspect of this war a lot of people in Israel will not feel bad for the Palestinians but yet the leadership in Israel feels for the Palestinian people and they allow whatever the minimal uh humanitarian Aid to be provided to the population in Gaza [Music] [Music] [Music] the law does create a vision of a certain kind of justice that we want to Aspire for we want to Aspire towards a world where human rights for all are protected the immense scale of suffering in Gaza there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks which is what is currently on the table does human rights law give us the tools to achieve human rights I'm not sure because of the interests of powerful states because of the double standards that are applied in the international Arena and therefore if it gets to court often the human rights do not win the day and so we need to think of other mechanisms to achieve these human rights [Music] the problem is not the law the problem is with the enforcement of the law and in in the Middle East and in the global South I would say uh the problem is that law is closer to political convenience than to Justice as a European I'm very sorry to say 500 years of colonization has left a huge imprint in our DNA in general Western people are not able to assess objectively what is what is being done through the non-application of international law or through the discretionary application of international law it's terrible to see the dismantlement of international order premised upon international law piece by piece [Music] manen it's unclear absolute Victory will look like when you've destroyed already 70% of Gaza when the overwhelming majority close to 2 million Palestinians are displaced um it seems to me that absolute victory means the the total decimation of Gaza to the point that it's completely uninhabitable and the depopulation of Gaza which Israel has told us time and again uh in this current moment that that is their goal that their goal is the depopulation of Gaza and um the settlement of Gaza by Israeli settlers of course in total violation of international law Israel does not Bridge the international law Israel keeps strictly very very strictly all the rules of law according to the international law why a country should be above scrutiny I mean no one should be the international law is there to be applied universally and not just for cherry picking because this this forms as I often say human rights protection into protectionism and this is unacceptable for me the the idea that the law will lead to Liberation or emancipation or Palestinian self-determination is a fiction human rights is not necessarily the the tool I think the tool needs to be more political in the sense of divestments in the sense of sanctions in the sense of boycotts to use this kind of Arenal of nonviolent weapons to pressure Israel to bring about changee freeee [Applause] [Music] Israel about 12 or so years ago realized having been so close to apartate South Africa the very real threat that BDS posed to the existence of the Israeli State as a racist occupying State and they created a ministerial Department called the department for strategic Affairs specifically to counter the BDS movement and what was the strategy that they hit upon it was to ensure that any criticism of Israel any criticism of its occupation any criticism of its behavior in the occupied territories was made equivalent to anti-Semitism and they have been remarkably successful at doing that there is no other argument than accusing us of anti-Semitism so as to deflect the attention from what matters the most from what our analysis insists upon for decades now I'm not surprised that Israel recurs to any strategies it can to uphold its goals to reach its objectives but I'm surprised that International Community joins this action because today you are not just attacked by Israel for being an anti-semitic if you just ask for the application of international law to Israel Israeli actions it's many many Western countries who do so and they betray also what anti-Semitism has really been The Surge of anti-Semitism in the United States of America and around the world is sickening you know we see it across our communities in schools and colleges and social media they surface painful scars from Millennia to hate of hate to genocide of the Jewish people every time I get accused falsely accused of anti-Semitism I respond I don't stay quiet I don't get intimidated I become louder and louder and by doing so I think I also Inspire other people to do the same I'm Jewish my mother was one of 20 odd survivors of the Holocaust so to describe me as anti-semitic given my history of anti-racism and my work on genocide prevention my invoking of the Holocaust of which my mother's family were victims it's simply an absurdity the so-call Western world is prepared to sacrifice the entire architecture of international law that has been put in place post World War II specifically to prevent there being another genocide like the Holocaust we are prepared to rent all of that aunder so that Israel can continue to murder 247 Palestinians on an average day 48 of whom will be women and 117 of whom will be children we're prepared to throw it all out that's the point of Crisis that our politics are at now and it is up to all of us who recognize that to actually create a counternarrative to the nonsense that is spewed by our politicians to maintain their own place in this appallingly corrupt and malfunctioning political system we have we continue every single day to wake up and insist on freedom and life in the face of genocide and there's simply nothing more dignified that anybody can do in such a hopeless and desperate moment I don't believe it's going to be sustainable to continue to prevent Palestinians from their right to Freedom [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="canada's new prime minister has stepped into power just as the ground shifts beneath his country's feet is Canada facing its own Sputnik moment i'm Janar and today's newsmaker is Canada at the [Music] crossroads what happens when a nation's bedrock assumptions are rattled by tariffs and tradition canada's new parliament convened under Prime Minister Mark Carney but Canadians find themselves at a crossroads how does Carney a veteran of global finance who's stepping into a melting pot deal with on the one hand diversifying beyond the US and on the other President Trump's looming tariff war and the offhand suggestion of annexation here's more on the story king Charles is on his first visit to Canada since succeeding to the throne three years ago he's delivering a speech to open Parliament the first by a British monarch in almost 50 years the visit is a reminder of Canada's historical ties to the British monarchy king Charles remains the country's head of state but as Canada honors its past it faces a challenging present pressure from ongoing trade tensions and threats from its southern neighbor president Donald Trump has repeatedly suggested a controversial idea about Canada's future to be honest with you Canada only works as a state keeping O Canada the national anthem i I love it i think it's great keep it but it'll be for the state one of our greatest states maybe our greatest state the idea has fueled unease in Canada but Prime Minister Mark Carney remains resolute meeting Trump recently Carney emphasized that Canada's sovereignty is non-negotiable while reaffirming the importance of cooperation having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign uh last several months uh it it it's not for sale won't be for sale uh ever uh but the opportunity is in the partnership and uh and what we can build together carney rose to power on the back of concerns over Trump's trade war seen by many as a wake-up call for Canada's economic vulnerabilities from soaring housing prices to low productivity and heavy reliance on the US economy Canada faces challenges that demand urgent action some analysts compare this to America's Sputnik moment a jolting realization that sparks swift action public opinion on King Charles's visit is divided for some the Dominion is mostly symbolic i would say they're symbolic more of a historical power but I do recognize the connection to Great Britain allows us autonomy over our bully state to the south which is particularly worrisome with the current political leadership of Donald J trump JD Van but others question the monarchy's silence amid growing economic pressure from the US with the tariffs and the trade that's going on the trade war if the British monarchy plays a more active role in Canadian politics and standing up for Canada then I welcome the British monarchy but I just find personally that he's been very silent king Charles's visit underscores the complex balance Canada must navigate between reaffirming its past and facing a future shaped by trade tariffs and political uncertainty with pressure mounting Canada's next moves will define whether it controls its own destiny or watches it slip away joining me now are from Madrid senior fellow over at the Center for International Governance Innovation Jan Churriak and from Ottawa former Canadian diplomat and vice president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute Colin Robertson and from Vienna Virginia the director of the Independent Women's Forum's Center for American Safety and Security Megan Mobs welcome to all of you um Dan let's begin the discussion with you what's next uh I mean how should Carney balance the need for domestic economic reform with the pressures of navigating the US president's evolving tariff regime so uh at the moment in the context of the peak uncertainty that accompanies everything uh the Trump administration does Canada has to basically keep all options on the table uh Mr carney's very guarded approach uh in his meeting with uh Mr trump in the White House diplomatic but very firm on the Canada's not for sale issue uh which he conveyed very disarmingly with a real estate metaphor some properties are never for sale like the White House that's that's how he approached that and that's the right uh approach at the moment the guidance from uh the White House on tariff policy going forward is that uh you know most Canada US trade is still tariff-free if it's compliant with the USMCA uh that's under the IPA tariffs the the international economic emergency uh powers act tariffs whether or not that would continue to apply once this emergency is done and the Canada comes under the reciprocal tariff uh policy which implies that there would be a 12% bespoke tariff on Canada the moment the guidance says yes but uh uh we we can note that other FDA partners like Australia and Korea uh do not have that particular uh uh out so we don't know what's going to happen which means that Canada has to be prepared for a world in which we face substantially higher tariffs in any event the national security tariffs on steel aluminum autos and others will continue there's no relief in sight on those uh fronts so Canada really does have to focus on nation building right now and um I in my in my view I think that we've got the uh more than enough margins of adjustment to do that and to thrive um as I write in my paper on Canada trade war uh economies that are at war wartime economies are boom time economies so Canada could really prosper out of this so that that that would be my story on that okay um Colin let me ask you i mean given your your diplomatic experience uh does Canada need sort of like a a a reset moment or uh as Dan just put it uh all options need to be on the table i mean what does Canada need to do without losing its dignity or leverage well the reset has begun with the election of the new government and a new prime minister who has taken quite a different perspective than his predecessor Justin Trudeau mark Carney's as Don said first of all get our economic house in order reduce the internal trade barriers we're a bit like the European community before uh they lowered all their trade barriers so that's underway we've set July 1st as our liberation day at the same time he's promised to build as he put it build baby build the infrastructure necessary whether we're talking about ports or roads or rail or pipelines or grids to make us uh more productive and to be able to get our goods to market and then the third piece in that of course is trade diversification we have 51 free trade agreements much more than many other nations I think more than any other G7 nation but our trade utilization as Dan can well corroborate is not high we could do do better there and here I think our premers are going to have to play a key role because they're often best suited to be the specific uh salesmen for their province's goods and services and so we will be seeking to first of all improve with the European Union and that we saw with Mr carney's initial visit both to Emanuel Mcron Sir Samur in Britain and then uh our links now with the Indo Pacific uh Megan let's uh continue the conversation with a a different perspective colin just mentioned uh Canada's uh liberation day you've argued that uh Canada is drifting from its sort of traditional values uh so let me ask you what would a valuesbased relationship or partnership between the United States and Canada look like today according to you first off thank you so much for having me it's a pleasure to be here um you're absolutely right what we need is a better neighbor in Canada we are great bedfellows we should be natural allies which we are in a variety of different ways but quite frankly Canada has not stepped up on defense spending the way they ha they should have over a extensive period of time they've relied on kind of the benign nature of America to its south to provide that defense pro protection and as a result Canada has not made the 2% requirement for NATO for their GDP in defense and as a result they can't be seen as good partners when it comes to a defense alliance they need to meet their defense spending at least at 2% they're currently even at 1.5% under 1.5% they're one of the lowest in the alliance on top of that as we're looking towards the Arctic and the requirement for us to be competitive against China and Russia one of the panelists mentioned kind of wartime economy earlier here the war isn't against America in the West we are facing a very real rising threat in the unification of all of our enemies in China Russia North Korea Iran and we should be unifying around that and as a result Canada needs to spend more they need to do more with regard to defense and then quite frankly they need to help secure the border between our two countries because there's been extensive and expansive uh opportunities for our enemies both our enemies Canada and America to infiltrate America to the south from the Canadian border so all of that to say the Sputnik moment here shouldn't be President Trump coming into office the Sputnik moment should have been the rising competition in the Arctic the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia and that should have woken up the entire Western world for the reality that we are on the cusp of something extraordinarily dangerous and defense spending needs to increase by Canada okay uh Dan let me let me turn back to you megan was saying &quot;All right we should be natural allies let me try to analyze this through through your expertise i mean what does a realistic uh redefinition of the trade relationship between Canada and the US look like under under uh President Trump especially in the second term because you've pointed out how Canada has always had to adjust to to shocks from the United States going back to the 1970s with Nixon and and to Smooth Holly are we just seeing history repeat itself or is this threat fundamentally different uh well there has been a bit of a Splutnik moment in terms of consciousness um uh for example uh in Ottawa me and and my friends you know the thought that that just possibly there might be US tanks rolling across the border is something that we had never thought of in our lives and even though that's not very realistic the fact that we thought it about it is is a change in in the way the world works for us right now but in terms of trade um what we're seeing now is part for the course um you know Canada came into being as a confederation a year after the first Canada US free trade agreement this uh Elgen Marcy reciprocity uh agreement was abregated by the US in 1866 uh we have pivoted p uh after the smoo holly uh uh tariffs we pivoted to to the British uh through the Ottawa agreements of 1933 which created new imperial preferences time and again we have had these shocks america is not a constant america is a changing u uh persona it goes from Wilsonian to Jeffersonian jonian modes it goes from uh ch championing the international uh liberal rules-based order to being you know very very much focused on its own uh uh national security and national economic security interests and Canada has to actually uh adapt to all those we are the by far the smaller player and uh so yet yet again we are facing another split moment yet another smooth holly another Nixon measures where we have to adapt which all tells us that Canada has to always be able to act on its own in its own interest uh I mean America first America uh it does not mean no allies left behind it means every ally is left to be sort of on their own so we have to kind of absorb that and and work on that okay um Colin um Dan mentioned three C's he said the United States is not constant it is changing and this threat is is about consciousness i mean do you feel the difference this time is that the the the threat is not just economic but it is existential especially given what Trump has said about Canada and in in the 51st state remark yes and I would just correct Megan who referred to us as bedfellows given the predatory predilictions of Donald Trump that's a pretty unfortunate analogy to use reference to Canada uh yes I think that the trust that was there has been shattered it'll take years to build it back she's correct when she points out that we need to do more in defense we will although we now have a new threat and that's south of the border which we've never we haven't had since really post civil war again highly unfortunate it's hardly how you build a western alliance when you go after your nearest neighbors so I think that we will be making much more we are Prime Minister's already said we'll put a lot more into defense we'll continue to contribute to collective security uh we're hosting the G7 in a couple of weeks and Ukraine will be up there and support for Ukraine will be top of the agenda and establishing an industrial defense base with or without the United States involving our NATO allies megan I'm going to give you a chance to respond with all due respect gentlemen I understand that what President Trump said could be interpreted as being quite frightening i think the the reality that any tanks would ever roll across the northern border is quite frankly ludicrous this is very Trumpian and what he does is he makes outlandish statements to call attention to a critical problem gentlemen you both acknowledge that there have been critical problems within Canada with regard to the industrial base to national security to ensuring the primacy of Canada america first does not mean America alone the president was necessarily calling attention to the reality of the situation in order in some ways I think to wake up Canada and as a result that's happening of course we want a strong Canada a strong Canada makes for a stronger America there is a unique bational and bilateral relationship that we have with our friends to the north that is fantastic and it should remain as such we share the North American Aerospace Defense Command because we recognize American security as in continental North American security requires that secure partnership it is extraordinarily difficult to have a secure partnership when one of them isn't pulling their full weight so yes some of the rhetoric can be frustrating and challenging and over-the-top but sometimes it's necessary to do that in order to have a recalibration where then both nations thrive more together in partnership and unite against our conant enemies which is not each other which is overseas with Russia China North Korea and Iran and in particular recognizing that the closest way to reach North America Canada and the and the United States of America is via the Arctic so that over the pole capability is necessary for us to unite together and that means a strong Canada committed both to its industrial base and its defense uh gentlemen Dan or Colin do you want to take a respond to this is is it rhetoric or is it just a shift in in uh broader ideology well we've not seen anything go ahead Colin go ahead Dan there we have Canadian politeness polite exactly uh so Megan yeah no I mean like the the thing is of course we thought about it and immediately dismissed that possibility as being unrealistic and of course the US Congress has already weighed in and said look uh they're not going to authorize any such thing uh that's not the really really the point but there is a sort of you know if I can use a a multiple syllable word an onlogical shock here for Canada uh on this and and it just says that you know we we we have to look at our history review the shocks you're absolutely correct on the defense thing uh the world has become a much more dangerous place and not necessarily in terms of nuclear threats of bombs flying over the uh the Arctic uh ocean uh it's rather more in digital space the uh you know the infrastructure of our economy now is you know interactive it's like a central nervous system that is hackable uh that and we need to figure out how to actually deal with that at the same time uh and all of for example our our trade commitments on inert uh products like you know cars that were not connected to the web those should remain in place we don't need to actually modify that but connected cars and this is a major initiative of the White House on connected cars it does acknowledge that there is a newfound risk in these kinds of products we do have to deal with that through some form of renegotiation of our commitments under the WTO but we should do this uh in a gentleman-like fashion very I would suggest a Canadian-like fashion whereby we sit down and renegotiate those commitments rather than putting up 100% tariffs and just to kind of final point on this you know Canada aligned with the United States on 100% tariffs on EVs electric vehicles and then we got hammered with 100% tariffs on our canola products we then President Trump is is basically pulling all the auto production into the United States so we don't have the EVs and we don't have the canola and that's just not a tolerable uh way to for Canada to go forward to be caught between two elephants who are jostling uh for uh you know dominance in in digital space we need to have this done properly and uh systematically okay Colin no our objective at the end of the day is to try and establish a new uh economic and security arrangement with the United States she can't change geography nor I think would we want to the United States is still the biggest market in the world and it makes a lot of sense i think even Megan acknowledges that as she said it would make a lot more sense if Canada the United States and Mexico could reestablish the platform we have with people energy resources your manufacturing hub makes us an important and and critical platform in a world that's turning to blocks um Colin since we have King Charles up here on our on our uh video wall I I I want to ask you uh do you feel that we're entering uh perhaps an era of uh soft diplomacy uh like the uh like the king's visit uh and its possible role in terms of playing a larger role in uh Canada's foreign posture yes I do i think that we're getting international attention because of the king's visit it underlines the importance of institutions and our own checks and balances and again we're a very different country we've evolved differently from the United States we have been friends we are neighbors we are allies although that's a question mark about how reliable our southern ally is um yes I do think that's correct and I think that what you're seeing is an example of soft power we still want to attract a lot of talent uh that's important for us and we want to be able to trade with the rest of the world so the King's Visit is putting a spotlight on Canada I think giving a sense of the brand as a diverse place a green place and a place that where people from all countries can come and live very well and happily okay uh Megan um I mean how does the US respond to Canada if there is a shift a visible shift pivoting more towards the the monarchy rather than uh US leadership i mean how much is Canada going to actually pivot towards the monarchy and how much can the monarchy absolut actually actually do in terms of assisting Canada it's largely a symbolic relationship i think it's wonderful for Canada to continue in that capacity i would actually urge and argue that Canada should revert more to their kind of traditional uh you know valuesbased country i think it's great for Canada in general i also think it's great for the US we have fantastic relationships with the UK we are reliable partners pushing Canada to do more doesn't make us unreliable it means we're asking to be mutual reliable partners when it comes to some of these things and we also know let's just be honest President Trump loves the monarchy we know that he loves the pageantry of all of that this is a great move for Canada we should be celebrating it in the same way that we should also kind of put aside the rhetoric there obviously is a place for gentlemanly discourse and gentlemanly discourse has not always worked with regard to demanding our allies to do more sometimes it has taken that Trumpian approach for our allies to recognize we're not playing around anymore this is necessary this is critical not just for us but for your safety and security as evidenced by the number of countries in the NATO alliance who have stepped up stepped up defense spending both under the first Trump administration and now again committing to even greater defense spending sometimes it's necessary just to bring a stick to the fight um Dan as we're slowly coming uh to to the end of our conversation um you said that there's surprising consensus around what needs to be done so um is Carney's biggest challenge not policy design but rather uh public mobilization you feel it's absolutely execution uh we went through a period of time where uh for decades where everything was basically outsourced to the private sector uh the idea was that you know governments should set the framework set the rules but not actually get engaged in anything but right now we're in a situation where there's peak uncertainty uh private capital uh sits on its uh on its hands when you are highly uncertain uh it just kind of raises the hurdle rate for any kind of investment so our challenge at the moment is that you know we're about to enter a recession because of these tariffs and not just in Canada but in the United States i mean with with all due respect Megan you know uh I fully agree with you on the defense thing but the economics of the uh of the tariff threats are such that they are causing they're putting private capital on the sideline so how does Canada actually execute we do need to have uh some internal trade liberalization we certainly uh have some options in terms of international trade liberalization uh but right now the biggest uh uh uh impact on our trade is the rising cost of north south trade with the United States not just over tariffs but because now every single product needs to have not just uh the uh uh USMCA rules of origin certificate there are like one story was that a guy a company that had shipped a product last year to the US needed four times the number of tariff codes in its uh uh uh order and that's a lot of expense so how do we deal with that so we do have to do nation building we have to build rebuild our defense we have to put in place a bit of industrial mil military industrial structure but we need execution thank you Dan uh Colin I have about 30 seconds left i'm going to give you the last word well I think that it's it's not a Sputnik moment but certainly a wakeup call for Canada and again what we hope comes out of this is a new economic and security relationship with the United States which has been our principal partner and ally and good neighbor uh that that's the objective at the end of the day but in the meantime I think that we have to as Dan has said diversify and uh build at home all right great stuff colin Robertson thank you very much dan Churriak as well as Megan Mobs thank you very much for joining us here on the Newsmakers and thanks for watching you can follow us on social media and be sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel i'm Adjar and we'll see you next time

          <attvalue for="7" value="chaos at aid distribution sites in southern Gaza the UN has distanced itself from the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that's backed by the US and Israel what's behind this move to establish a separate aid mechanism and what needs to change to help desperate Palestinians this is Inside Story [Music] hello and welcome to the program i'm Fib Batibbo gaza has been under total blockade by Israel for nearly 3 months aid agencies have been stopped from delivering the most basic of supplies leaving 2.3 million people starving now the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is delivering food packages but it's backed by Israel and the US and uses American security contractors its first attempt at distribution allowed in very limited numbers of people and turned into chaos the foundation has also faced strong criticism from the UN and other aid agencies they say it doesn't allow humanitarian principles and appears to be weaponizing aid so why has Israel decided to let in some aid and only under an agency it backs could this be part of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's stated plan to take control of Gaza and ultimately what does this mean for Palestinians who are starving we'll get to our guests in just a moment first this report from Imagin Kimber all these people are desperate for aid to hold off starvation inflicted by Israel that has barely let any food into the strip for nearly 3 months we're dying of hunger the children are saying &quot;Father I want to eat so I want to salivate my blood to feed them we can't find anything to eat.&quot; This aid is being distributed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation or GHF that is backed by Israel and the US and based in Switzerland the organization's plan has been criticized by the UN and other aid groups who say it appears to weaponize aid chaos broke out during the first delivery of food with Israeli soldiers opening fire as people rushed forward several Palestinians were killed others were too desperate to hold back we don't care about gunfire or shelling what matters for us is to bring food to our children israel says the GHF is a mechanism designed to assume control of all delivery of aid in Gaza and exclude aid organizations like the UN we're going to put many more of these and the idea is basically to take away the humanitarian looting as a tool of war of kamas to give it to the population eventually to have a sterile uh zone in the south of Gaza where the entire population can move for its own protection israel has long claimed Hamas loot supplies but this has never been proven and the armed group denies the allegation the UN criticized the operation on Tuesday saying pictures of the chaos were heartbreaking to say the least and explained why it won't be involved we do not participate in this modality it is a distraction from what is actually needed which is a reopening of all the crossings into Gaza a secure environment within Gaza and faster facilitation of permissions and final approvals of all uh the emergency supplies that we have just outside the border it needs to get in other international organizations are also boycotting the scheme saying it doesn't follow humanitarian principles if there is a reduction in the number of sites where people can access assistance that would effectively reduce uh or exclude the most vulnerable people in Gaza from accessing aid it's not feasible that's not practical in addition to that humanitarian assistance is only humanitarian when it's delivered independent from political and military objectives israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly stated Israel aims to control all of Gaza and wants Palestinians to leave and critics say controlling and limiting aid would appear to fit that plan imaging Kimber Al Jazer for Inside Story let's now bring in our guests in London is Chris Gunners former director of communications for UNRA the UN agency for Palestinian Refugees in Gaza City is Amjad Shaw who's the director of the Palestinian NOS's network also in London Ial Visman who's a professor at Goldsmith the University of London and author of the least of all possible evils humanitarian violence from Iran to Gaza welcome to the program gentlemen thank you so much for being with us i'm Jad Shaw in Gaza City let me begin with you the images that we saw from Rafa were shocking they were heartbreaking as a humanitarian from Gaza when you saw those pictures of of people climbing fences crying for food being shot at what did that moment represent were you surprised or was this to be expected thank you yes it was very sad moments as we used to have along the 600 days of war but this time it's uh shown how much the effect of the starvation that the people had to walk about two and a half hours to reach this m military basement guarded by militants in order to get some food back to their malnutrition children these people were insulted suffocated all the time but this time it's different and difficult and what we witnessed that this as I said that these militants shot and the Israeli army shot towards these crowds who were just trying to get some food and this scared me because this is the application of Netanyahu plan to force the people to displace from Gaza north right towards Rafa as he want as his plan for I'm before we get into what's motivating the this plan uh by the Israelis uh let me just ask you uh you know what you heard and what you saw about the aid that was distributed what was actually in the aid package that was given to to some of the people in in Rafa i read that some of it mostly was dried and prepackaged food like uh pasta and beans food that needs to be cooked i understand but that's extremely difficult right now in Gaza isn't it yes very limited amount of items which I think it's for two three days of family of five six members so just to let you know that we as a humanitarian we will not let this happen along the 19 months of the war we used to get the supplies the humanitarian supplies to the people to the neighborhoods to the sides not to get the people from where they are to these military basement to have small amount of aid and we are working in kind of compreh comprehensive approach not only just to distribute such minimal amount of aid and to use this way of dealing with the people and to shoot towards them by fire and to have tens of people who were injured this kind of insulting of our people it's very serious and to be considered that this is the real plan of the Israeli not to elevate the suffering of the people but also to deepen the humanitarian catastrophe this will not solve the problem of starvation caused by the Israeli occupation through denial of the entry of the supplies to Gaza all right Chris Gunnness let me come to you and ask you about your reaction i mean you've seen many crises during your time at at UNRA what did you make of the scenes in Rafa i'm calling the GHF the genocide humanitarian fig leaf because that's precisely what this is it's a fig leaf for genocide when an army that's been committing a genocide against 2.5 million people and starving it out in the way that it has done allows in just a handful of trucks of course this is going to happen and according to unconfirmed ICRC sources six people at least six people were killed by gunshot wounds and um well over 40 were injured because of gunshot wounds and this is what happens when you let an aid organization be taken over by a bunch of cowboys a bunch of mercenaries a bunch of people who have absolutely no track record in delivering aid to situations like Gaza there was no community consultation that's absolutely essential when you're delivering aid there was no attempt even to set up proper infrastructure we saw the laughable pictures at the beginning of your show of those it looked like a cattle pen it was that insulting for the people of Gaza um there was no attempt to prepare the community there was no consultation there was no attempt to get the infrastructure up and running and this gets to a very important point only UNRA has the warehouses the food distribution centers the staff 12,000 staff who have been working all the way through this crisis delivering food coincidentally everybody um so you know it's it's an appalling situation it's insulting that you know Gaza should be a successful the most successful export economy on the Mediterranean they've been reduced to abject food dependency in violation of international law it's disgrace this operation should end right now the crossing should be opened and UNRA and the other professionals in the UN agency unra has a track record going back to the 1st of May 1950 that's when they started delivering aid in Palestine the professionals should take over from the amateurs all they're going to see is more needless killing but Chris of course the Israelis and the Americans have said this operation was successful even if there was a a bit of chaos at the start of it and they say they'll continue it uh I let me come to you now you your thoughts about what's happened what went wrong with this alternative plan was it flawed in in design was it flawed in execution or both you know it's exactly the difference between a plan hatched on paper on computer screen somewhere in Tel Aviv or in Washington people think in the abstract and the reality of starved people um being channeled um into this degrading architecture of control and supervision being you know uh pushed there um by starvation and of course to expect people that are starving um to be um controlled in an organized way is completely idiotic of course you would see those scenes uh of chaos and of course that chaos as much as it is uh something that whenever we see an architecture of control being overrun by people there is some hope in that in in the people's sort of response to um all attempt to control them there is a price to pay the the the the food has not been distributed right this is a completely idiotic plan and we see the result of it right and I think that Yeah and Chris I wanted to uh Chris made an important point yal uh about the why I mean why establish a parallel untested aid mechanism when the UN and established NOS's have the capacity and the experience and the networks to distribute this aid what do you think yal this suggests about the motives behind this uh GHF operation and and this new system of aid distribution that the Americans and Israelis are backing i mean what what is ultimately the motive behind this so I think according to our analysis is this is the endgame of the genocide this is the final stage of it um we have seen in very early on during the genocide the complete systematic destruction of all agriculture and fisheries that is the capacity of Palestinians for food sovereignty to feed themselves uh then we've seen the destruction of all um aid distribution centers um we have seen it in early on in attacks on bakeries then we've seen it moving into attacks on aid convoys that was going on that enabled Israel to exercise control over allowing aid in through the checkpoints okay so Israel wanted full control over aid what they couldn't have uh exercise control of is over the distribution so this is why I call it the endgame of the genocide where Israel is trying to wrestle control over the last element that fell outside of their control is the actual distribution of aid so they've created starvation and during the last 3 months they've intentionally created starvation in order to to to supposedly come up with a remedy for it pushing through the starvation people into the infrastructure uh that that they've put in place which we've seen has been overrun at the get-go amjan I'll come to you in a moment but uh Chris you wanted to jump in chris go ahead to what extent do you think this plan is about feeding people i mean when Netanyahu was trying to justify the genocide humanitarian fig leaf um he said they were doing this because Hamas was stealing aid cindy McCain the head of the World Food Program said in the American media o on the record over the weekend that there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that Hamas is stealing aid and there's plenty of evidence that gangs who are enabled by Israel have been taking some of the food so let's just get that right there is no justification whatsoever in blaming Hamas let me ask about that Chris because um I think the other really sorry yeah on that point I just wanted to get Amjad on that point because he's on the ground of course in Gaza uh that argument Amjad that Chris mentioned there that's being raised by the Israelis and Americans that you know this they're pushing for this plan because you know the aid is being diverted by Hamas to to what extent is there credible evidence of that happening on the ground at at a large scale aid being diverted what have you seen in regards to that let me start out by the the the the humanitarian system the traditional one the UN the Angels and the National Angels which was attacked by the Israelis since the beginning of this war mainly the Honora which is the backbone for the humanitarian aid which was banned by the Israeli conet and now nothing entered to honor and most of the honora premises destroyed and also there's about 280 staff members of Anora were killed also the national NOS's the international there's so many restrictions of the work of this humanitarian structure and then now you know they want to make it collapsing so now they are trying to replace it by this military mechanism and the aid convoys which used to come through Karma Abu Salam commercial crossing there is in certain areas which is controlled by the Israel There is there is gangs who stop these convoys and under the Israeli observation and this happened so many times till the last week there was a convoy of flower about 15 tracks which was looted by militants in in Salah street which is this area is evac forcible evacuated and the quadcopter is over so it's this thing that we have very credible humanitarian system and we are working with the humanitarian principles to be applied in our distribution wherever the people are but this time through the provocation of Israel in this system along the time they wanted to smoothly put this uh Gaza humanitarian foundation on the track it's not for Gaza it's not a humanitarian and it's not a foundation for Gaza Palestinians it's to serve the Israeli security and politics all right Chris I'll let you continue your your thought about to what extent is the GF GHF plan less about feeding people and more about using aid as a tool to to reshape uh the political and territorial reality of Gaza well what we're seeing is force displacement and we're seeing ethnic cleansing under the opaces as it were um of this operation and as a I think quite correctly said this is the endgame of the genocide that you know you bomb these people into submission and trying to force them out of Gaza um but you know I look at the donors because the donors have allowed this to get to where it is the donors have sat on their hands and watched the Israelis try to dismantle UNRA there was a totally fictitious smear campaign based on the lie that was later shown by the Colona report the independent report to be a complete lie that UNRA staffers were involved in the October attacks the donors then withdrew their funding on the basis of absolutely nothing well those donors need to step up to the plate both politically they have to do what the ICJ has demanded and have a sanctions program against Israel so there has to be the political the economic they got to obviously stop supplying America Britain Germany these other countries stop supplying the genocidal weaponry and on the other side they have to step up to the plate in terms of first of all stopping the starvation then they've got to start doing the recovery these are the donors and then they've got to look at the complete reconstruction of Gaza it sounds daunting and it is daunting you know there are there are thousands and thousands of unexlo pieces of unexloded ordinance that have to be cleared but in 2014 after a devastating war not as bad as this one Gaza to some extent to a large extent was rebuilt you give the Palestinians the opportunity to do this and they will perform let me tell you I've seen it time and time again okay let me ask you then uh EA Chris mentioned the ICJ there and whether you think these recent events will uh affect the genocide case against Israel at the ICJ i mean the provisional measures that the ICJ called for was for Israel to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid and avoid actions that worsen the livelihoods of Palestinians but from what we've seen in Gaza especially yesterday that hasn't happened so how might these events impact that case so look you know Israel's defense uh on January 2024 was that it is warning the population it's providing aid and it's moving people for their safety now in the current operation it is admitting that the ethnic cleansing a force population transfer of Palestinians to places in southern Gaza are the aim of the operation so it's completely undermining its own arguments that you know were laughable already in January 2024 but now are clearly uh seen to be what they are when we speak about the endgame of the genocide Palestinians will be faced with and this is Israel's plan with two choices to leave Gaza under the Trump or any other plan or to die in Gaza and that in order to do that one has to create the space in which it is happen this is why uh spatial architectural analysis is very important in in cases like that because architecture when an architect works on a plan there is an intention to a plan it is very clear in architectural analysis to see what is the intention when you build a building you have a certain program to do that so we ask ourself what is the spatial architecture of Gaza designed for if not for the genocide of the people if not a transference of the entirety of the population to the one part of Gaza that has no agriculture that is no development uh within it there's no infrastructure so that every bit of infrastructure every bit of necessity that people need will be in the hands of the Israelis Now now we think that might be some kind of charity that Israel is uh is doing to the people of Gaza by delivering some sort of laughable amount of aid this is not charity firstly Israel is forced into doing that they wouldn't have done it if they wouldn't do it and so there's been the suggestion that this could also be in order to in order to bring the population into the places right by the Gaza Egypt border where just one more push would see them out of and there's also been the suggestion that this is also about starving support for Hamas about you know getting civilians Palestinian civilians to distance themselves from Hamas in the hopes of political change what do you make of that oh but you know I think I think both Chris and Amjad said it very clearly palestinian society is accustomed in the distribution and division of aid they know how to do it uh there are infrastructure of UNRA other organizations in Gaza that know how to divide the aid the the society knows how to do it it's been living under a a murderous blockade for two decades and it has learned how to do that uh very well no plan done by some architects on the outside or implemented by people without experience in humanitarian aid could replicate that palestinians know how to do that chris your your thoughts about the the motives and also this idea that this could be a way uh to to push Palestinians to distance themselves from Hamas and and lead to political change within Gaza look that's a joke i go back to the um elections in January 2006 where the world thought &quot;Oh we'll let Hamas stand in elections they won't get enough votes that'll split the Palestinians and there'll be no partner for peace we'll never have to do a two-state solution.&quot; I mean at every stage the international community led by Israel has completely got wrong the analysis on the Palestinian side and of course I mean of course the analysis is very much wishful thinking and here again we have more wishful thinking the idea that people will do Israel's bidding in Gaza do what the IDF has been incapable of doing for so long in spite of saying time and time again that they're waging this genocidal war in over in order to destroy Hamas destroy a political movement haha i mean we all know that you can't bomb a political and a social movement with high altitude bombers and this is going to be no different i mean all that's happened is Hamas is constantly um being reinforced as it were politically and in all other respects and I think this is going to backfire but I mean the good news is you can't spin genocide you really can't spin genocide you can dress it up as much as you can and I think the scales are falling from the eyes 19 months too late of course I think the Germans and who knows i mean the Brits too though they continue to sell 127 million pounds worth of military aid but you know you saw Trump raging spontaneously apparently against Putin maybe in one of his capricious fits he'll suddenly turn on Netanyahu and make some spontaneous decision to cut all military aid i mean who knows what motivates we have heard that change of tone yeah we have heard that change of tone from the Europeans but not yet from the Trump administration uh Amjad let me come to you now and ask you your thoughts about what we've heard from both Chris and EAL and also the important question um that raised and the choice that Palestinians in Gaza faced today um leave or stay and die in Gaza what is the mood on the ground i think yesterday there was a boom you know about this issue and about 85% of the Gazan sits clearly that they will stay in Gaza whatever the situation is nothing will abort us from here this is our land and this is where we belong to and we will not fulfill what Israel and Netanyahu want to reoccupy Gaza without its people and we are not investment project for any so the issue of our forcible displacement whatever the conditions will be we are staying here in Gaza North and the international community has to work hard in order to stop this genocide this war against civilians against the children against women to open the crossings to reenter the aid supplies which is waiting now for three months and part of it expired and damaged because of the denial of the Israeli towards it its entrance and the same time to protect the civilians every day yes I'm talking about starvation but the issue of killing of children women elders and to burn the bodies under their tents this thing has to be stopped and justice for these victims must be there thank you so much gentlemen thank you for for a great uh discussion an important discussion to have today thank you i'm Jad Shaw Chris Gunnis Eel

          <attvalue for="7" value="as climate change changes the ice is a scramble for Antarctica emerging a global treaty that banned all military and mining activity now looks increasingly irrelevant as major powers explore the ice not least what's underneath it while still slated only for scientific research as activity in Antarctica becoming dangerously geopolitical in nature i'm Andrea Sanki and today's newsmaker is Antarctica [Music] in the interest of peace for all mankind Antarctica shall not become the scene of international discord that's what leading global powers have agreed to for decades under article one of the Antarctic Treaty but with more military personnel appearing at scientific research centers plus discoveries of huge oil reserves the status of our planet's least inhabited continent is in question the Antarctic Treaty governing the area doesn't actually validate anyone's ownership but China Russia and the US run sizable research facilities each suspecting the other of banned activity so could peace on the frozen continent be more precarious than we thought here's a look [Music] antarctica the world's last true frontier landmass for decades the whole continent has been under the opaces of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty mining and military pursuits are banned and only peaceful scientific projects are permitted the treaty came about to quell fears that growing territorial claims could spark a geopolitical turf war over resources 12 countries signed the document seven of which had territorial claims already the treaty neither recognized nor rejected those claims instead putting them on indefinite hiatus today 58 countries are party to Antarctic agreements and it's been largely successful in keeping the peace and fostering scientific cooperation but more recent geopolitical developments mean some nations worry that mining and military concerns could stealthily creep once again over the frozen landscape china which does not have any territorial claims on the continent but is a party to the treaty has been increasing its presence and the number of research bases for years in 2024 it opened its fifth Chinang base australia claims 42% of Antarctica's territory the largest claim of any single nation in 2024 an unnamed source in the Australian Signals Directorate noted that China's Antarctic bases could serve as platforms for powerful satellite surveillance and radar systems there are also suspicions that Chinese People's Liberation Army personnel have participated in Chinese affairs on the continent in the past a breach of the Antarctic Treaty if true china denies this as a consultative party to the Antarctic Treaty China has always conducted its activities in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Antarctic Treaty System the construction of the Chinese Antarctic Station is fully in line with the international rules and procedures of Antarctica and will be conducive to enhancing scientific knowledge of Antarctica among mankind meanwhile Russia has been publishing increasing claims that it has discovered enormous oil and gas fields in Antarctica and the oil and gas it says it has discovered lie within the British Antarctic territory claim in 2024 President Putin and Bellarussian President Lucenko spoke via video link at the start of operations of a brand new Russian station Vosto i am convinced that the new station will strengthen the cooperation of scientists from different countries will become an open platform for solving pressing problems in the field of studying nature the environment and of course for promoting joint scientific and innovation programs within the framework of the union state of Russia and Belarus and in the US reigning in of scientific funding and Doge cuts to government spending under President Donald Trump mean that US scientific research on the continent is having to downsize american scientists are concerned that a reduced US presence mean America could fall behind on Antarctic research and lose influence on the frozen continent in Antarctica the currency is science and cooperation the consensus is peace but could a reduced presence of one of Antarctica's largest key players mean that the status quo could be at risk allowing other players to feel more free in pursuing their individual interests rather than the collective interests of science and the world at large now next month Italy is hosting the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting focusing on research and environmental protection but will that be overshadowed by geopolitical concerns and the real power of the Antarctic Treaty itself well joining me now to debate that and more are from Washington former US lead for Antarctic diplomacy and former director for ocean and polar affairs at the US Department of State Evan T bloom and from London professor of geopolitics and executive dean for the school of life sciences and environment at Royal Holloway Klaus Dods thanks both so much for being with me let's begin then if we can with I guess the framework we do have and though we may not have kind of a defining piece of legislation to to govern Antarctica as far as territorial claims are concerned evans still is the treaty we have good enough is it respected enough to protect us all from conflict breaking out over this region well first of all thank you very much for uh having me on today um the Antarctic treaty system which started in 1959 uh and is now u a set of interlocking treaties um that govern uh the continent um have created the the circumstances in which um the the continent has been governed um for uh the benefit of of of international of the international community as a whole um and it has been uh relatively successful um despite various geopolitical tensions uh over the years uh still the treaty system is focused on promoting peace and science uh in the region and um the treaty parties meet every year as you uh noted the next meeting will be in Milan next month right um and the cons consultative parties will talk about what um uh environmental protection and other issues and of course there are geopolitical issues in the background as well yeah but I mean Sure you've noted that it has worked so far but times have changed not least Russia discovering oil in what the UK claims is its territory in in Antarctica plus there's very much notice being taken of military personnel that is kind of manning these scientific research bases klouse let me ask you if uh if you feel confident enough in what is there to manage any confrontation between the global powers that are present in in Antarctica yes so thank you thank you again for the invitation i mean the the Antarctic Treaty which uh as Evan says dates back to 1959 and entered into force into 1961 is fundamentally an arms control treaty and one of the things that it did was in essence was to demilitarize the Antarctic and say that the Antarctic should only be used for peaceful purposes now how peaceful usage is defined now compared to 1959 1961 is obviously a conversation worth having but I'd also note that the Antarctic Treaty um was signed by 12 countries seven of which were and are claimment states including the United Kingdom and when it comes to resource potential this was something that actually was well known about in the 1950s and 1960s but actually we have a protocol on environmental protection that was signed in 1991 and entered into force in 1998 that says under article 7 all forms of mining are banned that doesn't mean by the way that parties including Russia don't remain intensely interested in the resource potential of the Antarctic they do but we still have these treaty obligations in place and thus far nobody's walked away okay uh we may have an additional guest joining us in just a few minutes time we'll see if we can get him connected uh but let me come back to you then Evan because right now you're in the United States and we have President Trump actually kind of axing uh some of the scientific research on Antarctica or the funding for research therefore you know he's cutting the US presence there while China who's seen as a US adversary is expanding so where do you see that going will Trump regret perhaps cutting scientific research and eventually come to see Antarctica the way he sees Greenland at present well the the US has been the largest had the largest presence of any country in Antarctica for for decades has three allyear stations there including the only one at the South Pole um and the largest uh station of all at uh at McMmero uh research station um so the US has very strong interests in Antarctica and those interests are primarily scientific in in in nature um and uh as you suggest if uh the US pulls back on science in Antarctica then that will have implications for um the influence of of the country and uh in the context of the rise of China and the interests of Russia um there are all sorts of implications for that i should say however that I think that things are a little bit early in the Trump administration um it's quite clear that there's an intention to come back to cut back on science in particular research grants that are coming out of the National Science Foundation um and that support McMurdo Station as the sign says on the screen um but I don't think the administration has yet focused on um the role of the US in Antarctica and what its ultimate policies will be there so um I think the extent of the US presence th there are some questions that are going to be focused on by the administration and its relatively new officials uh in the coming months okay we actually have our third panelist uh joining us now let me introduce uh Andrew Kpong joining us from Hong Kong he's a China strategist andrew I'm sorry you couldn't hear uh the last couple answers but you know we did discuss naturally uh the fact that some are a bit suspect of what is really happening in the Antarctic as per the national research bases that are located there china has 10 uh or sorry if I'm not mistaken China might actually have five and yes China has five they are seen as by some of the hawks in the United States in particular as having more military intention than over scientific research what do you say as far as China's presence is concerned in Antarctica do they see it as strategic geopolitically rather than scientifically well first of all there is absolutely uh no evidence or indication at all uh that China is militarizing uh the Antarctic um because this is far off uh place for China uh China's um uh approach to the Antarctic um is three-fold um long-term uh consisting of uh firstly scientific research because the uh Antarctic is a very large continent is the same is the uh almost uh if not larger the same size as China and India put together and that is full of hidden resources and of course with climate change uh if the ice melts it's going to raise the the water levels the world over uh bearing in in mind the size of the continent um so uh the first approach uh of China to the Antarctic is scientific as you mentioned there are um scientific stations there uh for a long long time the second um strand uh of China's approach to the Antarctic uh is of course um equipping is um fishing fleet and the ice breakers uh is supplying the uh these uh assets uh to um research um cooperative partners um because the Antarctic is very very difficult uh kind of terrain and so China is building up its um um vessel capability the ice breakers okay um perhaps with Russia uh the third one of course China's now uh because the the Antarctic is very rich in fishery resources particularly the um the kind of um what's the kind of fish is the quill yeah um so again it's very rich in um minerals and vitamins and so um for that the China's developing is shipping um it fishing capability um but the the course geopolitics because um there is a bipartisan consensus in the United States the China's existential threat uh there are all sorts of um rhetoric or narratives about China's is is is evil empire that kind of thing uh without any uh concrete evidence to battle it out um compared with the uh aggressiveness um of the Trump administration on all fronts against not only China but even its allies um so be that as it may um is is another political arena as presence there is to keep watch on that but then you look at all these Yeah let let me before you go too far Andrew let me just ask you Klouse your opinion on on what Andrew's analysis there was because again the hawks potentially in the United States might say that no you can't be trusted or China as an adversary can't be trusted in this respect to say that it is strictly for scientific or you know fishing rights that this is cover somehow for military development in the region do you think it's would be naive not to believe uh that China has ulterior motives or should the US really understand that this is strictly for scientific purposes and uh and not and leave it as is and if Trump wants to cut scientific research that's fine for us the US interest strategically i I mean I would answer it in this way i I think the United States Russia and China consider themselves great powers and they consider themselves also substantial polar powers so all three countries unlike my own country the United Kingdom have not formally made a territorial claim to the Antarctic continent thus far russia the United States historically have reserved the right to so there as I said right at the start there are seven claim states china takes its polar power status very seriously china will no longer be considered to be a relative newcomer to the Antarctic treaty system china understands well that science and logistics are one way to extend influence and power across Antarctica but China is also enormously keen in thinking of the Southern Ocean as a resource frontier russia is a disruptive actor and the United States under the current administration cannot be trusted as an ally as as the Denmark Greenland episode might suggest so what I think you've got from the point of view of the countries outside this great power uh grouping is actually a quite a lot of concern about what they might yet do in the future so it depends where where you look from and what and what kind of interests you have but I would say that China and Russia from the point of view the United States and European countries tend to be considered to be at this moment in time disruptive actors who are seeking to redraw the norms rules and values of the Antarctic Treaty system that would be the general perception okay perception evan do you see them as disruptive i I hesitate to use the word disruptive because um all of the countries that we're talking about China Russia um US UK have a variety of interests scientific research interests as well as political interests in Antarctica um the China is certainly a rising power when it comes to uh its its presence and activities in Antarctica but it's also the case that an that China is doing important scientific work in uh in Antarctica and um part of my job at the state department was to go and to visit these stations and see what was going on um there are questions uh not just with respect to China but others concerning dual use of technology in Antarctica and whether uh certain technologies are being used for either military or intelligence related purposes that may be inconsistent with the Antarctic treaty but I will say that it it isn't clear exactly what's going on with that in that respect and countries are going to have to focus through inspections and other means on trying to ensure that the principles of the Antarctic treaty uh are honored um okay there are various suspicions in the US and and other places but um uh it's a question of uh the various countries talking with each other and observing what each of them are doing right andrew I know you had a comment and if you could also mention you know next month's Antarctic treaty consultative meeting in Italy is that where China would hope to establish firmly that its interests in Antarctica are strictly in line with the treaty as per only scientific research no mining no military activity well of course that would be an opportunity for China to uh address any possible concerns uh but China's um interest in the Antarctic have been uh longgoing and in fact as I mentioned before um it strategy is very very long term uh because China signed up the um for the Antarctic um uh kind of treaty um which is going to be renegotiated in the year 2048 I think um and then there are more more than 20 years uh down the line um and and even the Arctic Um um but of course this the Antarctic is even colder but the Arctic is also changing because of climate change um and so there are possibilities for um um some of course u exploitation as well but I think the China's uh emphasis is still on um is very much on um upholding um the international laws upholding the treaty um based on um um um um international cooperation uh because the scientific research is there's a great deal amount of of um exchange of of data um and and research results um but also keeping all options open uh both in terms of u navigation uh the development of ice breakers um but also um the cre fishery but as well as possible of exploitation of some uh resources um when when the conditions are right but it's still very much further down the line and in fact the China focus on the the two regions Arctic and the Antarctic there's no reason that that um there's no question uh that China's emphasis is on the Arctic because the Arctic geopolitical importance is much much higher than the Antarctic yeah the Arctic uh can I mention one thing quickly yeah go ahead Evan very quickly yeah I just want to say it is it's not correct to say that the Antarctic Treaty is going to be renegotiated in 2048 there's a provision that says that a country could uh request review of the mining ban and then there could be a discussion that follows but the Antarctic treaty is solid and will uh continue um on question like fisheries however I think there are questions about um conflicts of economic interests and there Russia and China have uh proved unwilling to move forward with important steps to promote conservation in particular with respect to establishment of new marine protected areas in the southern ocean and that may flow from China's uh particular interest in the future of uh krill fishing um but that's something that is okay rather difficult for the international community to accept but close I mean with Evans perspective there there are other people who are betting that with you know global warming um Antarctica will will soon actually not just be habitable potentially but will have another strategic importance with endless fresh water supplies for example as well as much easier access to what mineral sources could be there so is it okay to say that in 2048 it shouldn't be renegotiated or likely won't be that this it can stand strong or are we ignoring some real strategic realities of Antarctica Antarctica's territory yeah well I I think to be honest if we get to 2048 and we decide that the Antarctic Treaty is no longer fit for purpose then we're probably in a world that has far bigger problems than simply uh those based in Antarctica if you look at the treaty the text it's not very long you would probably end up saying if you didn't have a treaty like this you'd end up with something remarkably similar if and this is the big if you were committed to peaceful coexistence however if you think the world is going to become increasingly fractious with three great powers fighting it out for their respective spheres of influence then of course you can invoke the nightmare scenario from the point of view of smaller states which is simply Russia China and the United States deciding to carve up Antarctica into three segments of sorts i think that is unlikely but I think you have to be clear that the resource value the strategic value the relative accessibility of the Antarctic Peninsula in particular is likely to become a topic of ever greater interest and finally I would just note the latest signatory to the Antarctic Treaty is Saudi Arabia and and that would would have seemed quite remarkable to those who were negotiating the Antarctic Treaty all the way back in 1959 yeah again interest in fresh water going forward always uh a possibility for geostrategic complication okay Claus Dods that will have to be the final word i'd like to thank really all three of my panelists so much for being with us on this edition of the Newsmakers our viewers of course for joining us as well remember you can follow us on social media and do be sure to subscribe to our

          <attvalue for="7" value="♪ (&quot;LAST WEEK TONIGHT&quot; THEME MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ We're going to dive straight in with our main story tonight, which concerns immigrants. Once again, named Group of the Year by Right-Wing Scapegoat Magazine. While campaigning, Trump promised a draconian crackdown on migrants, and his administration has since made a big show out of following through on that, from inviting Dr. Phil on a ride along with ICE to nauseating social media posts like this one, titled, &quot;ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight,&quot; featuring sounds of manacles and handcuffs, and this one, which is somehow in even worse taste. ♪ Closing time ♪ ♪ You don't have to go home But you can't stay here ♪ ♪ I know who I want To take me home ♪ That is real. They used &quot;Closing Time&quot; by Semisonic, which obviously isn't the right song choice. The right song choice would be no song at all, because deportation Instagram reel is a combination of words that should never exist, like &quot;Oscar winner Mr. Beast,&quot; or &quot;Stephen Miller nudes,&quot; or &quot;Bill Belichick speaks about his relationship -with 24-year-old girlfriend.&quot; -(AUDIENCE GROANS) Now, Semisonic denounced that video, saying, &quot;We did not authorize or condone the White House's use of our song in any way. The song is about joy and possibilities and hope, and they have missed the point entirely.&quot; And of course they have, because according to the band's drummer, the song's about the &quot;anticipation of fatherhood, a song about being sent forth from the womb as if by a bouncer clearing out a bar.&quot; And obviously it is. We all knew that and got it from the lyrics. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) It's closing time. You're a baby. Get out of that uterus and finish your whiskey and beer. You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. It seems every day brings terrible news concerning deportation policy, some of which has been so surreal, local news has had to run fact checks on it, like in this sponsored segment. ANNOUNCER: Tonight's &quot;Fact or Fiction&quot; is brought to you by America's Finest Carpet. Tonight, we're looking into a comment allegedly made by the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A story that you may have seen today claims acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said that he would like the agency to be run like Amazon Prime for human beings. And this is true. Yeah, it is true. And spare a quick thought for that station and its sponsor, America's Finest Carpet. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Because verifying ICE's director wanted to expel humans with the speed of a pack of emergency tampons on same-day delivery clearly isn't what their &quot;Fact or Fiction&quot; segment is for. It's for getting to the bottom of actual questions that they've answered like, &quot;Sharks test positive for cocaine?&quot; &quot;Woman arrested for cinnamon roll attack?&quot; and &quot;Ford creates 'very gay' raptor?&quot; Which you'll be pleased to know was very much fact. But the intention behind that Amazon Prime idea gets to something important here. For all this administration's talk of prioritizing hardened criminals, in practice, it seemed to value speed, volume, and spectacle over all else. Perhaps best summed up by the fact, at a rally on Tuesday, Trump directed the audience's attention to a grotesque video of men getting deported to a Salvadoran prison, being marched off an airplane, and having their heads shaved. Prefacing it by telling the cheering crowd those men were &quot;the worst of the worst.&quot; Despite the fact, when 60 Minutes looked into it, they couldn't find criminal records for 75 percent of the men on those flights. And Trump's own administration has conceded that at least one man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was sent there due to an administrative error. For weeks now, it has been scrambling to come up with reasons why it was okay to send that man to a foreign prison, which has been hard for them to do given that he had a court order protecting him from deportation to El Salvador and no criminal record. At one point, Trump posted a photo of himself holding an image that had been circulating online of Abrego Garcia's hand with labels added, suggesting the tattoos on his knuckles were somehow secret code spelling out MS-13. Multiple gang experts have disputed that, pointing out MS-13 tattoos tend to feature things like the letters &quot;M&quot; and &quot;S&quot; and the numbers &quot;1&quot; and &quot;3.&quot; But in an interview on Tuesday, Trump not only defended posting that image, he argued that the letters and numbers that had clearly been superimposed were actually tattooed on his hand, and he refused to let go of that idea for an agonizingly long time. And while you may have seen small clips of this exchange, it is worth watching the full 90 seconds, because it is absolutely incredible. The man that you picked out, he said he wasn't a member of a gang, and then they looked, and on his knuckles he had &quot;MS-13.&quot; -There's a dispute over that. -Wait a minute, wait a minute. He had &quot;MS-13&quot; on his knuckles, tattooed. He had some tattoos that are interpreted that way. -But let's move on. -Wait a minute. Hey, Terry, Terry, Terry. He did not have the letter &quot;MS-13.&quot; -It says &quot;MS-13.&quot; -That was Photoshopped. -So let me just-- -That was Photoshopped? Terry, you can't do that. Hey, they're giving you the big break of a lifetime. You know, you're doing the interview. I picked you because, frankly, I never heard of you, but that's okay. I picked you. Terry, but you're not being very nice. He had &quot;MS-13&quot; tattooed. TERRY MORAN: We'll agree to disagree. I want to move on to something else. Do you want me to show you the picture? TERRY: I saw the picture. Oh, and you think it was Photoshopped? -Well... -TERRY: Here we go. Don't Photoshop it. Go look at his hand. He had &quot;MS-13.&quot; He did have tattoos that can be interpreted that way. I'm not an expert on them. I want to turn to Ukraine. No, no. Terry, Terry. No, no. No, no. He had &quot;MS,&quot; as clear as you can be, not interpreted. This is why people no longer believe the news, because it's fake news. When he was photographed in El Salvador, they aren't there. But let's just go on. They aren't there when he's in El Salvador. Oh, they weren't there, but they're there now, right? -No. -But they're there now. -They're in your picture. -Terry. Ukraine, sir. He's got &quot;MS-13&quot; on his knuckles. Okay? We'll take a look at that. It's such a disservice. TERRY: We'll take a look at that, sir. Why don't you just say, &quot;Yes, he does,&quot; and, you know, go on to something else. It's contested. Terry! Terry! Terry! You're in hell, Terry! (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Terry, this is hell right now. I'm genuinely shocked Trump doesn't drink alcohol because that is the most &quot;drunk at an IHOP&quot; conversation I think I've ever heard. And no disrespect to Terry, but maybe don't move on from that. I know you've got other questions to get to, but if the president of the United States is trying to tell you that this amateur hour Photoshop is real, let him go get the picture and make him say it again. Point to that Helvetica-looking &quot;M&quot; and make the president say, &quot;Yes, I believe that artless 'M,' that's weirdly clearer and darker than all the other tattoos, is real.&quot; Make him say, &quot;I believe that man went to a tattoo parlor and said, 'The skull's pretty spooky, but what I'd really like is a neatly aligned '3' directly on the bone of my knuckle, and can you please make it so that it doesn't stretch or bend with the natural curves of the human hand, and also make it look like a typewriter did it?'&quot; Because, Terry, sometimes... when Trump's doing his normal racist blue-skying, you do need to cut him off to slow the flow of hatred into the world. But if he wants to tell America that this laughably doctored picture is evidence of a major threat to American safety, you have an obligation to let the man cook. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS, CHEERS) And for what it's worth... if Trump's going to hash out those claims, he probably should be doing that in court, not on TV, and after he's already shipped someone off to a foreign prison. But Abrego Garcia is just one of many horrifying stories surrounding immigration right now, from tourists being detained for weeks, to US citizens being caught up in ICE dragnets, to videos like this. ALYSHA PALUMBO: You can see an agent using a large hammer to break the back passenger window of their car. Marilu said the agents were focused on her husband, Juan, but kept calling him Antonio. That's the name of another man who lives in their building. Thinking this is a case of mistaken identity, Juan called his attorney, who told him to stay in the car until she got there. But instead of waiting for their lawyer, the agent smashed the car window, broke into the vehicle, and dragged the couple out. MARILU: They had no reason to detain him. We've been following the rules of this country. We are doing things the right way. That's why we have a lawyer. Right. They're trying to do things the right way. We have an asylum process in place. And while it is not perfect, I don't think a key step in it is &quot;guy smashes your car with a hammer while screaming someone else's name at you.&quot; But that's just the tip of the iceberg here. So, given that, tonight, let's look at Trump and deportations, the aggression of his administration's crackdowns, its blatant contempt for the law, and where this could be heading. Let's start with the fact Trump's off to a much quicker start than last time around. In its first 100 days, this administration has taken 181 immigration-specific executive actions, a six-fold increase over that same period in Trump's first term. And that is deliberate. As the head of one anti-immigration group that advised the White House has put it, the plan has been to &quot;do everything, all at once, everywhere.&quot; Which sounds less like rational government policy and more like a knock-off DVD sold on the subway. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And to do that, they've employed a wide variety of tactics. Sometimes they've gotten creative by looking through old statutes for cheat codes to expedite deportations. We've talked before about how they've tried using an obscure provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act to remove people if the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe their presence here would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences. That is the reason they gave for arresting students like Mahmoud Khalil. And while that was clearly a targeted attempt to frighten students out of voicing solidarity with Palestine, they've also taken much broader swings using a federal database that tracks even the slightest interactions with law enforcement to revoke visas and put thousands of international students in jeopardy. And some of the cases have been truly absurd, like this grad student who was suddenly told he had 15 days to leave the country. PATRICK TERPSTRA: Suguru Onda, getting a PhD at Brigham Young University in Utah, had his legal status in the US suddenly revoked after a criminal records check. But Onda, from Japan, had no criminal charges on his record, just two speeding tickets and a citation for catching &quot;one too many fish,&quot; his attorney says. That is ridiculous. If you can be flagged for deportation for catching &quot;one too many fish,&quot; then I truly fear for Henry Winkler. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) We could be just days away from seeing him -in an El Salvador prison. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Which I'm sure the White House will then justify by badly photoshopping an &quot;MS-13&quot; tattoo onto his neck. And while they later reversed that specific decision, this all feels like the inevitable result of a campaign that fearmongered about an epidemic of so-called &quot;migrant crime,&quot; which, as we've discussed before, was wildly overblown. But having promised mass deportations and even printed signs for people to wave around demanding them, they're now scrambling to deliver. While the administration denies it, ICE officials have reportedly been told to aggressively ramp up the number of people they arrest, from a few hundred per day to at least 12 to 1,500, with the idea being each of the agency's field offices should make 75 arrests per day. And for all of this administration's promises of a &quot;worst-first&quot; strategy, where they focus on those with criminal histories, as a former director of ICE pointed out three months ago, that was always unlikely to last. REPORTER: Sarah Saldaña believes if arrest numbers don't increase as rapidly as the administration hopes, it might abandon the worst-first strategy and begin targeting community locations like day labor sites. SARAH SALDAÑA: That is really a big concern of mine, because that's not, again, a stretch, to think that that might happen next. If the numbers are not coming through, let's get the low-hanging fruit. Right. And you should avoid low-hanging fruit. I tried to do that. If I were to constantly go for low-hanging fruit, I'd say that &quot;worst-first&quot; doesn't describe Trump's immigration policy so much as it describes his children. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -But again, I've avoided saying that because I have standards, so I won't do it. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) And the administration now seems desperate to scoop anyone up. Police in places like Upstate New York have been stopping Hispanic drivers for minor traffic violations, and if they're undocumented, handing them over to Border Patrol agents. Also, at one point, tens of thousands of people received emails explicitly telling them to please leave the United States immediately. Some of those were sent by mistake to American citizens, while others went to migrants with a legal right to be here. The fact is, what the administration is doing is sometimes targeted, sometimes arbitrary, usually blatantly racist, and always cruel, and sometimes breathtakingly so. REPORTER 2: Tonight, the administration is facing criticism from migrant advocates over the removal of two American citizen children of an undocumented woman from Honduras, including her four-year-old son. A migrant rights group says he was sent to Honduras without his medication for stage 4 cancer. How is going after families with young kids targeting the worst of the worst? First of all, we said we were going to prioritize the worst of the worst. You feel like that's what you're doing? Absolutely. But when you prioritize something, it doesn't mean you forget about everybody else. I said from day one, if you're in the country illegally, you're not off the table. Okay, first, Tom Homan can truly rot in hell. -(AUDIENCE CHEERS) -Though I'd expect nothing less from a man who clearly answers the question, what would Shrek look like as a white ogre? (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And while the government insists that woman &quot;chose&quot; to have her son deported with her, her lawyers insist that was not, in fact, the case. And either way, between the government putting that kid on a plane without his medication and the cuts to research at the NIH, it seems this administration's actively coming out pro-pediatric cancer. I feel there's a non-zero chance Trump's about to add a fucking brain tumor to his cabinet and then presumably RFK's either going to eat it or point at it and say, &quot;It's from Wi-Fi.&quot; But one of the boldest moves they've made to circumvent due process is invoking what's called the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that &quot;allows the president to detain or deport non-citizens without a hearing and based only on their country of birth or citizenship, if he decides that an invasion or predatory incursion by that country is underway.&quot; It was famously used to justify the internment of Japanese, Italian, and German immigrants in World War II, but Trump has now invoked it again, saying, &quot;It lets us do a lot of the things we wouldn't be able to do.&quot; He's issued an absurd proclamation, declaring a Venezuelan gang called Tren de Aragua, or TDA, has invaded the United States. And he's used that as a pretext to sweep people up in raids, label them as gang members, and deport them. Some have been shipped off to CECOT, a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador. And if you've only seen it in Trump's propaganda videos or in Kristi Noem's grotesque photo-op, it is worth knowing just how grim it is in there. DAVID CULVER: Inmates are assigned to one of eight sectors, each roughly the size of an airplane hangar, basically prisons within the prison. Once inside, it's said to be a life sentence. They'll never leave their assigned sector. Each sector holds more than two dozen large cells, roughly 80 inmates per cell, but that can fluctuate. Inside each cell, toilets, a concrete basin for bathing, and a barrel of drinking water, several rows of metal bunk beds. No mattresses, no sheets, no privacy. Yeah, it is awful in there. The Salvadoran Justice and Security Minister has even bragged that &quot;no one who enters the CECOT will ever walk out. They will only be able to leave in a coffin.&quot; And, &quot;You'll only be able to leave in a coffin,&quot; is a horrifying statement no matter where it is. Even if it was on a sign outside a literal coffin dealership... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...it'd be a bit much. I get you're just trying to make a sale, but come on, tone it down. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And look, sending anyone there is unforgivable, whatever they're accused of. But it's worth noting, we've not only done it without due process, in many cases, we've done it without cause. Remember, on those first plane loads, three-quarters of the people had no discernible criminal record. And while Tom Homan has insisted that that doesn't mean anything because &quot;a lot of gang members don't have criminal histories,&quot; you clearly shouldn't be sending people to a Central American forever dungeon just on vibes. And the government's evidence in some of these cases is just absurdly weak. Take Andry Hernandez Romero, a Venezuelan stylist who was in the middle of seeking asylum in the US to escape persecution for his political views and the fact that he's gay. Time magazine photographed him having his head shaved upon arrival at CECOT, with the photographer saying he was &quot;crying for his mother.&quot; And as his lawyer points out, the evidence the government's shown to justify that is ridiculous. CECILIA VEGA: In Andry's case, the only evidence the government presented in immigration court were these pictures of his tattoos. Crowns, which immigration authorities say can be a symbol of Tren de Aragua. LINDSAY TOCZYLOWSKI: The crowns themself were on top of the names of his parents. The most plausible explanation for that are that his mom and dad are his king and queen. CECILIA: A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said on social media that its intelligence assessments go well beyond just gang affiliate tattoos. She said Andry's own social media indicates he is a member of Tren de Aragua. We went back a decade and could only find photos like these. That is utterly infuriating. That is your evidence? What about this man screams violent gang member? The only thing I'm actually confident he's a genuine threat to is unaccented cheekbones. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -And for what it's worth, there are no tattoos that denote membership to TDA. An expert who wrote the book on them has said Venezuelan gangs are not identified by tattoos. But apparently the Trump administration's been relying on an Alien Enemy Validation Guide, specifically its scoring system, under which eight points are required for any individual to be identified as a member of Tren de Aragua. But that is not a high bar, as you can get four points simply for having tattoos denoting membership or loyalty to TDA, which, again, is not a thing, and four points if you display logos or dress known to indicate allegiance to TDA, which can be as simple as being dressed in high-end urban streetwear, especially basketball jerseys from the Chicago Bulls. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But that is clearly bullshit, because if that is all it takes, then 75 percent of the city of Chicago are TDA from October to April. And somehow, it gets even dumber. CECILIA: Tattoos and social media were also used to link another Venezuelan migrant, Jerce Reyes Barrios, to the Tren de Aragua gang. Immigration court documents include this Facebook post from 14 years ago, showing him flashing what officers said was a gang sign. His girlfriend told us it was all about rock and roll. Immigration agents also flagged Jerce's crown tattoo as a gang symbol, but they did not mention the crown is above a soccer ball. Jerce was a soccer player in Venezuela. His lawyer says the tattoo honors his favorite team, Real Madrid. That is pathetic. And as for this picture of Jerce supposedly throwing up gang signs, if that were true, Rihanna, Fergie, and Former President George W. Bush are all Tren de Aragua too. (AUDIENCE CHEERS, APPLAUDS) But when confronted on this in court, the government's been completely unrepentant. Early on, they violated a judge's orders to turn around planes carrying deportees to El Salvador. And even after the Supreme Court explicitly directed they facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody there, they've chosen to dick around about the exact meaning of the word &quot;facilitate.&quot; As for Trump, when he was pressed on whether the people he sent to El Salvador deserved any sort of due process, he said this. You know, we have thousands of people that are ready to go out. And you can't have a trial for all of these people. And a judge can't say, &quot;No, you have to have a trial.&quot; The trial is going to take two years. And we're going to have a very dangerous country if we're not allowed to do what we're entitled to do. But that's not how anything works. You can't just opt out of due process because it's inconvenient. It's why court orders don't tend to end with, &quot;If not, no worries! You do you!&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And the thing is, this could all get worse, because while thankfully the courts have tried to curb Trump's use of these two acts, they've also seemed to sign off on a new diabolical strategy the administration's been using, involving a decades-old legal provision called &quot;registration of aliens.&quot; It allows the administration to require undocumented people register with the government and carry proof of that registration. And it is clearly a trap. Because if you register and give the government all your information, you become an easy target. But if you don't, or are caught not carrying proof, you can be charged with a federal misdemeanor, allowing them to label you a criminal and putting you at risk of deportation. And this is already happening. People have been charged in Texas and Arizona using this mechanism. Basically, they can't find enough criminals to deport, so they found a way to turn more people into criminals so that they suddenly can. It's a desperate but depressingly effective move. And that's not even getting into the other plans that they've teased, from Marco Rubio saying, &quot;We are actively searching for other countries to take people,&quot; to the administration floating the idea of labeling suspected gang members as &quot;enemy combatants.&quot; They've also tried to stop anyone who stands in their way. Just last week, they arrested a judge in Wisconsin for supposedly helping an immigrant evade ICE. -(AUDIENCE BOOS) -And on Thursday, ICE made a big production out of serving a search warrant as part of an investigation into these flyers that were posted months ago with information about ICE agents on them. They even released dramatic footage of them rolling up to the house of their target's parents, who were understandably pretty surprised. REPORTER 3: Drone video this morning shows ICE agents moving into an Irvine neighborhood. Annie Yang and YuZong Chang are still in shock after being woken up by Homeland Security investigators. NEIGHBOR: Woke up to this this morning. REPORTER 3: Neighbors captured the scene outside their home. They described hearing, &quot;We have a warrant, come out with your hands up,&quot; over a loudspeaker. Never happened to us before. I feel like I was in a movie set or something. I mean, it was so unreal. Yeah, I'm afraid this is real life though. Seventeen vehicles with armed agents did a Zero Dark Thirty on a lovable, middle-aged couple, looking for a guy who'd put up flyers warning about ICE overreach. Fun fact, guess who was on site for that raid? The ICE acting director who said the Amazon Prime thing. Guess who wasn't there? The guy they were looking for, as he apparently &quot;moved to New York last month.&quot; A mistake, for the record, that Amazon would not make. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And while that's almost laughably absurd, it's also obviously scary and extremely dangerous. And it kind of gets to the heart of all of this, which is Trump loudly selling his supporters the lie that he'll protect them from existential threats, only to further government overreach and state violence, even while deporting makeup artists, unlucky soccer fans, and four-year-olds with cancer. So, what can we do? Well, some of this depends on elected leaders. And to their credit, a number of prominent Democrats have gone to El Salvador to call attention to this, which is definitely preferable to the approach that others have taken, with some anonymous House Democrats quoted as saying, &quot;Should it be the big issue for Democrats? Probably not.&quot; And complaining, &quot;Rather than talking about the tariff policy and the economy, we're going to go take the bait for one hairdresser,&quot; which is absolutely enraging, especially as many voters do seem to get the clear problem with deporting people without due process to a prison for life, even in red states. Here's Chuck Grassley being confronted at a town hall in Iowa. -Exactly! Exactly! -(AUDIENCE CHEERS) -That man... -(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) ...who definitely owes a real 1,200-dollar ticket... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...is right on the nose there. The president is clearly not following the law as he is required to. And look, if your elected officials aren't holding town halls, you can still tell them you care about this issue. Call them and say if they believe in due process, they should work to repeal the Alien Enemies Act and amend the part of section 237 of the INA that lets Marco Rubio decide whose free speech is a threat. But in the meantime, we're going to need to help immigrants defend themselves. Remember, those in the immigration court are not guaranteed a lawyer. And if they don't have one, their chances are basically zero. So if you can, it is worth supporting nonprofits like these that provide legal services for immigrants or local ones in your community. And this is an issue where I do think there is a practical value to public protest, because this is going to be in the courts. And those inside them need to be made aware of public opinion on this. Because it can make a difference. Former Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist once wrote that &quot;no honorable judge would ever cast his vote because he thought the majority of the public wanted him to vote that way.&quot; But that in certain cases, &quot;judges are undeniably influenced by the great tides of public opinion.&quot; And I would argue the moment we're in right now isn't just worthy . of a great tide, it is worthy of a fucking tsunami. Because this is an absolute outrage. (AUDIENCE CHEERS, APPLAUDS) And it is one where it is important to remind our elected leaders that all people are worthy of safety, protection, and due process. Because that is indisputably, in the words of this country's single weirdest carpet-sponsored local news segment, -a fucking fact. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="♪ (&quot;LAST WEEK TONIGHT&quot; THEME MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ We're going to dive straight in with our main story tonight, which concerns public health, one of the many good reasons to wash your hands. Some do it for the length of two &quot;happy birthdays&quot; or &quot;row, row, row, your boat&quot;s. Personally, I do it for the length of one “my name is Kiiiiiiiiiiid Rock,” and that feels enough. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) On the campaign trail, Trump loved to talk about who he was going to put in charge of public health and what that person was then going to do. Robert F. Kennedy cares more about human beings and health and the environment than anybody. And I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines. Look, even if he wasn't talking about RFK, I don't like the idea of anyone &quot;going wild&quot; on health. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) The same way I don't want anyone to &quot;go apeshit on water,&quot; &quot;get wasted on the census,&quot; or &quot;go full Armie Hammer on agriculture.&quot; It sounds bad. Unfortunately, RFK is now the Secretary of Health and Human Services and has indeed gone wild. In the run-up to the election, he pushed the slogan &quot;MAHA,&quot; for Make America Healthy Again, and just a month into his tenure, he made this big announcement. We're gonna streamline HHS to make our agency more efficient and more effective. We're gonna eliminate an entire alphabet soup of departments and agencies, while preserving their core functions, by merging them into a new organization called the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA. Uh, no, thank you. I do not like any of that. I don't like him calling agencies alphabet soup, and I definitely don't like how he just said, &quot;AHA,&quot; which is such a dumb name. It sounds less like a government agency, more like Manhattan real estate jargon used to describe the neighborhood -above Hank Azaria. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) If you are north of wherever Hank Azaria is at any given moment, then guess what? You're in AHA. In practice, what that's meant is a radical downsizing of HHS. That same day, Kennedy announced a dramatic restructuring that would shrink the agency to 62,000 employees from 82,000, including about 10,000 thousand layoffs and another 10,000 people who retired or resigned and now won't be replaced. Which is alarming because HHS is an absolutely vital agency handling just about every high-stakes job related to health you could think of. That &quot;alphabet soup&quot; includes the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, alongside 23 other divisions. Together, they account for around 28 percent of all federal spending. So these cuts are going to have a huge impact on our day-to-day lives, and no one knows that better than some of the workers who just got fired. We oversee child welfare. We oversee federally funded Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, which is welfare. We oversee federally funded childcare, child support enforcement. These are the services that serve the taxpayer, and they are gone. Right now, it's this kind of, &quot;Oh, someone else.&quot; Uh, it will impact all of you, the greater public. I think we're going to have a lot of people die needlessly, honestly. Yep. And it is pretty alarming to hear a fired government employee say, &quot;We're going to have a lot of people die needlessly,&quot; especially while wearing a T-shirt that says, &quot;The horrors are never ending.&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Now, would you feel any better if I told you that apparently the bottom of that shirt says, &quot;Yet I remain silly&quot;? (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Probably for a bit, right? But then you remember the man wearing it just told you people are going to &quot;die needlessly,&quot; so you'd feel like shit again. So, given a critical government agency is in the process of being gutted, tonight, let's talk about public health. What RFK is doing, the many ways it'll impact us, and the troubling direction this is all going. Let's start with the sheer scale and chaos of these cuts. They actually began before RFK announced his AHA plan, because HHS, like most government agencies, suffered an initial round of DOGE cuts in February, when over 3,600 probationary employees were fired. Around then, there were also a string of other freezes that hampered operations. At one point, DOGE instituted a one-dollar spending limit on credit cards, meaning researchers couldn't do things like pay for gas for vehicles used to transport patients' blood samples. And in the words of one scientist, &quot;We can't order mice.&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Which is bad, because you don't have to be a scientist to know that lab mice are a key part of research. I'm actually pretty sure that the full scientific method goes, &quot;Observation, hypothesis, order a mouse, don't name the mouse, don't get attached to the mouse, experiment, analysis, conclusion, and finally, cry because you got attached to Colonel Nibbles. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But then came the big AHA cuts, which were as sudden as they were cruel. Some federal workers didn't even know they'd been fired until they turned up to work and tried to use their badges to get in. If the light turned green, they still had their job. If it turned red, they didn't. Some fired workers were told to contact an employee named Anita Pinder if they wanted to file a discrimination complaint, which was hard to do, given she died last year. (AUDIENCE GROANS) One former staffer even said, &quot;This bloodbath was so fucking bad, I had multiple officials asking me if I thought this was an April Fool's joke,&quot; because on top of everything else, this happened on April 1st. (AUDIENCE GROANS) Which has to be the most confusing April Fool's Day ever, second only to the one in 1945, when US troops landed on the shores of Okinawa, and the Japanese troops were like, &quot;Wait, is this an April Fool's thing?&quot; And the Americans were like, &quot;No, it's actually World War II.&quot; And the Japanese were like, &quot;Oh, right, it's just confusing because of the date.&quot; And the Americans were like, &quot;Well, hang on, you guys do April Fool's Day too?&quot; And that's how World War II ended. Now, RFK initially insisted that these cuts were made for efficiency and that nothing important was being lost. But it soon became clear some crucial stuff had been defunded and he didn't know about it. There's, like, more than 50 pages of, you know, of cuts that I actually went through. The cuts were mainly DEI cuts, which the president-- JONATHAN LAPOOK: There were a lot, but I'll give you, for example, about 750,000 dollars of a University of Michigan grant into adolescent diabetes was cut. Did you know that? I didn't know that, and that's something that we'll look at. There's a number of studies that were cut, that came to our attention, and that did not deserve to be cut, and we reinstated them. Our purpose is not to reduce any level of scientific research that's important. Okay, it's not great that that's how he's finding out. The health secretary should not be learning what he just did, like some guy at a bachelor party being told what happened the night before. &quot;Do you not remember, bro? You spoke French well. Then you pissed on a grave, fucked a bike rack, and cut 750,000 dollars of research money for kid diabetes. You went wild!&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And for the record, simply reinstating studies isn't as easy as he's making it sound there. Some studies, once disrupted, can't just be restarted. So that's already infuriating before you hear him try to justify why the cutting of the wrong studies or staff is actually fine. Wouldn't it have been better, or was thought given to say, before firing them, going through and saying, &quot;Hmm, what is that job? What is that job?&quot; line by line by line and saying, &quot;I think that person's job maybe isn't needed. You know, this has to be eliminated--&quot; That would have been another approach, and it's the approach that has been-- has failed for 60 years LAPOOK: Because you mean it takes too long? It takes too long and you lose political momentum. Okay, so the question he was asked there boiled down to, &quot;Do you think you should have figured out what you were cutting before you cut it?&quot; And his answer was, &quot;No.&quot; Which is not good! The rules for restructuring HHS should be the same as the ones for a bris. It is crucially important to know exactly what you are cutting. Speed is just not the most important thing. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And it's one thing to hear about that in theory. It's another to see how these cuts are playing out. And let's start with the National Institute of Health. Its research and funding are key reasons why the human genetic code was deciphered, hepatitis C was discovered, the AIDS virus was isolated, and the first drug to treat it was discovered. And it's where the basic research that helped lead to the COVID vaccines was done. It is by far the world's largest public funder of biomedical research, and in particular, the largest funder of cancer research. The NIH has been called &quot;the crown jewel of American science,&quot; which, if anything, is understating it, because it's clearly better than a crown jewel. Those things don't really do much, aside from bedazzle a puffy hat that we occasionally balance on top of a collection of recessive jeans. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) The NIH, however, is really important. But it's now in trouble. Because within weeks of Trump taking office, it stopped considering new grant applications entirely, which instantly stalled about 16,000 of them. It then announced hundreds of existing grants would be terminated, many seemingly for including terms like &quot;minorities&quot;, &quot;transgender&quot;, &quot;AIDS&quot;, and &quot;vaccine hesitancy.&quot; In fact, they've reportedly cut about 750 million dollars in HIV-targeted grants alone. And while that is clearly bad enough, all research is now threatened, especially because in addition to these cuts, this administration has a disastrous new proposal to cap what are sometimes called &quot;indirect research costs.&quot; Here is a DOGE guy, in a group interview with Elon, explaining the rationale. So if I take NIH as an example, today, if you're an NIH researcher and you get a hundred-dollar grant at your university, today, you get to spend 60 of that and your university spends 40 of that. The policy that we're proposing to make is that you get to spend 85 of that and your university spends 15. So that's more money going directly to the scientists who are discovering new cures. Okay, set aside the fact that that group looks like a regional choir of orphaned businessmen. What-- What he just said there is extremely misleading. For starters, indirect costs don't come out of grants to researchers, they're issued on top of them. Essentially, right now, if you get a hundred dollars to fund your research, your university gets an additional 40 dollars. And it's not ideal that he doesn't seem to know that, especially as under this new plan, that 40 dollars would be capped at 15 dollars, which is a real problem because that money goes to cover costs that make research possible, like buildings, utilities, lab equipment, animal caretakers, and other support staff. As one expert pointed out, if you're going to use mice for your experiment, you actually need a mouse facility. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLES) Which does make sense. You cannot have your lab mice commute into work... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -...however adorable that might turn out to be. And scientists will tell you capping those expenses at 15 percent of a grant is a requirement that would make it functionally impossible for them to do high-quality work. Here is one scientist explaining what it would mean for his research on pneumonia. If there are no indirect costs flowing, we can't keep the computers running. If we can't keep the computers running, we can't do the science that we're doing. If we're supposed to work without buildings, without computers, without centrifuges, there's no way to get that done from someone else. Right, it should go without saying, but scientists need buildings and computers. I mean, maybe they can get by without centrifuges. I mean, I guess Carl can spin around pretty fast, but... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -You know what? No, I actually think they're going to need those too. The point is, you wouldn't ask a research scientist to do their job without a computer or lab equipment, the same way you wouldn't ask a DOGE employee to do their job without an iron deficiency and a deep-seated conviction they're the smartest boy in the world. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -They need that for work. But the attacks on research don't end there. There have also been wholesale cuts to grants at institutions across the country, and not just at Ivy League schools that you might have heard about, but also at flagship state schools in places like Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Nebraska, and Texas, which is very bad, because virtually all of modern medicine relies, to some degree, on research that was supported by federal dollars. Interestingly, the same day as those mass layoffs, NIH published a paper about a breakthrough in using a person's own immune cells to fight gastrointestinal cancers, which is absolutely amazing. Unfortunately, two patients' treatments using that therapy have already had to be delayed due to these cuts. And that is just one example of many. As one Alzheimer's researcher put it, &quot;Disruptions delay discovery.&quot; And it's impossible to know how many breakthroughs have already been delayed or that may now never happen. And while this is all supposedly being done in the name of saving money, I will point out a recent report found every dollar of research funded by NIH delivers two dollars, 56 cents in economic activity. And not that we should be investing in health research purely for economic gain, but it is still worth noting that that kind of return on investment would make the sharks on Shark Tank shit in their Eames chairs. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And so far, I've just been talking about the NIH, but RFK also oversees the FDA, where the cuts range from communication specialists who alerted the public to urgent safety recalls, to veterinary division specialists who were investigating bird flu transmission. So now it's going to be much harder to get answers to important questions that you may have about bird flu, like, &quot;Is it in milk?&quot; or &quot;Is my pet vulnerable?&quot; or &quot;I fucked Big Bird two weeks ago and now I have a sore throat.&quot; -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -&quot;Do I need to get tested?&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) RFK also now oversees the CDC, and cuts there range from the firing of all 20 members of an office focused on Alzheimer's awareness and prevention, to the shuttering of a lab that tracked STIs, meaning the US has apparently just lost its ability to detect drug-resistant gonorrhea. One former CDC staffer said, &quot;Shitshow is an understatement for what just happened.&quot; Which seems right, doesn't it? Because &quot;shitshow&quot; is a word you use to describe Anne Hathaway and James Franco hosting the Oscars... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...or Fergie performing the national anthem, not, &quot;Hey, look out everyone, turbo gonorrhea is on the loose, and it is pissed.&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And the thing is, the impact of cuts like that reverberate far beyond the CDC. Just take Wisconsin, where they've been dealing with a burgeoning lead paint problem in schools in Milwaukee. They've already had to close four of them for cleanup. And normally, a city can lean on the federal government for help in responding to lead contamination. But not right now. HANNAH HILYARD: Milwaukee health officials turning to the federal government for assistance. To see that all of our partners at the CDC had been let go was pretty difficult. HILYARD: Totoraitis received a CDC response saying, quote... Two days later, the health department received another follow-up email saying, quote... The move leaving the health department without any federal guidance. So, right now, you do not have any contacts with the CDC when it comes to lead poisoning? Correct. -Has that ever happened before? -No. That is awful. And the CDC's responses there showed some superhuman restraint. &quot;My entire division was eliminated,&quot; and &quot;I sincerely regret to inform you we will be unable to support you&quot; are an incredibly diplomatic version of what I'm pretty sure they wanted to say, which is, &quot;Our shit just got rocked...&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) &quot;...and buckle up because your shit's about to get rocked too.&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Now, RFK has since said, in his now classic style, that, &quot;If we make mistakes, we're going to admit it and we're going to remedy it,&quot; and that eliminating that lead program was one of the mistakes. But as of right now, that has not been remedied. And the thing is, even if it had, I doubt he'd even know about it. It seems that he only finds out what's going on in his agency whenever he appears on an episode of &quot;This Bitch Brings Receipts.&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And that's not even getting into the fact HHS has also abruptly cancelled more than 12 billion dollars in grants to states for their health services. And while some states are fighting that in court, in many cases, the damage has already been done. In Minnesota, their health department was told that they'd be losing more than 220 million dollars in previously approved funding. And they've warned that they may now have slower response times to infectious disease outbreaks, which is bad enough before you learn the cuts could even compromise their &quot;Team D.&quot; -Now, what is Team D, you ask? -(AUDIENCE CHUCKLES) It's Team Diarrhea. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) A group of public health students who interview people who've had diarrhea to track food poisoning outbreaks. And I love that name so very much... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...because it's straight to the point. If someone calls and says, &quot;Hi, I'm from Team Diarrhea,&quot; you don't say, &quot;And what is this regarding?&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Because you know things are about to get personal. You're about to talk about force and viscosity with a stranger. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Team Diarrhea is the best team name since the inter-department softball team on Law &amp; Order: SVU that was literally called Sex Crimes. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Sex Crimes is still number one, but Team Diarrhea is a close second. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And that's the impact on a big health department. In smaller, rural communities, losing even a relatively small amount of money can be devastating. The head of a mental health initiative in Kansas said, after losing around 50,000 dollars in federal funds, &quot;That is nothing to the federal government. But it is massive to this agency. And it is massive to the people we serve.&quot; And I'm still not done. Because HHS grants also help support programs that might not immediately come to mind, from this one, which provides things like heating and cooling assistance to more than six million low-income families, to public services like Meals on Wheels. Yeah, Meals on Wheels. They get funding from the Administration for Community Living, and nearly 50 percent of the staff there was just terminated. One of those people actually tried to confront Indiana Senator Jim Banks about the cuts, and it didn't go well. MACK SCHROEDER: Hi, I was a worker at HHS. I was fired illegally on February 14th. There are many people who are not getting social service programs, especially people with disabilities. Are you going to do anything to stop what's happening? -You probably deserved it. -SCHROEDER: I deserved it? -You probably deserved it. -SCHROEDER: I deserved it? Wow. Yeah, that's great to hear. Why did I deserve it? Because you seem like a clown. -Oh, fuck off! -(AUDIENCE GROANS) All else aside, do you even know what a clown is? (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Can you imagine how disappointed people would be if they thought they were going to see a funny clown and instead got a guy lecturing them about the dire lack of social services -for people with disabilities? -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Trust me, they wouldn't like it. Sure, they'll tolerate it for around 12 seasons. They'll even come and see it filmed -every once in a while. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But that doesn't mean they like it. Believe me. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And look, these cuts are dangerous on their face, but it gets so much worse when you remember who is in charge of all this, which brings us back to RFK. As we've talked about before, he has some extreme views on public health, although in his confirmation hearings, he tried hard to distance himself from them, pushing the idea that, if confirmed, he'd steer away from his controversial views on things like vaccines, and would instead prioritize health and wellness. Should I be so privileged as to be confirmed, we will make sure our tax dollars support healthy foods. We will scrutinize the chemical additives in our food supply. We will remove financial conflicts of interest from our agencies. We will create an honest, unbiased, gold-standard science at HHS, accountable to the president, to Congress, and to the American people. Yeah, that was his pitch, which does make sense, doesn't it? It'd probably be harder to get confirmed if he admitted that he's a rabid conspiracy theorist who, among other things, has suggested psychiatric drugs may cause school shootings, that Anthony Fauci was engaged in a historic coup d'etat against Western democracy, insisted that he won't take sides -on what happened on 9/11... -(AUDIENCE GROANS) ...and thinks it's acceptable to go barefoot on an airplane. -That is true. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) He took off his shoes and socks on, wait for it, a trip to the bathroom. (AUDIENCE GROANS) Here is a photo of it. -(AUDIENCE GROANS) -And I know, I literally just said &quot;9/11&quot; out loud, but RFK dragging his urine-soaked, free-range piggies through first class is literally the worst thing to ever happen in American airspace. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But regardless, that whole, &quot;I just care about Americans' health&quot; argument appealed to a lot of sceptics at that hearing, and he even won over Senator Bill Cassidy, a medical doctor who previously expressed concerns about Kennedy's stance on vaccines. And I know there are some out there who still think, &quot;Well, RFK's weird about vaccines, but he knows a lot about health-related issues.&quot; But you would be surprised by just how wildly wrong he can be when he is spouting alarming, official-sounding statistics. We are 4.2 percent of the world's population. We buy 70 percent of the pharmaceutical drugs on Earth. Fifteen percent of American youth are now on Adderall or some other ADHD medication. When I was a kid, I always say this, &quot;A typical pediatrician would see one case of diabetes in his lifetime. Today, it's one out of every three kids who walks through his office door. Twenty years ago, there was no diabetes in China. Today, 50 percent of the population is diabetic. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) So, here's the thing. All the numbers you just heard him say are bullshit. Americans don't buy 70 percent of the drugs on Earth. We buy around six percent. Fifteen percent of American youth aren't on ADHD meds. Estimates put it closer to five percent. One in three kids don't have diabetes. It's actually 0.35 percent or one in 285 kids. And the rate of diabetes in China is roughly 12 percent, not, as I think you already know, 50 percent. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Half of all the people in China do not have diabetes. And look, we've asked our researchers to fact check some dumb shit before on this show. Last year, we literally emailed J.D. Vance's team to ask, &quot;Has Senator Vance ever had sex with a couch?&quot; and &quot;Has Senator Vance ever had sex with any other furniture -or household items?&quot; -(AUDIENCE LAUGHING) But somehow that was still less embarrassing than writing to multiple diabetes experts this week and asking, &quot;Do half the people in China have diabetes?&quot; And in return getting a bunch of versions of &quot;no,&quot; and one response from a doctor that called Kennedy's statement &quot;ludicrous,&quot; adding, &quot;These stats might be related to the worm in his brain.&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS, APPLAUDS) And when you get key information about problems that wrong, you're probably going to fuck up any attempt at a solution. And that's not even the biggest issue with Kennedy's approach, because for all his loud talk of &quot;Making America Healthy Again,&quot; some of the cuts he's overseen are going to do the exact opposite of that. Because while he made a big show this week of claiming he'd eliminate eight dyes from foods like Froot Loops, which, fine... he's been much quieter about his decision to fire everyone at the CDC's Office of Smoking and Health, even though smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death and disease. As one former head of that agency has said, &quot;Shutting it down is the greatest gift to the tobacco industry in the last half century.&quot; With another former worker saying, &quot;If you're really worried about the ingredients in cereal, wait until you find out about the thousands of chemicals that are contained in cigarettes.&quot; And exactly! Just ask the Trix rabbit. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) He smoked three packs a day for the last 30 years, and he was just diagnosed with lung cancer. And it wasn't eating Trix that did it. He has three months to live. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) He's gonna die. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) In fact, for all RFK's self-promotion as being a scourge of big pharma and big food, he has just taken a buzzsaw to the regulatory agency whose job it was to keep them in line. And yet, there is one area where he is flooding attention and resources, despite it being the area that he had promised he'd stay away from, and that is sowing doubt about vaccines. He pushed out the top vaccine regulator at the FDA, who claimed Kennedy's team requested he turn over data on cases of brain swelling and deaths caused by the measles vaccine, something that was hard to do since, as he pointed out, that data doesn't exist because there have been no such confirmed cases in the US. But that is not all. Kennedy's also been making some very bold promises like this. We've launched a massive testing and research effort that's going to involve hundreds of scientists from around the world. By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic, and we'll be able to eliminate those exposures. Okay, so first, there is no autism epidemic. There are autism diagnoses for people who are autistic. And it is pretty bold to claim you're going to get a definitive answer to something that people have been studying for decades by September. Almost as bold as admitting to dumping a bear corpse in Central Park, your daughter telling the world you decapitated a whale with a chainsaw, and yet still having the audacity to make a highlight reel on Instagram that simply says, &quot;Animals.&quot; Keep their fucking name out of your fucking mouth! (AUDIENCE LAUGHS, APPLAUDS) Most people agree the vast majority of the rise in autism diagnoses is due to there being more research, better awareness, and more access for people to get an accurate diagnosis. That is what can happen when you put time and money into health services. But RFK has persisted in treating the rise in diagnoses as a tragedy, and the way he talks about autistic people in general can be utterly dehumanizing. Autism destroys families. And more importantly, it destroys our greatest resource, which are our children. These are kids who will never pay taxes. They'll never hold a job. They'll never play baseball. They'll never write a poem. They'll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted. And we have to recognize we are doing this to our children. And we need to put an end to it. Fuck you. (AUDIENCE CHEERS) -And I've got to say... -(AUDIENCE CHEERS) ...it is pretty telling that you are so divorced from any semblance of humanity that paying taxes is your first example of a fulfilling life. It may surprise you, but most parents don't actually hold their newborn baby for the first time and say, &quot;There's my future taxpayer. I can't wait until you get your first 1099 and therefore have any value as a human being. A coochie coochie coo.&quot; And to be clear, lots of autistic people can do the things RFK listed there. In fact, Marianne Eloise, an autistic poet, responded to those remarks with, &quot;I would love to read RFK's poetry, if he could share it,&quot; adding, &quot;I am not familiar with his work.&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But also, even if someone can't play baseball or write a poem or needs assistance using the toilet, they're still a person, and their life still has dignity and value. And as autistic advocates and journalists have noted, if Kennedy actually wanted to improve their lives, there are things he could be prioritizing, from research into how autistic people die needlessly from epilepsy episodes, to fixing our onerous system to provide around-the-clock care services. You know, the sort of programs he's been taking a fucking hatchet to. So, yeah, there are good reasons to have doubts about RFK's plan to tackle autism, even before you learn who he's bringing in to help him. Because among those he's turning to is David Geier. He's a longtime vaccine skeptic who Kennedy recently hired to head a study of immunizations and autism. Geier and his dad, seen here moments after telling each other, &quot;I love you...&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...have published papers claiming vaccines increase the risk of autism, something that has been thoroughly debunked, as we've already walked through at length before on this show. Much of their research was conducted in what his dad called &quot;a world-class lab, every bit as good as anything at NIH,&quot; but apparently was in his house, in a room that had wall-to-wall carpeting and faux wood paneling. Here is the two of them in that home lab. So, no red flags there, just two regular dudes knocking out experiments in what looks like a 1970s jack shack. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And their conclusions have been shockingly transparent bullshit. Geier's dad was often called to testify in court, and over the years, judges called his testimony, among other things, &quot;intellectually dishonest&quot; and &quot;at best negligent, if not a fraud on the court.&quot; In fact, by the time he died, his medical licenses had been suspended or revoked in at least ten states. As for his son, that is luckily not a concern, because, fun fact, he was disciplined by Maryland regulators for practicing medicine without a license. And while I do not know what the ideal qualifications are to run the nation's new inquiry into vaccines and autism, I'm assuming playing doctor for a while before getting caught isn't one of them. Not only is he not a doctor, he doesn't even play one on TV. Now more than ever, this is literally just some fucking guy. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And if you are thinking this is all going to end badly, it's already heading that way. As you undoubtedly know, measles is currently ripping across the country. As of taping, it has spread to at least 30 states, which is obviously bad because it can cause pneumonia, swelling of the brain, and one or two deaths per a thousand people. So far, three people have died, two of them children, meaning the country's now seen the first pediatric measles death in 22 years. And RFK's response has been a long way from ideal. He initially called the outbreak &quot;not unusual,&quot; which it very much is. And even when he wrote an op-ed acknowledging the benefits of the MMR vaccine, he made sure to say that &quot;The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,&quot; and he has been recklessly pushing alternative theories and remedies. LIZ KREUTZ: While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says the vaccine does protect children against measles, he also touts vitamin A as an effective therapy, writing in an op-ed last week... Okay, first, chicken soup is not a cure for anything. It is floating meat water parents trick their kids into eating by saying that it'll make them feel better. And that is only because the only way to get a child to eat anything is just to lie to them. &quot;Spider-Man eats broccoli all the time. Apples make you jump high. Santa Claus made these eggs, and if you don't eat them, he will kill himself.&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Kids will believe the dumbest shit, and apparently so will the head of the nation's health services. And while that clip was from a few years ago, Kennedy is still pushing vitamin A as a measles treatment, which seems to have had consequences given multiple children in West Texas have been treated for vitamin A toxicity stemming from at-home attempts to treat measles. And all the while, Kennedy's funding cuts have hampered states' ability to mitigate this outbreak. Vaccination efforts in multiple states have been canceled, including in places like Dallas, which had to cancel 50 vaccination clinics, including events specifically targeting schools with low immunization rates, proving once and for all that the city of Dallas and anyone from the Kennedy family simply do not mix well. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And it's not just measles. Whooping cough cases are also soaring right now, and multiple people have died of it in recent months, including two infants. The CDC's also been tracing an outbreak of hepatitis in Florida, but their lab that tests samples was just shut down, even though the kind of genetic tracing it performs is not conducted by any other lab in the US, or indeed, the world. And on top of all that, as we've mentioned, there are currently real concerns about bird flu spreading among wildlife and its potential to spread among humans. That could be a total disaster. This Colorado veterinarian has been sounding the alarm about bird flu for a while now, and she's only getting more concerned. BILL WHITAKER: Do we have enough information about how this virus is spreading? I would say today, no. At present, we're given a stick, and they put a blindfold on us, and we're sent into a gunfight. And we're losing. We are losing. Well, that is terrifying. And I really hope the worst-case scenario doesn't happen here, if for no other reason than I so badly do not want to get stuck in that white void again, slowly losing my mind while talking to myself and occasionally a passive-aggressive face that seems to hate me. Don't send me back in there! The point is, these are just some of the current crises. The damage that radiates out from the wholesale gutting of HHS is only going to compound over time. We talked to Dr. Georges Benjamin, the executive director of the American Public Health Association, not a man given to hyperbole, and he told us... It was a really uplifting conversation. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -And look, I'm not saying that our system was perfect before this. Over the years, we've done multiple stories about shortcomings in various parts of HHS, but our solution was always, &quot;It needs to be strengthened,&quot; and not, &quot;Hey, here's a good idea, let's cut its budget and put a dipshit screaming, 'AHA' in charge.&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But unfortunately, it feels right now, we're all about to get a harsh lesson in what each part of our public health system does as it gets taken away. Which is sorta like finding out what each of your organs does as someone removes them one by one. (AUDIENCE CHUCKLES) I'll be honest, in the course of working on this piece, we called a lot of people who have either worked for these agencies or rely on them. Sometimes they were people we've talked to multiple times over the years on various stories. They include many doctors and scientists who are, by profession, not alarmists. They can be endearingly and sometimes annoyingly measured in everything that they say. But they've been utterly shattered by the last few months. When we started making calls after the election, they sounded alarmed, but they were still holding off judgment, saying, &quot;Well, let's just see how this goes.&quot; But more recently, those same people have been telling us flat-out, &quot;This is a disaster. People will die because of the mistakes we're making right now.&quot; That leader of the APHA recently put out a statement that read in part... And look, I am not a physician or a scientist, despite, admittedly, looking like the child of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker of The Muppets. But I completely agree. RFK needs to go. And by impeachment, if necessary. To the extent any senators like Bill Cassidy were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, and I still cannot believe that they thought they could do that, that grace period is emphatically over because too much damage has already been done. This is a man who is clearly in way over his worm-riddled head. He doesn't know what he's doing, he doesn't know who he's fired, he doesn't even know how many diabetic people there are in China. And if that wasn't bad enough, he's currently spreading dangerous nonsense and gutting life-saving research, all while bringing in a basement quack. RFK in this job is dangerous. In fact, if I may quote every single passenger in the cabin of his ill-advised, piss-footed walkabout, there is something deeply wrong with this guy, and we need to stop him before he makes us all fucking sick." />

Amy Goodman with Juan Gonzalez we turn now to the Empire of AI that's the name of a new book by the journalist Karen How who's closely reported on the rise of the artificial intelligence industry with a focus on Sam Alman's Open AI the company behind Chat GPT karen How compares the actions of the AI industry to those of colonial powers in the past she writes quote &quot;The empires of AI are not engaged in the same overt violence and brutality that marked this history but they too seize and extract precious resources to feed their vision of artificial intelligence the work of artisan writers the data of countless individuals posting about their experiences and observations online the land energy and water required to house and run massive data centers and supercomputers.&quot; She writes &quot;Karen House book comes at a time when Republican Congress members are trying to block states from regulating AI the House recently passed Trump's so-called big beautiful budget bill that contains a provision that would prohibit any state level regulations of AI for the next decade.&quot; In a major gift to the AI industry Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green has criticized the provision even though she voted for the bill she wrote online quote &quot;Full transparency i did not know about this section i'm adamantly opposed to this and it's a violation of state rights and I would have voted no if I had known this was in there.&quot; She says she won't vote for it if it remains in there after the Senate votes to talk about this and much more we're joined by the journalist Karen How whose new book again is just out Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares and Sam Alman's Open AI former reporter at the Wall Street Journal and MIT Technology Review she leads the Pulitzer Cent's AI Spotlight Series program for J training journalists on how to cover AI you should train everyone on how to understand AI karen it's an amazing book why don't you start by talking about the title what exactly you mean for a lay audience for I suspect a lot of our audience are lites um so you really have to explain what artificial intelligence artificial general intelligence is so AI is a collection of many different technologies but most people were introduced to it through chatbt and what I argue in the book and what the title refers to empire of AI it's actually a critique of the specific trajectory of AI development that led us to chatbt and has continued since chatbt and that is specifically Silicon Valley's scale at all costs approach to AI development ai models in modern day they are trained on data they need computers to train them on that data but what Silicon Valley did and what OpenAI did in the last few years is they started blowing up the amount of data and the the size of the computers that need to do this training so we are talking about the full English language internet being fed into these models books scientific articles all of the intellectual property that is being created and also massive supercomputers that run tens of thousands even hundreds of thousands of computer chips that are the size of dozens maybe hundreds of football fields and use practically the entire energy demands of cities now so this is an extraordinary um type of AI development that is causing a lot of social labor and environmental harms and that is ultimately why I evoke this analogy to empire and Karen could you talk some more about not only the energy requirements but the water requirements of these huge data centers that are essence in essence the backbone of of this uh widening industry absolutely i'll give you two stats on both the energy and the water when talking about the energy demand McKenzie recently came out with a report that said in the next 5 years based on the current pace of AI computational infrastructure expansion we would need to put as much energy on the global grid as what is consumed by two to six times the energy consumed annually by the state of California and that will mostly be serviced by fossil fuels we're already seeing reporting of uh coal plants with their lives being extended they were supposed to retire but now they cannot to support this data center development we are seeing methane gas turbines unlicensed ones being popped up to uh service these data centers as well from a freshwater perspective these data centers need to be trained on freshwater they cannot be trained on any other type of water because it can corrode the equipment it can lead to bacterial growth and most of the time it actually taps directly into a public drinking water supply because that is the infrastructure that has been laid to deliver this clean fresh water to different businesses to different homes and Bloomberg recently had an analysis where they looked at the expansion of these data centers around the world and twothirds of them are being placed in water scarce areas so they're being placed in communities that do not have access to fresh water so it's not just the total amount of fresh water that we need to be concerned about but actually the distribution of this infrastructure around the world and most people are familiar with chat GPT uh the consumer aspect of AI but what about the military uh aspect of AI where in essence uh we're finding Silicon Valley companies becoming the next generation of defense contractors one of the reasons why OpenAI and many other companies are turning to the defense industry is because they have spent an extraordinary amount of money in developing these technologies they're spending hundreds of billions to train these models and they need to recoup those costs and there are only so many industries and so many places that have that size of a paycheck to pay and so that's why we're seeing a cozying up to the defense industry we're also seeing Silicon Valley use the US government in their empire building ambitions you could argue that the US government is also trying to use Silicon Valley vice versa in their empire building ambitions um but certainly these technologies are not they are not designed to be used in a sensitive military context and so the the aggressive push of these companies to try and get those defense contracts and integrate their technologies more and more to the into the infrastructure of the military is really alarming i wanted to go to the countries you went to or the stories you covered because I mean this is amazing the depth of your reporting from Kenya to Uruguay to Chile um you were talking about the use of water and I also want to ask you about nuclear power uh but in Chile um what is happening there around these data centers and the water they would use and the resistance to that yeah so Chile has an interesting history in that it's been under it was under a dictatorship for a very long time and so during that time most public resources were privatized including water but because of an anomaly there's one community in the greater Santiago metropolitan region that actually still has access to a public freshwater resource that services both that community as well as the rest of the country in emergency situations that is the exact community that Google chose to try to put a data center in and they proposed for their data center to use a thousand times more fresh water than that community used annually and it would be free and it you know I have no idea that is a great question but what the community told me was they weren't even paying taxes for this because they they believed based on reading the documentation that the taxes that Google was paying was in fact to where they had registered their offices their administrative offices not where they were putting down the data center so they were not seeing any benefit from this data center directly to that community and they were seeing no checks placed on the fresh water that this data center would have been allowed to extract and so these activists said &quot;Wait a minute absolutely not we're not going to allow this data center to come in unless they give us a legitimate reason for why it benefits us.&quot; And so they started doing boots on the ground activism pushing back knocking on every single one of their neighbors doors handing out flyers to the community telling them this company is taking our freshwater resources without giving us anything in return and so they escalated so dramatically that it escalated to Google Chile it escalated to Google Mountain View which by the way then sent representatives to Chile that only spoke English but then it eventually escalated to the Chilean government and the Chilean government now has roundts where they ask these community residents and the company representatives and representatives from the government to come together to actually discuss how to make data center development more beneficial to the community the activists say it is the fight is not over just because they've been invited to the table doesn't mean that everything is suddenly better they need to stay vigilant they need to continue scrutinizing these projects but thus far they've been able to block this project for four to five years and have gained that seat at the table and how is it that these uh western companies in essence are exploiting labor in the global south you go into something called data annotation firms what what are those yeah so because AI modern day AI systems are trained on massive amounts of data and they're sc that's scraped from the internet you can't actually pump that data directly into your AI model because there are a lot of things within within that data it's heavily polluted it needs to be cleaned it needs to be annotated so this is where data annotation firms come in these are middleman firms that hire contract labor to provide to these AI companies to do that kind of data preparation and open AI when it was starting to think about commercializing its products and thinking about let's put text generation machines that can spew any kind of text into the hands of millions of users they realized they needed to have some kind of content moderation they needed to develop a filter that would wrap around these models and prevent these models from actually spewing racist hateful and harmful speech to users that would not make a very good commercially viable product and so they contracted these middleman firms in Kenya where the Kenyan workers had to read through reams of the worst text on the internet as well as AI generated text where OpenAI was prompting its own AI models to imagine the worst text on the internet and then telling these Kenyan workers to detail to categorize them in detailed taxonomies of is this sexual content is this violent content how graphic is that violent content in order to teach its filter all the different categories of content it had to block and this is incredibly uncommon form of labor there are lots of other different types of contract labor that they use but these workers they're paid a few bucks an hour if at all and just like the era of social media these content moderators are left very deeply psychologically traumatized and ultimately there is no real philosophy behind why these workers are paid a couple bucks an hour and have their lives destroyed and why AI researchers who also contribute to these models are paid million-doll compensation packages simply because they sit in Silicon Valley in OpenAI's offices that is the logic of Empire and that hearkens back to my title Empire of AI so let's go back to your title Empire of AI the subtitle dreams and nightmares in Sam Alman's Open AI so tell us the story of Sam Alman and what Open AI is all about right through to the deal he just made in the Gulf when President Trump uh Sam Alman and Elon Musk were there alman is very much a product of Silicon Valley his career was first as a founder of a startup and then as the president of Y Combinator which is one of the most famous startup accelerators in Silicon Valley and then the CEO of OpenAI and there's no coincidence that OpenAI ended up introducing the world to the scale at all cost approach to AI development because that is the way that Silicon Valley has operated in the entire time that Altman came up in it and so he is a very strategic person he is incredibly good at telling stories about the future and painting these sweeping visions that investors and employees want to be a part of and so early on at YC he identified that AI would be one of the trends that could take off and he was trying to build a portfolio of different investments and different initiatives to place himself in the center of various different trends depending on which one took off he was investing in quantum computing he was investing in nuclear fusion he was investing in self-driving cars and he was developing a fundamental AI research lab ultimately the AI research lab was the ones that started accelerating really quickly so he makes himself the CEO of that company um and and originally he started it as a nonprofit to try and position it as a counter to forprofit driven incentives in Silicon Valley but within one and a half years opening eyes executives identified that if they wanted to be the lead in this space they had to go for this scale at all cost approach and had to should be in quotes they thought that they had to do this there are actually many other ways to develop AI and to have progress in AI that does not take this approach but once they decided that they realized the bottleneck was capital it just so happens Sam Alman is a once in a generation fundraising talent he created this new structure nesting a for-profit arm within the nonprofit to become this fundraising vehicle for the tens of billions and ultimately hundreds of billions that they needed to pursue the approach that they decided on and that is how we ultimately get to present day OpenAI which is one of the most capitalistic companies in the history of Silicon Valley continuing to raise hundreds of billions and and Altman has joked even trillions to produce a technology that ultimately has a middling economic impact thus far and uh we only have about a minute left but the relationship between Altman and other rivals like like Google or Elon Musk it is accelerating the development of this technology that again I I mentioned has this middling impact we've seen through the history of OpenAI that all of the former executives that have left have created their own rivals so Elon Musk was one of the original co-founders created XAI ilia Sudskyver was the chief scientist created safe super intelligence mirror Morati was the former chief technology officer created thinking machines lab all of them are now competing to try and dominate this technology and try and make it in their own image and finally this um regulation within the so-called big beautiful bill that says AI can't be regulated by states for a decade this is absolutely going to enshrine the impunity of Silicon Valley into law i mean I call this these empires of AI because they are already quickly becoming the apex predator in the ecosystem able to act in their self-interest and that bill if passed would certainly codify that well we're going to do a part two posted online at democracynow.org karen How is author of Empire of AI Dreams and Nightmares and Sam Alman's Open AI tune in tomorrow on Democracy Now when we speak with the

          <attvalue for="7" value="Welcome to The Daily Show! Man! My name is Jon Stewart. We've got a show for you tonight. Carole Cadwalladr is gonna be joining us. She's a journalist. She's gonna discuss with us the tech broligarchy and how the entirety of mankind, entirety, will be enslaved by a handful of misanthropic data hoarders. Spoiler alert, we don't make it. [LAUGHTER] Speaking of misanthropic data hoarders, DOGE-- [LAUGHTER] --has finally routed out one of America's least efficient government workers-- [LAUGHTER] -- and marked-- [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] --and marked him for dismissal. Elon Musk is no longer a special government employee. Friday was the billionaire's last day in charge of the Department of Government Efficiency. He's leaving. He's leaving his job to make more family with his time. [LAUGHTER] He, uh-- He [BLEEP] a lot, I think. Or he just has a mail-order sperm farm going. I don't know what he's doing. I'm actually-- I'm starting to feel bad for this guy. He's-- Look at him! He's been there four months! Look at-- Look at the poor bastard! It only took four months to go from this-- [LAUGHTER] --to this! Aw! Look at this [BLEEP] guy! He went from tech titan, given a mandate to move fast and crush the deep state, to-- [LAUGHTER] --guy who had a bad night in a Nashville bar and he can't remember, OK? He's got that look, like, has anyone seen my shoes? [LAUGHTER] He looks beaten down! He's got that look on his face that I imagine his employees normally have. Black eye, 1,000-yard stare. This dude has seen some shit! I'd like to know, at least, how that happened. REPORTER: Is your eye OK? What happened to your eye? I noticed there was a bruise there. No, I was just horsing around with little X, and I said, go ahead, punch me in the face. And he did. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] So you're not gonna tell us what happened. [LAUGHTER] Do you need a safe place to stay? Look, I believe some times do happen when you're roughhousing with your kids. But I'm also sure the one sentence no parent has ever uttered to their child is, go ahead, punch me in the face. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] But, no, no, no, no, Elon spent $300 million of his own money to get Trump elected, irreparably damaged his personal brand and almost all of his businesses, and is clearly suffering some kind of issue. But don't worry, Trump made sure that Elon got something in return. NEWS ANCHOR 1: President Trump heaping praise on the tech titan, presenting him with a golden key. And I gave him a little special something. We have here-- - Thank you. --a very special that I give to very special people. I have given it to some, but it goes to very special people. And I thought I'd give it to Elon-- Thank you. --as a presentation from our country. Thank you. Thank you, Elon. You couldn't just give him the [BLEEP] key! You had to make sure that everybody knows you give them to a lot of people. It's just not that special. You know, I've got a bunch of these. I give them to special people. Who's the guy who brings me my Diet Cokes? I give him one for every Diet Coke. Anyway-- [LAUGHTER] Enjoy your useless key. There was no need for Trump and Elon to commemorate this epic fail. It's an embarrassing display of theater. Look at these guys, pretending like this is some kind of celebratory, victorious sendoff for a job well done. Jesus, look, even Lincoln is looking down. Do you see him? Look at Lincoln! Look at Lincoln! [LAUGHTER] Even Lincoln is looking down, going-- [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] This is the most tedious performance I've ever had to sit through. This is-- Mm! [APPLAUSE] Even Lincoln can't take it! Oh, somebody Booth me! I don't like this! [LAUGHTER] [BOOING] Too soon? Is that-- [LAUGHTER] It's [BLEEP] Lincoln, for God's sakes. [LAUGHTER] With all the shit going on in the world, I was not expecting the audience to be like, poor Lincoln. [LAUGHTER] Just wanted to see a play. [LAUGHTER] Of course, Lincoln wasn't the only one seemingly disassociating in the Oval Office. And of course, there might have been an explanation for that behavior as well. NEWS ANCHOR 2: The New York Times reports that Musk allegedly used drugs far more than previously known. [LAUGHTER] Look, whether Elon was using drugs on the job or not, I have no idea. I do know one thing about the television industry, though, especially the news industry, and that is, whatever unusual images we have of Elon's enthusiastic time in Washington, DC, those images will now be repurposed and given a slightly different meaning and context, almost comically so. Inside Edition, do your worst. NEWS ANCHOR 3: Musk's departure comes as a jaw-dropping New York Times report claims he was taking a cocktail of drugs while on the campaign trail. According to the Times expose, Musk's erratic behavior, including waving a chainsaw around and that notorious Nazi-like stiffarm, can be attributed to a daily mix of ketamine, ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms, and Adderall. They claim he traveled with a &quot;daily medication box&quot; that holds &quot;20 pills.&quot; Yes! [LAUGHTER] Why do you want to do a brother dirty? Why are you doing that-- Come on, Inside Edition! Inauguration party enthusiasm? Oh, reefer madness! [LAUGHTER] And you might be saying, well, look, who amongst us hasn't unwound sometimes with a little mixture of ecstasy, mushrooms, ketamine and Adderall? [LAUGHTER] What could be the harm? NEWS ANCHOR 2: He told people he was taking so much ketamine that it was affecting his bladder. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] He-- He told people that? [LAUGHTER] This dude is a one-man anti-drug campaign. These are your pants. These are your pants on drugs. [LAUGHTER] And I do love the fact, though, that the detail is he's the one who told them he had a bladder fall. That means things were so bad, he had to be like, oh, don't worry, it's nothing weird, it's just an overabundance of ketamine. [LAUGHTER] Now, obviously, we on this program would have been delighted to offer an unedited forum for Elon to discuss his journey from hard-working efficiency expert to drug-addled child star mug shot. But he chose to go in a different direction by sort of speaking to your theater-loving parents' favorite news program, CBS Sunday Morning. This is true. This was his final Trump administration exit interview. I noticed that all of your businesses involve a lot of components, a lot of parts. Do the tariffs and the trade wars affect any of this? You know, tariffs always affect things a little bit. [LAUGHTER] How revealing. Any follow-up? I'm wondering what your thought is on the ban on foreign students, the proposal-- I mean, you were one of those kids, right? Yeah, I mean, I think we want to stick to, you know, the subject of the day, which is, like, spaceships, as opposed to, you know, presidential policy. Oh, OK. I was told anything's good, but-- No. Well-- No. [LAUGHTER] Look what Trump has reduced this man to! He has broken this poor man! Just in an interview, can't we just talk about spaceships? [LAUGHTER] I was told we'd talk about-- I was told we would both be wearing helmets and talking about-- [LAUGHTER] Just a simple boy with a set of Star Wars sheets and pillows, and I really would just like to talk about spaceships. I mean, you can't blame him. His whole project was cutting money from the government, trying to find efficiencies, and sneaking a Trojan horse in the back door and stealing all our data. But Trump is spending $200 billion more than the previous administration did in this amount of time and creating a deficit-exploding, big, beautiful bill that is the antithesis of everything Musk said he was trying to do. And now he's left softly complaining about it to a guy who's normal news segment is explaining to your grandparents how to download a PDF. You know, I was, like, disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, doesn't decrease it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing. I think a bill can be big, or it can be beautiful, but I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion. No, sir. We will not be body shaming legislation. [LAUGHTER] I'm gonna tell you something, and I speak for all the legislation out there, that, in this country, a bill can be big and beautiful! And-- [CHEERING] [CHEERING] I promised myself I wasn't gonna do this. And brave. [LAUGHTER] Holy shit! No-- Here's my favorite-- By the way, so, this, actually, is my favorite part of the whole interview. So, Elon actually expressed some dissatisfaction with what was happening with the Trump administration. It was a turn of events that stunned the reporter on CBS Sunday Morning, who had no idea, apparently, that this was being recorded. Right after our interview, CBS News posted a clip of it to promote this very report. It was that part, where Musk criticizes Trump's spending bill, and his remarks became news. It went all the way up to the White House. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] Yeah, that's what news does. [LAUGHTER] He's saying that like, so, am I in trouble now? I thought we were just killing time until we got another Patti-LuPone-apologizes update. I don't like any of this. But let this be a lesson to Elon and anybody in Trump's orbit. Whatever your passionate political belief, or whatever your ideology is, you will go from reaching for mine stars to dissolving in a puddle of your own urine and shame and starting a fight club with your kid just to be able to feel, because Trump-- [CHEERING] Trump-- [CHEERING] Trump-- [CHEERING] Trump-- Trump doesn't believe in anything, man. What, were you with him because of his commitment to rein in big tech? They use big tech to censor you. They use the deep state to spy on you. We have to make sure that we are protecting the American people's privacy and data rights. When I'm president, big tech will pay. ITunes will have to agree to your terms and conditions. [LAUGHTER] When I'm president, traffic lights will have to click on boxes containing pictures of you. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTEER] Capture that! So, how is that libertarian paradise vision going for you now? The Trump administration is expanding its partnership with Palantir. The company is reportedly going to build a master list of personal information on Americans that could give President Donald Trump immense surveillance power. [BOOING] It's a never a good sign when the phrase &quot;master list&quot; and &quot;surveillance power&quot; are coupled. No one's ever like, I've assembled a master list of puppies you can surveil for boops. But, hey, how evil can Palantir be? You've got &quot;pal&quot; right in the name there. Well, look, it's not like they're handing all of our data over to some crackpot CEO. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] Well, let's not judge a book by its cover. The most effective way for social change is humiliate your enemy and make them poorer. I don't think in win-lose. I think in domination. I love the idea of getting a drone and having light fentanyl-laced urine spraying on analysts who have tried to screw us. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] Well, let's not judge a book by its insides. [LAUGHTER] Well, I've always said, if there's anyone in the country who should have access to all of my personal data, it's the guy who wants drug-laced, urine-spraying drones. [LAUGHTER] Although, if he is serious about that, he's gonna need a source for drug-laced urine. I might know a guy-- No! No! Here's the thing. The reality is this. The reality of Trump is he turns even his most fervent and enthusiastic foot soldiers upside down. Take Dan Bongino, ex-Secret Service agent, Fox News host, and guy who looks like he starts fights at little league games, even though he doesn't have a kid playing. He was very excited for the Trump era. Right now, we're in charge. This is how shit gets done. Trump ain't [BLEEP] around. We are gonna hold every one of these people accountable. It is time for total personnel warfare. Fire 100 people on day one. Fire 100 more. Fire 1,000 more. Fire everyone. We're good at flipping the script on dipshit [BLEEP] liberal Commies. You know what's coming? What's coming? Does anybody know? [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] Well, that last part is gonna make for some good B-roll for an Inside Edition story one day. [LAUGHTER] Anyway, Trump made that guy deputy director of the FBI, because of course. But look what his only three months on the job have done to him. I gave up everything for this. I mean, cash is there all day. We share an-- Our offices are linked. He turns on the faucet, I hear it. He's there at-- He gets in at, like, six o'clock in the morning. He doesn't leave until 7:00 at night. You know, I'm in there at 7:30 in the morning. He uses the gym. I work out in my apartment. But I stare at these four walls all day in DC. Yeah, that's called a job. You have a job. That's what they are. You go in at a specific time, 6:30, 7:00, around there, to a specific room, mostly four-walled, and you're there all [BLEEP] day. It's work! It's job! And, yeah, there probably is a dude in there that you hear all [BLEEP] day. He turns the water on, you hear it. Hey, look at that, he's chewing another [BLEEP] sandwich! I hate this job! It's annoying! Yeah, it sucks! How do you not know that! For God's sakes, you're on the right! Haven't you even read Dilbert, for [BLEEP] sake! Work sucks! And how are you just finding out about this now? How is having a job now suddenly destroying everything? But I stare at these four walls all day in DC, you know, by myself, divorced from my wife, not divorced, but I mean separated, divorced, and it's hard. I mean, you know, we love each other, and it's hard to be apart. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] I mean, it's just-- It's hard. I don't like-- We're separated-- I mean, divorced. I'm not divorced. Obviously, divorced, but not separated. I'm separated together, but not, of course, alone. But I go-- Who knows? I mean, some people, they leave for work-- I don't-- Who the [BLEEP] knows? Guys come over. They come banging. Who the [BLEEP] knows what's happening? I don't know what's happening. Why can't she come to work? Why can't I just bring-- Can I bring my wife to work? Would that be OK? We all miss our wives! What the [BLEEP]? [LAUGHTER] The only one who's gonna come out of there unscathed is Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, because I don't think she's got any principles in there left to die. President Trump is truly the most transparent and accessible president in American history. We have truth on our side at this White House. I think everybody, the American public, believe it's absurd for anyone to insinuate that this president is profiting off of the presidency. It's frankly ridiculous that anyone in this room would even suggest that President Trump is doing anything for his own benefit. That's all he's doing! By the way, I think, the more she lies, the bigger her cross gets. Is that possible? It's like some sort of weird Pinocchio cross. The President can't be bought. [LAUGHTER] I'm not even upset with this lady, because just rolling with the punches is clearly the only strategy for happiness when you're working for Trump. Trump's very open secret has always been he doesn't believe in or care about any policy issue at all. He wants attention, he wants his ego stroked, and he wants money. He wants [BLEEP] wads and [BLEEP] wads of money. Remember his 90 deals in 90 days? He made them, but only for his family. Those are the only deals he made. Meanwhile, the world he said he was gonna fix is burning, like so many nuclear-capable planes in Siberia. And don't bother trying to call him on it, because, before you can, he's already moved on to pulling some new crazy thing out of his ass to distract us. NEWS ANCHOR 4: President Trump is reposting false claims about former President Joe Biden, saying that Biden was executed in 2020. Since then, clones, body doubles, and robots took Biden's place as president. [LAUGHTER] You're saying that the Joe Biden who doesn't even know where he is is actually an incredibly advanced cloned robot? How much ketamine are you on? [LAUGHTER] A lot." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="♪ (&quot;LAST WEEK TONIGHT&quot; THEME MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ We're actually going to start with our main story tonight, which concerns Trump's relationship with the press. It's always been antagonistic. And this week, we got yet another reminder when he was asked a perfectly reasonable question about reports that he planned to accept a luxury jet from Qatar. REPORTER: You're ABC Fake News, right? It's only ABC. Well, a few of you would. Let me tell you. You should be embarrassed asking that question. They're giving us a free jet. It's not a gift to me, it's a gift to the Department of Defense. And you should know better, because you've been embarrassed enough, and so has your network. Your network is a disaster. ABC is a disaster. That is pretty hostile, though I actually agree that ABC should be embarrassed. Just not for that entirely legitimate question, but for the fact that, as of taping, they still haven't renewed Doctor Odyssey for season two. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) What the fuck are you doing, ABC? It's sexy ER on a boat. It's The Pitt with sharks. It's got, and I'm not even going to try and beat their tagline on this, &quot;big deck energy.&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) In its pilot episode alone, it featured a water slide injury, someone overdosing on shrimp, and this. DR. MAX BANKMAN: What happened? It... It broke. He's in shock. What broke, Mr. Harrington? Is it a bone? (AUDIENCE GROANS) DR. AVERY MORGAN: Penile fracture. Are you not entertained? (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) How is ABC renewing shows called The Rookie and Will Trent, whose premise is apparently just, &quot;Despite being dyslexic, -he's become a special agent... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...in the Georgia Bureau of Investigation&quot;? What?! (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But they haven't renewed the only show brave enough to answer the question, &quot;What if sick, but boat?&quot; I shouldn't complain about the other shows. I shouldn't care that a show called and about a rookie is returning for its premise-defying eighth season. And I don't begrudge any audience members for sticking around to find out if their favorite characters will or won't Trent. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) All I'm saying is ABC's The View has been on since 1997 and &quot;Dr. Hot Boat&quot; is still in limbo. You're a disgrace, ABC! Your network is a disaster. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) The problem is, Trump clearly only likes when people are nice to him, and the press, by covering the things he says and does and the way he says and does them, is, in his opinion, being mean. Back in his first campaign, he attacked journalists constantly, calling Jake Tapper &quot;Fake Tapper,&quot; Maggie Haberman &quot;Maggot Hagerman,&quot; and Katie Tur &quot;Little Katie,&quot; which compared to the others is just lazy. Little Katie sounds like a doll from the 1970s that was discontinued for giving children lead poisoning. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But in his second term, Trump's administration has escalated those attacks on the press, from making it easier to subpoena journalist records, to detaining a Tufts University student after she'd co-authored an op-ed on Gaza, to Trump calling for Republicans to defund NPR and PBS, calling them &quot;radical left monsters that so badly hurt our country.&quot; And in March, he even went to the DOJ to issue this chilling announcement. I believe that CNN and MSDNC, who literally write 97.6 percent bad about me, are political arms of the Democrat Party. And in my opinion, they're really corrupt and they're illegal. What they do is illegal. And it has to stop. It has to be illegal. Okay. &quot;What the press does has to be illegal&quot; is obviously extremely bad, but I also want to talk about that 97.6 percent real quick, because I'm genuinely surprised that he knew that made-up number would sound more authentic if he added a decimal point. -A decimal... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...just feels more like a real number, even if it isn't. If I tell you 20 percent of Taco Bell ground beef is actually horse, you're like, &quot;No way, number's too round.&quot; -But... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...if I say 21.6 percent is horse, you'd be like, &quot;Mmm, he wouldn't make up a number that specific.&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Now, to be clear, I wouldn't say either of those numbers, though, because we all know that the real number is significantly higher, but apparently, legally, -I can't say that, so I won't. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And unfortunately, even as Trump's aggression has gone up, some owners of press outlets have gotten more submissive. During Trump's first term, a lot of outlets positioned themselves as &quot;fierce watchdogs for truth.&quot; The Washington Post, for instance, adopted the slogan, &quot;Democracy dies in darkness.&quot; But this time, even before the election, they seemed noticeably gentler. The Post's owner, Jeff Bezos, killed the paper's endorsement for Kamala Harris. He also ordered that its op-ed page focus purely on the importance of personal liberties and free markets. Bezos has seemingly gone out of his way to cozy up to Trump with his company paying 40 million dollars to license a documentary on Melania, the most Amazon has ever spent on a documentary, and even standing behind Trump at his inauguration. And come on, that's not just bending the knee, that's bending both knees, arching your back, and relaxing your holes. (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Bezos isn't the only media owner making notable concessions. JONATHAN LEMIRE: The billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Times has reportedly asked the paper's editorial board to, quote, &quot;Take a break&quot; from writing about President-elect Donald Trump. Patrick Soon-Shiong has reportedly required editors to send him the text of every editorial and the name of its writer before publishing. That is pretty chilly. And as for &quot;taking a break&quot; from writing about Trump, to be clear, I also don't want to hear about him all the time. I don't love that I'm talking about him right now, especially when I could be talking about the recent headline, &quot;Ohio Police Find Raccoon Holding Meth Pipe... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...During Traffic Stop,&quot; which was already good enough, until they made it even better, pointing out, &quot;When an officer took the pipe away, the raccoon pulled out another.&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Pulled out another?! From where?! (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) You don't think I want to talk about this raccoon with multiple meth pipes... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...for the next 25 solid minutes? Of course I do, but I can't, because... even as threats to the free press seem to be on the rise, resistance to them seems to be waning, and in some corners, to a worrying extent. So given that, tonight, let's talk about Trump and the press, how he's tried to reshape his coverage, the levers of power he's using to threaten them, and how we should be responding. Let's start with, if not the most important, the most visible sign that things have changed, the White House press corps. Back in February, the White House picked a high-profile fight with the Associated Press for the dumbest imaginable reason. You may remember, after taking office, Trump announced that he'd renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. And while some outlets started using the new name, the AP didn't, which led to them being banned from the Oval Office. Something Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt justified like this. If we feel that there are lies being pushed by outlets in this room, we are going to hold those lies accountable. And it is a fact that the body of water off the coast of Louisiana is called the Gulf of America. And I'm not sure why news outlets don't want to call it that, but that is what it is. Okay, to you maybe, but not to everyone. As the AP pointed out, it has clients all over the world, and lots of them still use the term &quot;the Gulf of Mexico.&quot; So it's not as simple as you're making out there, especially because it can take time for people to adjust to a stupid name change. Sometimes, hypothetically, before we can even get used to one dumb name... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...some genius comes along and only makes it dumber, then somehow it gets dumber still, and then against all the odds, somehow it becomes even worse before inexplicably going back to the stupid thing it was before. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS, APPLAUDS) Incidentally, earlier this week, my parent company apparently said they &quot;cannot wait for my hot take on this whole rebrand.&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Believing that whatever I say about this change was going to be &quot;pretty hot.&quot; -So... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...please look me in the eyes when I say this. Fuck you, don't tell me what to do. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) I'm not gonna do it if you want-- Unless, wait, hold on. Maybe you thought baiting me like that would be a good way to stop me from doing it. But on the other hand, how could a company be that smart when they're the same people that came up with so many stupid fucking names?! (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Now, after a legal battle, the White House began allowing the AP back into the Oval Office. And as you just saw with that ABC reporter, other traditional outlets are still allowed access to the president, primarily so that he can shit on them. But increasingly, he is managing to get the sycophantic questions he'd prefer. And even if you haven't noticed that, he definitely has. REPORTER 2: What has made you and your team so effective in finding, locating, apprehending, and deporting these violent illegal migrants? I love this guy. (PRESS MEMBERS LAUGH) I wish more people would ask questions like that. NICK GILBERTSON: Do you think it shows just how out of touch they are with the American people, especially given that 79 percent, according to a CBS poll, approved of your of your speech? I love this guy. REPORTER 3: How come when these Democrat elites want tariffs, everything's hunky dory. But when President Trump wants tariffs, all hell breaks loose? Do you see this double standard? I love this guy. Whoever the hell that is. (PRESS MEMBERS LAUGH) That's really nice. I appreciate that question. That is pretty humiliating, and not just because, &quot;I love this guy, whoever the hell that is&quot; is almost definitely how Donald Trump opened a toast at Eric's wedding. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But it's not a coincidence that Trump's been getting more flattering questions because the White House has increasingly let far-right news outlets and influencers into press events. A recent review of briefings found that four of the five reporters Leavitt called on, most were from right-wing outlets. She's also added a seat for new media, and the person in that seat is always called on first, meaning the press room now features figures like Cara Castronuova, who works for LindellTV, an internet news network bankrolled by the MyPillow guy, who asks questions like this. CARA CASTRUONOVA: Will you guys also consider releasing the president's fitness plan? He actually looks healthier than ever before. Healthier than he did eight years ago. And I'm sure everybody in this room could agree. Is he working out with Bobby Kennedy? And is he eating less McDonald's? That is an actual question a White House reporter asked, and everything about that is unsettling, from the fact she was essentially asking, &quot;The president's looking hotter than ever, right?&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) To the absolutely cursed smile of that ghostly twink presence... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...of the business Malfoy hovering behind her. You can all see him too, right? Please tell me you can see him. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And when she was asked to spell out her approach to journalism, it didn't go great. You are a Trump fan, right? Yes, I'm definitely a supporter of President Trump. So, will you be able to hold him to account then? I will be able to hold, a hundred percent, him to account. You know, there's, I'm sure, things that will happen that I disagree with. And I have said plenty of times, you know, on the record when I disagreed with his decision. Is there anything so far in this administration you've disagreed with? I'm not going to-- Let me put some thought into that for a second. Um... I'm just overwhelmed, like just overwhelmed with how well I perceive things to be going. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) What?! &quot;I'm just overwhelmed with how well I perceive things to be going&quot;? (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) That sounds less like what a White House correspondent should be saying to a reporter, more like something you'd say to an acquaintance at coffee before crying in your car for an hour. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And look, stocking the press room with suck-ups would be bad enough, but that's just one of the ways the White House has found to thumb the scale of its coverage. Another has been attempting to weaponize the FCC. Historically, it's at least pretended to be an independent commission, but that is now changing fast under its new chair, Brendan Carr. Trump elevated him to run the commission almost immediately after the election, and Carr made no secret of what he was going to do. I want to start by expressing my thanks and appreciation again to President Trump and to congratulate him again on his historic election victory. For me, as I go forward, the first thing is to get together with the president's team and make sure that I 100 percent understand his agenda. After all, it's going to be his administration, and it's going to be his agenda that we should be pushing. Okay, but that's not what your job is supposed to be. You never want to hear something as obsequious as that coming from someone in a role that's supposed to be independent. For the same reason you don't want to see an NBA ref wearing one of the team's uniforms... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...or a Supreme Court justice flying an insurrection flag outside of his house. Hypothetically, of course, you understand. And Carr does seem deep in the tank for the president. Trump supporters have celebrated this image of him -wearing a gold Trump pin. -(AUDIENCE GROANS) And after The Hollywood Reporter published an article titled, &quot;Trump's Media Pit Bull is Off the Leash&quot; that included this horrifying picture of Carr as a pit bull, he tweeted it saying, &quot;Woof woof.&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) One past FCC commissioner said, &quot;I'm about as worried as I can be about the future of the FCC. I would say Carr is the most ideological chairman we've ever had and the most political.&quot; And he's wasted no time pursuing Trump's agenda. His FCC is now investigating all the major broadcast outlets except for Fox. And Carr's stewardship of the FCC has also been part of a new squeeze Trump's been putting on the networks, with the FCC on one side and lawsuits on the other. Here is how it works. The FCC has the ability to regulate the broadcast licenses of local TV and radio stations. The big networks each own a bunch of those. CBS, for instance, owns all of these. And while the FCC revoking a license is incredibly hard, what it can do is make it very hard for networks to sell those stations. Which, given the frequency of media mergers and acquisitions, can be a real problem. So, networks now have that threat hanging over them, while at the same time, Trump is applying legal pressure by filing lawsuits to put them on the defensive. It is pretty flagrant. Trump files a lawsuit demanding money, at the same time his FCC starts making noises about plans to make that company's life unpleasant. So, the networks settle, in the hopes it'll keep Trump happy and get everyone off their back, and maybe they think twice about the tone of their coverage in the future. Right now, CBS is caught in this exact squeeze, largely arising from a 60 Minutes segment the day just before the election featuring an interview with Kamala Harris, which Trump maintains was misleadingly edited. He has sued the network in a lawsuit First Amendment lawyers have called &quot;frivolous and dangerous and ridiculous junk.&quot; And to understand just how true that is, it's worth looking at the specifics here. Very basically, it involves Harris' answer to a question about Gaza. And here is Trump's version of what happened. They took Kamala's answer, which was a crazy answer, a horrible answer, and they took the whole answer out and they replaced it with something else she said later on in the interview, which wasn't a great answer, but it wasn't like the first one. The first was grossly incompetent. It was weird. And that was fraud and election interference by their news magazine, a big part of CBS News. Okay, so Trump's theory is that CBS secretly replaced Harris' answer to a question to get her to win the presidency. And straight away, complaining about that is a bit like accusing me of hiding the secrets of my skincare routine. One, I don't have one. And two, even if I did, it doesn't matter because it's not like it worked, did it? (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But it's worth knowing the only reason he's aware of that &quot;weird answer&quot; is that it aired in a promo for that 60 Minutes interview on Face the Nation. So, CBS aired it. They weren't trying to hide anything. And if you're curious, here are the two versions. Here is what aired on Face the Nation. It seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening. Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. -That is a pretty shitty answer. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) It's like she's trying to express a thought in English but with French grammar. It sounds like someone just shook her awake and yelled, &quot;Israel,&quot; at her. So, Trump is not wrong. That was bad. But here's the supposedly much better answer that 60 Minutes aired that night. It seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening. We're not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end. I mean, I guess that sounds slightly more coherent, but they are both fundamentally celebrations of prepositional phrases and the passive voice. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) In both, she's talking like a high schooler trying to hit the word count. The letter of scarlet worn by Hester Prynne in the novel The Scarlet Letter, written by Nathaniel Hawthorne, published in 1850, symbolizes shame and punishment symbolically. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And the underlying fact is the two answers seem to be broadly saying the same amount of absolute nothing about the same topic, which isn't surprising because under pressure from the FCC, CBS actually released the full transcript of the interview, and it turns out this is her full answer to the question she was asked about Israel, this is what aired on Face the Nation, And this is what aired on 60 Minutes. So the network didn't take her whole answer out and replace it with something from later in the interview, as Trump claimed. They basically aired both halves of a single answer, and that sort of editing decision, for time or clarity, happens on TV all the time. As Semafor pointed out, early last year, Fox actually massaged a Trump interview, because in the version that they initially aired, this was the exchange. Would you declassify the Epstein files? Yeah. Yeah, I would. Okay, then. That is a firm, unequivocal answer. And at that point, they cut away to the next question. But when they later aired a longer clip from that interview, it became clear that his full answer played out a little differently. Would you declassify the Epstein files? Yeah. Yeah, I would. -RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY: All right. -Yes, I would. I think that less so because, you know, you don't know if-- you don't want to affect people's lives if it's phony stuff in there 'cause there's a lot of phony stuff with that whole world. Yeah, in one version, Trump's answer was edited down, and people who saw that missed out on the fuller context of watching his thought process go, in real time, from, &quot;Of course, we should absolutely release the files. People deserve to know the truth,&quot; to, &quot;Oh, wait, you mean that, Epstein?&quot; to, &quot;Oh, yeah, you know, you can't believe everything that you read about people.&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) The point is, CBS engaged in a pretty standard practice of editing an interview for length and clarity. Nevertheless, Trump sued them for fraud, demanding 20 billion dollars... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -...in damages. And CBS initially fought back, calling the claims &quot;completely without merit&quot; and saying that they intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit, which makes sense, as legal experts have called it baseless and an easy victory for CBS. But here's the thing. While that lawsuit was going on, the FCC began investigating the network over claims it engaged in &quot;news distortion&quot; with the interview. And that is a problem for CBS, especially as its parent company, Paramount, is currently in the middle of a massive merger with Skydance Media. And as I mentioned earlier, transferring its broadcast licenses will require FCC approval, and it can sit on that approval indefinitely. That may well be why Shari Redstone, Paramount's controlling shareholder has said she favors settling the case. She and Paramount have also apparently indicated to 60 Minutes they were very interested to know the segments the show was going to be running on Trump for the rest of the season, which feels like a big overstep. Bill Owens, the head of 60 Minutes, actually resigned in the wake of that, saying it had become clear he would not be allowed to make independent decisions at the show. All of which makes it pretty galling that just a few years ago, Shari Redstone chaired an event for CPJ, a group that defends press freedom around the world, and had the nerve to position herself as a defender of a free press. It is truly an honor to be here representing Paramount Global and the thousands of hardworking journalists at CBS News who fight every day for the freedom and integrity of the press. The honorees in this room are living embodiments of these values. They remind us that press freedom is never guaranteed, that it must constantly be defended, and that it often comes at a significant cost, both personal and professional. Wow, powerful words there about the need to defend press freedom at any cost from someone who has seemed to stop doing that as soon as there was a financial one to her. And that kind of undercuts the strength of her statement there. Imagine FDR saying, &quot;The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,&quot; only to flip the fuck out after he saw a bug. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -It undermines his point. (LAUGHTER CONTINUES) And maybe Redstone's calculating that if she just gives Trump what he wants now, he'll back down, but I seriously doubt that. Just look at what happened to ABC. They settled a defamation lawsuit with Trump in December over how George Stephanopoulos characterized the E. Jean Carroll verdict, paying 15 million dollars to Trump's private foundation for his presidential museum, despite experts saying ABC might well have won at trial. But since then, Carr's FCC has pushed ABC for more concessions, like threatening its broadcast license over Disney's DEI practices. And look, as bad as these examples are, you at least might already be aware of them. But there are fights happening at the local level that aren't getting nearly the same degree of attention, but that are just as worrying. Take a look at what Carr's FCC is doing to KCBS, a San Francisco radio station. Very basically, on the afternoon of January 26th, a local community group made this post to Facebook concerning ICE agents being spotted in the area. A city council member also posted about the ICE activities. Around 3:40 p.m., the community group posted that ICE had left. And around two hours after that, KCBS ran a story about it in the classic sedate tone of every radio news broadcast ever. Okay, first, that is a remarkably soothing voice... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...for a news report describing something as alarming as ICE agents in unmarked vehicles. It's like listening to a YouTube video titled, &quot;Lofi Sounds of a Man Getting Mauled by a Tiger -to Relax/Study to.&quot; -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But crucially, that report's also pretty basic. ICE was in the community, community groups and government officials were talking about it, and local news covered it. That radio station was actually one of several outlets that covered it around the same time. Here it is on the six o'clock news on NBC, which actually showed images of the cars and agents in question, and here's the same footage being aired on Telemundo. But it was the radio report that got the attention of a right-wing activist who pointed out that KCBS was owned by George Soros' investment firm and claimed that it had put ICE agents &quot;at serious risk while an operation was ongoing,&quot; which it very much did not. Nevertheless, that complaint made its way to Brendan Carr, who later got himself in front of a camera to say this. So, what happened was you had ICE agents undercover doing operations in East San Jose, in part of the town known for violent gang activity, and you had this radio station broadcasting the live location, identifying the unmarked vehicles that they were in. So we have sent a letter of inquiry, a formal investigation into that matter, and they have just a matter of days left to respond to that inquiry and explain how this could possibly be consistent with their public interest obligations. What are you talking about? Covering stories like that is literally the whole point of local news radio. That, and delivering the driest imaginable ad read for a local deck staining company. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Now, legal scholars will tell you this FCC investigation is also meritless. As one First Amendment expert put it, law enforcement operations, immigration or otherwise, are matters of public interest. So if it comes to a court case and KCBS chooses to fight, it will almost certainly win. But it's a little worrying that so far, they haven't openly defended their journalists, who, again, did absolutely nothing wrong. And on one hand, I get it. Fighting the FCC costs money and opens the station up to risk when their license comes up again. But staying silent has real cost too. As that First Amendment expert says, &quot;Even if charges are never filed, people have to look over their shoulders to wonder, 'Is the government going to come after me because I reported something that the government doesn't like me to say?'&quot; Sadly, that is a reasonable question to ask now. Much more reasonable, you could argue, than, &quot;When's the president's workout DVD dropping?&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And this feels like where the biggest potential harm may be done because the government, directly or indirectly, is controlling criticism. And that is, to put it bluntly, authoritarianism. We've seen countries backslide, and the press tends to be one of the first casualties. It happened under Viktor Orbán in Hungary and Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines. And those who've watched it happen in person will tell you this is where it starts. And this is also the one chance you get to stop it. Maria Ressa’s a journalist who was arrested in the Philippines for standing up to the Duterte regime. She ultimately won a Nobel Prize for doing that. And she said she sees parallels here with what happened there. And her warning to people like Shari Redstone is pretty stark. Don't voluntarily give up your rights, right? I mean, again, I'll give you our example in the Philippines, where the first-- the newspaper gave up, the television station gave up, largest. It lost its franchise or license to operate. And guess what? It never regained it, even after the time of Duterte. I guess what I'm saying is, &quot;hold the line&quot; is the phrase we use, because it's connected to the rights that you deserve as a citizen. And if you do not hold the line at this crucial moment, this is the moment when you are strongest, you will only get weaker over time. Exactly. Fundamental rights and freedoms are worth fighting for. And this is one of the fights that nerds who work in newsrooms can actually win, mostly because it doesn't require any upper body strength. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) So, what can we do? Well, obviously, public support for organizations like The AP and 60 Minutes is important, but we also need to pay attention to what's happening at places like KCBS. And I'd argue there's a special obligation here to any outlets owned by extremely wealthy people, like this lot, to fight back. Don't comply with Trump's ridiculous demands prematurely. I know he and the FCC are making a lot of intimidating-sounding threats and fighting them will undeniably take time, effort, and money, but I'd argue it is very much worth it, especially when the likeliest outcome is that you win definitively. If I may quote someone who I hope meant it when she said it, &quot;Press freedom is never guaranteed, it must constantly be defended, and that often comes at a significant cost.&quot; The point is, if media owners enjoy the applause they get when they say things like that, now is the time to pay for it. Think of it this way. A free press is really a lot like Doctor Odyssey. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -It's rare. It's special. We're very lucky to have it. (LAUGHTER CONTINUES) And if we're not extremely careful, we're all gonna miss it terribly when it's gone." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="foreign everything he said is a reflection of himself and request that only the durats remain inshallah attached to all of us they must bless him may Allah bless everyone here at this beautiful Center there's a Sakina in the center and clearly with that Tranquility there is a level of Tranquility that descends I pray because of the mention of the most beloved of Allah's creation to him for an entire day here and with that would be the presence in the night on of the angels and of his of his mercy and I pray that Allah allow this conference to allow us to to go all go back home connected to the messenger I mean when I was asked what to speak about in this particular context I wanted to address probably what is the most fundamental element of this but at the same time hopefully leave you with some thought and this will be a little bit different because I actually want to reflect on this from a bit of a personal perspective a connection to the prophet salallahu that we're all trying to forge on a consistent basis can be complicated and not everyone is going to find the same connection to the messenger but there is a level that all of us have to connect with the prophet salallahu with and a particular Dimension and I want to start actually with story that really brings this discussion to a level of our daily connection with Allah with the Quran and it's actually a narration where he mentions that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to visit the woman who held him from the very beginning and Then followed him in his entire through his life until the very last moment that he had on this Earth the woman that was there for him through every single difficult moment through every single episode through every single moment of Victory through every disappointment who followed him in battle who watched him and would look at him with a level of adoration and admiration that is beyond what a mother looks at her child with a woman who when the prophet saws would ask her how are you she would say I am well so long as Islam as well completely committed to his mission who says that in the time Abu Bakr used to visit her as was the Sunnah of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and so Abu Bakr Almar and myself went to visit and I want you to put yourself for a moment in the living room think about yourself as the fourth person and you going to visit on Eamon and imagine walking into that living room and sitting down after the death of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam in that living room and as you say to her may peace and blessings be upon you how are you oh amen and she breaks down crying imagine being in that situation if any of you have ever visited someone who has just lost someone near to them or were visited for just losing someone near to you it's very obvious what those tears represents all types of emotions start to flood and Allah starts to cry is a man of extraordinary emotional intelligence and he's a man of extraordinary wisdom and he's a man whose Hearts subhanallah is connected to the truth to where he recognizes things very quickly but here don't you know that what is with Allah is better for the messenger of Allah you know like a mother with her child wants to know that she sent him off and that he's doing okay don't you know that what Allah is giving him right now is far better than what he had when he was with us the way Allah is loving him right now the way Allah and he always loved him the way that Allah is taking care of this messenger this extraordinary human being it's far better than the Comfort the love the Embrace that we could have given him on this Earth he says that's not why I'm crying I'm not crying because I have any doubt that what is with Allah is better for the messenger of Allah than what we had for him but I'm crying because the revelation of the Quran has ceased to come upon us from the heavens no one loved the prophet saws smile more than his family no one loved his shama the beautiful things that we learn about him his attributes the way that he would laugh the way that he would connect with you the way that he would uplift you no one loved everything about him more than the people that were with him throughout his entire life no one loved them like that more than his family but um understood that that love of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was beyond the love that another human being would have for another human being I could read the shamal of the Mason and subhanallah even if there weren't a Divine connection fall in love with him just because of how he was as a person but the thing that I love most about him is that Allah sent him to me Allah chose him to be the greatest blessing to the rest of his creation a blessing to each and every single one of us a mercy to the worlds that means that he's a mercy to you and he's a mercy to me and the thing that I love most about him is that he is rasulullah he is the messenger of Allah that he is the one that Allah chose to be the vehicle by which he communicated my entire sense of purpose to me he is the vehicle by which Allah chose as a demonstration as a manifestation for everything that makes me beloved to him he is that connection to our Lord at the deepest level and yes we don't make Dua through the prophet saws but who taught us to make Dirham the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam yes we don't have the type of spiritual hierarchy that other Fates and traditions might have where you have to go through but taught us everything that we know about how to connect to Allah and that is the thing that I love most about him that he is the greatest of Allah the greatest slave the greatest servant of Allah and so if I want to Aspire to be a greater ABD of Allah he is the greatest example in that regard when you think about what about his Sunnah what about his person do I want to connect with most and everything about his sunnah's blessed there is nothing from the Sunnah of the Prophet salallahu that should be minimized or diminished but the worship of the Prophet sallallahu the connection that he had to Allah that's what I want to inculcate most into my life from him ask for his characteristics I have only been sent to perfect character there is not a single element or dimension of character or a single dimension of your life personal Family Social that you can't look at the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam that you're on an exalted standard of character that he sets the standards he sets the standard of what it's like to be anything in society now when someone talks about this idea of loving the prophet sallallahu there are a few things that I want to approach this inshallah with number one and I'm going to put this out there as just an equation that I hope inshallah everyone will be able to ponder upon to some extent when we think about the questions that come about faith the questions that arise about how we're supposed to connect to Allah why is this happening why is that happening can you explain this can you explain that if you want your heart to be at peace connect to the names and attributes of Allah and then all the questions about why this and why that and all the questions about different things that happen in life and different things that happen in the world all the dilemmas that are posed about mercy and Justice and cruelty and why this and why that will melt away in knowing who Allah is because you trust Allah it all goes away it all disappears and so the shaytan will not have a means by which he can enter into your heart and poison it in regards to the Affairs of your lord if you know who your lord is it's the names and attributes of Allah connecting to Allah's names and attributes shuts all of those doors and if you start to come across certain texts certain episodes from the Sierra certain misinterpretations certain things in isolation about the messenger of Allah or about the Sharia that the prophet salallahu brought knowing the prophet saws and connecting with him at the level of his miracles and his characteristics his attributes makes all of that go away shuts that second layer of doubts come completely out of your life when you can connect with the prophet salallahu at that level knowing Allah makes questions about Allah irrelevant knowing makes questions about the messenger of Allah irrelevant you have to know him you've got to connect with him on all of those different levels but there is a sequence that we start to find developing in the Quran and the Sunnah about how to start to develop that relationship with him and believe it or not it starts with Allah Praises those that believe in the Unseen now let me ask you a question who is greater us or the companions of the prophet sallallahu it's okay you can answer this question the companions companions are greater than us those that live with the messenger are greater than us but what is a greater act believing in the prophet sallallahu while you can see him or believing in the prophet saws and you've never seen him it's a greater Act to believe in the prophet saws and you've never even seen him has a powerful reflection on the very beginning of when Allah says that the Believers are those who believe in the Unseen for the companions of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam the Unseen literally means that which is missing from you that which you have not encountered that which you have not seen to them the Unseen is Allah to them the Unseen are the Angels to them the Unseen are Jannah paradise and hellfire to them the Unseen are all of those things that are unseen to as well but there's a difference between us and them in one regard here that rasulullah is not included in their but he's included in ours to them they saw him and if you're reading through the Sirah and you're seeing people that were captivated by him in an instant that's because if you saw him you would say I've never seen anything or anyone like that before him or after him you would see him and you would know this is a special man before he even said anything and then when he spoke and then the Miracles started to come and the proof started to come and then his character started to shine then the evidences only became more stacked you know subhanallah the scholars mentioned about the sight of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam that he was the most beautiful of Allah's creation he had the most Jamal the most beauty of Allah's creation but his Beauty was enveloped in his Jalal in his glory what does that mean you know uh we always read about Yusuf the beauty of you and many of the scholars they say that the difference with the beauty of Yusuf is that the prophet sallallahu was given an extra layer of Jalal an extra layer of Glory to where if you were in front of him you'd immediately put your head down because his presence imposed that much of a respect and an honor when you were there and that's why I couldn't describe the prophet saws to you because I couldn't bring myself to actually look at him to stare at him you put your head down because not only was he beautiful but he had a presence that was stunning a glory that he walked with meaning when you saw him it was plausible that the most intelligent of people that the most Discerning of people would immediately come to the conclusion that that's the messenger of Allah a people subhanallah that did not believe in life after death and did not believe in unseen gods right they believed in gods that were made of stone in front of them could suddenly be brought to the conclusion that there is eternal life after death and that there is only one unseen God and all of these Gods mean nothing could have their entire purpose recalibrated and their entire theology adjusted by speaking to the prophet saws one time these are Discerning individuals these are intelligent people but seeing him was different you knew when you saw him you were captivated by him who says the difference is that with us those that came after the companions the prophet saws actually included in our life he's included in our unseen we are expected to believe in him to follow him to connect ourselves to him to love him and we've never even seen him and the person confirms that is the messenger Islam himself no those are the people who come after me they believe in me but they've never even seen me and they would trade everything that's been given to them in this world for the ability to be able to look at me and to be with me they would give it all up never even seen God's hidings to the one who believed in me and he saw me the prophet saws and Glad Tidings to the one who believed in me and he never even saw me what is it that makes you cry when you read about him what is it that makes you feel pain when you read about his pain what is it that makes you feel Joy when you read about his Joy what is it that makes you feel that sense of smallness when his greatness is mentioned and you've never even seen him that act is superior to the act of having seen him and believed in him simultaneously but we will never be superior as a people to those great people that were around him they surpassed us but that act is a blessing from Allah and that's something that Allah Praises you with in the very beginning of the Quran those who believe in the Unseen you've never seen him but you love him that's number one number two because you love the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam first and foremost for the example that he is to you of how to connect to your lord you love him for that reason when Allah says foreign guide us to the path of those who have earned your favor who's at the top of that list it is Muhammad and that it is the prophets and so on so forth and then it is the companions the family and the companions of the Prophet sallallahu may Allah be pleased with them and then it is the pious ones the truthful ones the martyrs what a great companionship that is may Allah allow us to be their companions Allah I mean you're asking Allah you're asking Allah to make you like the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam every single time you reach you're asking Allah to guide you to that path you would not know that path had you not had your prophet sallallahu that's what he means to you and the messenger of Allah continues in a beautiful narration where he says he love Allah for the blessings that he provides to you now you should love Allah for many reasons you should love Allah for who he is subhanahu wa you should love Allah for his names and attributes but subhanallah was sharing this reflection every one of these blessings around you is so that you could love him more and it's a sign of his love for you everything around you every blessing that you have is a sign that Allah loves you and he wants you to love him and to connect with him so love Allah for the blessings that he provides for you subhanallah I want you to think about if someone were to walk up to you in the parking lot right now and to say to you I don't know you and you don't know me and this might seem completely out of the blue but here are the keys to my house and my car they're yours how indebted would you be to that person what would you do if you needed a kidney transplant or a liver transplants or a heart transplant and someone put their own life on the line to donate that to you how indebted would you be to that person for the rest of your life how much would you love that person how much would you cry every time you see that person especially if it worked if the operation was successful but the one who put that heart in that kidney and that liver in you in the first place and created you and originated you and allowed you to function and gave you reward upon reward upon reward upon reward and you don't love him for the blessings that he constantly showers you with blessings that you did not earn but that in his generosity he bestowed upon you love Allah for those blessings and the prophet saws continued love me because of the love of Allah shared a beautiful reflection on this I was cheating I was asking them both before I came in here give me a reflection on this Hadith and I feel uncomfortable not attributing it to them he said the greatest so you have blessings of Allah and then you have the blessing of Allah the greatest blessing of Allah upon you is guidance and that guidance was manifested through the guide but Love Me For the Love of Allah love me because of Allah's love for me you want to connect to Allah love the prophet salallahu love the most beloved creation to the Creator increase your salawats increase your salawat watch how your duas are beautified increase your salawah watch how your life is expanded watch how everything changes in your life through salawat on the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam Love Me For the Love of Allah Allah loves him and that in and of itself would be sufficient of a reason to love him you know who implements this in the best way can anyone tell me who implements this Hadith in the best way which creation of Allah I'm getting I'm giving you all some hints the angels the Angels implement this Hadith beautifully don't they why in Allah when Allah loves someone I love this person so you should love this person loves that person say why what do I what do we know about this person can you tell me about this person so I can love this person as well can you give me some of the descriptions maybe if I hear a few paragraphs about this person maybe if you tell me oh Allah what it is about this person I'll start to love this person as well no just loves that person because Allah loves that person that's enough so all of the inhabitants of the heavens love that person as well puts Acceptance in the hearts of the people for that person the acceptance of the righteous for the righteous what does that mean subhanallah if you've ever seen someone who you feel like is connected to Allah that simple person that comes to Salah or whose eyes dwell up when they hear the name of the messenger or someone who you think exhibits characteristics of someone who's beloved to Allah and you immediately love that person the sign of Iman isn't it it's a sign of tasting the sweetness of Iman that you love someone purely for the sake of Allah do you love rasulullah for the sake of Allah do you love him for the sake of Allah it's sweetness of Iman you start to taste the sweetness of Iman I love rasulullah first and foremost because of how much Allah loves him first thing that I love about him is that he is before his smile before the incredible endearing incidents the between him and our mother before all of the stories with him may Allah be pleased with them before all of that I just love him he's Allah's messenger you know subhanallah some of the scholars said that that is in fact a beautiful connection between the Hadith of where you make a Dua for someone and the angels will say I mean I mean and for you as well and when you send salawat on the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and the angels respond back with so much more because when you send salawat on the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam you are making durat for your most noble brother so it's not just that you're out for anybody else and Allah and the angels respond to you not just be mythical not just with what you sent on him but with so much more because he's not just another one of your brothers he's more than that so Love Me For the Love of Allah and then thirdly the prophet saws and love my family because of my love for them love my family because of my love for them when the prophet saws says about Fatima Fatima is a piece of me subhanallah like she is a piece of me do you love Fatima when the prophet saws and the prophet saws sits on the member holding them now if you were an elderly companion they're really cute kids right I mean somehow the description it's a beautiful description sometimes the Vivid details of a Hadith of the Prophet saws are lost imagine this cute kid running up to the prophet saws of the Prophet saws and he's all dressed up in his jummah turban and he's tripping over his turban I'm tripping over his though falling forward to the prophet saws can't resist him he gets down off the moon but he picks him up and he gives the rest of the Hassan in his lap cute kid beautiful kid that's a piece of the Prophet sallallahu love him love them because the prophet saws love them I love the family of the Prophet saws they're my family the prophet saws to love the ansar is a form of faith if you sent someone beloved to you if you had a child and you sent them to another place and someone said you know what I'm going to pick him up from the airport I'm going to get them all settled I'm going to take care of them I'm going to make sure that everything is as comfortable and convenient for them as possible I'm going to protect them a bullet comes their way I'd stand in front of them that's what the ansar did for the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam I love the answer may Allah reward them for what they did for our beloved ones so when you hear the names of Assad and sad and sad and sad and Beyond love them because they loved your prophet sallallahu and they took care of him so that's one dimension that the prophet saws gives to us and then there's this interesting Hadith which I'm sure all of you have heard the Hadith say that no one of you has perfected their Iman until what can anyone repeat paraphrase is fine who knows this Hadith until what someone can raise their hand and say yes that's one Hadith and it's an authentic Hadith not this one is one and so he loves for his brother he lost for himself but there is another Hadith until I am more beloved to him than his own self family wealth his own self you know um no hypocrite when we read about him because you get what you're looking at the man was as transparent as they come extinguishes between truth and falsehood he's always there all the Allah doesn't even want to be on the same street as him he's an honest man points to this by the way because it's an important point asks the prophet saws something or when he hears something for the messenger his intention is to practice it to perfection right he wants to know exactly what he's hearing so he can apply it exactly as it should be applied so he could have simply walked away from that and said that sounds nice I mean how many people could really say they love the prophet saws and when I guess I love him more than myself but all of the alarm wants to get to Jannah and so that's why when he asked the prophet saws on questions he gets to the details and then he goes home and he practices so the prophet saws because he processed it he thought about the implications I know I love you more than my family I love you more than my wealth but I don't know if I love you more than myself like what are the implications of that now when he went home and thought about it how did um have this transition in his mind and his heart see a lot of people know the beginning and the end of this Hadith but there is a turning point in um introspection in his in his reflecting upon this concept not until I'm more beloved to you than yourself and what does he comes to the conclusion of he says nephe myself sometimes it commands me to do evil the prophet saws always commands me to do good so you know what I love the prophet saws more than I love myself I love him more than I love my Neffs see this wasn't some ambiguous emotional things he's thinking about the Practical implications yes I love rasulullah more than I love my own self and the prophet saws that's the Perfection of faith now I want you to appreciate for a moment that this is in fact that the prophet is closer to the Believers than their own selves Neffs has a quality to itself has a quality in Islam it has attributes it has all sorts of definitions and dimensions and ways by which you tame it it's not an ambiguous Concept in Islam right when Allah says the prophet is closer to the Believers than their own selves explains that what this means is that when your nephs calls you to something [Music] one the prophet saws calls them to something and when their nuffs calls them to something they prefer what the prophet saws calls them to to what the Neffs calls them to that is literally your daily struggle isn't it to resist the urges of the nafs entertainment by connecting it to Allah and the greatest way that you connected to Allah is by making it more like rasulullah when your person starts to become like his personality and so do you love the prophet saws more than yourself I hope so I hope that I love the prophet saws more than myself but there is an implication there see Allah does not leave these Concepts in ambiguity because if you do then you're never going to improve you're never going to actually have a meaningful connection that's why I call it Allah say if you love Allah then follow me and Allah will love you back if you have relegated the names and attributes of Allah that you were taught as a child that you recite to a few scripted duras that you recite robotically to a few things that you read in a book of philosophy the some things that you come across in Ramadan in the Quran then of course you're not going to connect to the names and attributes of Allah until you start to perceive in every single element of your life all of these names and attributes become Hollow to you Salaam if the prophet saws is simply a book that you read or a lecture that you listen to and not someone that you're trying to be like in every single moment of your life and someone who's Sunnah has become the gold standard for you and how you conduct your daily Affairs and of course you're going to feel disconnected from the prophet salallahu loving the prophet saws is not simply something is not simply something that you express something that you live something that you try to embody it's starting to see people the way the prophet saws saw them and it's starting to try to see yourself the way Allah saw his prophet sallallahu it's starting to bring his interaction into every interaction that you have with the creation of Allah and then elevating your worship to the worship that he had of Allah that's what it means to connect to him there are a lot of people that are waiting for something deeply transformative to happen in their relationship with the prophet saws and it's similar in that sense to this miraculous moment you're waiting with Allah to bring you back to him a lot of people wait for this transformative moment where the light shines on you and suddenly it all comes together and now I'm going to connect with Allah after this deeply transformative moments and so many people might be thinking like I'm waiting to see the prophet saws in a dream if I see the prophet saws in a dream then it's going to be easier to connect to him one of my teachers said something that stuck with me for a long time and I'll tell you by the way that it was because I went to him complaining that I hadn't seen the prophet saws in a dream I was so upset I was so upset that I hadn't seen the prophet salallahu this is an interaction by the way I want to say exactly 15 years ago it actually complains I'm like you know I'll feel such a connection I could have sworn the first time I went to had some when you're in Madina and you pass by the prophet saws for the first time it's like this is it I'm gonna see rasulullah in a dream when I seen a YouTube video or at that time it was a Google video prior to YouTube or something was was giving a pretty in my opinion a very reductionist take on how you see the prophet saws in a dream so I was really upset with myself honestly I was like I feel like I love him I really want to see him I really want to see him and it is a gift to see him in a dream it is a gift for sure beautiful come to life in front of you you can see him in a dream allow us to see him in this Dunya before the next before the akhiran to see him day and nights and then I mean you know he said something to me subhanallah he said that you know it's interesting that I know of people that saw the prophet saws in a dream that were barely practicing Muslims and that became the means by which Allah brought them back to him and I know of people that memorize al-bukhari and Muslim and have the highest the highest of every collection that read about the prophet saws that manifest him day and night and that appeared to be the most righteous people and they'll tell you they never saw him in a dream and that's just another from Allah perhaps Allah wants the one who is longing to keep longing and perhaps Allah wants to transform the one who's not longing at all think about that change my perspective it really did perhaps Allah wants that 75 year old 80 year old Sheikh who's been teaching about the prophet salallahu loves him and who Longs for him and who's been waiting for that sight of the messenger of Allah to keep longing and perhaps Allah wants to transform that 17 year old and bring him back and give him something transformative and transformative in that way but in reality Allah has given us enough about the messenger of Allah to long for him to want to be with him to want to be like him if you are struggling to love the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam first and foremost Define what love is that means that when he calls you to something and your snuffs calls you to something else then you follow the direction and the instruction of the Prophet saws by the way very simple things subhanallah when you say something like it's just a Sunnah it's just a Sunnah I want you to think about how detrimental that is spiritually right no everything that he was I want to be and I'm not going to diminish any element of that entire profile of the most beloved creation of Allah how many people have walked the face of this Earth how many billions and billions and billions and billions of people to be that one sallallahu alaihi wasallam who Allah loves the most that's what I'm going to aim for and you know subhanallah there is a saying that the sahaba are like the stars right and I want to reiterate this aim for the Moon and if you can't get there then inshallah you'll at least find yourself amongst the Stars aim for the moons the sahaba all give you a deeply personal experience with the prophet saws people ask me why I don't teach Sirah and I teach the first I go through the sahaba one by one you know what I love about learning about the sahaba it's like getting reintroduced to the prophet saws through every one of their stories over and over and over and over and over and over again it's like that point in the story that you're reading and you're like where is the moment because I want to reintroduce him into my life every single day until Allah introduces me to him on that final day and allows me and you to be his Perpetual Neighbors may Allah put in us that true sincere love of the messenger that transforms every element of Our Lives May Allah forgive us for our shortcomings and not let those shortcomings manifest themselves in a barrier between us and the messenger of Allah may Allah make us amongst those who dwell under his throne with his beloved ones foreign" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="with the hunt for the fugitive gathering pace the man in question was desperate for a deal as jolo's phone calls to the malaysian government continued he turned on one mdb's partners in the middle eastern capital abu dhabi i'm still very very close to abu dhabi they are most concerned about the because i think that's something they believe is tougher to manage massive kickbacks flowed from a deal jolo brokered between one mdb and an abu dhabi government investment fund chaired by sheikh mansour the brother of the crown prince in 2012 the abu dhabi fund guaranteed 1mdb bonds of the 6.5 billion dollars raised more than 2.5 billion was siphoned to offshore companies for the personal benefit of jolo najib his family and abu dhabi officials abu dhabi they have admitted to they have admitted to nothing but when jolo unleashed on abu dhabi he claimed complicity and corruption at the highest level the reality is people did take money the discussion that i left off with them is is look whatever i settle with the doj that is used to pay 1mdb bonds you all should match the same amount which is probably close to a billion dollars their position has been looked as abu dhabi inc we're not going to do that so i think they're managing that quite carefully recent u.s department of justice court filings reveal the 700 million mega yacht that jolo rented to show rosmah her pink diamond was owned by a company controlled by none other than sheikh mansour and had been bought in part with 1mdb money the abu dhabi royal and united arab emirates deputy prime minister did not reply to our questions about receiving 1mdb funds i've actually asked the current malaysian government to actually pursue the matter because approximately 160 million dollars of 1mdb money was used to pay for the past the huge mega yacht that part of our money should be returned to malaysia [Music] it's about how each deal changes a community a country and a world by 2016 china was about to become entwined in the 1mdb global financial scam jolo's investment company jinwal capital in hong kong and another business consulting firm in shanghai gave him a strong base in the communist state the last we know where he is he was in china we knew that he was negotiating with the companies involved in one of the mega projects in malaysia with jolo's help najib's government fast track contracts with giant state-owned companies including china communication construction company or cccc for massive infrastructure projects worth more than 30 billion dollars the highlight across country railway we have always claimed even before we won government that the contracts were inflated double the actual value of the project where the excess would then go towards various needs including paying for 1mdb debts as well as perhaps some pocket money for jolo i'm not it going to think the initial idea was you know there was some intent that at least uh if local contractors made like a substantial margin then you know a portion of their profit could be used to acquire certain assets but keeping the money trail hidden from growing international investigations proved a challenge back in 2016. again jolo turned to his friends in the middle east this time in kuwait enlisting the help of sheikh sabah jabba mubarak al-sabah a member of the royal family and son of the country's then prime minister and promoted an eight billion dollar joint venture between the gulf state and china seemingly as a smoke screen to channel excess money from inflated chinese contracts in malaysia from 2016 to 2017 hong kong subsidiaries of the chinese conglomerate cccc transferred more than 1.2 billion dollars into company accounts controlled by shakespeare almost 50 million dollars of this was used to pay for jolo's mounting legal fees and maintaining his assets so so he has had these pockets of funds being transferred and parked in various entities across the world paying money on his behalf to allow him to continue to to have a global presence without being found then more than 600 million dollars were siphoned through a maze of shakespeare's personal and company accounts back to 1mdb to pay off a fraction of its debt now standing at a massive 15 billion dollars [Music] neither cccc nor sheikh zabar responded to allegations of their involvement in the 1mdb scandal [Music] in his 2018 conversations with the malaysian government jolo was very careful not to implicate either kuwait or china in his backdoor scheme to repay 1mdb debts in fact he appeared to be acting in the interest of china i think the east coast railing is the most important it was like presidency's biggest one the one rook program in asia but i think the chinese position is i understand that the current government may need to adjust pricing and so on so forth but i'm but the fugitive was perhaps well placed to understand china's concerns he was still operating businesses there and said he was calling from there you know i'm not sure i guess what the concern is you know with respect to hong kong and macau whether it's because it's a china thing you all don't feel comfortable you know with uh meeting these locations that's you know my question today as it relates to jolo is if he is indeed in china what's in it for them [Music] china might have got involved in some of jolo's schemes and might very well be protecting him because of information he now has about their participation china is a signer on uncac the u.n convention against corruption and yet they completely ignore the rules interpol has placed a red notice for jolo to be arrested the united states has a warrant for his arrest the u.n convention against corruption should have some penalty by the end of may 2018 jolo was feeling the heat and he wanted malaysia to know it he warned their negotiations for the speedy return of assets was seriously in jeopardy one thing to consider and this is for you to report after the leadership too okay yeah yes the longer we take the more difficult it becomes what's in the u.s criminal suit any negotiation you know is going to be very challenging yeah and he claimed he was starting to feel pressure from najib's camp najib's youngest son ashman who was on the mega yacht in 2009 as the first 1mdb scam was being planned was barraging him with text messages at 11 30 am he just sends me a message don't trust anyone from the other side a deal will be proposed but it's a trick the former prime minister's u.s legal team was also unsettling him pian's lawyer he talks to my u.s lawyer very very often now we don't fully trust them but we think their information is accurate najib's u.s legal team was also acting for his stepson having received some 248 million dollars from one mdb risa aziz spent it on high-end real estate and kick-starting a movie career producing the hollywood blockbuster wolf of wall street was all this legal absolutely not like jolo he now faced civil forfeiture cases in the us and will become the subject of a criminal investigation we think that in an effort to get rizza off the hook and potentially the prime minister and first lady of the book we have been crafting this narrative trying to build the blame on me jolo also claims najib's u.s lawyers which included a former attorney general john ashcroft were furiously lobbying congressmen and even the cia it's getting me very worried because the more active they come i'm just worried it gets way more complicated for everyone i'm always disappointed when a former attorney general or someone else is knowingly representing a foreign kleptocrat but as far as what jolo is saying [Music] i can tell you even though millions are spent on lobbying efforts i don't see that they're successful but where those minions were coming from was clearly irritating jolo i think the important one to find out is actually who is cunning their legal bills because i can tell you from someone that is facing all these things they cost a lot of money so i think if the [ __ ] source is chopped off you know [Music] lobbying campaign went beyond the us pushing authorities in the uk to investigate mahathir's global assets they refuse to tell us who but there's a very influential british individual who has been in touch directly with the british prime minister the same british individual has met the number three person at scotland yard and they discussed potential special operations being conducted to gather data on the market and global assets but back in malaysia mahathir and his government seemed unperturbed we haven't made no deals with criminals now actively in pursuit of jolo they issued an arrest warrant and interpol red notice against him and when the fugitive next called he'd aborted a meeting in macau with malaysia's 1mdb investigators but i told them yesterday he claimed he'd been forced to flee from his safe haven in china to the united arab emirates because of the whole you know war of arrests and you know effectively basically the uae folks just didn't think it was safe so i've just gotten into dubai the reality is you know uh i'm in the uae they are like ultra paranoid now so i think it's going to be challenging for me to get any clearance to me having seemingly dodged malaysian authorities he was now suggesting he'd merely borrowed money from one mdb i don't believe there's any wrongdoing but you know irrespective of that all these ultimately world loans [Music] without you know being prosecuted i mean it starts out with like there was no wrongdoing if there were no wrongdoing people wouldn't be giving back the assets right there would be no assets to be seized i mean it's comical it's like if i keep saying the lie maybe somebody will believe me [Music] mahathir's administration definitely wasn't buying it it's only fair that everyone's everything [Music] okay it's very unlikely that the interested party yourself in particular will be dissolved from any further action it's very unlikely because the public will not accept that i'm sure you are very well aware because in malaysia we do not have plea bargain yeah okay okay no in malaysia no no the bad news got worse for jolo days later his malaysian passport was cancelled so too was the sinkits passport he bought in 2011 but unbeknown to authorities he still had others including a cypriot passport soon came a call from his lawyer robin rathmaul from the global firm cobrand kim [Music] joe provided you guys with a potential way forward with a holistic settlement and there were various offers to meet with joe our biggest piece of leverage right now is that you don't have joe so we can't proceed with this unless we are satisfied that on your side the good faith is that you're not using this whole whole thing is really just a if you like a smoke screen to try and arrest joe and the discussions became even more tense are you maintaining the position that there is no situation in which [Music] okay robin i'm sure you know for the fact he cannot walk away yeah he cannot walk away either he's going for a long time or slightly less that's only his two options yeah okay well that's very clear i mean look obviously i would say to that at the moment [Music] most jurisdictions are are not even going to listen to to that sort of bargain at least here in the united states you know we we basically do not bargain with fugitives the fugitives legal representatives are well paid for their advice in late 2019 alone cobrae and kim received more than 1.5 million dollars from the kuwait royal sheikh sabah for legal and pr services for jolo just eight months later sheikh zabar was arrested for his suspected involvement in the 1mdb scam even with the law firm i mean you don't have a complete anonymity to not know the source of the funds that you're being paid because ultimately if the law firm is knowingly taking in that money and then using those funds to hire the pr firm my next question would be are they guilty of money laundering you know because they're they're making it appear like legitimate funds when we put the former fbi agent's question to cobra and kim the firm didn't respond in early august 2018 jolo's equanimity was the first asset returned to malaysia malaysian police have filed the first set of criminal charges against jolo the next few weeks and months would see jolo charged with money laundering and bribery in both malaysia and the us najib who was facing more than 40 criminal charges was bolstered his new defense he'd been scammed by jolo it's just ridiculous i mean you know any simple person that looks at the facts is going to be able to tell what exactly happened so don't try and start you know telling telling everyone that you know you don't know anything which is absurd the last jolo recording is from late november 2018. once again he promised a complete list of all the assets bought with 1mdb money i can do something up in terms of better depth on the but he never delivered and the man who stole billions claimed he was struggling to be honest like it's a very different situation i think you know when we last spoke i think you know it's quite stressful you know because you know we kind of pay our legal fees it's racking up and you know we don't want this issue to drag on i think the malaysian government is the military government so so at the end of the day hopefully like many many years leave that you know it would be safe for us to go back to malaysia so i think you know ultimately we don't want to be seen as you know doing anything that is bad for malaysia less than 18 months after this final call mahathir's coalition government collapsed leaving open the possibility of najib and his cronies returning to power for jolo i'm sure his long-term thought is maybe the people that were involved in this scheme with him will once again become in a position of power and he'll be able to go home and not face prosecution there and not face the risk of being extradited to the united states but for now jolo remains on the run and on the move despite arrest warrants and interpol red notices in september 2019 he reportedly flew to kuwait then two months later we can confirm he traveled again this time on a previously undisclosed passport from the caribbean nation of granada aboard a gulfstream leader jet he flew from bangkok to dubai stopping for three days in india's ahmedabad on the way when and how he entered thailand is unknown the only way that can happen is through extremely high level government assistance from you know hunting for one individual if they do have the full resources of one or more governments to assist them on maintaining their their status as a fugitive it's difficult you know it can be difficult to get them but not impossible malaysian police accused china of harboring the fugitive and obstructing his arrest [Music] the communist superpower strongly denies it's protecting him but sources in both malaysia and macau have confirmed that jolo has been residing in a macau villa owned by a high-ranking chinese party official and businessman since at least february 2018. he still finds himself in a position where he's useful to certain people in positions of power whether that's strictly money or if it's continued contacts but all of that usefulness is perishable and he's a he's a pretty young man so uh he's got a long way to go to keep himself useful malaysian and united states authorities are still actively in pursuit of the fugitive i'm pretty sure that people who don't want to be incriminated would want him out of the country but we want him back the people of malaysia want him back in malaysia to face justice" />

Plus, remembering the longest Day veterans gather in France on the 81st anniversary of the D-Day landing in World War two. These stories and more tonight. &gt;&gt; From EWTN Global Catholic Network. This is EWTN News Nightly. &gt;&gt; Thank you for being with us tonight. Our top story. We are closing in on one month since Pope Leo the 14th began his pontificate. The last several weeks have seen joy, celebration and hope during this new moment for the church. The first pope from the U.S. First appeared on the loggia of Saint Peter's Basilica back on May 8th, following his election during the conclave. Since then, the Holy Father has been carrying out. His papal duties as he begins his pontificate, providing some early clues along the way to what his ministry will look like. Joining us now to discuss this some more is EWTN news vice president and editorial director, as well as the author of the new book, Leo The 14th Portrait of the First American Pope. Doctor Bunson, thank you so much for being here. &gt;&gt; Privileged to be with you. &gt;&gt; Nearly a month into this papacy. What has stood out to you the most? &gt;&gt; Well, first, it's almost astounding that it's a month into this papacy, right? We were all there in the square of Saint Peter, and we witnessed his election. And now here we are weeks later. But I think we can look at this from two directions. The first is from the Pope himself. He has settled into this pontificate with such remarkable ease and grace. But the word I would use is encounter. He has really been very deliberate in the way he's having encounters with the faithful of Rome, whose bishop he now is. He went to, for example, the Saint John Lateran, and was on the loggia there and had this encounter with them. So he's really been reaching out to the world. The other way of looking at it is how the world has reacted to Leo, right? We looked at the astounding numbers of his page at Pontifex on X. I think it's now at almost 19 million followers. Yeah, just truly remarkable numbers. So it's not a honeymoon. It is a fact that this encounter on the part of Pope Leo reaching out to the world and the world is very much responding, and you can see that with the enthusiasm of the crowds. Yes, he's a new pope. Yes. You're going to have that natural enthusiasm. But there is something very winning, something very authentic about him that we saw on that first day on May 8th. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. We're seeing that enthusiasm, and we've heard a few of the homilies at this point, including a very powerful, powerful message on marriage and the family just last weekend. What have you noticed in his speaking style so far? &gt;&gt; He's speaking style is very easy in the sense that he's very relaxed in his delivery. He's comfortable joking in multiple languages, which is itself impressive. His general audiences are notable because he does this. The summary in English, in English by himself. So there's that. So there's more of that direct connection with English speakers around the world. But there's also in him, as I was saying, this ease. It's a testament, I think, to the fact that as a missionary, he is adaptable to so many different circumstances. And but he's also able to adapt himself to the situation in which he finds himself. &gt;&gt; And let's talk about appointments. He has made several appointments in the last few weeks, some at the Vatican and some of the diocese's right here in the U.S. What do you take away from these selections? What can you tell us about this? &gt;&gt; Well, the first is that he seems to be very focused on there's a classic term in Catholic social teaching, subsidiarity of keeping things sort of local. So, for example, we saw him promote an auxiliary bishop in San Diego to that see, in succession to Cardinal Robert McElroy, who was moved to Washington before the passing of Pope Francis. He has done a very similar thing in Thibodaux in Louisiana. He's promoted from within in Newark, and even in some of his Vatican appointments, he sort of stuck with this structure that exists. For example, his recent appointment of Monsignor Renzo Pecoraro to succeed the somewhat controversial Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia as head of the Pontifical Academy for life. He was chancellor there for a number of years, appointed by Pope Benedict XVI. So Leo, for the moment at least, is sort of promoting from within, but relying on that local experience. &gt;&gt; Sure. A lot to pay attention to. Doctor Matthew Bunson, thank you for that. We'll be coming to you for the latest on Leo as we move along in this papacy. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Let's keep praying for our new Holy Father. &gt;&gt; Let's do it. Coming up later in the newscast, we learn more about how Pope Leo's background in math could influence his pontificate. The social media feud between President Donald Trump and billionaire businessman Elon Musk could have wider implications. Musk worked side by side with the president to cut government waste and abuse, but their fallout threatens key government programs. White House correspondent Oan Jensen begins our team coverage. &gt;&gt; Own mark on this Friday. It's not clear tonight where their relationship stands. They're being urged to make peace now. Musk has been critical of the big beautiful Bill and their social media spat even nearly rocketed into space. President Donald Trump today waved to reporters while on his way to Marine One, headed to new Jersey. Although President Trump recently praised Elon Musk in the Oval Office for his controversial cost cutting measures across government. &gt;&gt; Elon gave an incredible service. Nobody like him. &gt;&gt; The two started fighting over future funding and spending. President Trump writing the easiest way to save money in our budget billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts. That would include the money spent on Musk's rocket company. SpaceX used to take astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station for NASA. Musk responded by saying SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately. But Musk later accepted online advice to cool off and take a step back, posting he wouldn't withdraw the Dragon capsule back on Earth. The Wall Street Journal reporting that Tesla vehicle President Trump bought earlier this year. He now may sell it or give it away, and asked whether the social media falling out will impact Doge efforts in the future. Peter Navarro, the president's trade adviser, told reporters. &gt;&gt; No, no, look. &gt;&gt; Waste, fraud and abuse, unfortunately, is alive and well in America. And the Doge folks here, they're good folks. &gt;&gt; Navarro, who was once ridiculed by Musk, did not want to answer multiple questions about him. As for Musk's departure. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm not glad. Or whatever it's people come and go from the white House. He was a special government employee with an expiration date. &gt;&gt; Now, President Trump spoke out on network TV, saying he's not particularly interested in speaking with Musk at the moment, and repeated his claim that Musk has lost his mind at the white House. Owen Jensen, EWTN News Nightly. &gt;&gt; Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Republican leadership is trying to present a united front amid the feud between President Trump and Elon Musk. Could it impact getting the one big, beautiful bill across the finish line? Let's check in with Capitol Hill correspondent Erik Rosales with the latest Erik. &gt;&gt; Hey good afternoon Mark. Good evening. Republicans certainly didn't need this headache. Even House speaker Mike Johnson is involved trying to douse the political flames. He called Elon Musk several times yesterday, but says the billionaire never picked up. Instead, Musk returned political fire not by phone. But as Owen mentioned during his own communication platform. Now, Republican Leader Steve Scalise tells me it's nothing more than a temporary distraction. &gt;&gt; It's unfortunate, but I think a lot of people said they knew it was inevitable, you know, and here we are. I mean, it's going to play out. But look, Donald Trump has got a strong vision for the country. He was elected to deliver on all these things that he's doing. &gt;&gt; Other Republicans are also downplaying the spat. &gt;&gt; You know, they're having a lover's quarrel. They can work it out. Do you think they can work it out with no problem. We'll see it, won't we? Stay tuned. &gt;&gt; Democrats are using this as a political platform, saying the one big beautiful bill is on shaky ground. &gt;&gt; They're going to have some issues. I think the likelihood of it passing drops, but it doesn't mean it won't pass. I think it might look kind of different, but time will tell how much of an impact it will have. It doesn't help. &gt;&gt; The fact of the matter is, too much ego and too small space, and that makes things difficult. &gt;&gt; Amid the back and forth, some lawmakers say Musk and Trump are misusing their influence. &gt;&gt; They both have taken such extreme positions. And, you know, these they're men of great power that have tried to use that power not for the good of the people, but for their own selfish interests. And of course, when that happens, things explode. &gt;&gt; But most Senate Republicans remain optimistic. They plan to make significant changes to the bill starting next week. &gt;&gt; President Trump has the biggest platform on Earth, and the platform that he's advocating for is to prevent that $4 trillion tax increase to fund our military, secure our border, and strengthen Medicaid. &gt;&gt; While Democrats say this is more likely a reality TV show. &gt;&gt; It's definitely made for Bravo. I mean, this is like The Real Housewives of Foggy Bottom. I mean, it definitely is. It's the reunion show. I mean, Andy, Andy Cohen, if you're listening, you got to produce this reunion show. The seating chart of it, like where Stephen Miller is going to be seated, like it's going to be fascinating. &gt;&gt; That would make an interesting show. Well, another thing to consider, if the feud does consider what a continue that is. What effect could it have on the midterm elections later this year? Elon Musk has given millions of dollars to the Republican Party for numerous races, and recently he's pinned a new post on his ex asking if it's time to create a new political party, one that will, quote, actually represent the 80% in the middle. So the saga continues. Mark back to you. &gt;&gt; President Trump isn't just lashing out at Elon Musk over social media after today's jobs report pointed to a weakening labor market. Trump intensified his attacks on the head of the Federal Reserve, calling for interest rates to be slashed by a full point. Posting on Truth Social too late at the fed is a disaster. Europe has had ten rate cuts. We have had none. Despite him, our country is doing great. Go for a full point. Rocket fuel. According to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Economy added 139,000 jobs in May, compared with a downwardly revised 149,000 post in April. Despite the better than expected May figure, economists say revisions to prior data suggest job growth has shifted to the lower trajectory. Several are dead and dozens injured following a massive Russian air attack on Kyiv. Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky says Russia used more than 400 missiles and 40 drones in the attack. The barrage was one of the fiercest of the war and lasted several hours. The strike comes just days after the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, told President Trump he would have to retaliate for Ukraine's attack on Russian airfields. A solemn day in Normandy, France, as tens of thousands of people gather for the 81st anniversary of the landings at D-Day. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth lays a memorial wreath at the cemetery for American soldiers. A service at a nearby Catholic cathedral remembered the more than 4000 Allied troops killed on June 6th, 1944. The invasion helped turn the tide of World War Two and the defeat of Nazi Germany. We have a lot more still to come on EWTN News Nightly, including the church in the modern age. It is a top priority for the Pope, warning the world of the AI threat. Find out how the bishops of Maryland are helping him spread the word. And while enrollment in Catholic schools declines nationwide, one state remains the outlier. Find out what's behind the numbers. atholic bishops have issued a pastoral letter addressing the ethical implications of artificial intelligence. In it, they write, as AI technologies transform our lives, workplaces, relationships, and even our sense of identity, the church must be a prophetic voice calling the world to place the human person made in the image of God, at the heart of this transformation. Ginny Kraska is the executive director of the Maryland Catholic Conference. She explained to EWTN why the bishops tied the release of the letter to the Feast of Pentecost, which is this Sunday, June 8th. &gt;&gt; The Feast of Pentecost really symbolizes the church being empowered to go out and spread the gospel message in every language and every time and every culture. And that is what we are being asked to do right now. When it comes to AI. AI is basically this, this new language that we're being asked to interpret. And the church should and must have a role in interpreting what AI will look like and how it will be used in a in a way that is just and compassionate and really keeps us at the center of it. The respect for human dignity. &gt;&gt; Pope Leo the 14th has made curtailing the risk of runaway AI a defining mission of his pontificate. &gt;&gt; In our own day, the church offers to everyone a treasury of her social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defense of human dignity, justice, and labor. &gt;&gt; Switching gears, a pro-lifer in Belgium has been released after she was arrested yesterday for displaying a sign speaking out against the transgender movement. &gt;&gt; Because a man was harassing and following Lois everywhere she went, trying to stop us from filming. The police have now arrived. &gt;&gt; Lois McClatchy Miller was featured yesterday in a video on social media. In it, she and a friend are surrounded by police as she displayed a sign that reads children are never born in the wrong body. More than 1 million people viewed the video. Her husband, also a prominent pro-lifer, says this is a further indication of a lack of free speech in Europe. &gt;&gt; I would say to Europe, wake up, because this is really happening. And I would say to America that you have a really profound role as a country that really can have an influence if you really care for Europe and care for its people, you will take the sort of action necessary to make sure that we can preserve our basic freedoms. And that would involve things like sanctioning the politicians involved, sanctioning the authorities involved, and taking action really just to ensure that there is no chance that anything like this could ever happen again. &gt;&gt; Calum Miller also said his wife and the other pro-life advocate were initially charged with disturbing the peace. The last decade has unfortunately seen a decline in Catholic school enrollment in the U.S, however, one state remains an outlier. A new report by Step Up for students shows Florida is leading the way on Catholic school enrollment, while enrollment is down 13.2% nationally over the last decade, it is up 12.1% in Florida over the same span. More recent upticks come after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law, a measure which makes every student in the state eligible for a state supported choice scholarship. Joining us to break down these numbers some more is Tommy Schultz, CEO of the American Federation for children. Tommy, thanks for joining us. What stands out to you most when you look at these numbers from Florida? &gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Mark. Yeah, the numbers in Florida are staggering. And what stands out the most is that good politics, good policy that yields good results for students at the end of the day, like you mentioned nationwide, 13% decrease in the last ten years with Catholic school enrollment. Yet Florida, they've been pushing pedal to the metal school choice expansions for basically two decades. And governor DeSantis signed into law the big expansion that made every single family eligible for school choice funding in the state. And guess what? Florida is up 12%. Basically, ten years ago you had about 82,000 kids, and now in Florida, there's 92,000 kids enrolled in these programs. And it couldn't come at a better time to have this data that just was published, because Congress right now is debating as part of the big, beautiful bill negotiations, inserting school choice legislation into that piece of into the law such that all 50 states could have school choice. So when you see places like New York, 31% drop in Catholic school enrollment, Pennsylvania, 23% drop, Illinois 20% drop. You know, all these places that have had huge drops in Catholic school enrollment, partly due to government regulation, partly due to challenging financial dynamics, federal law that could get passed as part of the big beautiful bill here, maybe in the next month, could actually be a game changer. We could see Florida like trends in the rest of the country. &gt;&gt; Well, what kind of role could choice scholarships play in assisting Catholic school enrollment nationwide? &gt;&gt; Well, basically, like in Florida, you're eligible for about $8,000 per kid per year with state funding, essentially. So rather than your all of your taxpayer funds going into the public system, now, all parents just fully control their funding and for education in Florida. So if Congress passes a piece of federal legislation that says families will be able to control their child's education funding through a tax credit donation mechanism, that's going to be an absolute game changer for millions of families, particularly in places like New York or Illinois, that have had these 30 and 20% drops in Catholic school enrollment. So all of these Catholic schools that are obviously doing a lot of fundraising, and they're relying upon a lot of Catholic Charities to support students, particularly lower income students, middle income students. Now, we're every family could be theoretically able to control their child's education funding like we see in Florida, like we see in Arizona and other places. That is just a total game changer for families, and it could bring a lot of children out of poverty. &gt;&gt; Catholic parents and so many others are interested in this topic. Tommy Schultz, thank you so much for being with us. &gt;&gt; Thanks for having me. &gt;&gt; Up next on EWTN News Nightly. It's all coming together. Best selling author Rick Warren weighs in on the relationship between evangelicals and Catholics. Plus, a great addition. Learn more about Pope Leo and his background in mathematics. says Christian unity will be a major theme of his pontificate. Others are discussing this topic as well. A recent conference outside Rome focused on evangelization, and began the dialog toward the year 2033, which will mark 2000 years since the death and resurrection of Jesus. The non-Catholic speakers included the author of the best selling book, The Purpose Driven Life, EWTN Vatican bureau chief Andreas Donhauser has more from Pastor Rick Warren. &gt;&gt; Maybe you can tell us a little about why are you speaking at a Catholic conference about evangelization? &gt;&gt; Because no single denomination can complete the Great Commission on their own. There are 2.5 billion people in the world who claim to believe in Jesus Christ. Now, that doesn't mean that they are walking with him. They're, you know, working with him on a regular basis. But if you were to say, do you believe in the Trinity, father, son, Holy Spirit, oh, yeah. Do you believe Jesus is who he said he was? The Son of God? Yes. Do you believe he died on the cross for our sins and rose again? Yes. Do you believe he sent the Holy Spirit to start the church? Yes. Well, you're not a muslim. You're not a Hindu. You're not a Buddhist. Of the 2.5 billion people who follow Jesus in the world, they're not Muslims, okay? 1.3 billion are Catholic. Okay. So it's an enormous it's about half of the Christian church are Catholic. And so this is what I call the sleeping giant. &gt;&gt; But 2033 what is the objective there. &gt;&gt; On Pentecost Sunday, June 5th, 2033? That will be the 2,000th birthday of Christianity. It's the 2,000th birthday of the church. 2000 celebration of the resurrection. And so all around the world, Christians, every different tribe, for now, for probably about a decade, have been thinking, how are we going to celebrate the 200th birthday of Christ's Church, the body of Christ on earth? &gt;&gt; But don't you also find a lot of concern that people say, oh, you evangelicals, you just want to take over the Catholics or, oh, the Catholics, they just want to take us over or. &gt;&gt; No, it doesn't have any. It doesn't have anything to do with that. We're never gonna in John 17, which is Jesus last prayer before he goes to the cross. He's in the Garden of Gethsemane the night before he goes to the cross. And he is great prayer. There is the prayer for unity. It is still the unanswered prayer. Jesus. Twice in that passage, Jesus prayed, father, I pray that talking about his his followers, they will be one so that the world may know. And two verses later he says, I pray that they will be one, so that the world may believe the purpose for unity first. It's never we're never going to have cultural unity. We're never going to have structural unity. I don't even I think there's value. It takes all kinds of churches to reach all kinds of people. We're never going to have unity in doctrine, but we can all agree on one thing every Christian understands we're called to go. &gt;&gt; And so it's possible to pray together. I saw you praying with Archbishop Sinkiewicz with with other leaders of other churches. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And I pray with anybody who believes Jesus Christ is the Lord of my life. And these are brothers and sisters in Christ. &gt;&gt; We are in the jubilee of hope. We are. Francis called that out. What is your hope for this year but also towards 2033? &gt;&gt; Well, hope is the most important thing that we need. It's the last thing to lose. When you lose hope, it's over. And. And so what the world needs now is hope. Francis called it twice. He called it when we did the Year of Mercy. Remember when we did the Year of Mercy? Our church did the Year of Mercy? We're not a Catholic church, but we did the Year of Mercy. I thought, this is a great theme for the year. &gt;&gt; Pastor Rick, thank you so much for being with us, and thank you for your testimony. &gt;&gt; It's an honor, and I will just say we love EWTN. It's been a great ministry in my life. And I'll give you a personal testimony that when I lost a son, let's see, that would be now 12 years ago, 2013. He struggled his entire life with mental illness and in a fit of depression, he took his life and it was the worst day of my life. One of the things that helped me through was on EWTN. They were playing the Chaplet of Divine Mercy and the Chaplet of Divine Mercy ministered to me and to my wife. And just doing that, it was a healing balm in my heart. And so thank you, EWTN for all you're doing. &gt;&gt; Thank you for viewing. We know Pope Leo the 14th is a man of many firsts. First U.S born pope, first to hold Peruvian citizenship and the first from the Order of Saint Augustine. But there is one more first you can add to the list. During his studies at Villanova University, the Holy Father majored in mathematics, and he may be the first pope to have done it. While he did go on to study canon law, some excited Catholics are referring to him with a mathematical term of endearment Pope Pi EWTN News Eric Rosales sat down with the mathematician to learn more. &gt;&gt; And joining us now is Brad Jolley, who majored in mathematics and has even developed activities for Catholic students in Uganda. Brad, we're delighted to have you. First off, let's talk about the papacy and mathematics. It's not a connection that a lot of people make there, but there is a strong connection now with this Pope. And can you explain? &gt;&gt; Well, it's a pleasure to be with you, Eric. And I don't think that a pope necessarily has to be a mathematician, but I do think that a background in math can be very helpful to a pope, or really anybody who's trying to understand God. There's this misperception. Well, there's a misperception out there that math is only for practical purposes. And while you certainly can use math for engineering and architecture and science and medicine and other things that really contribute to human flourishing, there's so much more than that. I think a proper math education should also focus on the infinite, the good, the true and the beautiful, all of which can really draw us closer to God. And I know that my own understanding of physics and math was important in my conversion to the church. &gt;&gt; Oh, beautiful. Well, we'll get into that. Yeah, but I got to tell you, when you when you can't solve a math problem, you kind of look for other theories and things like that. A lot of rigor in math. And what do you think that this will help in the Pope's work, the Holy Father's work? &gt;&gt; Well, you know, I hesitate to make predictions, right? But my hope is that the Holy Father will use his math mindset and his ability to reason abstractly about whole sets of issues. And if you reason abstractly, you can often address many problems at once with very deep principles. So if the Pope can distill and communicate these deep principles in a way that really properly clarifies existing church teaching, I think that will bring badly, badly needed clarity to the faithful. &gt;&gt; Is that what helped yourself in coming to the Catholic faith? &gt;&gt; It really was. A lot of times people. They lay out objections to the to the faith. And I know I certainly did that. But when you understand things at a deep level, the objections really sort of fall away. &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of people shy away from math, my myself included. That's why I was a communication major. But no doubt it had a lot of bad memories, but a lot of therapy there. But how would you encourage them who are having trouble with math today? &gt;&gt; If you believe that the whole purpose of math is just to solve practical problems, you end up with what we have today. But if you believe that math education should be a response to the commands of Christ, that we're to love the Lord our God, our God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength and love our neighbor as ourself. Then you get a very different and more joyful and beautiful way to do math education. &gt;&gt; Well, Brad Jolley, thank you so much for joining us. &gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Eric. &gt;&gt; It all adds up, doesn't it? Well, we thank you for watching tonight. Remember, you can follow us on social media, Facebook and Instagram at News Nightly I'm Mark irons. Good night and God bless." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="this week on Christian World News in the shadow of Islamic terror groups like Boo Haram and ISIS Christian missionaries shine the light of the gospel see how they're reshaping the spiritual landscape in one of the most dangerous places on earth plus from the war torn streets of Beirut to the critically acclaimed set of The Chosen actor Nick Shakur tells CBN News how The Hand of God was with him the entire time and it was one of the largest church breakups in American history 3 years after the split that rocked the Methodist church we look at the fallout on both sides hello everyone welcome to this week's edition of Christian World News i'm George Thomas and I'm Wendy Griffith in one of the most dangerous regions on Earth an American missionary is quietly building an army not with weapons but with prayer you are going to meet an incredible woman her name is Carol Ward and she has made it her mission to obey God and train fearless believers on the African continent here's my report from the southern edge of the Sahara Desert the Sahel region of Africa isn't the kind of place you just wander into you're cold here it's very dry it's very sandy it's dusty it's desert it can be 115° year round this vast stretch of land cuts across 10 African nations from Seneagal to Eritrea it's a land of extremes scorching heat shifting sand and deadly danger more than half of the world's terror related deaths happen here it's the front line in a spiritual and physical battle and now here you are in the middle of one of the most dangerous swats of land in Africa what is wrong with you the call of the wild i don't know i think it's in the blood carol Ward runs toward the fire she's been doing it for decades starting in northern Uganda during the height of the Lord's Resistance Army then came South Sudan civil war destroyed villages broken hearts while others fled Ko stayed bringing healing hope and the relentless love of Jesus you can't live here until you've already died and then then what do you mean by that you've died to yourself and the devil can't kill a dead man because your life isn't your own this kind of courage runs deep so this map was my father's map on the wall of his um of our missionary house actually in the Philippines and he would lay his hands particularly on Muslim areas just weeping and weeping her parents spent 62 years preaching the gospel in regions terrorized by Abu Sai in the Philippines her grandparents served as missionaries in China for 30 years following Jesus wasn't just a decision it was their legacy i realized then fear is contagious but so is faith and so I grew up in a home that even though Abu Sai was looking for my own father's head for 45 years he had no fear he absolutely loved the people that burned the Bibles and threw him back in his face and he was willing as lay to lay his life down today Carol's mission continues here in Chad a country shadowed by the presence of Boka Haram ISIS and al-Qaeda my heart is to move farther and farther north into more Islamic darkness with the gospel because if we're not advancing as rapidly as they are we've lost she's launched a nationwide prayer movement raising up local believers chadians who know the land language and cost of following and sharing Christ we've had some Boka Haram come to Jesus in our missionary training school we've done five of them in Chad now and are launching missionaries we have over 150 launched in Chad and these are Chadian missionaries some of those missionaries have gone east into the flood of Sudanese refugees escaping war many believers baptized 202 of them the first missionary training school they had these aren't outsiders they're locals trained equipped and ready to go where few others will ready to go people like Digba Katsala a street [Applause] evangelist he doesn't just preach he rides straight into the chaos sometimes people are not very receptive at times it gets a little confrontational but afterwards when people see that you persist with the word of God then they get used to you and when you preach at the end there are people that start giving their lives to Christ and that's extraordinary for the past 5 years Pastor Digba has been using his motorcycle to ride the streets of Chad's capital city Angelina and at different locations he would set up his audio uh system and get his microphone out and he would open his Bible uh in either French or Arabic and he would boldly proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ chad is more than 50% Muslim but that doesn't stop Digba from openly talking about Jesus his voice echoing through market squares and busy roads people stop they listen and many respond then there's Abdullahimi Mahayanga another missionary who once followed Islam i was a fervent Muslim i prayed five times a day i fasted during Ramadan and I did not like Christians at all his father trained with Islamic extremists in the Sahel to target Christians now Abdullahi walks into the same regions not with hate but with hope while the world sees terror here he sees something else there is hope because many Muslims in these countries are open today to listening to the gospel god is really working in the Sahel they are coming to Jesus in large numbers and their lives are being transformed carol calls Abdulah Digbar and countless other Chadian believers the tip of the spear through prayer sacrifice and the reckless love of God they are reshaping the spiritual map of one of the most dangerous places here on the continent prayer transforms us to be willing to lay our lives down and fulfill the great commission no matter the cost prayer gives us the burden we actually get maps out and we map where are the unreached people groups where's terrorism where are wars and bloodshed let's go let's go let's Let's go and that's exactly what she has been doing for the last almost three decades on the African continent from Uganda to Sudan and now to this most dangerous part of the African continent where Islamic terrorists are wreaking havoc and she's right in the middle with the gospel of Jesus Christ is there anywhere you won't go for a great story cuz that was a great story thank you heck no of course not i mean that was fantastic i loved every second of it wow well up next from war torn Lebanon to Hollywood stardom one of the stars of The Chosen opens up about his incredible faith journey stay with us welcome back to Christian World News the latest episodes of the hit series The Chosen begins streaming this month season 5 makes its prime video debut on June 15th the Chosen: The Last Supper features eight episode eight episodes and will be released in three parts beginning with two episodes on Sunday June 15th Father's Day followed by three more on June 22nd and the last three on June 29th season 5 made its theatrical debut in the US in March and internationally in April grossing about $60 million and still counting that's pretty awesome you know actor Nick Shakur inspires millions with his portrayal of Zebedee in The Chosen his real life story is just as powerful as his on-screen role yeah he sat down with CBN's Efron Graham to share how God directed his path from Lebanon to Hollywood you're I think you're about right here and Zebedee you can be on this side between takes playing the role of Zebedee in the chosen Nick Shakur has been busy writing his memoir Transformer awakening from a spiritual coma is a layered story of divine protection and divine calling my head's got this like neon lighting on it it looks kind of like this futuristic '8s movie and I I'm thinking like what is this and then in big gold writing it goes Transformer and then in subtitle format blue neon with alarm clock font awakening from a spiritual coma an extra autobiography and then the first thing I said was &quot;Is this appropriate God?&quot; His story begins in Lebanon where as a young boy he witnessed war on one hand and people uniting on the other you begin in war torn Beirut as a kid what was life like there what do you remember most it was a it was a trip to say the least so it was a ju just a position of we could get bombed at any second and then we did as well we we were dealing with that but then the the polar opposite of that was neighbors being there for each other um you're always invited over to somebody's house that you don't know for dinner or coffee and it was this very tight-knit community and it needed to be because we were under such kind of dire circumstances i remember vividly looking up into the sky and there's several missiles just coming down it was all very slow motion and literally like you know feet waves are like things are just blowing into smitherreens there was a intense civil war happening within the country at the time so what I call like in the book I talk about this protective power encapsulated me that protective power continued from his childhood into his adult life and it led to an unforgettable meeting what can you share or share what you desire about that encounter what happened there's so much that happened at that church conference it's just overwhelming to even talk about but I I showed up completely disarmed and broken when I finally made it to the conference like I was in such a dark dark dark dark dark place and I I won't even say it's a suicidal dark place it wasn't that and I've also dared to say before it was almost if it's even possible worse than that i I can't even describe it that's how dark it was and next thing I know when the conference is over people are ushering out you know the intercessor there who they call Papa James who I call Papa Smurf because he was wearing a blue shirt and I call him that in the book too and I call it that to him directly and he says &quot;Yeah I'm Papa Smurf.&quot; Um he's their intercessor he came over did the anointing oil on the palms and forehead and I said &quot;Sure go for it.&quot; My grandpa baptized me he did the same thing but I wasn't expecting something to happen when he started you know praying over me in what they call the spiritual language speaking in tongues and my cells started to vibrate at a very rapid pace and that's when I saw a transparent presence of God rise from the ground it wasn't it wasn't like a man with a beard but that presence that God used encapsulated everything about his personality and who he was and who Jesus calls the father in heaven when you encounter him he becomes everything you've ever wanted and your body knows it but your mind doesn't comprehend it i met him through the Holy Spirit and and what was more so I could sense that Holy Spirit all around me and looking back he sees the Holy Spirit often connected him to spiritual superheroes along the journey the book's about superheroes and everybody that poured into my life in the book gets a superpower when the viewer opens it I want them to literally fall head first into the book and experience life the way I experienced it one of those superheroes is Dallas Jenkins the filmmaker who cast him as Zebedee after an audition Nick thought cost him the role when you are auditioning now for The Chosen you thought you bombed it right yes because nothing in me wanted the role because I I flipped out when I read Zebed's description as being a fisherman and a father in his 50s i was like 50s 50s it's like because I'd gone so long with so many rejections at auditions that my body my mind my soul as I describe it in the book gave out i made a joke of the whole audition and I asked Dallas later on during season 3 I said &quot;I just got to ask you while we're setting up why did you cast me for this role my audition wasn't good.&quot; And then he said &quot;Well that's what I liked about it you were actually being very careless.&quot; And he saw something in that kind of carelessness and shrugging things off the constant in Nick's story is the greatest superhero of them all as I'm writing the book and I'm going back and connecting the dots wait something felt like it took over me as I'm running away from bombs something took over me you know it's uh that part of it was an amazing discovery for me as I was writing the book because I thought &quot;Wow God has been there the entire time.&quot; Efron Grant CBN News coming up a look at the split that rocked the United Methodist Church and the impact of the breakup 3 years later welcome back to the broadcast here in the US the Supreme Court ruled 9 to nothing that a Catholic charity cannot be required to pay unemployment taxes when other religious groups are exempt wisconsin state officials argued the organization didn't qualify for an exemption because its day-to-day work doesn't involve religious teachings but the high court sided with Catholic Charities ruling that the state violated its first amendment guarantee of freedom of religion well George it's been three years since the United Methodist Church split since then 7,600 churches in the US have left over issues of sexual orientation and ordination cbn's Paul Patit looks back at one of the largest church breakups in American history and the subsequent impact on both sides 2022 was was easily the most difficult year of ministry reverend Clark Atkins pastor's first church in Sylum Springs Arkansas one congregation that decided to break away from the United Methodist Church there's some members that are missing that aren't here um but it does feel renewed it feels more joyous three years ago the Global Methodist Church a theologically conservative alternative to the United Methodists officially launched with just a few dozen congregations today it oversees more than 4600 churches worldwide most of which split from the United Methodists the Global Methodist Church really offered um the closest thing for our theology and the culture of our church at the heart of the split differences over same-sex marriage and the ordination of LGBTQ clergy tracy Malone is president of the United Methodist Church Council of Bishops there's no longer the the fighting um there's no longer um I would even say the distraction um around the differences particularly related um to human sexuality but for Reverend Atkins and many others the issue wasn't simply about sexuality i I knew about um bishops that were were violating the discipline and I thought that's just inexcusable dr daniel Bennett teaches political science at John Brown University and wrote an easy citizenship embracing the tension in faith and politics he says the church divide reflects broader shifts in the country this is a really good example of these cultural expectations and changes in our culture and social environment than seeping into congregations it's not like churches have been driving these conversations in in our broader culture i would argue it's much more likely that it's culture that are shaping some of these conversations in the churches in the years since the split First Church has seen significant growth we saw immediately in the first year um an increase in worship attendance of about 15% another 13% the year after i think this year we it was over 10% the first 10 minutes in that sanctuary you feel it oh yeah it's it's a totally different atmosphere than when it was a a supper club that wasn't working and the growth isn't just local reverend Atkins now oversees 300 disaffiliated churches and he says they're witnessing an overall rise in attendance baptisms and professions of faith and the United Methodist Church is also moving forward in May it unveiled a new mission statement love boldly serve joyfully and lead courageously it means that it embraces and includes people of every age nation race gender and walk of life the church's inclusive approach like a new queer theology course has led to a rise in LGBTQ leoty applying for ordination they are wanting to be a resource to clergy and leoty to help them understand um what it means to be queer and whatever that theology is around um queerness this kind of thing absolutely uh makes me uh relieved that we did leave for First Church the decision to leave the denomination came after a series of meetings prayer and votes um and some congregations are still recovering um just from the pain that they experienced um but I would say now that we are on the other side of this affiliation um there is a greater sense of of unity and a greater um focus on our disciplehip church has gone through a lot um I've I've seen a lot of growth um but I can say that the spirit of this church is probably the healthiest it's been in a long time three years later churches on both sides are finding renewed purpose in the places where they feel most at home that's as a tale as old as the church itself in many respects uh there won't be one unified church until the second coming uh but hopefully we strive uh for that process of sanctification in the meantime in Sylum Springs Arkansas Paul Petit CBN News finally this week in a time when churches are closing Christian leaders from across Europe met in Berlin at the European Congress on Evangelism not just for a conference but for a wake-up call cbn's Brody Carter has the story [Music] [Applause] [Music] berlin is a city once divided by walls christian leaders from across Europe gathered under one roof united by one mission the gospel has power we're going to reach Europe we need an army an army of evangelists unafraid unashamed unapologetic uncompromising at Berlin's JW Marriott national flags line the walls and at the center of it all a single cross illuminating what's being called Europe's most significant spiritual gathering since Amsterdam in 2000 and a return to the city where Billy Graham launched his global mission in 1966 the city of Berlin has influenced the world in every field what a place from which to shout to the world &quot;Christ is the Savior.&quot; The mission comes as churches close across Europe franklin Graham told CBN News nearly 1,000 churches in Germany closed their doors last year alone he challenged pastors to stand firm and move forward and pastors are responding to that call we have a big job in front of us to reach this generation worship leaders speakers and believers came from 57 countries including Ukraine and Russia where war still rages yet here they stood side by side united in the gospel we want to ignite a fire uh in Europe where there's an excitement for evangelism the churches are are willing to be bold and not ashamed of the gospel we've got Ukrainian churches coming we have churches coming from Russia you know he said &quot;These countries are at war.&quot; Yes they are but the gospel is more powerful than any of that stuff with a renewed mission and shared vision these church leaders now return home ready to share the good news throughout Europe brody Carter CBN News thank you Brody folks that is it for this week's edition of Christian World News went by quickly it did it's a great job with Thank you same here well until next week from all of us

IDF from the resistance in Gaza we've seen Yemen exhausting the Iron Dome on a daily basis and of course the cruel and unusual weaponization of aid by the Israeli regime USbacked its fragility has never been more apparent now Netanyahu is facing even more internal opposition as the genocide drags on with no end in sight and with no notable achievements beyond the complete devastation of Israel's global reputation at a historic rate what is the state of the resistance as we enter month number 20 of this gruesome genocide in Gaza and the proliferation of regional war and regional resistance to discuss all of this I have three of my most trusted and of course uh just prolific voices journalists uh on these matters first let me introduce Professor Muhammad Mandi of the University of Tan geopolitical analyst professor Mandi good to see you again thank you and then we have Loki he is a hip-hop artist a journalist an activist you can find his tour tickets in the video description below he's going on tour this fall loki good to see you good to see you Danny thanks for having me and then we have Ali Abuima he's chief editor over at the Electronic Antifa uh a publication you all need to follow uh Ali good to see you again thanks Danny hi everyone all right well let's get started well I actually wanted to begin with there is this very uh it's it's making the rounds and we've been talking about here on this show and and we've spoken about it before the uh state of this forever war and genocide in Gaza now it's taking a very strange turn where it's been revealed that Israel has been arming and funding uh groups that some former Israeli officials are saying are are affiliated with ISIS this is what uh Benjamin Netanyahu had to say in response to that it's the first time Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly admitted to Israel aiding armed Palestinian groups in Gaza on the advice of security officials we activated clans in Gaza that oppose Hamas what's wrong with that this is only good and saves the lives of IDF soldiers so maybe I can turn to you Loki about this what do you know about this development because as we've talked about we have these reserveists these settlers not wanting to fight there's been desertions there's very strict and repressive laws about this but what exactly is going on here why is Israel and Netanyahu why are they so uh joyful and jovial about what they're doing with regard to these so-called Some are calling them gangs some are calling them ISIS what's your assessment well it's important also to contextualize this in a trajectory of Israel's support for this essential inversion of Zionism a sort of mirror inversion of Zionism in the region we know for example that when uh you had a sort of appearance of dashes in the Sinai and they actually kidnapped and executed some Egyptian soldiers on camera the exact thing that the dash um individuals said is they said this person is guilty of smuggling weapons to the apostates in Hamas this was the exact words which were uttered by a dash individual in the Sinai before this Egyptian soldier was executed now the fascinating thing to me which struck me as strange is that ISIS would be using this way of discussing uh a Palestinian resistance group and that the reason for execution would be that alone and so to me it seemed as if Israel was perhaps pushing a button in Egypt to uh maybe warn the Egyptian regime or the Egyptian military more specifically when you look at the development of ISIS and Jebet Nusra which is kind of a sister organization in Syria it is a known fact Elizabeth Ciro the uh Israeli spy who is currently in Iraq published an article in Foreign Policy in which she stated clearly that 12 groups within Syria were being funded by the Israelis and were being paid a wage actually and one of those groups was Jabetusra we know for example and you know what were the rest of those 12 groups um you also have to take into account that when Pretty Patel the uh British home secretary who had to resign um because before that she'd been in charge of uh Britain's international aid and she met with had 13 meetings with Israeli government officials without informing the British government including with Netanyahu but one of those meetings was about the siphoning of funds to um groups like Jebad Nusra in Syria um in a way for Israel to cover up the uh movement of uh funds towards these people and the amazing thing about both this and the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation debacle which has developed is that the information about the funding of these organizations has come from the Israeli political elite so you've had in the case of the Gaza Humanitarian um foundation it was Ya Laid who comes out and says they've set up shell companies and this is Mossad money now we've known for a long time that the way the Israel lobby has functioned is the setting up of shell companies the the pager attack in Lebanon is also another example of the setting up of shell companies it's what Israel does and uses the western world as a playground for this and is able to launder money in different directions to achieve specific objectives so now both this and this uh funding of Abu Shab and his gang um of of you know Dlan is somebody that is famous for collaborating with the Israelis against the Palestinians in Gaza but I I always felt that there are many dans it comes in in in many different guises and many different masks and and one of them will be a a a more dash type of orientation as we've seen across uh the region but so this funding came out because Avidor Lieberman um actually had said that this is what the Israeli government is doing so actually now when these political figures are going to war with each other secrets are falling out which actually have a lot of benefit for the rest of us to know and form an idea of of what is happening here but you know this is not new israel has been doing it across the region for a long time it's important to also understand what is the function of a Golani in Syria it's not that he might normalize it's not that he um uh he might stand up to them no it's a simple fact that he was cultivated by the very same British external intelligence which cultivates the Palestinian Authority so that is the model government for the region which Israel Britain and the United States deems acceptable it's either a Palestinian authoritarian um a Palestinian authoritarian um authority uh type model perhaps with a dash flavor so there's always the chance of sewing internal chaos and there's always the opportunity to push sectarianism against the only forces in the region who are actively stopping Israel that's basically the option that people in the region have and Israel rules Syria today let's be clear israel rules Syria it bombs wherever it wants why is it that even BBC journalists can be stopped stripped handcuffed by the Israeli soldiers in southern Syria golani rules nothing and he is bending over backwards to try to be allowed to have some form of briefcase independence but it seems that even that is not going to be um possible within the the Zionist imagination this is in a state of constant expansion and and as I say this information that's come out about the funding of this particular um group of thugs in Gaza is interesting um not new more uh kind more kinds of leaks like this are going to come out from the Israeli political elite and I think that's ultimately a good thing yeah Professor Mandi what does this what does this tell you about the state of things because you know uh as Loki was talking uh he said that one of the reasons that this is happening is because Israel wants to get rid of all the forces that are fighting for Palestinians well one of those is Palestinians themselves and in Kunist there's been heavy fighting jabalia there's been heavy fighting actually in Kunis the reports are 17 dead are wounded in just a day of Israeli soldiers i mean I I mean what does this say to you that Israel is going to these lengths to what they claim to be is uh to get rid of Hamas and the resistance uh what's your assessment of this the the regime has been using uh such groups for a very long time and uh Loki is absolutely correct uh when we look at Syria uh the u from the very beginning of the uh dirty war in Syria we saw that uh al-Qaeda was cooperating with the United States they were on the same side of the battlefield and the famous uh tweet or sorry the famous email uh that I and others have tweeted so many times of Jake Sullivan to Hillary Clinton jake Sullivan the previous uh US uh national security adviser where he said in Syria al-Qaeda is on our side that email was on February the 12th 2012 so that is how the United States works that's how the Israeli regime works the Israeli regime actually in its Hebrew press it's much more open about its uh sinister uh views and its sinister activities than it is in its English press so uh if people go to the translations there's a lot more material out there but they have openly in the previous decade spoken about how they've been supporting ISIS al-Qaeda and other extremist groups in Syria to undermine the previous Syrian government and alongside the occupied Golan Heights the Syrian Golan the the Israelis were supporting al-Qaeda and ISIS both of these groups had bases alongside the Golan Heights and uh whenever the Syrian army would try to advance they would strike them with artillery or with tank fire or other means to drive them back and they would treat the injured ISIS and al-Qaeda militants terrorists uh in their own hospitals they would give them weapons they'd give them food they give them uh they'd also be funding all all other terrorists and in Syria we had a host of different groups and now we see how the infighting in Syria's uh beginning again uh but uh in in the case of the Gaza Strip I think it's going to be more difficult for the Israelis this is not new as uh again Loki pointed out the the murder of those uh Egyptian soldiers goes back quite a while and the their their uh crime was for their because of their support for Hamas hamas I believe is too strong in Gaza to be able for them to for the Israelis to undermine them through Palestinians uh their allies are uh very close to them the Palestinian Islamic Jihad which is the second largest resistance group they will stick with them till the very end and hopefully we won't we will never see such a situation but they will stick with them and the other Palestinian groups they too are with Hamas there have been some protests obviously the Israelis uh Mossad and others have been behind it but those are small groups of people who many of them were just it's they they small groups but many participated in in because of the desperation the desperate desperate situ situation they're in and that's a policy that the Israelis and the Americans have always pursued what that's like what the Americans have done in Cuba in Cuba the American Americans are strangling the people of Cuba and uh their hope is that people will turn against the Cuban government out of desperation they do the same in Venezuela they I just returned from Venezuela uh that the sanctions there are are hurting people and the objective is to hurt people so that the the population would turn against the government the same is was true of course with Syria but Syria ultimately collapsed the same is true with Iran and any other it's a war it's a form of war the Israelis do the same thing in Gaza they're slaughtering people they are starving people and they the they and Western intelligence agency that the Israeli intelligence agency agencies as well as Western intelligence agencies work together to turn people against the resistance but I don't think that's going to work i don't think uh ISIS is going to be able to undermine Hamas in any way or form and we saw as you pointed out today that the resistance has been able to score uh successes against the this uh the Zionist regime and inflict significant casualties i I I also believe that um we're going to see further attempts to to turn both the local population against Hamas to try to encourage people to protest simultaneously you're going to see uh these terror groups uh being deployed against Israelis this will this will continue but uh I think to to the credit of the resistance uh after 20 months of genocide uh and to the credit of the people of Gaza uh people have remained steadfast across uh the Gaza Strip and they've tried to separate the people put them in different in boxes in different parts of the Gaza Strip separate them make it impossible to manage they would bomb police officers uh they bomb people who who would guard and do bomb people who guard just a few days ago they did it again people who are guarding uh food and uh that for or aid that was being brought to the people they bombed them they kill them in order and use these terror groups in order to create further chaos but so far we've seen that Hamas and the resistance has been able to maintain control because the population remains loyal they may not be and I cannot say uh I cannot speak on behalf of Palestinians in in in Gaza they may not they may have their own grievances but they know who the enemy is they know what the enemy is trying to do so someone may not be a supporter of Hamas someone may be a supporter of a different group someone may not be a part of any group but they know that the Palestinian cause is just they know that the Israeli regime and the Americans and the Europeans and this and regional regimes are doing nothing for them at at best uh but they still know that they have to stand with the resistance and that the other side is only trying to undermine all of them through division through through supporting ISIS and uh through trying to create unrest in in Gaza Ali please Stephan yeah um I think with respect to what's been revealed in the last couple of days in Gaza I'm somewhat skeptical that there is really an ISIS link uh you know and what is ISIS really it's a brand that is used by Western intelligence services so you know it it they can use it for for anything they want to use it for i think the key point here is not whether or not this group is ISIS affiliated but that it is Israel affiliated that's the important thing and I think the context in terms of the history of the struggle in Palestine is that Israel has always sought Palestinian collaborators and for that matter Lebanese collaborators and as Loki pointed out Syrian collaborators and this model goes back decades and it's a classical colonial model you find local native collaborators to help you fight the resistance against you know your own people's resistance against the occupier and there's a history of this in Palestine going back many decades but we can start in the 1970s with the so-called village leagues which Israel tried to set up in the occupied West Bank uh following the occupation of 1967 and then of course the Oslo Accords turned the Palestine Liberation Organization from a liberation movement into essentially a collaborative force with Israel and yes Arafat who was the head of the Palestine Liberation Organization was murdered when he refused to collaborate enough as far as Israel was concerned and so they replaced him with Mahmud Abbas who has been much more willing to collaborate with Israel and is is completely an Israeli asset as is his newly appointed deputy Hussein which Israeli leaders called and this is a quote our man in Ramallah so this is the model that they're trying to establish in Gaza and this uh Abu Shabbab this this local collaborator who may be a thug who may be a criminal who may be an opportunist uh a local warlord that Israel wants to build up into an asset or a client actually claims to be operating under what he calls Palestinian legitimacy and therefore suggesting a link with the Palestinian Authority and last month uh the resistance had uh put out a report uh a field report and a video saying that they had carried out an ambush of what they thought were were what called Mustav or Mustin these are Israelis who uh disguised themselves as Palestinians in order to infiltrate and carry out assassinations and terrorist attacks for example in the West Bank these mistim uh often uh have have often gone into hospitals and murdered people in hospital beds descri uh while these these killers these gunmen are dis disguised as Palestinians so the resistance thought they were attacking a force of uh Mr and it turned out that they were actually Palestinian collaborators coordinating with and being directed by Israel and so uh as Loki pointed out it was the Israeli right-wing politician Avagdor Lieberman who blew the whistle and confirmed what has actually been known or suspected for a while you know to the extent that there's been any looting of aid even Cindy McCain the wife of uh ultra neocon pro-Israel uh John McCain the late US senator who who never saw a war he wasn't thoroughly enthusiastic about now she's head of the UN's World Food Program which traditionally that's a role that's given to an American and even Cindy McCain is denying and saying there's no evidence that Hamas steals any aid to the extent that aid has been looted and stolen and this has been reported and documented for months and months it has been by these Israel affiliated mercenaries and gangs and what has happened in the last couple of days is essentially this has now been officially confirmed by Israel and it's very interesting what Netanyahu said when he said that you know what's wrong with this i think on the one hand he's acknowledging that Israel does this that this is standard Israeli uh modus operandi but he also said this will save Israeli soldiers lives so again the they want a proxy force just like in South Lebanon between 1978 and 2000 when Israel had the so-called South Lebanon Army militia a traitor militia of Lebanese uh Lebanese collaborators under Sad Hadad and um Antoan Lah uh to fight on behalf of Israel because the casualties uh inflicted by the Lebanese resistance were so die they wanted local people to pay that price in blood similar again to how the West wants uh Ukrainians to die for its proxy war against Russia they want uh um Syrians Syrian proxies to die uh in their regime change war in Syria and Israel wants Palestinians to die killing other Palestinians on its behalf but this is an acknowledgment from Netanyahu that Israel cannot sustain the level of losses that it is sustaining in Gaza that's why they need local collaborators because the losses are so high and the operation today this morning in Kunes which killed Israel has acknowledged so far four of its soldiers and it severely injured five is only the latest of this drip drip drip drip drip of daily uh casualties which is why Israel is unable after 2 years to achieve any of its goals in Gaza yes we know they're the world champions at murdering babies at starving children at bombing hospitals no one will ever be in Israel's league when it comes to that but in terms of gaining operational control they do not have operational control over any part of Gaza and remember a couple of weeks ago they were blustering about how we're going to send in you know if if if Hamas doesn't agree to whatever ceasefire terms Israel was trying to dictate through its American uh lawyer Steve Witkov that we're going to carry out a huge massive invasion we're massing for what was it 450,000 troops they cannot fill the the brigades that are in Gaza most of them are missing uh uh whole units and uh the when they call for reserves only a fraction is showing up and this is even acknowledged within the Israeli media even if we don't know the full story because of the you know military censorship and fudging and so on so they need these proxy militias but this strategy has consistently failed and I think it will fail in Gaza it will sow chaos yes they're sewing chaos they have been trying we talked about this last time we were all together on this stream with those astroturfed protests in northern Gaza they're trying to generate some kind of popular uprising against the resistance in Gaza as Dr mandi said Palestinians may have different political opinions they may hate Hamas some of them may hate Hamas politically speaking but the idea of a mass uprising against the resistance is a a a fantasy for the Israelis that will never come true people will differ politically but they will not turn against the resistance and if they haven't done that after 20 months of genocide they're not going to do it now or in the future or ever and they haven't surrendered and they haven't kneelled despite the unbearable suffering Israel and its Western backers the United States Canada uh the European Union and others and the complicit Arab dictatorships and vassels in the region who are also uh effectively on board with this throwing promises of trillions at Donald Trump without even saying end the genocide end the starvation in Gaza if none of that has brought Palestinians to their knees and brought them to the point of surrender there is nothing Israel can do that will oh no that's a powerful powerful take Ali because and I I definitely agree and I wanted to uh bring it back to you low key uh you know with everything that Ali just said there's this reality that maybe Israel will need uh proxies uh in order to fight even within Gaza to continue this genocide there was a recent study that said 40% of Israeli settlers are considering leaving and we know how many tens of thousands of Israelis over the past what has it been nearly two years a little under two years since this uh massacre began so uh is this a matter of low-key that Israel is going to need to outsource because it has it is exhausting itself and breaking itself through this forever genocide and war in Gaza or uh what what's your assessment of this well Zionism necessitates genocide and it has always necessitated the institutionalization of a human shield strategy and what has just been laid out by Ali is that the way that that human shield in a collective sense is playing out but I think an important part of the story which has not really received that much attention in terms of um the media has been the very duplicitous role of regional actors so on one side we would expect those in the UAE for example or those in Saudi those especially in Qatar to have given some form of requirement when uh prostrating before Donald Trump for this this protection money that he claimed at least a mentioning of of the Palestinians but it is the simple fact in terms of infrastructure that you've had weapons going from the Alade base in Katar to uh Neatim base in uh the Zionist entity that's happened several times throughout the war you've had the same with US bases in Kuwait and weapons going directly there in the case of the UAE and Turkey though for example it's really extreme what has happened during this time so last time I mentioned the way that there's an Israeli company called Highlander which manages quote unquote Israel's airspace that is partially owned by the Edge Group which was which is a UAE state-owned company but it gets actually worse than that israel has something company called Third Eye Systems which operates um around Gaza and works on uh target acquisition and other things that is 30% owned by Edge Group which is a UAE state-owned company you have for example all of the money that's been poured in through the UAE and Saudi into Jared Kushner's affinity partners which from the beginning Kushner said this is a corridor for Gulf investment in Israel and one of the stipulations of the Abraham Accords is that each country had to invest 10 billion over the coming years in Israel 10 billion dollars and so through for example affinity partners that you've got Saudi and UAE money in Phoenix holdings phoenix Holdings is one of the biggest shareholders in Elbert Systems it has a role in expanding settlements in the West Bank you look at channels like Hadith and Arabia in the case of Arabia they have directly worked with the Israeli military throughout this war these are Saudi owned channels you have for example the Israeli spy Gad I think is his name he's a Lebanese origin Israeli spy who has gone on record saying that he smuggled weapons for Israeli intelligence recently had an interview on Arabia English in which he was trying to discredit the idea of empathy from afar now this is quite complicated psychological warfare that's being waged through a channel owned by the Saudi government how many people have you seen detained and told they cannot have any semblance of anything Palestinian around the Kaa how how many times have you seen people detained for wearing kufi okay for us to say the Saudi government uses Israeli company Celbrite to hack people's phones it was hacking Jamaal Kha Shakji's phone with Pegasus spyware normalization happened the the Gulf region and the rulers there have been essential to the war on Raza netanyahu went on record and he said &quot;We give we give these states some wiggle room in their public pronouncements.&quot; meaning they'll allow Saudi to call it a genocide when sitting at the absolutely useless Arab League which actually in and of itself where do you think the Palestinian Authority gets its money from it gets its training from the British government it gets its funding from the Arab League from the EU who are they giving that funding for they're giving it because it's a condition that the United States and Israel puts on them fund our proxy in the West Bank which is priming the population for at best dispossession ethnic cleansing at worst mass murder that's what the Palestinian Why is it that when the British are training the Palestinian Authority agents they are not allowed to train them in the use of sniper rifles they are not allowed to train them in the use of sniper rifles that specifically because they fear the chance of those weapons being turned on the Israelis and and it has happened there has been um cases of that of course and Turkey you know we really have to get into Turkey and more needs to be said about Turkey because you have this uh Turkish journalist Metin Shian who has actually gone on record and publicly made the claim that Borak Odan the son of Oduran has been trading with Israel throughout the Gaza genocide and the data that he used was from the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce and this was something he tweeted on the 7th of December 2024 he said &quot;While the attack on Gaza was continuing we sent 400 ships to Israel we sent 4 million tons we provided fuel for the Israeli planes clothing for its soldiers parts for its weapons.&quot; He said &quot;Thank God we sent our prayers to the Palestinians do not forget um Palestine.&quot; What you also have the case of is several business figures close to Odan actually owning shipping companies that have been involved in uh sending uh shipments to the Israelis you of course have 40% of the oil that Israel uses flowing on the pipeline from Azabaijan um to uh to Turkey and then on to the Israelis really there's there's so many examples of uh the way that this is happening so for example there's an Israeli company by the name of DAD Energy which supplies electricity to Israeli military bases now the second largest shareholder in this Israeli company is Zulu Holding which is headed by Odugan's close friend Ahmed Zulu so what are we talking about here we are talking about betrayal on a grand scale by the very same people especially odan especially odan who they in Arabic they say he he he is the biggest propagator of prayers for Palestine we don't need your prayers in fact your prayers are probably harmful In this case Odan is guilty is guilty is guilty is guilty and these are the rulers in the region there needs to be a reckoning where we are able to um clearly have clarity about what has been done during this period and by whom israel couldn't have kept going without of this this this support from um its allies but specifically those in the region who are actually financially benefiting off it that's that's what we're talking about here we're talking about financial benefits from the infrastructure built up around genocide and I think also there needs to be more clarity from um if if you are if you are involved in arms struggle against the Israelis and I completely understand there is a necessity to have diplomatic relations with all sides and there is help given in a limited way how can you trust the safety of of of of information exchange there or any of that when when this level of uh integration between these forces is so extreme you know the British for example have excelled at portraying themselves as sort of bumbling noble intentioned incompetent actors but all of that's propaganda and rubbish this is Britain is the most sly actor in uh in the region you've seen complete integration of the British and the Israeli security services britain for example the British police are using the Sandcat armored vehicle that Israel has been using in Gaza they've literally purchased it off the back of Israeli activity in Gaza and they're rolling it out on the streets of Britain the British police hack phones with an Israeli company there is an integration that has taken place and Israel is in the process of integrating itself with the regional security services also so it's uh yeah absolutely in order to to to carry out this uh maximalist project of Zionism it is needing all the help it can get from those in the region yeah and uh Professor Morandi I wanted to you know Loki laid out this picture of of the region and uh it is indeed a stark one and and certainly there's been so much enabling of uh the Zionist regime of Israel but there was a recent article I want you to actually react to uh I'll just how the how Ansarala rattled the US Navy and transformed maritime war and I think this is incredible given this regional situation that uh Loki just laid out uh just what has happened here on the opposite side with uh the resistance outside of Gaza uh here you have uh the Wall Street Journal acknowledging that Ansarala engaged the US Navy in the fiercest battles it's fought since World War II despite being one of the world's poorest countries and uh then it said here some 30 vessels participated in combat operations against Ansarala in the Red Sea from late 2023 up until this year and rain down 1.5 billion worth of munitions on Ansarala uh and while they claim that they destroyed much of the arsenal that's uh very very much under question given that Ensurala continues what it is doing it says that the US Navy was not able to achieve the strategic goal of restoring shipping through the Red Sea so uh FA Mandi uh your your reaction to this uh given that you have Israel kind of in this uh very unhinged state it's bombing Lebanon of course it's continuing its onslaught in Gaza and uh yet it seems to be mired in many fronts and Yemen happens to be one of the biggest ones right now yes and uh I think if we go back to um when Trump began this genocidal onslaught against Yemen which is the only Arab state that has been supporting the Palestinian cause in a meaningful way ansarah is a part of the government they are the government that rules in San the cap the capital of Yemen and they are the legitimate power in Yemen even though the UN security council does not recognize them at the behest of Saudi Arabia and the Emirates but they have been in power for uh a decade now over a decade uh the United we you recall that when this attack began and it was all done to support the Israeli regime the Wall Street Journal after a period of time I think it was the Wall Street Journal yes and they admitted that the United States was unable to destroy the underground facilities of Ansaro and we saw from the leaked signal uh chats that were carried out between American officials that they're targeting uh they were targeting civilians in their air strikes if you recall they said the the head of the the guy who was the head of the missile force they never named the person they just said that he entered a building and we brought down the whole the the whole building all the people living in that apartment building were slaughtered because of some person that they claimed was the head of the missile command and a person who they couldn't name and Ansar ultimately stated that by the end of the conflict none of their commanders were martyed the Americans had failed across the board and the Wall Street Journal back then admitted that the US failed to destroy their underground facilities and they were only able to damage the entrance points which were immediately rebuilt then the New York Times later on admitted that I I never read the article because it was behind the payw wall but they said it was said that they spent they wasted $7 billion in this monthlong campaign and I don't think that included the F-18s that were uh that fell into the Red Sea or the drone so the real cost could have been a lot more the United States failed against Yemen and they had to capitulate trump said Yemen capitulated but when we saw what really happened it was clear even the Americans admitted that it was the United States that capitulated and I I think that this uh is an this this was a major victory the the West likes to say that the resistance has been defeated on all fronts and that the Israeli regime has has been able to expand its power but I think that's propaganda and wishful thinking what happened in Yemen I think was the the the greatest defeat for the United States uh really since uh Vietnam uh it was brief but it was uh humiliating the United States went to war against Yemen they engaged in war trump prom and Trump and his secretary of defense promised to crush what they called the Houthis or Ansarah and the Yemen armed forces and the Yemen government and all they did basically was slaughter civilians in different cities they failed completely to deter Yemen if they had had any if they had success they would have continued with the onslaught they would have continued with it for two three four months until they until they finished the job but it was clear that uh they had they were they had failed completely and also I think what we saw yesterday in Lebanon is significant that uh the Israeli regime while it's carried out a new wave of bombings on civilian targets and it was clear that was they were all civilian targets they were just apartment blocks the bombing was carried out out of spite and hatred for uh for human life and using Hezbollah as an excuse and we saw how the Western media basically repeated whatever the Israelis said that they were striking Hezbollah targets i know those neighborhoods those are all people's homes they destroyed between 100 to 200 apartments two 100 to 200 families are now permanently displaced kids who have who are in the middle of their exams near the end of the school year during the Eid uh vacation where family people came from abroad to visit they they created chaos across southern Beirut simply out of spite but that it it shows that the Israelis have not succeeded in Lebanon and uh in Lebanon by the way another victory for the resistance were the local elections the in the local elections Hezbollah and its allies won across the board after this devastating war after this genocidal war the fact that the resistance is so popular in Lebanon despite what the Americans and the Europeans and the Israelis and their local partners their genocidal fascist partners in in Lebanon tried they failed so in Yemen the resistance won the war in uh Lebanon the resistance is alive and well and in Syria it is a sad state of affairs but at least the reality is being exposed to many who for whatever reason failed to see the reality and that is that what happened in SP in Syria was a conspiracy regardless of the nature of the previous government the Iran was never a fan of the Ba'ist party whether in Syria and obviously in Iraq we fought Saddam Hussein and and the Ba'ist party in Iraq invaded Iran so Iran was never in love with the batheism but Iran saw what the Americans and NATO were doing how they were conspiring to bring down uh Lebanon how they were conspiring to bring down the resistance in Lebanon and to bring to destroy the bridge to the resistance in Lebanon as well as the bridge to the resistance in the West Bank so this black hole that is now that sir which is now a black hole uh sadly and where people are suffering I think that in the long run this is going to be more costly what uh for the Israeli regime they are overstretched in Syria and for the collaborators who brought about this horrific state of affairs it's going to be very costly as well and they have vindicated the resistance they vindicated and its allies that people now see what happened in Syria was exactly what Hassan was saying would happen yeah Ali I definitely want to bring you in here and also there have been reports over the last uh recent period of a a new possibly a new resistance emerging in Syria as well uh I know firing rockets uh into the uh or you know Syrian territory uh Golan but Israeli occupied Syrian territory uh but your your reaction to any of this yeah just to say that I think when there is occupation and colonialism resistance in is inevitable and you know the in the US and Israeli view of the world or at least what they claim to believe the reason there is conflict and bloodshed and there is no peace is because Hamas and Hezbollah evil organizations that exist just to hate Jews and kill and cause chaos for the sake of causing chaos but the reality of course as most people will know is that Hezbala was created as a reaction to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon the murder of tens of thousands of people and it it was an indigenous resistance group that grew up and that's exactly the same with Hamas hamas emerged in the late 1980s in Gaza in opposition and resistance to decades of brutal Israeli occupation and the PLO the Palestine Liberation Organization also and its different factions uh emerged as a resistance to uh Israel uh at an earlier phase when the PLO essentially became subcontractors of the Israeli occupation resistance didn't disappear resistance reemerged in the form of other organizations so suppose a genie comes out of a bottle and uh you know Benjamin Netanyahu rubs the bottle and says and the genie comes out and says what's your wish and Netanyahu says my wish is that Hezbollah and Hamas disappear and poof they're gone well maybe Israel will get calm for a very short period of time until new resistance groups emerge and so that's what will happen in Syria that's what will happen in Lebanon for political reasons Hezbollah has decided not to respond militarily to Israel's constant aggressions it's not that Hezbollah can't respond that can respond but as part of the uh ceasefire deal the one-sided ceasefire deal uh that uh the Lebanese government s signed and agreed with Israel as sponsored by the United States and and France and whoever else agreed to step back and say to the Lebanese state to the government okay you're in charge uh you get our land back because of course Israel still occupies uh Lebanese territory uh along the border and continues to attack Lebanon and violate its airspace daily including the massive barbaric terror attacks carried out by Israel last night in the southern suburbs of Beirut so Hezbollah said to the Lebanese state &quot;Go ahead to the Lebanese state go ahead it's all yours.&quot; Now I can imagine a point where uh if the Israeli aggression continues to escalate where Hezbollah will may decide that that position is untenable but uh if they sit it out too long other people in Lebanon will start to resist and to say we can't tolerate the attacks on our territory so the root cause of all violence is the aggression is the colonial occupation is the attack from Zionism against the people of this region uh and their land and as long as that attack as long as that original aggression continues and persists and is backed by uh of course when people in the region are resisting against Israel they're resisting against the might of the entire West uh and so as long as that attack continues then there will be resistance and that's just a reality and and in the past in Palestine it was called the Palestine Liberation Organization that's no longer a resistance movement in any form uh and uh today it's called Hamas or Islamic Jihad or uh you know the the other smaller factions that are involved in the resistance today in Lebanon it's Hezbollah but if Hezbollah uh doesn't return to military resistance for any reason I suspect that other military resistance organizations will emerge and and so the same is true in Syria uh you can have a Golani a British American intelligence asset Abu Muhammad Galani aka Ahmed Shah who has been crowned as king of Syria by the western intelligence services uh and he can pledge as he has been doing repeatedly that we don't want any trouble with Israel we don't want anyone to attack Israel please please please just leave us alone but there are Syrians who will uh rise up and say this is our land and we cannot tolerate this aggression this occupation this humiliation and and so we are going to resist even if the American installed monarch in Syria the king of Syria decid or the king of Damascus uh decides he doesn't want to um to resist yeah uh low key I I definitely want to uh uh bring you back in here to uh react to you know what Ali said but also uh you know Yemen has recently fired one of its Palestine hypersonic 2 missiles at Bengurian airport of course there was the moment not too long ago where one struck and pierced the Iron Dome but they keep firing the ballistic missiles and the hypersonic missiles and they keep having an effect of shutting down the airport and of course uh causing economic uh you know dislocation and disarray and then you have I don't know if you saw the reports too of a new Islamic resistance front in Syria that had recently fired rockets um into Israeli occupied Golan uh is this all for not because I think a lot of people are very pessimistic about the situation when you have Israel raising Gaza the genocide the you know the massive infrastructure destruction the aid weaponization what the you know the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation debacle uh luring people Palestinians into essentially um uh uh to their to their deaths um shooting them down as they were receiving these this pitiful amount amount of aid uh your take on this because I think a lot of people are very pessimistic about the situation despite the presence of resistance as Ali said uh continuing well I think it's important also to clarify that what the resistance in Lebanon is protecting is the entire region why is Israel so obsessed with getting to the Lethani River because it wants to control the water sources of the region now what did Golani facilitate by allowing Israel to occupy Syria the way it has this king of Damascus he has facilitated Israel controlling 40% of Syria's water israel controlling ala dam which supplies water to Jordan now let's not forget that Jordan is actually one of the poorest countries in the world water-wise so now through the occupation of Syria Israel has a further control on this poodle in Amman that they that they control now in terms of the case of um the the other aspect you have to remember that Israel occupied the highest the highest point in the entire region in Syria um and so therefore has this strategic um full spectrum visibility of the region it's always wanted to get to that mountaintop and it did now uh in response to uh some of what you said yes you have the development of this in Syria who have shot these uh weapons from the Jolan Heights you also have to remember that the Yemenes said to the former Syrian government &quot;Let us come and open the front.&quot; This is following the alaka flood they said &quot;Let us come and open the front.&quot; And they were prevented from doing so at least that is my understanding of what happened from some in Yemen but also one other thing that I've noticed is there is a coordination playing out across the axis of assistance in the region and they are trying to astroturf anti-resistance feeling why is it that on the same day you had Mahmud Abbas come out this Israeli spy this filthy killer and torturer to death of Palestinians Mahmud Abbas came out with the statement he said he said &quot;Give up the hostages you sons of dogs.&quot; This is what Mahmud Abbas said on the very same day El Jolani arrests the leadership of Islamic Jihad in Syria not long after that he arrestal Naji from the PFLP the same period the Jordanian government outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood which is essentially about targeting Hamas so all of that happens on the same day or within days of each other so this is the axis of assistance which in the region is pushing to astroturf these anti-resistance ideas who remembers the reports that Arabia the Saudi channel were putting out about the leadership of Palestinian resistance factions and then the reaction from the Iraqis when they went down and they and they shut down Arabia they are trying as much as they can to warp people's perceptions of this entire situation they are trying to give the mood music for Israel to carry out this uh genocide on the Palestinians and and and look at Yemen look at what Yemen has contributed to humanity when you even look at the um the um the the the convention on genocide you have very clearly laid out the basis at which an intervention should take place yemen has launched the most humanitarian of humanity the mo the most humane of humanitarian interventions that we've ever seen when the resistance in Lebanon was um directly engaging the Israeli en enemy what were they striking they were striking military targets they were striking military targets there was a point when they struck a house of Benjamin Netanyahu yeah frankly as somebody who has a uh a an arrest war well who is who is believed by the International Criminal Court and wanted for um for the crime of genocide that is a legitimate target yeah so really what you've seen is the resistance forces in the region carry out their engagement in this with far greater respect for international humanitarian law than any of the other actors that we're talking about we're talking about high techch savagery and barbarism visited upon poor starving people and actually this Gaza Humanitarian Foundation these aid sites they are disappearing Palestinians on a daily basis they are baiting them so they can be massacred on mass and I'm certain I am certain they are being used to try and bully and and uh intimidate and torture Palestinians into some form of collaboration and it's the direct use of food for political uh purposes that's certainly what's happening at these at these uh sites and and I do believe there's greater Gulf involvement even in terms of the mercenary groups that are manning some of the checkpoints videos have come out of some of them some of the individuals have been Egyptian some of the individuals have been speaking in in in Gulf Arabic there's a video I've seen of one speaking the with an Iraqi accent where are these people coming from what's happening here exactly um and so you know all of that will come out um as time goes on uh the extent of collaboration that all of this has uh has entailed yeah vers Randi your your final comments on this before moving on i understand why some people are pessimistic and uh people raise these issues often but I I I don't feel that that is really u a valid belief i think that uh the resistance obviously is always going to face great difficulty you have an alliance behind Israel that uh is has been controlling world affairs for centuries and uh since the second world war the United States has had uh an empire that after the collapse of the Soviet Union literally became universal and as both Ali and uh Loki have pointed out you have regional countries that uh have been collaborating they've been cooperating in in one form or another so in Lebanon for instance many people think that Hezbollah is the government hezbollah has never been the government lebanon is a is a country where the United States and the Europeans and these collab regimes that collaborate with the west either as part of NATO or as a part of their regional uh alliances uh they have they have huge uh influence and they have uh NOS's and spies and embassies that have always been working against the resistance unlike in Yemen where Ansarah is in control of much of or most of the uh country which is has a a significant population and unlike in Gaza where Hamas is in control of the has always been in control of that territory lebanon is not like that lebanon is a deeply divided country and uh the United States has fascist allies in Lebanon which uh are always stabbing the resistance in the back the Hezbollah accepted the ceasefire because Lebanon was divided and there are strong elements there are people in parliament in Lebanon who support Israel there are people in parliament and in government who want to see Hezbollah bombed that's how divided the country is the majority is with the resistance according to polls according to election results but it's still deeply divided in the West we know where they stand we know where the oil and gas rich countries in the Persian Gulf stand don't be fooled by some television outlet that supports the Palestinians in Gaza in the broader picture they are in the American camp all of these countries are in the American camp so it's very difficult for Hezbollah it's very difficult for Ans to do more than what it is doing it's under siege it's being starved and of course Hamas is in a terribly difficult position along with its allies like Islamic Jihad but I agree with what Ali is saying resistance is not going to go away what the Israeli regime is actually doing in Lebanon is that it's strengthening Hezbollah because it is showing that those who put forward the argument to fool the population that the Lebanese state in cooperation with the United States will end Zionist aggression the ceasefires prove that that's nonsense even now we're seeing for the first time last night the president and even the prime minister who's the prime minister of Lebanon who's more than pro-American even they have had to take a stand so the country the population those who were sort of in the middle are seeing that the issue is not Hezbollah the issue is that Zionism is an ideology which does not accept peace it does not accept borders it only believes in domination and supremacism so what Netanyahu is doing is he's ultimately strengthening Hezbollah hezbollah is preparing itself there's no doubt and the same is true in Syria they've occupied key areas in Syria but people in Syria are not going to accept that if the the new regime that's come to power this regime that's been installed by the West and its regional clients if this regime fails to retake Syrian territory all of those territories take that have been occupied by the Israeli regime then it will lose its legitimacy in the eyes of those who saw it to be legitimate or those who want it to be legitimate or those who are willing to wait and see if they're going to take back or that territory is going to be taken back these areas now occupied by the Israeli regime in Syria are are the most important parts of Syria they are the most important parts of Syria and of course it's also it adds to the threat against Hezbollah because Hezbollah is now surrounded on its uh eastern flank as well they'll manage but in any case it's this land is very ter it's very very very important so this situation in Syria is not going to be sustainable and all these terrorist groups that are under this umbrella organization controlled by Golani they're going to turn against one another for a host of different reasons and people are going to see how fanaticism and these groups many of them foreigners from Central Asia and China and elsewhere that uh they are going to be they are more busy suppressing Syrians rather than taking back territory taken by the Israeli regime so in the short term the Israelis may have success in Syria but in the long term I think actually they are proving to everyone that they are the problem and what they are doing is actually in the long run I think going to take away the tools that the West and regional oil and gas rich dictatorships use to divide the region sectarianism racial hatred and other means through which they keep the region divided remember these all of these countries are in the American camp all of them whatever you know whether it's the Emirates or the Qataris which despise each other they're still in the American camp whether it's Turkey or Saudi Arabia which despise each other or dislike each other they're still in the American camp the American camp is the problem it is the United States that's the problem but I think it's becoming clear to everyone that the region cannot live with Zionism and the not only is this true about the people in the region but it's true about people across the world the Israeli regime has exhausted itself the resistance continues in Palestine the resistance is fighting back in Yemen the resistance in Lebanon is rebuilding itself the American Israeli NATO project in Syria is bound to fail hatred towards the regime is overwhelming across the region one of the things that I find so fascinating so extraordinary is that none of these despotic regimes or none of these regimes that are facilitating the genocide or that are accommodating the genocide none of them are they if they took a stand against the regime the Israeli regime they would become they would be the most it would create popularity for them among their populations imagine if Turkey took a stand imagine if Egypt took a stand imagine if any other country in the region took a stand if if the Emirates took a stand the leaders in these countries regardless of the nature of their their regimes they would have the the overwhelming majority of the people behind them because this is a cause that now everyone believes in beyond the region everyone believes in so I think that in the long run this is like it's working against the Israeli regime and it's working against the collaborators who cooperate with the regime it's working against the West it's working it the Israeli regime has lost its legitimacy across the world people look down at Zionism people look with disgust at what they do whether it's in China or in Central Asia or in Latin America the new polls that have come out that I think Ali has done an article on they show they indicate how badly things are going for the Israeli regime so I think we should remain optimistic the axis of resistance is very much active the axis of resistance will continue to grow and the broader resistance that goes beyond the axis of resistance the global resistance is on the rise i'm I'm very confident about the future that these are dark days what we're seeing on the ground is very painful but I think that ultimately the Israeli regime has has sealed its fate it is not going to last yeah well I think it's is a good transition uh to our final uh story uh Ali this one centers on you so you can definitely begin i wanted to pull up your uh I think very important coverage of the new polls that have come out um that have shown that revulsion for Israel as you said is surging worldwide according to the survey here the Pew survey i mean it's absolutely stunning um and then you just look at the west or I mean some of these countries like you say Hungaria you could argue it's not the west Poland but just the very unfavorable in Netherlands Spain this is of Israel itself the opinion of Israel 75% Spain 75% Sweden even the United States 53% 60% Canada I mean this is this is a I think a stunning development Ali so talk about this research what it reveals and uh why why it's significant uh given uh all that uh you've been covering yeah it is significant you know I mean the the thing is this this is a survey done in 24 countries by the Pew Research Center which is sort of one of the most respectable mainstream US institutions so this is really an establishment think tank that did this survey in 24 countries and really it it's stunning evidence of just how unpopular Israel is around the world and they actually say in 20 of the 24 countries surveyed around half of adults or more have an unfavorable view of Israel around 3/4 or more hold this view in Australia Greece Indonesia Japan the Netherlands Spain Sweden and Turkey and it's notable that say in Europe among the countries surveyed in Europe the Netherlands had the highest uh negative views of Israel at 78% which is remarkable given that historically the ne the Netherlands is one of the most pro-Israel countries in Europe um and then look look at Germany 64% uh which is also remarkable given the solid support across German political elites for the genocide you know whether you talk about the Green Party or the Christian uh Democrats or the Social Democrats or whoever they are that's not reflected that you know the public opinion in Germany is disgusted twothirds of German the German public are disgusted with Israel and you mentioned Hungary even Hungary you have a majority of the population that has a negative view of Israel and that's remarkable too because Victor Oban the Hungarian prime minister is the only leader in Europe who openly welcomed uh Netanyahu to visit Budapest a couple of months ago vi uh you know flagrantly violating Hungary 's uh legal obligation to arrest him on that international criminal court arrest warrant and then if you take um the United States I mean there are some things that are not surprising here uh and and then again in light of Loki's comments about Turkey 93% of the Turkish Turkish public have very negative views of Israel they didn't survey Jordan Lebanon Saudi Arabia Egypt because I think it would have been redundant to do such a survey it would have you know been 98 or 99% yes you have a small elite that is pro- Israel but the public are certainly not um or if not if not pro- Israel certainly not willing to to do anything real to oppose it but um remarkably I think it's very notable that in the United States there have been for many years now polls showing you know if you go back a decade or more there have been polls showing that the support among uh certain subgroups of Americans for Israel has eroded steadily so for example among Democrats among younger people among people of color for a while now there have been majorities who view Israel negatively or who support Palestinian rights what's new in this survey is that for the first time that I've ever seen and I've been looking at this stuff for 30 years for the first time I've ever seen you have a sort of a credible respectable polling organization finding a majority of Americans overall turning against Israel that is unprecedented and there's if you dig deeper into it it's even more interesting because Pew observes that in general in many of the countries that it surveyed people who place themselves on the political left have a more negative view of Israel than those on the right but that ideolog ide ideological gap is more pronounced in the US where 74% of liberals have a negative view of Israel compared with 30% of conservatives so it's been true for a while that Israel has more and more become a right-wing conservative cause but but even that is breaking down now because Pew did another survey in April focusing on the United States and they found a sharp rise in the number of Republican voters who view Israel favorably rising from 27% to 37% since 2022 indicating that Israel is losing support across the political spectrum and we've seen that um reflected also in the emergence of a relatively new phenomenon of really prominent right right-wing commentators like Tucker Carlson Candace Owens Judge Npalitano voicing skepticism about US support for or ties with Israel and sometimes really harsh criticism and denunciation of Israel's genocide side so that really is a new phenomenon in the US this breakdown in support not just on the left or the liberal sphere but even on the right i've never seen that before so and again the the the the reason the Israel lobby has worried about this for so long particularly the erosion among younger Americans is because that's where the future is the future of the US support for Israel when this generation of young Americans grows up they're not going to want to keep spending billions to finance genocide and that's why US politicians have been in such a panic it's why they're they're focusing their crackdown on college campuses it's why they want to ban Tik Tok because they're hoping uh like King Canute that they can turn back the tide and I don't think they can there's nothing nothing no multi-billion dollar PR campaigns that are going to counteract the horrific reality of this genocide that is streamed in high definition to our phones every day there's nothing you can say about that there's nothing that that Israel can say that can justify what it's doing there's nothing that Hamas did or could have done or that Israel claims it falsely that it did on October 7th that is going to convince anyone that mass murdering people at uh so-called aid distribution hubs is justified that um blowing the limbs off thousands of children is justified that attacking hospitals is justified that starving two million people to death is justified the good news is we don't live in a world where ordinary people see that as normal or acceptable yes our lead our so-called leaders are willing to accept it are willing to be silent about it in order to keep their uh seats or or their privileges or whatever but the world is turning against it israel is done low key I know your time is short for you so I definitely want to get you in here absolutely and you know what's fascinating is in the UK context you had the Israel lobby have such a free run in the Corbin years literally almost every single prominent journalist was singing from the very same himsh sheet with talking points that came directly from Israel lobby groups 247 corbinism was something I have never seen you are talking about the uh confection of a supposed crisis for Israel's foreign policy gain in Britain but also the British establishment murdering a uh someone seemed to be a a radical um in Corbinism and so literally reproducing these things now all of those same journalists that during those that time did such a service to the lobby are now essentially trying to save their souls this is about their own redemption and this is about saving their own legacy and so they're making quite a big song and dance of the fact that now they sort of can recognize at least partially Palestinian h humanity but what I worry about in all of this is that you know Zionism has always been a topheavy movement and so what I mean by that is you have many of these supposedly right-wing some actually right-wing um podcast hosts actually ranging from you know Joe Rogan to even you know someone on the more liberal end like Piers Morgan all of these individuals have their podcast sponsored by ExpressVPN now ExpressVPN is a subsidiary of Cape Technologies kate Technologies was founded by Teddy Sagi who's given $3 million to the Israeli military during the genocide uh the company was headed it had CEO Ido Erlikman who was from the Duvdean unit unit 217 the Mustin um it was also founded with alumni of unit 8200 in the Israeli military um this Teddy Saggy has made very clear his political um orientations in this equation and so what you then have to think of is if ExpressVPN is being used by people all over the world also and if these now critical of Zionism um right-wingish uh podcast hosts are now um directing their users towards ExpressVPN how has Israel engineered the infrastructure of this entire system to work in its uh in its advantage you know you also have to look at for example the whether it's the Leavon affair in Egypt where you had the Abdas government and uh the Israelis the defense minister at the time uh Leavonne they sought ways to literally plant bombs at sites of both American and uh Jewish um uh use in Egypt you have the same thing play out in Iraq with the amazing book the law of Zion he really shows how Tofi passed the law the denaturalization law which would allow Iraqis to become Israelis no one took them up on the offer no one took them up on the offer so what did the very new Israeli external intelligence agency MOSAD do it literally placed bombs at synagogues and so I guess my fear in all of this is the type of tricks that Israel will resort to in in uh in trying to turn back this tide and also the extent to which it has been able to entrench itself within the infrastructure and the the big tech aspect um of this of all of these states you look at the Netherlands for example um you know there's huge pro Palestinian feeling when you had the Makabe uh hooligans there running riot their repulsion was largely supported by people across the Netherlands but what is the case of the Netherlands you've had literally since the '9s their uh hacking carried out for the Dutch government by Verin which is an Israeli company and then after that now cyber intelligence an Elvis system subsidiary has the right to hack phones for the Netherlands um internal uh intelligence operations so it literally means that states across the world in Europe and in the Middle East are outsourcing their internal and external intelligence functions which key part of their sovereignity to the Israelis so I wonder about how entrenched that is and what kind of leverage that can potentially give the Israelis to try and bully um particularly political elites and others within these within these societies but certainly on a popular level Zionism has never been more naked than it is today indeed indeed uh I want to get Professor Mandi in here though but uh low key uh this might be the final comment uh do you want to do you need to go now or later i definitely want to promote i just say keep up the absolutely amazing work i'm so happy for example that the electronic interfer exists in the world all of our understandings of all of this not only during this period during the Corbyn years and long prior to the Corbyn years all of our understandings would be far poorer were it not for the electronic interfa so may you continue and keep strong and thank you Danny and Professor Miranda it's great to see you all as uh as as always and hope to see you again soon thank you well everybody everybody go to the video description and find uh Loki's link to all his tour dates if you happen to be in the area uh out west uh out in the UK I believe but uh Professor Morandi your comments on what we've been discussing here i I don't think um there's much that I can add to what Ali and Loki have already said uh I think that uh the tide has turned i I I've believed this for a very long time now and I think actually if Pew had been more representative in its u choices uh it would have looked a lot worse for the Israeli regime uh I I took a very brief look at the art at uh the piece in electronic inifat which everyone should be uh constantly uh studying at electronic inifat in general uh Argentina which is an extremely white right-wing government the if I'm not mistaken the the the the amount of disgust towards the Israeli regime is very high even though the president has converted to Zionism uh or in the case of India which has always been an exception to the rule it doesn't look too good for Zionism they're not uh they don't have this strong majority they have a minority of support uh in China my understanding through my different trips there and through my uh communications and the meetings with Chinese scholars and students the population is overwhelming overwhelmingly critical of the Israeli regime the same is true in Russia in our region it would be almost 100% as Ali mentioned earlier in Iran the only people who would support Israel are some young liberals who really may support the Israeli regime out of spite and whenever I have conversations with them on campus their arguments quickly fall apart in Iran it's uh almost universal the hatred for the regime again as except for a certain class of people who I think out of out of uh spite they may take a different position but I think deep down they all know where the truth stands so uh I see this is the death of Zionism it is when when it is despised across the world it cannot sustain itself and when it is despised universally across the region by uh the population regardless of what some of these elites do uh I don't see a future for it it is tired it is not doing well after almost after 20 months of genocide we saw today them take losses they are overstretched their economy is falling apart and their supporters in the west are the west itself is in terrible shape they have the the Israeli regime is dependent on the west for its existence the west is no longer the empire that governs the world it is the empire is collapsing before our eyes the what we saw between Trump and uh yesterday and and and how Musk was attacking him i think is just reflective of a broader problem in the United States and in the west at large that the west no longer has that unity it no longer has that authority it no longer has that aura of strength and power that it had before and without that without the overwhelming uh power of the west and the US empire how how is the regime going to sustain itself it is completely dependent on it those who in the west who like to say that the Israelis are uh the supreme power in the region or they're the superpower in the region the Israeli regime is is a puny tiny vulnerable weak regime that is completely dependent on the West for everything it does all of this whole genocide is being carried out with Western wealth with Western money with Western support if the United States or even the Europeans if they withheld their support for the Israeli regime for a few weeks it would be over the regime would be over right now the Germans the the British and the French at the UN Security Council they voted for a ceasefire it was only the Americans that vetoed it but will the British and the French really do anything against the Israelis they will continue to support the Israelis the Germans will continue to support the Israelis and they'll even purchase Israeli weapons in order to help fund the genocide but they are on the decline so this com this regime that is completely dependent which had the benefit of Western media Western soft power that was able to to in the past create a favorable environment for the Israeli regime and and Zionists across the world that media has failed western soft power has failed western economies the Western Empire is failing it they they no longer have it no longer has the power and authority that it had before so Israel's support is weakening on all fronts it is failing at home people despise it this is not this is not good news at all and I personally think that Netanyahu is destroying the Israeli regime he is the person who's he is destroying it because he's not even fighting for the interests of Zionism he's fighting for the interests of Netanyahu and Netanyahu's allies and he's allied with these people for the sake of Netanyahu so ultimately I you know again as I said a few minutes ago 10 15 minutes ago I'm optimistic about the future i think the resistance and the access of resistance will continue to degrade the regime's capability and the United States which has overextended itself in trade wars in in uh in Ukraine where Trump foolishly foolishly was unable to bring an end to the war he he could have ended the war and he didn't and now this war is going to continue to degrade the capabilities of of of the West so they've overextended themselves on multiple fronts they've destroyed their image because of their support for the Holocaust things I'm I'm optimistic i'm optimistic about the future of Palestine the suffering that we see day and night is intolerable but uh I I definitely see light at the end of the tunnel yeah uh Ali it was your article so I maybe I'll give you the final word actually because um after hearing what person and and Loki before he left said uh what immediately came to mind was you know all successful resistance movements had this element where the outside world or the world perhaps around uh the resistance wherever it is uh really came to its support i'm curious if you think that is what has been happening and and whether it will accelerate but any final thoughts you have on your uh piece here yeah I I think I want to make a general point that I hope everyone who's watching and listening to this whether they're watching it live now or later on YouTube or any other medium should know is that the voices of people around the world actually matter and the reason we're seeing now some things starting to shift the governments in the West particularly where Israel's base of support is will resist till the very end any change they will hold on to their beloved Israel as long as they can and I'm on an old I'm old enough to remember that that's how it was with apartheid South Africa now in hindsight everyone likes to pretend that they were against apartheid in South Africa when Nelson Mandela died Barack Obama and all those Western leaders went to his funeral and they were taking selfies and pretending like they thought he was a hero at the time when most of those governments treated him and the African National Congress as terrorists and they supported the apartheid regime and every western university resisted and refused divestment and uh the governments the western governments particularly West Germany the same Germany that supports the genocide now in Palestine West Germany was opposed to sanctions on apartheid South Africa Margaret Thatcher the British prime minister was opposed to sanctions on apartheid South Africa Ronald Reagan the US president was opposed to sanctions on the genocidal white supremacist regime in apartheid South Africa why did it change it changed because of people power it changed because the public made that politically untenable yes there were also ge geopolitical factors as well just as there are now by the way you know this was coming towards the end of the Cold War and the West didn't need South Africa as an asset as an anti-communist uh anti- colon an anti-communist pro-colonial pro- empire asset in southern Africa the same way there are geopolitical shifts now and Israel is lo losing its relevance as the US empire declines so I want to emphasize that people power is essential the voices the protests uh showing visible solidarity in any way you can it's all so important speaking out on social media they haven't shut us down yet they you know with all the manipulation of algorithms and all of this kind of thing they still can't make Israel's crimes disappear from people's screens and consciences and so people have to keep it up your voices matter this is why they're cracking down with such heavy-handed and crude censorship in the West uh arresting journalists arresting college students smearing people all these tactics are because they know they're losing and we are winning humanity is winning so keep it up don't despair yes our hearts break yes we're sad yes it's okay it's okay when you see and hear the suffering that's going on in Gaza it's okay to cry it's okay to mourn we need to do that because what we're seeing is horrible but don't despair because we are winning globally we're winning humanity is winning justice is winning things are they we will see i believe I believe it visualize it it will happen that when Netanyahu falls when Israel uh when Israel um uh you know unravels even more than it is now the way these western corrupt regimes are going to um redeem themselves is just the way some of the western pro- genocide journalists are now now they're saying &quot;Oh you know Pierce Morgan uh Dr mirand's friend Pierce Morgan uh of course I'm being sarcastic there but uh you know now Pierce Morgan is trying to rescue his reputation by being critical of Israel western leaders and governments will do that too and I believe we will see Benjamin Netanyahu uh arrested and brought to trial and that of course will only be the beginning of accountability for this genocide could I just add a couple of very quick points one I agree with everything Patty said uh even if even if if even in my opinion if the situation was hopeless we all have a responsibility nevertheless we have to support what is right and oppose what is wrong but the regime is losing the regime is lo the Zionist regime is losing on all fronts and therefore we all have to push harder and young people have done a fantastic job young Jews young Christians young Muslims young Hindus we saw the young lady uh at MIT take such a heroic stance and people across the world saw saw it we have to all of us collectively continue pushing hard everyone doesn't matter how much influence we have what it's our intentions that they count so now is the time the regime and uh I think Loki may or maybe it was Ali alluded to this that they they're desperate they may go for false flag operations they will do whatever they can to turn the tide but I think it's too late and I think people are too too much awake but we have to continue pushing harder and harder and when Netanyahu falls and he will fall whether he's uh he will be I agree I think he will probably be arrested not for necessarily the right reasons but he will probably be arrested by the regime itself for other reasons but the regime post Netanyahu is going to be in a far more in a far worse situation than it is today and today it's in a very very bad situation well I think this is a great place to end the conversation um by the way sorry correct myself when I say he will he may be arrested for the fall wrong reasons I don't mean that he isn't corrupt i mean the real reason why he should be arrested and put on trial is for the Holocaust but the Zionists themselves corrupt as they are they will they will probably arrest him for corruption yeah that's uh I don't know if there are truer words spoken there Professor Mandi it seems very likely that's going to be the case without further ado though this was a a great conversation we really covered a lot of ground i want to thank Loki of course you had to run uh a little earlier uh I want to of course thank you Ali thank you Professor Morandi uh we can find your work in the video description both of you uh your Twitter uh Pro

          <attvalue for="3" value="Israeli settler violence against Palestinians in the Occupied West Bank has surged to record levels. For decades, the Israeli government has often tolerated such violence, and the recent Hamas attack has only intensified settlers' drive for revenge and their efforts to displace Palestinians. This violence not only reinforces Israeli control over occupied land but also fuels Palestinian militancy, potentially opening yet another front in an escalating regional war.

          <attvalue for="7" value="Israeli settler violence against Palestinian in the occupied West Bank has a long history dating back to 1967 but since 7th of October it has surged to record levels for decades the Israeli government has failed to check and often tolerated such violence now hamas's attack on Israel has only fueled Settler's determination to take revenge and force Palestinians from their homes so Sellar violence is kind of a catchall phrase it basically describes various ways in which Israeli civilians or citizens who live in occupied territory harm disturb terrorize prevent access for Palestinians since 1967 almost without exception consecutive Israeli governments have supported the settlement Enterprise the support has intensified under prime minister Benjamin netanyahu's government which has boosted Israel's settlement project and includes ministers representing the Hardline elements within in the settler [Music] movement these officials condone and justify attacks on Palestinians even before 7th of October 2023 was already the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank in the first half alone there were 591 settler attacks against Palestinians and now average of 95 per month or nearly three per day from 7 October through August 2024 there have been over 1,000 settler attacks on Palestinians it's important to note that settler violence while it is its own phenomenon is part and parcel with what the occupation is which is State violence which is all different kinds of ways in which the government and the Army prevents Palestinians from living normal lives so it could range from anything from preventing access to a road which will lead to their agricultural end to coming and assaulting them and beating them to harassing them sometimes settler violence is driven by revenge in 2023 following incidents in which Palestinians shot and killed Israelis Israeli settlers rampaged through the Palestinian Villages of ha and turmusaya they destroyed property and terrorized residents despite neither Village being connected to the shootings that supposedly provoke these attacks however a more fundamental motive is to drive Palestinians of their land in the past year entire communities have been forcibly displaced by settlers [Music] [Music] Palestinian beding communities who rely on grazing for their livelihoods are especially vulnerable settler cattle Farmers frequently seize large areas of grazing land under the pretense of farming or hering establishing outposts these outposts which are unauthorized by the Israeli State severely restrict access for beding herders and often provoke violent [Music] confrontations for settler violence also targets Palestinian agriculture settlers often destroy crops uproot trees and damage farming equipment inflicting significant economic losses on Palestinian Farmers see they come through here look how they bend the the fence and they come through there they are very dangerous if you try to do something to them they kill you I'm surrounded over this area surrounded by five to six settlements this settlement it's been over 15 20 years they cut uh the trees maybe more than 200 trees they cut for me and not just one time they keep doing it and doing it and doing it they have the well over here they damage it I tried to put the fence they stole it then I bought it again they cut it then I bought it again and they keep damag it though senior Israelis security officials have condemned egregious incidents the Israeli Defense Forces or IDF often overlook this violence settlers many of whom now serve as reservists with weapons and uniforms provided by the Army have gained more influence within the security forces soldiers increasingly come from West Bank settlements and often are trained in National Religious camps and in general Prov violence views are growing among younger Israelis in mandatory service the IDF primarily its Duty in the occupied territory in practice is to protect Jewish Israelis from Terror and to protect settlers in general under international law under the belligan occupation they are supposed to protect the Palestinian as the occupied population in practice they don't do that so we've actually seen more and more cases over the years of uh soldiers not only not doing anything when settlers uh harm Palestinians but actually supporting and protecting them from anything that could Poss Poss happen and and ensuring that settlers are fine while the Palestinians are harmed so the IDF really not only doesn't do anything about it it actually sometimes also actively supports settlers the police which is a far far less resource and has much less people on the ground in certain cases might show up and try to talk to the Palestinians and take a testimony but in most cases not even that happens the majority of settlers claim that the term settler violence is derogatory meant to defame all settlers as violent some however justify the violence as part of what they consider a necessary battle a conflict over land if you ask settler leaders Community leaders about settler violence they'll tell you it's a very very small number of people who are acting like anarchists and for the most part it doesn't really exist as a phenomenon um but uh when you look at the phenomenon of settler violence what you see is that settlers are basically trying to take over land and the best way for them to take over land is to intimidate and harass Palestinians in ways that might not even be that explicit or active but that in ultimately lead Palestinians to live in fear to have their economies and their livelihoods Disturbed in and in which case they will often times try to leave their their homes settler violence is rendering the possibility of a just and durable solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict further from reach it is enabling further Israeli takeover of occupied land fueling Palestinian militancy and increasing the likelihood of a larger outbreak of violence while decreasing prospects for Palestinian political renewal despite this dangers Western Powers have been reluctant to take stronger action sanctions that the US and European countries have imposed on some violent settlers are a step forward but fall short of addressing the root of the problem doing so would require a sustained unified commitment from foreign powers without concerted action Israel's annexation of the West Bank and the accompanying Bloodshed will accelerate not only harming Palestinians but potentially creating yet another front in an expanding Regional War [Music]" />

of an Israeli ground offensive on the area and caused by its politicians to permanently expel Palestinians from the strip fears are growing of yet another the force population transfer people in power investigates we should create a humanitarian problem that will force Egypt and turkey and Europe to absorb the Arabs as refugees the purpose of the Zionist project was the Eraser of the Palestinian people the methodology was mostly expulsion intimidation and massacres Ya Allah Ya Allah Ya Allah since October 7th 2023 about 2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have had to flee for their lives to escape death and destruction which has followed them even in areas they've been told are safe zones thear thear came Israel's war on Gaza has wrought an unprecedented humanitarian disaster push to and cornered in rafah through air and land assaults by the Israeli Army gazans fear the worst people and power set out to investigate if population transfer of the Palestinians in Gaz and the occupied West Bank is Israel's ultimate goal as of February 21st 2024 close to 30,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli Army and more than 60,000 wounded and maimed thousands more are missing many presumed dead under the rubble Israel's real aim is clear is to empty the land of Palestinians Marwan Masher Jordan's former foreign minister and once ambassador to both Washington and Tel Aviv has long been involved in Arab Israeli relations Israel is obliterating all forms of life in Gaza not just human life but the infrastructure the schools the places of worship uh the hospitals in a clear attempt to make Gaza uninhabitable so that Palestinians are forced to leave Jordan has taken the lead in warning the world about the dangers of large-scale population transfers of Palestinians I I think on the first part of the question on the issues of refugees coming to Jordan and I think I can quite strongly speak on behalf not only of Jordan as a nation but of uh our friends in Egypt that is a red line uh because I think that is the plan by certain of The Usual Suspects to try and create de facto issues on the ground no refugees in Jordan no refugees in Egypt a lot of people in the west uh look at this and say how can people not allow uh Palestinians to get in but in fact this is a position coordinated with the Palestinians themselves who have learned the lesson from 1948 who do not wish to leave uh and so the the decision to close the border is actually a decision not to allow Israel to solve the conflict at the Palestinians expense and drive Palestinians out of their land most UN member States including Western Powers have expressed concerns for the fate of gza's 2.3 million people they have publicly condemned Israeli politicians and leaders who call for the expulsion of the Palestinians on January 28th at least 10 Israeli cabinet ministers participated in a reset settle Gaza event in Jerusalem Israeli National Security Minister itamir benir addressed a cheering [Music] crowd there will be no Arabs in the Gaza Street they will go to Turkey to Scotland to Britain I want them out of Gaza and we'll use different methods one of them is not to give them any human humanitarian Aid so the countries of the world will have pity on them and take them at one of the few entry points into Raza Israeli settlers storm Aid convoys preventing them from delivering food and medicine one of the families waiting for Aid is that of Amir jaaji in October 2023 they fled Gazza City to a refugee camp in Rafa after their home was bombarded and their neighborhood destroyed experts say plans to displace and transfer these Palestinians began decades ago the most important method used by these European Jewish settlers to take over a land that will belonged to the Palestinians and build their own Homeland on it the main method they were using was ethnic cleansing expulsion transfer if you want Professor Elan Pape is Israel's foremost historian on the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians it really begins in the late 19th century when an ideological movement called Zionism uh decides that the best way to solve the problem of anti-Semitism in Europe and the best way for a modern future for the Jewish people is in the land of Palestine so in that period between the late 19th century and the end of the first world war Zionism becomes effect on the ground in in Palestine at the time it was the United Kingdom which was a Chief Architect and Ally of zist aspirations in Palestine the British ruled Palestine as part of their colonial portfolio between 1918 and 1948 so in the mid 1920s the Zionist movement succeeds in buying land in Palestine in two places called Wadi haari and marbar before Zionism people also bought Land There were transaction but the custom was The Villages who lived there for centuries remain I mean the change of ownership does not appro the Zionist as land owners the first thing they do they go to the British government and say you should evict The Villages so already in 1926 they evicted 11 Villages uh which means few thousand people were the First Palestinian victims of ethnic cleansing deprived of their farmlands expelled Palestinian villagers became part of the urban working class over the next decade Palestinian resistance against Zionist settlers took the form of strikes and rallies and increasingly armed resistance killings of Palestinian leaders by the British contributed to the 1936 Arab Revolt after the Revolt the British sent a commission to Palestine and the commission was the first to think of the idea of two states that included the relocation the term was of some of the population Professor Assam Nassar is a Palestinian historian whose focus is the history of the British mandate period the main champion at the time was someone with the name of you vites and whites was the head of the Jewish National Fund whose job was to acquire lands for Jewish use only uh the discussions went further to the level that they started to think of where do we move these Palestinians so when we reach the end of the Mandate that is May 1948 you can see that the Zionist movement managed to buy five to 6% of the land of Palestine that's all because people resisted and uh not everybody was willing to send land understanding that purchase of land immediately is followed by eviction of people it's a settler Colonial movement of a project of displacement and replacement like all set the colonial movements if they don't complete the Takeover of the land and the transfer of the people they will continue because they really believe ideologically that without a total control of the land geographically but also demographically namely to have it an absolute majority or just an absolute presence that's also the main motivation for the Israeli edin today in the Gaza Strip and also it's the Israeli plans for the day after while the refugees in Rafa ponder their day after moment that day came for yakui in the spring of 1948 when Zionist forces expelled them from their home in lifa outside Jerusalem leaving their homes uninhabitable and banning them to this day from ever [Music] returning Yak keeps his family property Deeds photos and a house key from lifa close to his heart first of to prepare a master plan for the expulsion in March called Plan D plan dallet and in April and the beginning of may they implemented and the first stage of Plan D was to take over the urban space of Palestine and they depopulate most of the Palestinian cities out of the 75,000 people who lived in hia only 3,000 remain hi's old Arab neighborhoods today are sprinkled with Arabic names signs here and there and old photographs on the homes of those who were driven out south of hia yea was another major Palestinian Port City that was forcibly depopulated by Zionist forces samad's family was among the few that managed to remain the main tools for uh ethnic lensing of Palestine between 1947 and 1949 was Violence by different Zionist terrorist groups at that time the British called them terrorist groups all the important Palestinian cities yaa Ram people were expelled if you are imagining what is what is now being done to the Palestinians in Gaza so they are pushing all the Palestinian population towards the city of Rafa towards the border and they said clearly that their strategic plan is expulsion and they said that the preferable scenario is total expulsion of 2.3 million people from Gaza to Sinai and then they not also want to keep them in sa they want to spread them all over the world the Israeli Ministry of Intelligence on October 13th 2023 recommended the forcible and permanent expulsion of the 2.3 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip to Egypt's Sinai Peninsula after a leaked copy was published by the Israeli magazine plus 972 Israel's Ministry of intelligence verified the authenticity of the document the vast majority of gazza's new refugees are descendants of families expelled from what is now Israel including Amir jaaji and her family for the majority were expelled through the sea because Jaffa is a coastal city those who went South I'm talking about tens of thousands of people were expelled to Gaza Gaza is only Gaz Gaza is only 65 kilometers far from Jaffa Juliet Tuma is one of the few Aid workers who's been able to enter Gaza during the war places like schools for example had to be converted into shelters what we call and even those shelters were never spared during the war we have recorded more than 300 people who were killed during those hits and over a thousand people who were injured only in unare facilities the so-called evacuation or ERS that the Israeli authorities um kept on issuing especially the first one under which at least 1 million people were impacted they created this sense of sheer panic and people quite often just left and left everything behind experts say today's events are a continuation of a s decade long Israeli practice of forcing Palestinians out of their homes and then barring them from ever returning in first of all there was a ethnic cleansing of about 300,000 Palestinians in the immediate aftermath of the June 67 War since 67 until uh today Israel used an incremental policy of ethnic cleansing around half a million Palestinians were uh expelled in one way or another or ban from returning which is the same past policies demonstrate that attempts to end Gaza are not new in 1967 and there was a plan particularly of uh reducing the number of refugees in Gaza and there were talks about let's destroy the refugee camps and transfer this population to Jordan and until Jordan started to prevent gazin from entering Jordan a total of 12,000 gazin were let into Jordan in 1969 and temporarily settled in a refugee camp near jash the Gaza Camp is the poorest most marginalized camp in Jordan and that's because the residents of that camp they don't have the national ID that they need to allow them to work nazal is a co-founder of a Cooperative that helps gazan women refugees in Jordan find culturally relevant employment Amal aradi is the descendant of gazen Palestinians who were driven out of their homes twice by Israeli forces so you can see over the past 75 years consistent attempts to erase Palestinian identity simple ways like co-opting hos but T is a way for us to affirm the existence and continuity of the Palestinian identity so now you see symbols like the watermelon like embroidery like the cfia even without embroidery being used within the global solidarity movement and within the Palestinian diaspora as a further confirmation not only do we exist but now everyone knows that we exist over the years Jordan became a way station for millions of Palestinians pushed out of their homes and expelled into other countries I am a descendant of AAR solite family God bless his soul ABD my father and he s is in katamon which is in the west part of Jerusalem which was occupied in 48 so we were forced to leave or we were kicked out in the war of 48 these are parts of the structural and Architectural plans of our home in katamon and I see the stamp date and it says City engineering department 4th of January 1945 this is which I was very happy to see or find my father's signature as an owner and that's his name here Muhammad ATA runs a farm in the Jordan Valley right across from his birthplace in Jericho he is one of up to 4 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan who await the moment they can return to their former homes and we left Jero when I was 13 during the war 67 one of the things that is kept in my memory is how we left all the whole family we were 12 children and my mom and maybe some of the neighbors all backed in one vehicle well I remember another thing that isra Al ples were bombing people as they were leaving talking about things repeating itself and one family that was killed with an airplane an Israeli airplane was killed here not far from the farm across the Jordan River in the occupied West Bank Israel has walled in and isolated most urban areas and declared many rural Communities closed military are areas a samama a community of 300 was declared a closed military zone in May 2023 and its residents expelled in 2023 alone a dozen such communities were banished at gunpoint the people of aamia now live in Barracks less than 15 km from their former homes in the occupied West Bank more than 300 Palestinians have been killed by both Israeli settlers and the Army since the war in Gaza began in a parallel Battlefield Israel has a mechanism of about 200,000 people are daily employed to police the Palestinians wherever they are and part of this policing is also dealing with sometime individual cases of ethnic cleansing but it's a Perpetual reality it doesn't it doesn't end what Jordan and Egypt today are doing is Raising awareness in the International Community to the question of mass transfer uh to Israel's real aims so that such a scenario does not develop we cannot uh today say that mass transfer is a thing of the past that cannot be [Music] done Ford" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="democracy depends on a free press please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org/give we begin today's show with the escalating feud between President Trump and Elon Musk the world's richest man who up until just recently was a top presidential adviser and Trump's top political benefactor the fight could have broad implications for Trump's presidency the Republican party and many government programs including NASA that rely on technology from Musk's various companies the feud became public Tuesday when Musk called Trump's so-called big beautiful budget bill a disgusting abomination because it'll increase the federal deficit by $2.5 trillion the tension then escalated considerably on Thursday during a meeting with German Chancellor Friedri Meritz a reporter asked Trump about Musk's comment this is part of his response but I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here better than you people he knew everything about it he had no problem with it all of a sudden he had a problem and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV mandate because that's billions and billions of dollars and it really is unfair he knew it better than almost anybody and he never had a problem until right after he left and if you saw the statements he made about me which I'm sure you can get very easily it's very fresh on tape uh he said the most beautiful things about me and he hasn't said bad about me personally but I'm sure that'll be next but I'm I'm very disappointed in Elon i've helped Elon a lot the feud then spilled into social media with the two billionaires launching personal attacks on their own social media platforms musk on X and Trump on Truth Social at 2:37 p.m thursday Trump wrote &quot;Elon was wearing thin i asked him to leave i took away his EV mandate that forced everyone to buy electric cars that nobody else wanted that he knew for months I was going to do and he just went crazy.&quot; At 3:10 p.m Musk wrote &quot;Time to drop the really big bomb real Donald Trump is in the Epstein files that's the real reason they have not been made public have a nice day DJT.&quot; Then Trump wrote &quot;The easiest way to save money in our budget billions and billions of dollars is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts i was always surprised Biden didn't do it,&quot; Trump said musk responded by threatening to decommission the Dragon spacecraft used by NASA musk also appeared to back the impeachment of Trump and took credit for Trump winning the presidency trump ally Steve Bannon went further calling for Musk to be investigated and deported he also called for Trump to seize Musk's company SpaceX to talk more about the fracturing of the Trump Musk relationship and what this could mean for the Republican party we're joined by Quinn Sabodian professor of international history at Boston University working on a book about Elon Musk titled Muskism he is author of Hayek Bastards: Race Gold IQ and the Capitalism of the Farright as well as Crackup Capitalism: Market Radicals and the Dream of a World Without Democracy professor Sodian welcome back to Democracy Now were you shocked by what you saw happen yesterday i mean who knows they could be holding a joint news conference soon and announced they're back in love yeah I mean they are people who always have their eye on the bottom line but they also are obviously titanically sized egos and I think that more than anything this is just a sign of uh how dangerous it is to put you know billions of dollars even the lives of astronauts the whole future of the American economy and the political scene in the hands of two sole human beings when you said threaten the lives of astronauts explain Well the Dragon uh unit that you mentioned is the only way for the astronauts in the International Space Station to get to and from um where they are now so were he to decommission it it might literally mean that they would be stranded out there kind of gravity style um so this is just one of the examples of many of the offloading of core government functions onto private service providers that Elon Musk has been so masterful at playing that we feel uh more and more exposed to from the uh the use of Starlink satellites in the field of battle in the Ukraine to the use of that same internet uh connection as leverage in his battle with the Brazilian government i feel like over time we'll only realize more and more how much we are at the mercy of someone who is acting with total impetuousness and sometimes not even with his own self-interest in mind let's go from the threat uh to lives in space to hear on the ground that Elon Musk taking on the budget calling it an abomination um when Trump said he knows that um the budget bill better than almost anyone else inside and out uh Musk's response was that is false i never saw it it was passed in the middle of the night um can you talk about the significance i mean this is the guy in charge of Doge how many thousands of jobs have been lost um and yet at the same time now he's viciously attacking the budget that was so narrowly passed and it could threaten its ultimate passage i mean I think it's worth sort of returning to the question of why Musk got involved at all with Trump right what he was doing with this Doge project and I think it's uh possible to kind of split it up into three categories i think first of all he was doing a kind of a bear hug strategy so I think especially on the trade war and his many many interests in China you know he has a a gigafactory there that has capacity to make a million Teslas a year he wanted to get out in front of any possible excessive economic nationalism that might be rolled out and then I think he was kind of making a hail mary move that you know he hadn't really clicked with the Biden administration and this could be a chance to maybe use a window of opportunity to boost his own aspirations especially in artificial intelligence where he was being outpaced by people like Sam Alman and Open AI and then third I think you could see it as a kind of moonshot strategy where I think he was trying to really even more plug in his own services especially SpaceX to in fact not only get to the moon but divert the whole project towards Mars so there was a lot of reasons why Musk would want to be involved but from Trump's point of view he's never really been a fiscal hawk right he's always actually run against austerity in certain ways and run against this mainstream obsession with the debt ceiling and the deficit that has so defined um uh GOP politics for the last couple decades so it was always kind of an odd fit and it's not surprising in that sense that Musk now feels that this budget is you know not hard austerity enough for his liking it's telling for example that he's posted multiple Milton Freriedman memes over the last couple of days sort of implying that this problem of runaway debt inflation should be top of mind at all times for the government but Trump has always profited by playing fast and loose with that kind of ideology and uh the question is why now has this led to a snapping point for Musk and I think there's a keep going if I could just say I think there's a a couple of things there i think um Trump invokes the EV mandate and that is a serious issue right what that is it needs to be broken down is the capacity of California to enforce a move towards electric cars over time a part of which is a regulatory credit system that allows um normal ice uh internal combustion engine vehicles to buy credits from electric vehicle manufacturers and this is now 40% of Tesla's net income in the last year it's went up a billion dollars in the last year alone and if that gets killed it really does kind of kill Tesla's margin and I think that Musk is starting to feel the heat from Chinese producers like BYD battery producers like CL and I think he sees here maybe the possible demise of the Tesla brand as he is hated more and more from both sides of the spectrum so there's reasons as he returns to his businesses to start to sweat about what he's actually signed up for um uh how about what this highlights around a rift within the MAGA movement and where JD Vance uh fits into this the vice president well it's always interesting to ask what exactly was going on with Doge right i mean if you want to get into the real kind of dangerous liaison sort of cortisanship I think that was happening inside of the White House it it seems that based on reporting Steven Miller was kind of stage managing along with his wife a lot of what was happening with Doge and if you look at what actually came out of Doge and this is a good time now for us to sort of do a autopsy or post-mortem on it as it winds down really he said he was going to do two trillion cut two trillion in cuts out of a $6 trillion budget very unlikely went back to 1 trillion scaled it back to 150 billion what did they end up taking out i mean it's basically culture war stuff right i mean it's ways to trigger the progressives and the libs get rid of US aid attack uh NE funding arts funding science funding um education energy these ended up being big wins not really for Musk's own bottom line cost cutting mentality but very much for the um culture war being waged by people like Miller and JD Vance and Russell VA at the office of management of budget so there is a way of looking at this as having been a success from their point of view they were able to use the credibility of Musk as a kind of supposed um you know brilliant Edison-like inventor and wonderful um you know efficiency creating cost cutter to actually get to some of their political goals but they never could bring that big number down why because entitlement spending still dominates um the state spending in the GDP and when you come close to that you come close to the kind of beating heart of the social contract and we saw the town hall meetings we saw the anger when things started to um encroach on the questions of social security and Medicaid and for me that was a very telling moment and it was one that I think took Musk by surprise too he's not used to the idea of needing to engage with a kind of consent and legitimacy mechanism where people feel like they paid into something and should now get something back he's used to interacting with a Twitter fan base a set of really boughtin Tesla investors for whom you know he always walks on water and he's a god reincarnate and when he just was confronted with the anger of average people who want to make sure that they can pay for their next meal um he didn't know what to do so I think that there's a kind of a there's a way to see this as a victory for the national conservatives they got to do some of their their um their easy wins against the pro progressives and the libs and now they're able to keep the door open for more protectionism and expansion of of spending as we see in the so-called big beautiful bill um finally does do you think Musk has access to all of the private information that his Doge um army downloaded from all the agencies is that possible i am not a a software programmer or I do not know how databases work that well but it seems at least likely that um part of what they were doing there when they were converting things done in old programming languages and updating them was also you know harvesting a lot of that data for use for we don't know what um feeding the machine of Grock or XAI is the most likely answer and finally let me ask you Steve Bannon who's on the anti-Musk side of the MAGA rift has been calling for Trump to nationalize Musk's businesses and for him to be deported right i mean uh Elon Musk comes from South Africa yeah i mean this actually isn't the harshest thing that Bannon has ever said he referred to Silicon Valley as an aparttheid state a few months ago um the idea of nationalizing SpaceX is an interesting one it would certainly run against the core um privatization ethos that Trump and the former GOP has been following for decades and decades so far I would chalk that up to just um saber rattling rhetoric

          <attvalue for="7" value="this is democracy Now democracynow.org The War and Peace report I'm Amy Goodman we're continuing this holiday special with tanassi coats author of the new book The Message democracy Nows Juan Gonzalez and I interviewed him on October 8th one day after hundreds of activists rallied in Union Square in New York for a jewish-led vigil on the first anniversary of October 7th to mourn Israelis and Palestinians who've been killed and to call for an end to the Israeli massacre in Gaza after the vigil I spoke to Ava borgart a spokesperson for the group if not now right now people are wearing signs that say no us money for bombs um and talk about the motto of this October 7th vigil so the motto is every life a universe and it's it's from piku nefes which says that to destroy a life is to destroy an entire world and to save a life is to save an entire world and our government is not treating every single life as a universe they're treating Palestinian lives as less sacred how did you get so involved with this issue I got involved through the Ferguson Uprising and I was watching black and Palestinian activists trading tips on Twitter about how to deal with tear gas and it became clear that it Palestinians in the West Bank are facing a military charged with policing and black Americans are facing a militarized police force and um that was my entry point where I said I need to organize my community which was unable to or which was limited in being able to show up for the Civil Rights fight of our time for the black lives matter movement because they were upset about the messaging for a free Palestine in those protests and so I've spent the last 10 years of my life working on building the movement of Jewish Americans who are calling for equality Justice and a thriving future for all no matter where people live that's Eva bergart of the group if not now one of hundreds of people here in New York City and Union Square for two large rallies on the anniversary of October 7th Our Guest today is tanassi coats the prizewinning journalist and author of the new book the message in part about a visit he took last year organized by the uh Palestinian the Palestine Festival of literature pal Fest uh to the West Bank um and Israel um talk about this whole journey you took you were part of the palfest and then you also stayed yeah and I guess to be honest my my journey began 10 years ago when I when I published the case for reparations um and there was a section uh again as a as a writer as a journalist you always trying to make people feel things make things real and there was a section where I offered an analog uh for reparations for how I could possibly look and it was um from uh West Germany to the state of Israel and I need to be very specific about that not to Holocaust Survivors but to the state of Israel itself and um that part of that essay came under quite quite a bit of critique and uh what became clear to me was deservedly so um it took 10 years is for me to get it fixed because writing takes a long time you know um but I but I knew I had to like that I was going to have to go at some point you know I knew it wouldn't be enough for me to you know appear to Rally do a slogan whatever and long story short um I began talking to palfest in 2016 finally got there in 2023 uh just in time for the message uh I spent 5 days with them uh mostly traveling through the occupied territories and through East Jerusalem as a Palestinian would getting a sense of of of what their daily was U and then the next 5 days I spent mostly in the company of a group called breaking the silence uh former IDF uh veterans who are against the occupation uh and I saw the country largely through the views of in Israeli how they move through the through the world how they move through Jerusalem how they move through the roads um but I also again you know spent a lot of time actually talking you know more to Palestinians um it was revelatory it was I don't think the average American has a real sense of what we're doing over there and I emphasize what we're doing because it's not possible uh without American Support I have heard people say over and over again that there are great evils happening in the world um States across the world perpetrating evils against uh uh whole groups of people why pick on Israel and the thing I say is I'm an American this is the thing that we have our fingerprints on those Bombs Over Gaza the planes that drop bombs on Gaza uh the plaques that I saw for instance in jerus all of that is America and we are going around the world propping ourselves up as the font of democracy we are going around the world propping Israel up as the only democracy in Middle East this is a deep deep fiction a very very dangerous fiction um that must be addressed and that's what I tried to do in the book you WR in the book uh quote it occurred to me that there was still one place on the planet under American patronage that resembled the world that my parents were born into can you elaborate yes and I think I talked about it the last time I was here actually um these are the words I have even now and they are probably insufficient to what a Palestinian uh would offer who experiences this but the words that come to me are segregation um when you are on the West Bank there are separate roads there are roads for Israeli settlers and citizens of Israel and there are roads for Palestinian Ians these roads are not separate and equal these roads tend to be separate and unequal it tends to take longer to get where you want to go if you're Palestinian uh if you enter a city like herin for for instance herin is quite literally segregated there are streets that Palestinians cannot walk down there are streets that you know Israeli settlers are giv complete and free movement of moving throughout the West Bank in general they there are checkpoints everywhere for Palestinians uh these checkpoints are sometimes normal checkpoints that they know are there some times checkpoints appear out of the blue with they which what they call Flying checkpoints your basic movement is constantly imp parallel the justice system which is deeply familiar for African-Americans here is quite literally segregated there is a civil justice system that the minority of Israeli settlers as Israeli citizens enjoy and then there is an entirely separate justice system that uh Palestinians on the West Bank are subject to you can be arrested for instance um as as an Israeli Citizen and you are you know uh do all the due rights that we are familiar with you have to be told what the charges are Etc if you are arrested as a Palestinian you can just be taken in another political context we would call those hostages because nobody has to say why you're taken nobody has to say what you were taken for nobody has to inform your family you are under the jurisdiction of the of of of of the military it has been this way since 1967 and the word we use for that is occupation which is a kind of uh uh deeply um vanilla word that does not actually describe what is going on how a country that maintains this this uh separate and unequal system how a country that that does not even allow the quote unquote Palestinian citizens of the state full equality with its Jewish Israeli citizens is allowed to refer to itself as a democracy is a mystery to me and the closest analogue I can think of is the time in which uh the United States of America referred to itself as a democracy even as it was disenfranchising whole swats of black people in the southern states and so when I say Jim Crow when I say segregation that is because that is the period that immediately comes to mind for me talk about being stopped by an Israeli soldier Tanashi oh well we stopped all the time to be clear you know because we were on the roads we were constantly stopped you know um I was you know you just kind of got used to it after a while which was also weely familiar but I think the instance you're referring to is when I was in Hebron um which is a you know a flasho for anybody that that that that's been over there um I was walking down the street attempting to uh patronized a Palestinian uh vendor uh and a guard IDF uh guard or IDF Soldier stopped out he was young enough to be my son uh stopped out and asked me what was my religion um it was clear that I had to State my religion in order to pass when I told him that I was not religious he asked what my mother's religion was when I told him my mother wasn't particularly religious he asked what my grandmother's religion was and this is a very very important thing because when you start asking what my mother and grandmother's religion is you are referring to something Beyond do I accept Christ as my you know personal savior or what God I I pray to you are asking a a deeper question about my ancestry and it became clear that if I did not give the right answer to that question I would not be allowed to pass I highlight this because when you hear Palestinian and Palestinian American activists make the charge of racism this is what they're talking about why does who my grandmother or my mother worship matter if we're strictly talking about a God not that it would be right even in that sense but when you hear the charge of racism this is what people are referring to tonassi this is a powerful book and you went on CBS This Morning recently to talk about the publication of it and I want to go to that interview on CVS this morning um The New York Times is now reporting CBS News has rebuked one of the morning anchors uh Tony deople uh over what he did in that interview to you and maybe you could also say to his fellow anchors as he dominated this CBS Executives said the interview fell short of the Network's editorial standards this is an excerpt of that interview I want to dive into the uh Israel Palestine section of the book it's the largest section of the book and I have to say when I when I read the book I imagine if I took your name out of it took away the awards and the Acclaim took the cover off the book The Publishing House goes away the content of that section would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist and so then I found myself wondering why does tanahashi coats who I've known for a long time r at his work for a long time very talented smart guy leave out so much why leave out that Israel is surrounded by countries that want to eliminate it why leave out that Israel deals with Terror groups that want to eliminate it why not DET anything of the first and the second antifa the cafe bombings the bus bombings the little kids blown to bits and is it because you just don't believe that Israel in any condition has a right to exist well I would say the perspective that you just outlined um there is no shortage of that perspective in American Media um that's the first thing I would say um I am most concerned always with those who don't have a voice with those who don't have the ability to talk um I have asked repeatedly in my interviews whether there is a single Network mainstream organization in America with a Palestinian American bureau chief or correspondent who actually has a voice to articulate that part of the world um I've been a reporter for 20 years um the reporters of those who believe more sympathetically about Israel um and its right to exist don't have a problem getting their voice out but what I saw in Palestine what I saw on the West Bank what I saw in hia in Israel what I saw in the South Hein Hills those were the stories that I have not heard so tanassi um you sitting on the set of CBS This Morning uh with uh the former football player now anchor uh Nate burlson Gail King very welln um both African-American anchors and Tony deople he dominated the discussion talking about your book belong could be found in an extremist backpack um talk about the backlash on this the aftermath of this and also who you felt was most wronged in this well it wasn't me I mean at that part I let me talk it was not me you know um it certainly and I don't know there was anybody on that set um look I think um there is a meta conversation that happens here uh where we end up because we're media where we end up talking about media and and media politics um but I do think it's really important to Broad the frame from the few people that that were there and talk about um what was actually excluded and who was actually excluded from that conversation by the very structure itself I just don't want to lose sight of that um I don't really have a problem with a tough interview you know I knew what I wrote you know I knew I'd be confronted I you know was he rude was he aggressive you know like I can't really get into that like it's not really something that I think too much about the question I would ask though is how often on CBS on NBC on ABC or or any major news organization do you see someone who is a defender of the Israeli state project get confronted in that kind of way um get uh given a tough interview in that kind of way when was the last time you saw for instance a defender of Israel defender of Zionism uh confronted with the fact that major human rights organizations say that Israel is practicing a Pare how do you defend that when is the last time You' seen an interviewer how often do you see interviewers cuz don't want to say it never happens how often do you see interviewers say listen we have you know the former head of Human Rights Watch that says you are practicing genocide right now in Gaza how do you respond to that how often do you how often do you say that how often do you see how do you define yourself as a democracy when fully half the people under your rule are not equal there is no problem with confronting me you know I would like to see some other people confront it and the second part of that is who gets to do the confront in the first place I have said and I will continue to say I am a little uncomfortable with this role and a little uncomfortable with with the publicity not because I feel like I I do not know but because I feel like there are people who are going through this experience and who have gone through this experience who know so much more who are completely out of the frame and those are Palestinians and Palestinian Americans so it's not just the issues that I raise in the confrontation the question I was I would ask is you have to imagine a world where a Palestinian amican journalist could be on a mainstream show like CBS This Morning and confront someone who wrote a book that say defended Israel or defended Zionism with that kind of aggression it's fine if I get it but I want to live in that world too you know and that really is you know like one of the things I was really really trying to get at in the book in the message you know it's it's the questions we ask it's the stories we get to tell and the stories that we don't tell and perhaps most importantly it's who gets to tell them who doesn't and I just I I really feel this passionately this is not about me this is not about Tony this is not about Gail this is not about n we're going to be fine it's the people who are invisible it's the people who were not in that set you know on that set to begin with who are not part of that conversation and and tassi this this criticism that you were sufficiently taking into account that history uh when the reality is here we are on the anniversary of the October 7th uh attacks uh and very little discussion is occurs about what was Gaza like before October 7th of last year and uh and and how were the the the residents of of Gaza being treated essentially in an open air prison yes no I I I I completely agree look I I I you know I I love that um the young lady who was saying uh earlier in the lead in every life is a un i i i Tru truly believe that and so you know as I've said before like there really is no part of my politics that has the ability to look at October 7th and not mourn the death the massacre uh the the atrocities you know perpetrated I just wish that some of my countrymen especially my countrymen especially Americans who are responsible for this who are propping this up had that same sort of compassion and that same sort of energy for October 6th October 5th Etc you know this kind of abstracting events outside you know of of of their historical context is really necessary to the political order because it allows us to justify ourselves and not have to think harder and not have to ask you know much deeper question you really have to be able to hold both you know and I know that that sounds a bit cliche but I I I I truly do believe that you have to you know believe in this idea that I actually just heard today that every life is a universe I you know I think that's really really beautiful articulation you know um and that has to be true for all life that has to be true on October 7th you know and loudly said but it has to be true on 654 321 also uh and also I wanted to go back for a second because we are we are running out of time and ask you about sry my answers are so long yeah about President Trump and in the coming upcoming election uh the great surprise to me all these these years now is the enormous support that Donald Trump still has on among huge swats of the American public to what do you uh attribute this Darkness there's a darkness in all of us I mean this is um this is not new you know I mean and if you if you just took American history from the perspective of an african-amer and I suspect the the the from the perspective of the indigenous people of this continent what what they would tell you is there is nothing new and people using power and people using you know the worst tropes in the world to win and to to to dominate for any black person that you know grew up in the south from I don't know 1876 to 1964 and probably Beyond I'm being very conservative by saying that this is what politics was like this is this is just what we you know grew up under and so I I think maybe we thought or we allowed ourselves to believe that somehow you know we had escaped the gravity of history but no people no country escapes the gravity of History we live within it we we we are part of it and so you know I I think it's a very very dangerous thing that our leaders led us to believe um in 2016 that this was like a thing that could not happen in in America you know whereas had we looked at history from another perspective we would know that this actually very American you know that doesn't make us you know inhuman or somehow demonically evil you know on the contr it just makes us human it means that we're subject to you know the darkness in our souls like any other group of people would be tassi I wanted to go to that point you say of who gets heard um we were at the Democratic Convention everywhere we were interviewing people saw you in the background we were interviewing the delegate from what uh Michigan from Florida from Connecticut who unfurled a banner in the Florida delegation that said stop arming Israel um you were there as we were interviewing them in the hallway uh when we were outside when they were about to begin the sleep in overnight demanding that kamla Harris allow a palestinian-american to speak you were there uh and then the next day um and you wrote a piece and Vanity Fair about your experience of Palestinian Americans place under the Democrats big tent the looking at the uncommitted movement and their unsuccessful efforts to have such a speaker this is rura Roman of the uncommitted movement she's a Palestinian American Georgia state representative this is part of what she would have said if she was chosen for 322 days we've stood together demanding to enforce our laws on friend and foe alike to reach a ceas fire and the killing of Palestinians free all the Israeli and Palestinian hostages and and to begin the difficult work of building a path to Collective peace and safety that's why we are here members of this Democratic party committed to equal rights and dignity for all what we do hear Echoes around the world they'll say this is how it's always been that nothing can change but remember Bonnie Lamer shun for her courage yet she paved the way for an integrated Democratic party her legac lives on and it's her example we follow so that's Georgia state representative Ru Roman and um needless to say uh there was not a Palestinian American Voice on the stage last night um kamla Harris uh did an interview with 60 Minutes at least they played it last night um this is what she had to say about Israel Palestine when we think about the threat that Hamas Hezbollah presents um Iran um I think that it is without any question our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks now the work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing Pursuit around making clear our principles which include the need for humanitarian Aid the need for this war to end the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages and and and and create a ceasefire and we're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and and in the region including Arab leaders that's Democratic Presidential nominee Kam haris speaking on 60 Minutes last night uh as we wrap up you were just talking about Trump talk about um what the position of the Biden Harris Administration is right now they did hold two separate um uh commemorations yesterday President Biden was at the White House and he lit a candle and also I think crossed himself right after and um uh kamla Harris the vice president the Naval Observatory planted a tree a pomegranate tree well and you know that that's good and appropriate you know um like I said you know we we don't want to uh have a politic that um does not take life serious and does not take loss of life serious um on the larger question and maybe even as an extension of that but we have to take all life seriously I don't think we're doing that um this is morally untenable what I saw was and this is the first time I've ever said this or put this in this Frame and maybe you know the uncommitted delegates understood this um there was as much a moral gap between what I saw in Chicago that is to say to go on stage and promote these values of diversity Humanity big tent and to exclude um the people whose families are being bombed right now as it was in the early 1960s and you know before when the Democratic party you know claimed to be for the Working Man and the working person while millions of workers all through the South were effectively in a system of indentured servitude and they refused to give those people political representation it is a gigantic moral golf um that is trou disappointing heartbreaking and deeply deeply personally upsetting tanassi coats author of the new book the message that interview was

          <attvalue for="7" value="hi everyone I'm Jimmy I'm the host of the show Thank you for watching Thank you for joining us on a um now it's starting to feel fake It uh I have to tell you something Uh Mondays with all the terrible stuff that happens over the weekend nowadays Mondays for me are like how I would imagine Monday feels for the janitors who have to clean up the men's room at the Port Authority bus station in New York all the horrors accumulate and we have to come in with a power washer and flush them all out I mentioned last week we finally got some good news out of the White House and the good news out of the White House is that Elon Musk is out of the White House We don't know for sure because they're doing their best to spin it to make it seem like his work is done But the more likely scenario is he didn't deliver any what he promised and they've had enough of them But it can't look like Trump made a mistake bringing him in even though he obviously did So they had a ceremony a farewell press conference to send the skittish South African off on his way and to catalog some of the many imaginary contributions Doge has made Doge canled $101 million for DEI $20 million for Arab Sesame Street in the Middle East Nobody knows what that's all about Nobody's been able to find it $8 million for making mice transgender So they spent $8 million on making mice transgender And he's reading it out of a three- ring binder So you know for sure it's true You think he believes that that I don't I mean there I'm not sure which is scarier that he does or that he doesn't because it has been repeatedly established that what Trump is referring to are transgenic mice not transgender mice which are mice used for gene research and have nothing to do with sex changes There is no such thing as transgender mice There's not even a Chuck-e-Cheese in West Hollywood But to Trump they Trump and Musk claimed Doge cut $160 billion from the federal budget Their initial promise was to cut $2 trillion from the budget but that didn't happen because Elon fired everybody who knew how to do math The most notable part of the press conference was the shiner on Elon Musk's eye I don't if you noticed him Reporters asked him what happened and he claimed he got punched by his 5-year-old son X and wound up with a black eye Steven Miller freaked out when he heard uh Elon was in the Oval Office with a black eye He uh he thought they said black eye and it was quite a relief But Trump was effusive in his praise for Musk He thanked him for working tirelessly Well yeah of course he was working tirelessly They say he's gobbling down 20 different kinds of uppers every day when he was there And and he Trump even gave Elana a get out of here gift I gave a little special something We have here Thank you A very special that I give to very special people I have given it to some but it goes to very special people and I thought I'd I'd give it to Elon as a presentation from our country Thank you Thank you Elon Thank you Take care Thank you I think what I'm going to miss most is their chemistry You know it's I feel like I feel like all it would take would be one trip to the driving range together to convince Trump never to speak to Elon again And who knew there was a key to the White House apparently in his book the first son-in-law Jared Kushner said Trump personally designed these keys which explains why they say key to the White House on them Master of subtle elegance Over the weekend the New York Times published a crazy story about Elon Musk claiming among other things he was taking ecstasy psychedelic mushrooms pills believed to be aderall and so much ketamine it was affecting his bladder control which is a delightful detail Between him and Trump that Oval Office is going to smell like an abandoned nursing home Elon of course denied these claims strongly Shortly after the report came out he wrote &quot;To be clear I am not taking drugs.&quot; That's a good start The New York Times was lying their ass off I tried prescription ketamine a few years ago and said so on X So this not even news It helps for getting out of dark mental holes but haven't taken it since then And I do have to say I believe him I mean does this look like a person who's on drugs thank you very much for being here He's done a fantastic job Our country has given $5 billion dollar plus I don't think Harvard's been acting very nicely I think Colombia wants to get to the bottom of the problem They've acted very well and they capture Ask your doctor about ecstasy You can't dance to bad music on ecstasy And mushrooms Go to space without a ship on mushrooms And ketamine A whole garbage bag full of ketamine And bladderall Blow up your bladder with bladderall I don't see any evidence of any unusual anything there at all I mean these are the moments of a perfectly normal well-balanced human being So Elon is leaving the cutthroat world of DC politics and headed back to work at SpaceX where he is beloved by all He offered us an interview at SpaceX's enormous headquarters We knew we were in the right neighborhood when we saw this huge bust of Musk installed by his admirers and vandalized by his critics Probably another one of his 13 kids Never mind the bandit who added Superman's chin to his face But all that fraud and abuse Elon and his musketeers found through Doge is nothing compared to what our conspiracy theorist and chief uncovered over the weekend Our current president blew the lid off a bombshell coverup involving our previous president that goes beyond anything we've ever heard before This is perhaps the most shocking political scandal in the history of this planet On Saturday Trump reposted this There is no Joe Biden executed in 2020 Biden clones doubles and robotic engineered soulless mindless entities are what you see This is a theory that claims President Biden was cloned and replaced by a robot which first of all aren't robots and clones two entirely different things Not in Trump's head they aren't And secondly I know Trump puts out this stuff like as a smokeokc screen to hide the fact that he's about to cut $600 billion from Medicaid but this is so deeply nuts How is this not on the front page of everything the president of the United States is spreading deranged stories about his predecessor being a robot Hey Republicans remember when you were very concerned Joe might not have the mental acuity to be president come get your guy because he thinks Biden was executed and replaced by a a clone a robotic clone I mean if your dad was saying stuff like this you'd start looking for an assisted living facility And by the way whoever built that Joe Biden robot is very bad at building robots I mean if anyone was replaced by a robotic clone it's Melania right and then he uses the words fake news with a straight face It's worth noting that the individual who originally posted this Biden gobbledygook that Trump reposted claimed today since he's on a roll that Michelle Obama is actually a transgendered man who played college football at Oregon State His name is Michael Robinson which makes even less sense when you go through the roster and learn that no one named Michael Robinson ever played football at Oregon State which means Michelle Obama is a ghost too Look I know I understand that Trump blasts us with a a fire hose of crap every day but the media needs to stop being polite when they report this stuff This is the headline from NBC Trump shares unfounded conspiracy theory claiming Biden was executed in 2020 Never mind unfounded This is not even a theory That headline should be convicted felon posts insane fairy tale about cancer patients while constipated on toilet Though I will admit a robot Joe Biden would make a pretty solid movie You get the best of both worlds Fastest reflexes modern technology has to offer onboard computer assisted memory and a lifetime of on the street elderly presidential programming It is my great pleasure to present to you Joe I'm staying in a race This idea is a bunch of [Music] malarkey the scripted cyborg [Applause] It's just the beginning Trump has a lot of other great ideas including a possible pardon for Diddy Trump took a break during his goodbye party for Elon to weigh in on whether or not he would consider a pardon for his old pal Diddy First of all I' I'd look at what's happening and I haven't been watching it too closely although it's certainly getting a lot of coverage I don't know I would certainly look at the facts If I think somebody was mistreated uh whether they like me or don't like me it wouldn't have any impact on me Right Right I mean this is a man who's famously immune to flattery It makes no difference to him at all He loves the idea that he can let anyone out of prison at any time He loves it He's handing out pardons like they're podcast promo codes right now But he won't be giving one to Diddy if 50 Cent has anything to do with it Nobody's having more fun with this Diddy trial than 50 Cent right now and 50 Cent He claims he's going to call President Trump to share all the insulting things Diddy said about him just in case he thinking about giving him a pardon This is how far hip hop has come Rappers are now personally reaching out to the president to put their rivals in jail What happened to snitches get stitches is that And also can you imagine the list of calls Trump fields in the day is bananas All right Zilinsky I got to hop off I got Fiddy calling about Diddy And you know last week Trump freed a couple of reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrysley who were convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud They were already back They're shooting a new season of their show And according to Todd getting locked up wasn't all bad So you know we're grateful for everything that has happened thus far And as bad as this experience has been there's also been a lot of blessings to come from it I have met some wonderful men Well say no more As Trump's big beautiful bill works its way through the Senate Republican lawmakers are in the tough spot now of having to defend some truly indefensible ideas like throwing more than 8 million Americans off health insurance Iowa Senator Joanie Ernst had a town hall in Butler over the weekend with constituents who were very upset At one point during the discussion on cuts to Medicaid somebody shouted &quot;People are going to die.&quot; And before I share what Senator Ern said in reply I want you to think about the worst thing you could say to respond to that statement Do you have it okay I don't know what's in your head but I'm pretty sure this is it They are not eligible So they will be coming off So we people are not Well we all are going to die Oh for heaven's sakes There's a difference between we're all going to die and we're all going to die because of what you are doing This woman is a senator a United States senator telling her constituents &quot;We're all going to die.&quot; I mean imagine how terrified you would be if your Uber driver said that But to her credit Joanie slept on it and then took to Instagram to issue an apology Hello everyone I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize for a statement that I made yesterday at my town hall I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that yes we are all going to perish from this earth So I apologize and I'm really really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the tooth fairy as well Cruel and condescending That's a nice combination of qualities And all we need now is a dash of pseudo-Christian hypocrisy For those that would like to see eternal and everlasting life I encourage you to embrace my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Yes Yes The hardright conservative Jesus Christ who famously said &quot;Blessed are the poor bastards who suck so hard they can't afford healthcare.&quot; I hope the actual Christians of Iowa remember that in November of next year Speaking of cruel bastards Steven Miller was on Laura Trump's show over the weekend where he took a rare break from deporting children to talk about his own And have your kids met President Trump yes What do they think what's I actually I have a um I I'm very lucky because um I have a I have a uh a photo of my daughter when she was a newborn meeting President Trump Look at how he's holding that baby It's like like it fell from the ceiling and he caught it by the head But go on And what people don't know about President Trump you can speak to this He's actually great with kids He's like a kid magnet When kids are around they want to be around President Trump He's a child whisperer The uh kids love President Trump President Trump loves children Cuz he is a children He knows how they think Remember how Trump said he would lower grocery prices on day one well he didn't Groceries are still very expensive and these tariffs he keeps throwing around aren't going to help The price of all the basics especially clothes are expected to go way up by the end of the summer The price of eggs still 78% higher than they were under Biden's robot clone at this time last year Many Americans are now buying food on credit which is a bad sign And some companies are trying to capitalize on this now I

          <attvalue for="3" value="In a searing address to the UN Security Council meeting on the Middle East and Gaza, American trauma surgeon Dr. Feroze Sidhwa delivered a first-hand account of Gaza's collapsing healthcare system, drawing from his two medical missions to Khan Younis. &quot;I am not here as a policymaker, but as a physician bearing witness to the deliberate destruction of healthcare, the targeting of my colleagues, and the erasure of a people,&quot; he stated, describing surgeries performed on filthy floors without anaesthesia and children dying from preventable causes due to Israel's blockade of medical supplies. With haunting detail, he recounted treating pregnant women &quot;whose pelvises had been obliterated and their foetuses cut in two,&quot; and revealed that 83% of American medics in Gaza reported seeing children shot in the head or chest. &quot;This is not system failure - it has been systematically dismantled through violations of international law,&quot; he emphasised, condemning the man-made famine now killing more civilians than bombs. His testimony peaked with the March 18 mass casualty event at Nasser Hospital, where 221 trauma patients arrived in one morning - 90 dead on arrival, nearly half children - an onslaught no besieged health system could withstand. &quot;Parents memorise their children's clothing to identify remains,&quot; he said, exposing the war's psychological toll: nearly half of Gaza's children are now suicidal, asking, &quot;Why didn't I die with my family?&quot; Dr. Sidhwa implored the Council to enforce seven measures, including an arms embargo, calling their inaction &quot;a testament to collapsed conscience&quot; as Gaza's last doctors and a generation of Palestinians face annihilation. &quot;You cannot claim ignorance,&quot; he concluded, &quot;when children no longer want to live.&quot;&#10;&#10;Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe&#10;Follow us on X:   / ajenglish  &#10;Find us on Facebook:   / aljazeera  &#10;Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/&#10;Check out our Instagram page:   / aljazeeraenglish  &#10;Download AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile&#10;&#10;#UnitedNations #UnitedNationsSecurityCouncil #UNSC #Palestine #Gaza #GazaHumanitarianCrisis #Israel #GazaWar #IsraelGazaWar #GazaHospitals #GazaHumanitarianCrisis #GazaStarvation" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="i now give the floor to Dr Feroh Shidua Please Thank you Mr President Members of the council my name is Dr Fose Sidwa I am an American trauma and critical care surgeon based in Stockton California I come before you today to speak about the Gaza Strip where I have volunteered twice since October 7th first at European Hospital from March 25th to April 8th of last year and most recently at Nasser Medical Complex from March 6th to April 1st of 2025 Both are in the city of Kununas I'm not here as a policy maker or a politician I am a physician bearing witness to the deliberate destruction of a health care system the targeting of my own colleagues and the eraser of a people The constitution of the World Health Organization states that the health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security and is dependent on the fullest cooperation of individuals and states I have taken this to heart and it is the reason I volunteer in conflict zones from Haiti to Ukraine to Gaza In Gaza I operated in hospitals without sterility electricity or anesthetics Surgeries took place on crowded and filthy floors Children died not because their injuries were unservivable but because we lacked blood antibiotics and the most basic supplies that are readily available in any large hospital anywhere else in the world I did not see or treat a single combatant during my five weeks in Gaza My patients were six-year-olds with shrapnels in their heart and bullets in their brains and pregnant women whose pelvises had been obliterated and their fetuses cut in two while still in the womb Mothers sheltering in the hospital cooked bread on hot plates in the emergency department during mass casualty events as we dealt with the reign of fire and death falling around us everywhere Mr President the foundations of life in Gaza family health and community have been shattered The medical system has not failed It has been systematically dismantled through a sustained military campaign that has willfully violated international humanitarian law Civilians are now dying not just from the constant air strikes but from acute malnutrition sepsis exposure and despair Between my two visits to Gaza I witnessed a sharp decline in patients health driven not just by injury but by worsening hunger and malnutrition that left their bodies weaker their wounds slower to heal and their survival far less certain And let's not forget this is a man-made catastrophe It is entirely preventable Participating in it or not allowing it to happen is a choice This is a deliberate denial of conditions necessary for life food shelter water and medicine Preventing genocide means refusing to normalize these atrocities It means refusing to dehumanize the Palestinians to refuse to see them as calories counted or numbers of trucks moved We see now that this way of thinking has brought about a human dignity crisis with an entire people on the edge of survival On March 18th the ceasefire was violated by Israel That day I witnessed the most extreme mass casualty event of my career at Nasser Medical Complex 221 trauma patients arrived in one morning 90 were dead on arrival Nearly half were severely injured children No health system on Earth could cope with this least of all one that is besieged and starved of supplies Hospitals are meant to be sanctuaries Healthcare workers and first responders are supposed to be protected Children are supposed to be protected In Gaza these protections are simply gone Every day the distinction between combatant and civilian is erased Most of my patients were pre-teen children their bodies shattered by explosives and torn by flying metal Many died Those who lived often awoke to find their entire families gone Last year I published in the New York Times a survey of 65 American healthcare workers who had served in Gaza 83% of them reported seeing children shot in the head or the chest I personally treated 13 such cases in my two weeks at European Hospital According to the Warchild Alliance nearly half of Gaza's children are suicidal They ask &quot;Why didn't I die with my sister my mother my father not out of extremism but out of unbearable grief I wonder if any member of this council has ever met a 5-year-old child who no longer wants to live let alone imagined a society in which so many young children feel this way And what astonishes me is not that some children in Gaza have lost the will to live but that any still cling to hope My Palestinian friends mostly healthcare workers no longer speak of resilience or even survival Parents memorize their children's clothing in case they must identify their remains later They pray for one piece of bread to give them before they sleep so that their children might die less hungry if they are killed at night And meanwhile my Israeli and American friends express horror at what is being done in their names Many of us cannot understand how our governments continue to arm this senseless destruction But you in this chamber have the power to stop it Mr President I am here because I have witnessed what is happening in Gaza with my own eyes especially to children and I cannot pretend not to have seen it You too cannot claim ignorance I urge the council and especially my own government to act with urgency on these enforcable measures One demand an immediate and permanent ceasefire including a halt to all arms transfers to all parties to the conflict alongside targeted and lawful sanctions on Israel Two demand the reopening of all of Gaza's crossings and guarantee unrestricted medical evacuations including to hospitals in the West Bank and East Jerusalem where Palestinian patients can be treated by Palestinian doctors with safe return to Gaza assured Three guarantee sustained humanitarian access throughout Gaza allowing all essential supplies shelter food water fuel and medical supplies to reach all people in need Four strongly and explicitly reject the weaponization and politicization of aid embodied by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation whose executive director a veteran of the US Marine Corps publicly resigned on Sunday citing the foundation's lack of adherence to humanitarian principles We must affirm support for existing UN mechanisms back UNRWA and ensure NOS's with expertise in reaching and providing specialized care to those in need have unimpeded full access Five the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages Six the immediate and unconditional release of all healthare workers including Dr Husam Abu Sufi now held in Israeli detention for more than 150 days And seven without delay uphold the UN charter and act now to prevent genocide One day Gaza survivors may have a record of the empty promises made by the members of this council as their wounds deepened and their lives were lost If this council remains silent and fails to act now that record will stand as a testament to a global failure to provide urgent care and to the collapse of our collective conscience I'm pleading with you to do what you were entrusted to do to protect international peace and security and to prevent irreversible harm The steps I mentioned are the very least that is needed I'm asking my own government's representative to hear the voices of the majority of Americans who are calling for the same If this continues there will be no Palestinian doctors left no one to care for the sick and wounded There will be no Palestinians left to rebuild the health care system We are losing a generation before our eyes condemning people to die of hunger disease and despair Deaths that could be easily prevented Thank you I thank Dr Shida for his briefing Make sure to

He reads a selection of poems from _Forest of Noise_, while sharing the stories of friends and family still struggling to survive in Gaza, as well as those he has lost, including the late poet Refaat Alareer. He also describes his experiences in Gaza in the first months of the war, including being displaced from his home and abducted by the Israeli military, noting that the neighborhood in Jabaliya refugee camp that his family first evacuated to last year was bombed by the Israeli military just days ago. &quot;Sometimes I want to stop writing because I'm repeating the same words, even though the situation is worse.

Gaza you die several times mosab abu's second book of poetry is just out it's titled Forest of noise his previous awardwinning book of poetry things you may find hidden in my ear poems from Gaza masab abua is a columnist a teacher founder of the Edward SED library in Gaza his recent essay in the New York Times is headlined Gaza schools are for learning not for dying and his latest piece for the New Yorker is headlined the Gaza We Leave Behind masab Abu TOA it's wonderful to have you in studio safely here in New York but I know that your heart and mind are in Gaza right now before we talk about your poetry uh you have just come with terrible news for you and your family about what is happening there can you describe what you've heard just today thank you so much Amy um yeah I mean just you mentioned the the the air strikes that U took down 10 residential buildings um I was staying with that in that place with my wife and kids just before we had to leave uh for an honor School uh to stay in a shelter there and before I was abducted by the Israeli Army and this morning I looked at the names of some of the people who were killed in that air strike and I see the I mean 19 um names from the same family including iMat AB Rashid I mean a temporary neighbor I mean we had M fat as a neighbor for a few days before we had to leave the neighborhood and now I read that this neighborhood which I where I was staying with them was bomed so she was killed along with some of her children and this is the of so many people I'm not sure if you can see this this is the list of the whole family and for example you're holding up a list of what some 20 names yeah 20 names including fat the grandmother her children and her grandchildren and I I look at for example I read this every day so there is Muhammad Salman his brother YF Islam s so five brothers and then there is there is muhm fat the son of fat Abu Rashid and his wife and his and their children so I've been seeing all this all the time time and by the way we are focusing right now on North North Gaza yesterday late at night Israel bummed intensely kanun and I'm looking at some of the pictures here these are the the photos of the children who were killed yesterday they just were able to withdraw the bodies of these children after the Israelis retreated from the area so and and that was today I learned about this just half an hour ago and then I went to the to the local news channel in my city Bia North Gaza and I saw the picture of my neighbor um Iman abua this is his photo he was killed he was killed this morning uh while he was trying to to get some water from from a tab in the street aan to honor his memory he was the principal of the Oni agricultural College in North Gaza and he was trying by the way he lived just a few blocks away and he wanted to move to to stay with his brother because there are some friends who and some neighbors are staying there so he wanted to be close to the people who are there but he was killed and his his son my wife just told me because she was on the phone with her mother and father who are trapped right now in bethle they were told that the brother of my my neighbor has been critically wounded and he is in the house there's no way that an ambulance can come there's no way that any anyone can come to their rescue and the same thing happened yesterday in the jab refug Camp the 10 residential bu building that were took down massab yesterday last night I saw you at the Brooklyn Public Library sold out to hear you speak about your poetry and you said at the beginning I saw your wife and your three little children but that hadn't been the plan uh you're now in Syracuse at Syracuse University um talk about you almost canceling the day before CU your wife was too terrified for you to come to New York indeed I mean taking my wife and three kids with me was a last minute decision I mean the Israeli Army has been in I mean horribly attacking North Gaza displacing people and and kidnapping abducting doctors and and nurses and and journalists and from and even the even even the injured people they were they had to evacuate I just imagine I mean people who have been injured and they had some medical care and they had to be um on some some some medical equipment they are taken away from the hospital some of them would die and that's why the Lancet Journal said that more than 200,000 people have been have died or were killed by the Israeli airri the Israeli uh military campaign since October 7th so my wife's family including her father her mother her her siblings and some of the uh the nephews and nieces her grandparents too aged 75 they are now trapped in the family house and they are unable to leave and now the ab my neighbor was killed just a few a few meters away from them by by by by Shel my from a tangel so she worries that if I I'm away from her and she gets some terrible news like to like today's news she she would she would die from from from Pain and grief so she wanted me to be with her and I told her I I I couldn't cancel you know the event at uh at the Brooklyn Public Library and also my event today at NYU so I said okay you come with me and now she came with me as if this would I mean I I don't claim I don't say that I would make her feelings better because I too have family in bethle I have a young sister with three children the youngest is 2 years old and I haven't talked to her for about 10 days it's it's impossible to get in touch with my sister I don't know how she's surviving or whether she's alive alive at this moment uh you wrote on social media six days ago I write with a heavy heart that my cousin Sama 7 years old has been killed in the air strike on their house along with 18 members of her family which is my extended family for our TV audience we are showing an image of sama right now tell us who she is so so s is one of the five children of my aunt Asma who was also injured the mother I mean in the House s was staying with her parents with her siblings with her grandmother who happens to be my my grandmother's sister and I used to call her grandmother because my grandmother passed away when I was very young so my my my my my grandmother's sister with two of her daughters and her grandchildren and two of her daughter-in-laws and the grandchildren are still buried under the rubble until this moment so s was killed in the air strike and the only reason why my aunt and her other children or even though they were wounded the only reason why they they were not killed is that they were staying close to the door because the bomb when it falls it usually hits the middle of the house so my my my my aunt Asma survived the air strike with some injuries along with her husband and four other four children and they had by the way they were my my my my aunt had to walk to the Israeli soldiers who were standing just a few meters away from the bond house so just imagine a criminal killing you and then waiting for you until you are either dead or or or come to them limping and and and she she she told me that she kissed their hands begging them to leave them alone and if she could take with her some wheat flour from the house that she was keeping next to her because there is no food in Gaza so s was seven years old and I remember something very clearly which is that every time I visited my aunt's house especially during theid the the you know after the Ramadan and all after you know the pilgrimage season so we have two big uh AIDS or feasts so I used to visit my aunt and her children are there and this this photo is from I think you showed it but this is from the theid this this is her dress and my aunt would bring um a sheet of paper and and ask her daughters including s yal because I'm an English language teacher so she said Y show show M the new words that you have learned the colors the animals but now S I mean I did not I did not have the chance to bid her farewell this is my cousin and I lost 31 members of my extended family including three first cousins two of them with with their husband and children I didn't get just the chance even to see them before they were buried and I didn't know whether some of them had any part of their bodies intact after the air strikes so just imagine the magnitude of loss that I'm facing as a I'm just one person some some other people lost all their families and we know about the the the new term uh wounded the child no surviving family about more than two 2,000 children had the same case they were the only the so survivors of their family I mean what future is awaiting them no one is asking this question no abuta is an award-winning poet and author he has a new book of poetry out it's

way this poem was written after May 2021 attacks so my son yazan was uh about 5 years old old my daughter yaa was uh four years old and this is about them now this is very important because you just said this is written in May 2021 half your poems in forest of noise are before last October 7th and the other half after well I mean this tells you this tells you and others a lot of things so this this poem could be written today and if if it was written today it there are so many things that would not be present here because this current genocide is so different from any other uh Wars that Israel launched against the civilian population in the Gaza Strip my son throws a blanket over my daughter Gaza May 2021 at night at home we sit on the floor close to each other far from the windows and the red lights of bombs our backs bang on the walls whenever the house shakes we stare at each other's faces scared yet happy that so far our lives have been spared the walles wake up from their fitful sleep no arms to wipe at their blurry eyes flies gather around the only lit ceiling lamp for warmth in the bitter night cold except when missiles hit and burn up houses and Roads and trees the neighborhood next to us where yazen learned to ride his bike scorched every time time we hear a bomb falling from an F-16 or an F35 Our Lives Panic Our Lives freeze somewhere in between confused where to head next a graveyard a hospital a nightmare I keep my shivering hand on my wrist watch ready to remove the battery if needed my 4-year-old daughter yafa wearing a pink dress given to her by a friend here's a bomb lood she gasps covers her mouth with her dresses Ruffles yazan her 5 and a half yearold brother grabs a blanket worn by his sleepy body he lays the blanket on his sister you can hide now he assures her and I have a video of that it's on my phone I took a video of my son throwing a blanket that's that's how I couldn't forget this moment now you're kids know the hospitals in Gaza that we were just describing um tell us to humanize Kamal adwan Hospital ala Hospital yeah yeah I mean by the way ala hospital so Kamal adwan is run by the Gaza Health Ministry the the Ala hospital is run by the Palestinian red crescent which is an NGO um and and the Ala hospital is U dedicated mainly to the uh people who cannot afford to pay uh health health insurance and uh many of the uh pregnant mothers uh who go to onra clinics are referred to Al the hospital to give birth there for free so it's it's a hospital not only not only for the patient but also for the pregnant women to give birth my sister a uh 30 sorry 35 years old is pregnant and she's about to give birth and there is no hospital near close to her so I don't know what she's going to do um Kamal adwan hospital is the main hospital in Bia and also in B project um and in the past few years it was turned into a children's hospital and I used to take yafa and yzan to that hospital when they feel sick when they have fever when they are injured and I have many friends who used to work as nurses there and I know Dr Ham Abu safia who is the the head of the kamalan hospital right now who we watched just a few minutes ago I mean he is very helpless I mean I use this in my language I say that situation in North G in be or north is catastrophic I mean how many times did I use the same word I mean sometimes I want to stop writing because I'm repeating the same the same word even though the situation is worse so I mean the language is is helpless I mean I use the same the same vocabulary after October 7th it describ the situation in in North Gaza in be lahia I said we had no water no food that was October 12th and now we are October 25th 2024 so I hear I mean does the language help us why do why why does the world make us feel I mean helpless I think I I mean I I I don't like this as a human being we have never never stopped shouting and screaming and showing our pictures and videos can you remind our viewers and listeners who may not have seen you on democ now first soon after October 7th we talked to you in Gaza um we then talk to you or spoke to others about you when you were taken by the Israeli military um then when you were released and made it with your family to Cairo we spoke to you yeah we spoke to you in South Africa and now you have come to the United States but take us on that Journey how you got out and remind us what happened when you were separated from your family and taken by the Israeli military so Emy that that interview that you did with me it was October 12th I can't forget the because that was the last the last day I was in my house I just finished my interview with you on October 12th I think it was uh 300 p.m. which is 8 oh 8 morning yeah I I even didn't pay attention to New York time yeah I mean by the time I finished my interview with you I went down my SI my father and mother and my my brother Hamza and his children and his pregnant wife my brother my brother Muhammad and his wife my sister a with her children who is now pregnant um my sister s and my sister SU about 25 people were in the house with me so I went down and I found my father and my mother packing their their bags and when I talk about bags I talk about children's uh school bags we don't have suitcases by the way which is something that many people don't understand why because we don't have airports we don't need suit suitcases we travel with our backpacks my children's kindergarten backpack I stuff it with some clothes and some I I put some water s some water bottle there so I found my parents packing their their their bags and I I asked him where are you going and they said you know the Israelis just dropped some leaflets ordering the residents of B about 9 90,000 people you know to evacuate and that was the first time I found my parents you know leaving and then I went upstairs I didn't know what to take with me I only took with me the copy one copy the only copy that I had of my first poetry book and I took a bottle of water and some clothes for my children and then we went to the refugee camp and where do you know where we stayed we stayed in the same uh neighborhood that was bummed yesterday where where 150 people were killed and I just told you about the names of the people who were killed including inat who I now remember that uh we got one hour of uh of water from the tab when I when we were in the camp and in fact he would tell tell the neighbors the water is on the water is on fill your buckets so I remember here um and then when the bombing got intense in the refugee camp we thought of going to an honorous school which is just a few hundred meters away from the neighborhood in the camp so we stayed in the in a in a school shelter in jabalia which was later raided by the Israeli Army and by the way a few days ago the Israelis again visited that school took the men out incl and they has they have abducted so many including my S my wife's sister husband he he's he's a brother-in-law to me so he they took him and one reason he he stayed in the school he's a nurse he couldn't leave the refugees in the school without any any any nursing person so he was abducted and he's left with three children the youngest was born after October 7th so when the bombing got intense I had to leave the school with my wife and kids especially because we had the the chance to leave Gaza H for Egypt and and and and on the Salah Street which was described by the Israeli as a save passage I was abducted by the Israeli soldiers I was handcuffed and blindfolded and before that I had to remove all my clothes I was naked for the first time in my life and under gun point two Israeli soldiers were pointing their guns at me and the the the person next to me and then they were we were taken to a place we didn't know I mean it's for me as a Palestinian who was born in Gaza I had never been to Palestine which is now Israel so so that was the first time for me to sleep in my country as a datiny as someone who was blindfolded and handcuffed as someone who didn't know there his wife and children who he left behind we're still breathing just imagine Not only was I taken and blindfolded and handcuffed and and beaten and harassed and insulted they kept saying bad words in Arabic to these are the only words they know in Arabic insulting words but also I did not know whether my wife and kids from whom I was separated were still breathing whether they went to a place that is safe because there is no place that is safe why because when there is occupation there is nothing that's called a safe place and I had also to worry about my mother and father who I left behind in the refugee camp and my siblings and their children I mean I I I I was torn I was torn into a hundred pieces thinking about myself where why are they taking me where are they taking me and I heard the the some young men uh screaming you know some of them were had to be separated from their from their pregnant wives so after 3 days um I was released I was dropped at the same checkpoint well there was International outcry over you having been taken as as as m not as a Palestinian so I think many people cared about me because I am uh a friend on and a writer but they did not maybe um consider maybe doing the same thing with other people it's easy to get someone out uh than getting a whole population uh from under the military uh Fist of the Israeli Army I mean just imagine if if I was not a writer if if I was not a poet if I did not have a publisher if I did not have an um you know some journals and magazine that I wrote for just imagine no one knew about me I would still have been under the Israeli uh custody maybe I could have died just like Dr Adan B who was taken from Al hospital by the way in November last year and he was announced last October he was the best surgeon in the Gaz trip and he was he died he was killed I wanted to ask you about another man another poet but he didn't make it um the Palestinian poet the Islamic University Professor someone you knew rafat alad last on Democracy Now October 10th 2023 rafat was killed by an Israeli strike in December along with his brother sister and four of his nieces this is Scottish actor Brian Cox reciting rafat ELO's poem If I must die and then I want you to share your poem a sort of segue to it a thoughts if I must die a video that went viral if I must die you must live to tell my story to sell my things to buy a piece of cloth and some strings make it white with a long tail so that a child somewhere in Gaza while looking heaven in the eye awaiting his dad who left in Ablaze and bid no one farewell not even to his flesh not even to himself seiz the kite my kite you made flying up above and thinks for a moment an angel is there bringing back love if I must die let it bring hope Let It Be A Tale Scottish actor Brian Cox you know um who played in succession reciting rafat alad's poem If I must die in a video that went viral and you can go to democracynow.org to see our interview with rafat just before he was killed in your book masab abua Forest of noise um talk about rafat and then your kind of rejoiner to this poem I I mean I I knew rat as a professor at the isic University of Gaza he did not teach me but I would say that he taught me a lot uh because when I was uh in my second year he was in Malaysia doing completing his finishing his PhD um and when he returned I was already finishing my courses um so but he was someone who led me uh to the we are not numbers project that he co-founded which is a project that um offer some mentorship for Young Writers I was uh in the beginning of my writing career so he introduced me to the group and uh that is a picture that I took with the strawberries uh we're showing an image of fat holding strawberries yeah yeah we picked that strawberry that same strawberry together in ble in my father-in-law's farm from father my father-in-law's Farm um so yeah I I knew as um as a father he's he he was a Wonder a wonderful father uh uh for his kids and he was a lovely son of his parents his parents still survive I hope in Gaza City um and he's also a professor of English literature and we talk when we when when we when we were talking uh about literature he would talk about Arabic literature and also English literature his favorite poet I think was John dun and in the Arabic language he loved the classical Arabic poems like Al like like he would recite some Arabic poems to me and I was amazed you know um so uh before before was killed he published his poem uh if I must die and he posted it on his Instagram and I read that and I was still in North Gaza it was before I was abducted and it was very heartbreaking for me I mean someone writing about his death and what his he wishes his death to be um um like and I couldn't but try and write my own uh if I must die but I did not call it if I must die I wrote If I'm going to die but after he was killed I retitled the poem which is now called a request a request after if I am going to die let it be a clean death no Rubble over my corpse no broken dishes or glasses and no not many Cuts in my head or chest leave my ironed untouched jackets and pants in the closet so I may wear some of them again at my funeral yeah MAV abuta reading from his new second book of poetry Forest of noise just months after rafat was killed his eldest daughter sha rafat um was also killed an Israeli strike in Gaza along with her husband and two-month-old son uh rat's grandchild yeah yeah I mean just imagine I mean rat became a grandfather after he was killed he was he became a grandfather after he was killed and I mean something that that breaks my heart just like just as it must break break everyone's heart is that when someone is killed they even don't know who was killed with them they don't know I mean did not know that his his daughter sha and her husband ABD I think his name and and and his grandchild were killed after him I mean I don't know whether he knows about this whether I mean he's now I mean feeling a lot of pain knowing about this um so it is it is a campaign of killing the father the mother the sister I would call this not only a genocide it is it's not only a genocide against a people but it's also a genocide against families because when you look at the names of the people who are killed you see the name of the father the mother the children the grandchildren it's not about killing five people from the street or five people in the mosque or the school it's killing a whole family when I tell you that I lost 31 members of my extended family I talk about two first cousins with their husband and their children I'm not talking about my cousin no her husband their children the youngest two or four m can you look into this camera and share your message with the world what you want the world to take away right now about what's happening in your home in Gaza I mean if the world cannot really help us I hope that they will not continue to uh to support the oppressor if you can't really stop this why don't you just go away I mean I I wish the world was ignoring us no they are not ignoring us no they are contributing to our suffering and our the our our the genocidal campaign that Israel has been launching not not since last year since 60 76 years I mean I mean you maybe you just mentioned that um that that blinkin would say says that in a few days you know the the negotiations would start again I mean why don't you say the same things about sending the weapons to Israel why don't you oh in in a few days we will try and send the Israelis some new weapons why don't you take your time and think about what these weapons are going to do why does it take time to resume negotiations and force the Israelis to stop their their their killing of my people why does it take time what why is it difficult to stop this but it's easy to send more and more weapons just leave us leave us alone your choice of a last poem to share with our audience around the world would you like to share the moon or right or left or under the rebel oh under the rebel is long so I would just go with right or left which is a poem that I wrote for one of my my my friend's uh sisters my friend himself was killed with his parents with his uh with with four of his sisters with his two children so the only survivors was were his wife and two other sisters so the the body of my friend is abuin the body of his sister uh 16 years old and his father are still under the so I read this poem about the bodies that remain under the rubel the body of his sister right or left under the rubble her body has remained for days and days when the war ends we try to remove the rubble stone after Stone we only find one small bone from her body it is a bone from her arm right or left it does not matter as long as we cannot find the H from her neighbor's wedding on her skin or the ink from a school pen on a little index finger" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Good evening and welcome to Washington Week. I want everyone to know that I take the Trump Muk breakup drama seriously. In part because Donald Trump gave his former best friend Elon Musk, access to enormous amounts of secret government data, and there's no predicting what Musk could do with it. But the world at large is in a state of seemingly permanent tumult, and so it's a good time for a general checkup. My guest tonight is Thomas Friedman, a 3-time Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and foreign affairs columnist for The New York Times. Tom, thanks for coming in for our seemingly annual, annual checkup, um, uh, the, uh, I, I, I want to ask you about this Elon Musk, uh, business, um, and maybe we can put it into some serious context. Before I, before we, we jump to that, I want to Read something that my colleague Charlie Warzel writing in The Atlantic this morning had to say, uh, the sun rises every morning. Spring turns to summer, water is wet. Donald Trump and Elon Musk's relationship has ended with a post about Jeffrey Epstein. And then, of course, uh, you know, he, he tweeted, these guys really do escalate quickly. um, Trump, Musk tweeted, time to drop the really big bomb. Real Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have Nice day, DJT, um, So Put this into some kind of context that makes sense for ordinary people. What is going on here? Well, I confess, Jeff, on the way over, I thought you'd asked me about this and the first thing that popped into my mind was the Iran-Iraq war. What do we say about the Iran-Iraq war if only both sides could lose, OK, so, uh, there's no hero in this story. Um, what it really is, is the latest manifestation to me of the central truth of the Trump 2 administration. Trump one was surrounded by buffers. Trump too is surrounded by amplifiers and therefore stuff that used to begin at the Mar a Lago bar and then get muffled in the Oval Office, now goes from the Mar a Lago bar right to the Oval Office, right to you and me, and whether it's what he feels about you know, Musk or his role. He wants him in the government. But to me the whole Musk phenomenon is part of a much deeper and more disturbing phenomenon from an American citizen point of view, which is nothing here is modeled. Nothing here is stress tested. Everything is a riff. The country is being run like the Trump Organization today, not like the United States of America. And so as a result of that, Jeff, there's no second order thinking. All right. What's second order thinking? I'm going to put on tariffs, OK, 10% across the board, including Canada and Mexico, even though I'm violating an agreement I signed with them when I was president last time. Second order thinking is, oh my God, you mean the Ford F-150, only one third of its parts are made in America. Um, and the other 2/3 now are going to be tariff. I will bet any amount of money, no one told him that. And that's true now of everything. And so, you know, for the first trimester of this administration, do you think the 1st 3 months, all of this was kind of entertaining, but now he's running up against a wall. It turns out he can't solve the Russia-Ukraine war overnight. It turns out tariff wars aren't easy to win. It turns out Musk is not going to, you know, do the revolution and the government for. Turns out courts sometimes don't like what you do. So I think the second, you know, uh, 3 months are going to get very interesting as he runs into this reality, and I don't know where it's going to go, but it leaves me disquiet. That's interesting. I was thinking as you were saying this, I was thinking about John Kelly, General John Kelly, being, uh, and along with General Mattis and others being those buffers or filters, uh, there's literally no one in the White House or in the whole system who does anything but amplify. Is that fair to say? I mean, I, I just don't Treasury Secretary, I, I, I just don't see it, you know, I mean, yeah, you hear these stories that the Treasury Secretary had to wait, you know, for, um, uh, one of the other, you know, economic guys that Peter Navarro to be out of the room for him to come in to try to change the tariffs. This is crazy stuff. Now, I happen to be in China, uh, twice in the last 6 months. I've watched a lot of this from China actually and, and when you see it from China, I mean, they say a couple of things. One is, you know, we are never going to put our president in a situation like Zelensky. in the Oval Office where he can be embarrassed, number one, the second thing they say, Jeff, is that this isn't cute. We just saw Donald Trump tear up a trade agreement that Donald Trump made with America's two closest neighbors and allies, Canada and Mexico. What is the value therefore of a trade agreement with him now and um you know, the Chinese, uh, uh, these are, these are you like them or hate them. These are serious people, you know, and they are not spontaneous. No, exactly. So when Trump put 10 47, um, uh, 44% tariff on them, they said, uh, you're talking to me? You talking to me? Do you realize that we control 90% of the rare earths that make the magnets that go in every car you make. Do you realize that? Which he didn't, which is why Ford and GM and Stantis had to announce this week we may actually have to curb some production because we're running out of Chinese magnets. Right. The stay stay with, uh, stay with this Musk question for a minute and, and, and this, this, this, this issue of Musk as a, as a radical isotope in a kind of way. He's been given access to the government secrets across the board in order to cut your government agencies through the Doge operation. Um, that seems like an operational security nightmare if he goes rogue surprising to you? I mean, how, how, where does this, where does this relationship go? Can they bring it back from the brink? Is there anybody who's trying to bring it back from the brink, or is this just more chaos? Well, you know, I think the best way to understand this is not with the analogy of Political science, but world wrestling Federation. And, and those, uh, uh, in World Wrestling Federation, there are breakups and comeback and new teams and whatnot. I put this all in the area of entertainment, you know, not in, in something serious. We're dealing with two extremely unstable characters, but what really is, is more important is what's the wider world audience saying? What's the wider world audience saying? They're saying, you know, for, for all of our lifetime, Jeff, sort of post-war America. If I had an extra $1 and I'm a foreigner, I'm going to put it in America. If I have an extra, you know, brain power and, and a, and a brainy person, I'm gonna study in America. And if I have a little extra dollop of trust, I'm going to trust America. Now you take all three of those things away, and you end up with a, a very different relationship between America and the world. OK, so I have to ask you, and by the way, it's interesting. right? Miami is Miami because it's a safe place for people's money. Harvard is or was Harvard because people want to come from around the world and so on and the United Nations is headquartered in New York, you know, you know, I mean, everybody, for, for a reason. We were the, we were the, we wrote the the rules of the road for the post-war international order. The question is, You're an ally or an adversary, and you're looking at, at, at this, uh, clown show, by the way, on the weekend that marks the 81st anniversary of D-Day, noting just for the record, um, you, you put yourselves in the shoes of an ally and adversary. Are you thinking that this is a midlife crisis America's having a nervous breakdown, or is this some kind of weird terminal illness. I don't know which. All I know is I'm completely disoriented. If I'm an ally and I'm completely disoriented if I'm the foreign affairs columnist for The New York Times because I've never covered this world and you know, um, uh, our friend, you know, Freed Zakaria wrote a book, um, uh, uh, 15 years ago or so called the post-American world, and Fred's book was really about a change in relative power, you know, between that there'll be the rise of Brazil and India and other countries, so we won't have as much power as we had before. What really, if I were writing a book today, Jeff would be called the post-America world. OK, that's what I'm really worried about because America stood for some things. It stood for universal values. It stood for stability. It stood for the rule of law. It was a loyal ally. We were always against the dictator versus the people seeking freedom. What really worries me that at the end of my, you know, career basically. I'm, I'm dealing with the post-America world, America, I grew up and loved and was devoted to and as someone who lived abroad like you have, know how important that America is to the whole world. American ism and stability makes the world go around. You take us out of the equation. It's not like anybody else comes in. I'm sorry. You have, you have a no superpower world, you know, but, but come back to this, is this, do you think that this instability that we're experiencing emotional, political, all the instabilities that we're experiencing. Could it be temporary, or is this Can we not come back? reputationally to start. Well, the thing I'm worried about most is that, and it may seem like a simple thing, but you know, uh Donald Trump came in and he told all the Democrats on the board of the Kennedy Center, you're gone. Now traditionally every president sort of left the other party's people there and then he put in his people. So when you enter into a kind of zero-sum politics now in America. When you fire the head of the NASA, after you appointed him because he made a donation, a tiny donation to a Democrat, you're into a kind of politics that I grew up with in the Middle East. What was that rule or die. OK, you're either in power or zero sum, OK? I'm on top or I'm in and, and so there's a book about African dictators called It's Our Turn to Eat, you know, and we're just gonna eat everything. So then, no, no, if you're a Democrat, and, and guess what, we do have, God willing, if we still have elections, rotations in power, did they come in now and treat all the Republicans in these traditional bipartisan forum, you know, the same way. And if that happens, we're really off to the races and then the whole thing just starts to what country does that remind you of that, you know, you, you, you, you, I mean, so many dictatorships just in general that I've covered over the years. That's what you come in, you wipe out all the other guys' people. Well, that's not how we do things in this country, right, right. Let's talk about a country that's not democratic for a second, um, you know, the, the, I, I want you to watch this. It's the latest analysis by President Trump of the current state of play in in Russia's war against Ukraine, and he's talking about Putin here. He got hit. He's been doing hitting, so I understand it, but he got hit hard. And I don't think he's playing games. I said, President. Maybe you're going to have to keep fighting and suffering a lot because both sides are suffering before you pull them apart before they're able to be pulled apart, but it's a pretty known analogy, you have two kids, they fight, fight, fight. Sometimes you let them fight for a little while. You see it in hockey, you see it in sports. Not Henry Kissinger, but he's trying to impose his own realpolitik understanding of what is he misunderstanding from your perspective, Jeff, do you know how flat out crazy that is. I mean, that's like saying, well, you know, I mean, Hitler in Poland, they fight, they fight, they come back, you know what I mean? Um, yeah, Trump came in and said I can end this war, all right, there's one way to end this war. You say to Vladimir Putin, um, if you don't stop the war, um, uh, and, and we agreed to the ceasefire terms I dictate. We are bringing Ukraine into NATO in 30 days. Which part of that sentence don't you understand? Do you want to mess with me? Test me. That's how you end this war. What you just heard of Donald Trump, that sounds like a commentator on Fox TV. He's not the commentator. He's president of the United States. Well, he hit him and he hit them and he hit this guy invaded a country. He's basically tried to rape a country. That's what Putin did, OK, and the Ukrainians with incredible bravery stood up and defended basically the Western. On something that's very important because if Ukraine were able to join the European Union, Jeff, then you have a Europe that's really whole and free. That's actually a big deal for Europe and for us, and this guy is talking about it like it's some schoolyard fight and they're morally equal. It's nuts and it's, it's disgusting. Right. Is there any issue from a foreign affairs columnist perspective. Is there any issue in which Trump is not transactional. Have you ever seen have you ever seen a sign of a, um, what we would think of as in a bipartisan way, American idealism. Out of Trump? Yeah, um, none comes to mind. What I would say, I, where I thought you might be going is, um, uh, you know, some things are also true even if Donald Trump believes them, and by the way, his transactionalism sometimes can also be an advantage, for instance, I'm glad he's sitting down with the Iranians. Let's see what you got. I'm glad he told the Syrian president, um, uh, I'm gonna give you a reputation to live up to. I didn't mind him talking directly to Hamas. If I can get the hostages out, so there is that. transactional side of him that I think could be an advantage, but it's not grounded in any moral, you know, framework of what we stand for as a country. What we've always stood for if it's just a kind of free floating thing. It becomes very, very dangerous in, in his non-sophisticated analysis of the current state of play, uh, in, in Russian and Ukraine. He didn't really talk about the drone attack that Ukraine launched on Russian. aerial assets deep inside Russia, does that change? This war, um, you know, you know, Joe, I'd say two things, and again, it's part of the craziness of this moment. Let's start at 30,000 ft and then come down to the battlefield at 30,000 ft, you and I are having this discussion on the eve of the greatest technological revolution in human history. We are very close to a birthing a new species, not a new machine, a new artificially intelligent species. Um, and it's going to be with us under sometime, sometime, while Trump is president, it is not going to change one thing, it's going to change everything. We are not talking about that at all. So that's, I would say number one. Under that technological revolution, um, and you know, one of the things they say about AI, it'll actually be mankind's last invention. Because once we invent that, it will invent everything else. That's going to be a big deal under that though, we're seeing a revolution in military affairs. Basically Ukraine spent $20,000 to to knock out, you know, $20 million planes, $20,000 that was probably because they couldn't get Costco online, you know, from Kiev, and they had to buy them from Amazon, you know, um, so the, the, the asymmetric warfare world that we're entering now, um, wow, I mean if you're the US Navy and you're sitting 12 aircraft carriers and you just recovered from the fact that the Houthis, you know, you lost an FA Hornet because you had to swerve your cafeteria in the in the plane fell off the back because you were getting out of way of not a sterling moment naval history because you're avoiding a Houthi missile, a bunch of guys in flip flops, basically, um, in a country that's based water starved, the asymmetry we're going to be dealing with right now, um, uh, I think we have, we, these, these events are really disturbing and and going to require a huge revolution in how we think about military as I'm listening to you about AI, AGI, and, and drone warfare. I, I'm just thinking that the, the, the preoccupation this weekend in America is the emotionally febrile relationship between this ketamine taking billionaire and our reality TV star, president, and it's like there's something that's so deeply unserious about, and I think, I think it's been. two of our country that basically everything became politics. Um, and so we don't have just ESPN now. We have ESPN, you know, sort of politics sports network and it's, it's, it's a testament to the the underlying strength of our country, Jeff, that our economy goes on, we still invent amazing stuff, and we think we can afford this, and, and you know what Jeff, we, we can't afford it until we can, right" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="JEFFREY GOLDBERG: President Trump's leadership  on the world stage is being put to the test   everywhere, and the challenge for America's allies  and adversaries alike is this, figuring out his   actual policies. As the president prepares for  the first major foreign trip of his second term,   we assess America's erratic and contradictory  role in conflict zones across the globe, next. Good evening and welcome to Washington Week. Let me try to encapsulate the challenge before  us tonight. Here in Washington, no one knows   for sure what President Trump wants to do about  the Iranian nuclear program. No one in Jerusalem   knows if the president has truly just left Israel  to fight the Houthis of Yemen alone. In Ottawa,   no one really understands why Trump keeps  threatening Canada's sovereignty. In Copenhagen,   leaders are asking themselves if Trump would  actually invade Greenland. And at the Vatican,   one likely subject, how will the new  American pope get along with an American   president not known for sharing the stage or  the pope's views on poverty and immigration? I'll try to unpack these mysteries  tonight with my guests, Susan Glasser,   staff writer at the New Yorker, Asma Khalid is  an NPR White House correspondent and co-hosts   the NPR Politics Podcast, David Sanger is a White  House and national security correspondent at The   New York Times, and Nancy Youssef is a national  security correspondent at The Wall Street Journal. Okay, we have to go fast because there's a  lot of countries to talk about. The first,   let's talk about the biggest news of the week.  And I recognize that the election of a new pope   is a matter of supreme ecclesiastical  import, but this is Washington Week,   so we're just going to do the politics  of it. I'm very sorry about that. So, Pope Leo XIV is among other things an American  on the world stage with far more followers than   the entire MAGA movement combined. And so one of  the questions I have is how is this relationship   going to work? I mean, the president was very  kind about the new pope. He said it's such a great   honor for our country to have an American pope.  I mean, what greater honor could there be? And we   were a little bit surprised and very happy. It's  just a great, absolutely great honor. It's sort   of like America won Eurovision or something, but  it's -- you know, he was very generous about that. But I also want to take note of an article that  the pope, then-cardinal, recently posted. The   headline that he posted was, J.D. Vance is wrong,  Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others. So, let me start. David, let me  start with you. Try to look out   a little bit into the future. What do  you think this relationship between the   two most important Americans in  the world is going to look like? DAVID SANGER, White House Correspondent,  The New York Times: Well, I think,   initially, the president will probably  treat him with enormous respect and -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: There'll be  a visit, a big visit coming. DAVID SANGER: And there'll  be a big visit and you know,   the president's going to have to like  read up on the White Sox a little bit   because this is a Chicago pope after  all. But there's all that commonality. The problem's going to be if the discussion ever  turns to migration, if the discussion ever turns,   as you said, to poverty issues. And at some  point, you know, Donald Trump's not a guy who   tends to love to share the limelight out here. And  I think the biggest problem's going to come if he   thinks the pope is beginning to talk to American  voters in different ways than Donald Trump does. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. Asma,  do you think that part of the   motivation on the part of the College  of Cardinals was to have an American   counterbalance to Trump? I mean,  I know that there are people -- ASMA KHALID, White House Correspondent, NPR:  I'm not in the mind of the cardinals. Well,   I'll say I very diligently listened to all  of the live coverage. It was fascinating,   as the Muslim watching this all unfold. But I will say, look, I think regardless of  intention, the result will be that you have   a very loud -- an American with a loud megaphone  on a global stage that is not Donald Trump. And,   arguably, under any other circumstance, the  American president would be the loudest,   perhaps most popular American  in the international arena.   And now you have another, you  have a counterweight to that. So, regardless of intention, that  is the result. And I agree with   David that I don't think that Donald  Trump is one to share the limelight,   but I'm also really interested to see ways in  which he presents an alternative vision of what   it means to be an American this time (ph),  because there's a lot of debate about that. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: That's interesting. Susan,   you know, I remember when Pope Francis and  President Obama famously got along very,   very well. How far will President Trump go to  make his displeasure known if this pope eventually   starts talking about immigration in ways that,  let's say, Stephen Miller disagrees with? SUSAN GLASSER, Staff Writer, The New  Yorker: I don't think you're going to   have to wait too long. Donald Trump is not  a man to restrain him himself or his views,   Jeff. And I would imagine that the social  media posts will be voluminous and forthcoming.   You already see, in fact, a lot of discomfort if  you look in the sort of very online MAGA world,   especially, you know, very conservative, very  right wing Catholics in the United States.   They're not a big fan of someone who's already  publicly called out the vice president of the   United States on immigration views. And,  again, pointing out that in recent years,   this has been a major friction point  already with Pope Leo's predecessor,   who has also criticized the United States and  others for lack of empathy toward migrants at a   time when there are more people on the move around  the world than, you know, in any for decades. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. I mean, Nancy, do you  see -- I mean, I think for American Catholics,   especially, let's say, conservative-leaning  American Catholics, it kind of puts them in   an exquisitely sensitive position. He's the  leader of the church. It's ecclesiastical role,   obviously. But his politics seem  to be very, very different. I mean,   is this is a -- is this an electoral story or am I  being too parochial in my questioning about this? NANCY YOUSSEF, National Security Correspondent,  The Wall Street Journal: I don't know. Because   what was interesting to me is the  church introduced him as the second   pope from the Americas. They didn't  introduce him as the first American pope,   and I thought that was sort of interesting. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Well, he has  two decades or more in Peru. NANCY YOUSSEF: That's right. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: So, he's very associated with -- NANCY YOUSSEF: He's an American polyglot. He's  an American who's really spent a lot of time,   as you note, in Peru and also in Italy. At the same time, to me, what was fascinating  about it is how we speak about an American   pope. You know, just 65 years ago, there was a  question about whether Kennedy could be president,   whether he would answer to the pope. We have  six of our nine Supreme Court justices that   are Catholic. And so to your question in  terms of the influence that'll have on the   Catholic population here in the United  States, I think he really personifies a   church that was trying to sort of find  a compromise between the vision that   Francis had and some of the more conservative  Catholic positions here in the United States. And so where he fits in that and how much  he's able to resonate with American Catholics,   I think, is going to be very interesting. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. It's going to be  completely fascinating. We've never seen it.   It really is historic, this decision by the  church. I mean, there's things that we used   the term historic lightly, but this is really  quite a week in American history and obviously   the history of the church. And it's going to be  fascinating to watch these two men circle each   other and size each other up and figure out how  to get their way with the other to some degree. I want to pivot to talk about a current conflict,  not necessarily a future theological conflict.   Let's talk about Iran a little bit. And what I  want to talk about specifically is our Iranian   policy or policies. Let's listen to President  Trump talk about Iran's nuclear program,   first on Sunday, and then on Wednesday.  So, just listen to this for a moment. KRISTEN WELKER, Host, NBC News: Is  the goal of these talks limiting   Iran's nuclear program or total dismantlement? DONALD TRUMP, U.S. President: Total dismantlement. KRISTEN WELKER: That's all you'll accept? DONALD TRUMP: That's all I'd accept. You know,  civilian energy often leads to military wars. And   we don't want to have them have a nuclear weapon.  It's a very simple deal. I want Iran to be really   successful, really great, really fantastic. The  only thing they can't have is a nuclear weapon. REPORTER: Isn't the U.S. position  that Iran can have an enrichment   program as long as it doesn't reach a weapons -- DONALD TRUMP: We haven't made that decision yet. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Nancy,  what's our Iran policy today? NANCY YOUSSEF: I don't know. I'll do my  best though. I mean, he has basically said,   I think we're leaning towards this idea of  total dismantlement that sort of appears to   be where they're trying to go with it. But,  practically speaking, can they get there?   Why would Iran agree to that? And there's  no in indication that they're willing to. I think there's an assumption that's happening  that because they've lost a lot of power and   influence in the region between their  proxies being weakened in Lebanon and   in Syria, and in some cases in Yemen, that  somehow Iran is in a vulnerable position. And I would argue that, actually if you're Iran,  because of those losses that the nuclear program   becomes all the more important, I think the  United States is approaching it as though Iran   is at its weakest and not maybe considering  that that very weakness makes it harder for   them to really consider a program where they  would truly dismantle their nuclear program. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Asma, inside the White House,  are there different factions on the Iran question? ASMA KHALID: I mean, I think there certainly are  different factions within the White House. I mean,   the other factor I will say is that I'm  actually unclear though as to how and what,   you know, Trump fundamentally wants. I don't  have a clear sense of that. I will say like   the talks are ongoing. They have said now they  are meeting again this Sunday. Will it actually   lead to any sort of deal before he heads to  the Middle East, before the president heads   to the Middle East? No. I mean, I don't think  so. I mean, these are just ongoing talks. But   I think the White House feels optimistic about  that the fact that they are continuing to talk. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: You do a lot of reporting  inside the White House on these factions. Are   there distinct hawkish -- is there a distinct  hawkish group and a distinct dovish group? ASMA KHALID: I don't know that there's  a distinct dovish group. I don't know.   Does anybody think that there's a distinct  dovish group? I mean, I think maybe Trump. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Maybe quasi  isolationist. I don't know. ASMA KHALID: Yes. I mean, Trump, as a  whole, I think his foreign policy is   hard to parse as to where he himself stands.  But I don't know that there's a dovish group,   what I would describe as a dovish  group within the White House, yes. SUSAN GLASSER: Well, it seems to me  that we actually do know that it's   not about ideology for Donald Trump and that,  in fact, often, in my view, we overprioritize   here in Washington the idea that there is a  consistent ideology or policy goal. Donald   Trump's goal, we actually know his goal  here. It's to come out with the biggest,   bestest, most importantest deal that there can be  because he's looking for his Nobel Peace Prize. And I don't say that lightly. You know, this  is something, first of all, people didn't take   seriously enough, but even in his first term,  Donald Trump -- it wasn't what the hawks in   his own party or even in his own administration  wanted. He was looking for an opening to talk to   Iran in his first term. This is in part, he sees  this as unfinished business from that, and he is   looking for a goal. And part of the risk, and,  you know, we've debriefed many people who worked   for him in national security roles, as you have,  Jeff, in Donald Trump's first term, the fear that   his own people always had was that he would make  a bad deal because he was so eager to make a deal. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: But the irony of that, David,   is that the thing he fears most is having his  Iran deal be equated to Barack Obama's deal. DAVID SANGER: That's right. And when he's  seen headlines on stories that we've all   done here that do that comparison,  he hasn't reacted well to the -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Well, tell me more about that. DAVID SANGER: Well, the fundamental  problem that he faces right now is   that his criticism of the Obama  2015 deal was essentially twofold,   that you didn't stop them from being on  the pathway to Obama, in other words,   didn't dismantle everything. So, as soon  as Trump pulled out of the deal in 2018,   the Iranians were able to go reconstitute  their program, you know, within a few years. And the second problem he had was, and this was  a legitimate criticism in my view, was that the   Obama program was on the clock, and by 2030, the  Iranians were free to do whatever they want. Now,   he keeps saying they just can't have a bomb.  Well, that isn't the issue. The issue is can   they have a pathway to a bomb in case Trump  or a future president pulls back. And that's   the problem that Steve Witkoff's got  to get at. And it's the one they -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: And Witkoff is doing  the negotiating on Trump's behalf? DAVID SANGER: That's right. He's doing the  negotiations. He's up against an Iranian   negotiator, the foreign minister, Araghchi, who  was the number two negotiator in the previous -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: And Witkoff has no previous   experience negotiating nuclear deals or  anything other than real estate deals? DAVID SANGER: None. And the  guy he's negotiating against,   Foreign Minister Araghchi, knows every  single inch of the Iranian program,   from the getting of the fuel, to  the enrichment, all the way through. So, President Trump wants a like really short  deal, not the 150 pages of the Obama era one.   I think the Iranians see that as an opportunity  to have vague wording about what they can do. And   the Iranians say, look, they're a signatory to  the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. That means   they have the right to enrich. The question  is, can Witkoff talk them out of enriching. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. Nancy, go  into this a little bit more deeply,   because I'm very interested in the role  Israel plays here in this drama. Obviously,   Iran has argued and fights against Israel,  doesn't believe Israel should exist.   The Israelis have been extremely worried  about Iranian nuclear potential for 20,   25 years. The current prime minister of Israel,  Benjamin Netanyahu, has signaled to us in manifold   ways that he trusts Trump to deal with Iran  more than he ever trusted Obama or Biden,   but here we are, when he seems to be looking  for a deal, as Susan suggests, at all costs. So, where does this leave Netanyahu and his  relationship with Donald Trump right now? NANCY YOUSSEF: Well, the truth is it changed in  some ways quite dramatically this week in that we   really saw more public tension and an expression  of frustration after the United States reached a   deal with the Houthis that essentially said, you  can continue attacking Israeli ships, and then we   started to see strikes by the Houthis into Israel.  And remember that the Houthis are backed by Iran. NANCY YOUSSEF: And so I think we saw a major  shift where that sort of promise that the   U.S. and Israel be lock step with -- if there  was a threat from Iran seemed to be framed. To me, what's interesting is  what happens if Israel decides,   as Trump has said, that you have to  deal with your threats as you see them,   they strike at Iran and need U.S. support?  Will the U.S. come through? The indications   we got from the White House today was that they  wouldn't, but that would be a major break -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: When you say the  indications, go into that a little more deeply. NANCY YOUSSEF: Well, we heard a lot of tension  between the two. The president essentially said,   we are here to strike deals for the United States.  We're not here to strike deals for Israel. And so   when they struck the Houthis deal, he said very  frankly that this was a deal for U.S. interests   and that Israel had to look out for its own  defense. But what does that look like? Because   if Israel goes and does that and then needs U.S.  help, is it clear that the United States will -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Or if it goes  and doesn't need U.S. help,   but has nevertheless ignited a conflict -- DAVID SANGER: It's almost impossible to  imagine that though, Jeff, because the   Israeli capabilities are somewhat  limited here. And the question is,   do they want to strike at the Israeli -- at the  Iranian facilities but not really destroy them,   because it really takes U.S. weapons to  be able to get into the deepest of -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: 2,000 pound bombs, the deep -- DAVID SANGER: Right, to get to the fordo  site, which is built inside a mountain. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. DAVID SANGER: And so there are  very few scenarios in which   there's an Israel-Iran conflict where  the United States doesn't get sucked in. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Go ahead -- No. Let me --  I'll come back. But, Asma, as someone who's   reporting in the White House every week,  are you at all surprised that Donald Trump   would kind of tell the Israelis, well,  look I made a deal with the Houthis,   they're going to stop attacking American  ships and your problem is your problem? ASMA KHALID: I mean, I was -- yes. I will  say I was surprised given the sense that,   broadly speaking, I think that there was  an expectation that he was going to be,   and he presented himself throughout the  campaign as being, I think, a strong supporter. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Much stronger  than Joe Biden in his argument. ASMA KHALID: Exactly, right? And, look, I  don't think this is just -- not just the   Houthis statement this week. I think it's  notable that the president's traveling next   week to the Middle East. He's not visiting  Israel. He's visiting three Gulf countries. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. ASMA KHALID: Part of this is  also, I think, the fact that,   you know, the war in Gaza rages on, he  doesn't really want to be committed to that. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: And there are more hotel  building opportunities in the Gulf, sorry,   I will say it, but that's  the reality of this trip. ASMA KHALID: But, yes, no, I think I'm surprised  in that regard. On the other side, I will say,   though, I mean, Trump has often presented,  and we can talk about this as -- you know,   we'll probably talk a bit about like India,  Pakistan. I mean, broadly, this administration's   view is sort of like we don't want to be engaged  in other wars, we want to step out of it. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Susan, I want to  talk a bit about India and Pakistan. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Not that Asma  is directing, but she is. I mean,   it's very important, but I think you  had one quick point to make on that. SUSAN GLASSER: Well, just -- I  think that people didn't understand   that Donald Trump had a much more charged  relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu than   his campaign season rhetoric would have  it, and actually never got over his fury   with Netanyahu for calling up Joe Biden and  congratulating him for the 2020 election. NANCY YOUSSEF: That came up during  the TIME Magazine interview. SUSAN GLASSER: Yes, exactly. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Which was, in ordinary  politics, a very normal thing to do,   you congratulate whoever wins the election. But  for whatever reason, Trump was offended by that? SUSAN GLASSER: Well, it's  Donald Trump's litmus test. SUSAN GLASSER: It's all personal for him. SUSAN GLASSER: And, again, it's not about policy.  But I do think that not visiting Israel this week   is very notable because Steve Witkoff was  also in charge of negotiating a ceasefire   that was going to be a permanent ceasefire  between Israel and Hamas. That has failed.   The administration doesn't want to call attention  to the fact that Witkoff has failed to produce a   ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. He has  failed to produce a meaningful ceasefire   between Russia and Ukraine. And now Trump has  given him this other assignment with Iran. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: He's a busy guy. Okay. So, in the next five minutes,  we have to talk about Pakistan, India,   Canada, and Denmark. So, I will  try to keep my question short,   but I do want you to listen to J.D. Vance  talking about the India-Pakistan conflict.   I mean, obviously, it seems to me that it's  America's business when two nuclear-armed   powers seem to be escalating a war, but J.D.  Vance has a more nuanced view. Let's listen. J.D. VANCE, U.S. Vice President: What we can do  is try to encourage these folks to deescalate a   little bit, but we're not going to get involved  in the middle of war. That's fundamentally none   of our business and has nothing to do with  America's ability to control it. You know,   America can't tell the Indians to lay down their  arms. We can't tell the Pakistanis to lay down   their arms. And so we're going to continue to  pursue this thing through diplomatic channels.   Our hope and our expectation is that this is  not going to spiral into a broader regional war,   or God forbid, a nuclear conflict. But,  sure, we're worried about these things. ASMA KHALID: That sounded like hopes and prayers,   right? We're offering our hopes and  prayers that this will not escalate. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Well, what it sounded like to   me is -- stay on this -- is a little bit  like we're no longer the superpower that   dispatches the secretary of state  to go stop people from fighting. ASMA KHALID: I mean, I would assume --  I shouldn't say, I would assume. Look,   I don't think that it benefits, I would say,   certainly Pakistan or neither India really  to escalate in this situation. And if they   could find a way to deescalate an off-ramp,  it would be open to it. No one, no country,   certainly not the United States, is publicly  offering that leadership for an off-ramp. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: David is  this war America's business? DAVID SANGER: You know, anytime that two  countries that combined have probably 400   more or more nuclear weapons come together, it  can become your business really quickly. And   that's the problem here. And, you know, back  in 2001, when there was another one of these   really bad conflicts, Colin Powell went over to  Delhi and to Islamabad. And I remember him saying   to me one time after he was done with this, it  had been his plan to make sure there was a senior   American in one capital or the other so that these  countries would not head into the worst of this. DAVID SANGER: And, you know, what have  we seen now just in the past few hours,   attacks directly around Islamabad on  some of their military sites (ph). NANCY YOUSSEF: That's a great point. But they  were also -- in the first Trump administration,   when there were tensions in 2019, Mike Pompeo,   writes about this in his book about the  U.S. intervention, that this was the U.S. -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Former secretary of state. NANCY YOUSSEF: Excuse me, yes. NANCY YOUSSEF: And, by the way, Rubio has  been in touch with the parties all week. So,   it's not like they weren't involved. And so this  idea, this has been the role that the U.S. has   played as a broker, and to say right now at the  height of tensions, we're stepping back, there is   no one else to fill that void that the U.S. has,  as you know, since 2001 and certainly before that   filled, this is not the time to sort of change the  fundamentals of how we approach these conflicts. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Susan, I want to play something  that President Trump said about two of our allies,   Canada and Denmark, and then I want you to comment  on it and then tie it up into a very neat package. KRISTEN WELKER: I asked you if you would  rule out military force to take Greenland,   and you said, no, you don't rule out anything.  Would you rule out military force to take Canada? DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think we're not  going to ever get to that point. It could   happen -- something could happen  with Greenland. I'll be honest,   we need that for national  and international security. KRISTEN WELKER: But you are not ruling  out military force to take Greenland? DONALD TRUMP: I don't rule it out. I don't say  I'm going to do it, but I don't rule out anything. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Susan, we have a lot of  problems and challenges in the world. Denmark,   which owns Greenland, is a NATO ally.  Why is the president of the United States   threatening a NATO ally with military  action when there's so much else to do. SUSAN GLASSER: Jeff, you know, I don't  think we need to get inside Donald Trump's   brain or pretend that we understand him to  look and see. This is the through line of   Donald Trump from the minute he stepped  on the public stage is attacks often   inexplicable on America's allies and praise  often inexplicable for America's adversaries.   And that is the one consistency that we've  seen from Donald Trump, a man who can change   his mind three times in one day on what our  actual goal is in Iran nuclear negotiations. But right now, the fact remains that Donald Trump,  a little bit more than 100 days into office,   is threatening Denmark and praising Iran,  okay? So, we are in a kind of an Alice   in Wonderland situation. And that I think is  the longer term damage to the United States. You asked it to put it together. What I would say,   and I've been thinking this week about the  passing of someone we all know, Joe Nye,   great professor from Harvard, came up with the  concept of soft power, America soft power in   the world. Donald Trump is trading that away  because leadership was our power in the world. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: That was a pretty  good answer. Thank you, Susan. We're going to have to leave it  there for now. We'll be talking   about these things obviously in the  weeks to come. But I want to thank   our guests for joining me. I want to  thank you at home for watching us. I'm Jeffrey Goldberg. Goodnight from Washington. (BREAK) END" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="BREAKING NEWS TONIGHT. DONALD TRUMP ACCEDES TO A COURT ORDER 57 DAYS AFTER THE SUPREME COURT UNANIMOUSLY ORDERED DONALD TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION TO FACILITATE THE RETURN OF KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA AFTER HE WAS SENT TO EL SALVADORAN PRISON BY MISTAKE. TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION BROUGHT HIM BACK TO THE UNITED STATES, THUS ENDING TRUMP'S GAME OF CHICKEN WITH THE SUPREME COURT. IN THE LAST 57 DAYS, DONALD TRUMP HAS CLAIMED THAT RETURNING ABREGO GARCIA IS NOT WHAT THE COURT ORDERED HIM TO DO. HE'S CLAIMED THE DECISION WAS IN THE HANDS OF EL SALVADOR'S PRESIDENT, AND TODAY ALL THOSE EXCUSES, ALL THOSE EXCUSES WERE EXPOSED AS JUST THAT, EXCUSES, BECAUSE TODAY DONALD TRUMP CAVED, TACOED IF YOU WILL. CHICKENING OUT IN THIS CASE IS A GOOD THING. TRUMP IS NOT DEFYING A SUPREME COURT ORDER ANYMORE, AT LEAST. WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE ON THIS LATER IN THE SHOW, INCLUDING HOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL PAM BONDI IS TRYING DESPERATELY TO MAKE THIS TACO SEEM TOUGH AND TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE THE DEMOCRATS WERE WRONG TO SPEAK UP AND DEMAND THAT THE TRUMP DOJ FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION AND NOT DISAPPEAR PEOPLE TO FOREIGN PRISONS WITHOUT DUE PROCESS. BUT IT WAS DEMOCRATS LIKE MARYLAND SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLAND WHO FLEW TO EL SALVADOR AND DEMANDED TO SEE ABREGO GARCIA, WHO WAS THEN, UH, TAKEN OUT OF THE NOTORIOUS TERRORIST MEGAPRISON AND MOVED TO A LOWER SECURITY DETENTION FACILITY, AND HE RAISED PUBLIC PRESSURE ABOUT IT. THE SUPREME COURT IN A 9 TO 0 DECISION, WE DON'T SEE MANY OF THOSE. IN A 9 TO 0 DECISION. ORDERED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO FACILITATE THE RETURN OF MR. ABREGO GARCIA IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS. NOW, IF PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN IGNORE THE COURTS, THAT'S A VERY SHORT, SHORT ROAD TO TYRANNY. I HAVE MADE VERY CLEAR FROM THE START. THAT I'M NOT VOUCHING FOR THE MAN, MR. ABREGO GARCIA. I AM VOUCHING FOR HIS RIGHTS BECAUSE IF YOU DENY HIS RIGHTS, YOU PUT IN JEOPARDY THE RIGHTS OF EVERYBODY WHO RESIDES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I WANT TO COME BACK TO THAT STORY VERY SHORTLY, BUT TODAY THE CONSERVATIVES ON TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT GRANTED ELON MUSK'S SO-CALLED DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY ACCESS TO SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION DATA, INCLUDING SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS, IN THEIR QUEST TO FIND WASTE, FRAUD AND ABUSE, WHICH THEY'VE LARGELY FAILED TO FIND SO FAR. THE THREE LIBERALS ON THE COURT DISSENTED, WITH JUSTICE KATANJI BROWN JACKSON ARGUING THE CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY WAS SIMPLY DOING DONALD TRUMP'S BIDDING. THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO GIVE DOGE UNFETTERED ACCESS TO THIS PERSONAL NON-ANONYMIZED INFORMATION RIGHT NOW BEFORE THE COURTS HAVE TIME TO ASSESS WHETHER DOGE'S ACCESS IS LAWFUL. IN ESSENCE, THE URGENCY UNDERLYING THE GOVERNMENT'S STAY APPLICATION IS A MERE FACT THAT IT CANNOT BE BOTHERED TO WAIT FOR THE LITIGATION PROCESS TO PLAY OUT BEFORE PROCEEDING AS IT WISHES. THAT SENTIMENT HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN INSUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY THE KIND OF EXTRAORDINARY INTERVENTION THE GOVERNMENT SEEKS. BUT ONCE AGAIN, THIS COURT DONS ITS EMERGENCY RESPONDER GEAR, RUSHES TO THE SCENE, AND USES ITS EQUITABLE POWER TO FAN THE FLAMES RATHER THAN TO EXTINGUISH THEM. TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT IS LETTING THE MUSK CREATE A DOGE, WHICH IS A FAKE GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT IS NOW NOT RUN BY ELON MUSK, ACCESS TO YOUR SENSITIVE DATA. THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTS THE JUSTICES CLEARED THE WAY FOR DOE REPRESENTATIVES TO ACCESS THE SENSITIVE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION DATA OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHILE LITIGATION ON THE MATTER CONTINUES. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE SUPREME COURT GRANTING MOST OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S EMERGENCY REQUESTS TO LIFT OR SCALE BACK LOWER COURT RULINGS, BLOCKING HIS INITIATIVES WHILE LEGAL CHALLENGES PLAY OUT. AND ALL THIS COMES AS WE SURVEY THE WRECKAGE OF THE BRUISING PUBLIC BATTLE BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND ELON MUSK, WHO DONALD TRUMP JUST CALLED CRAZY. DONALD TRUMP ALL BUT CALLED ELON MUSK CRAZY AGAIN, REFERRING TO HIM IN A PHONE CALL WITH ABC NEWS AS QUOTE, THE MAN WHO'S LOST HIS MIND. HE TOLD FOX NEWS, QUOTE, ELON'S TOTALLY LOST IT. HE TOLD CNN HE'S GOT A PROBLEM. THE POOR GUY'S GOT A PROBLEM. SO TO RECAP, THIS PERSON WHO IN TRUMP'S ASSESSMENT HAS LOST HIS MIND AND HAS GOT A PROBLEM AND IS CRAZY IS THE VERY PERSON DONALD TRUMP UNLEASHED WITH A PROVERBIAL CHAINSAW ON THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET ON AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, ON HURRICANE AND NATIONAL DISASTER RESPONSE, ON NATIONAL PARKS, ON THE GOVERNMENT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. FOR HIS PART, ELON MUSK WAS RELATIVELY QUIET ABOUT HIS FIGHT WITH TRUMP TODAY, TWEETING INSTEAD ABOUT HIS BUSINESSES, WHICH WAS SUPPOSEDLY THE WHOLE REASON THAT HE WAS LEAVING HIS ROLE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. MUSK SAVED HIS ATTACKS TODAY FOR TRUMP'S ALLY STEVE BANNON, WHO IS URGING DONALD TRUMP TO DEPORT ELON MUSK, WHOM HE SAYS IS IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. A SENIOR WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL TELLS NBC NEWS THAT DONALD TRUMP IS NOW CONSIDERING SELLING OR GIVING AWAY THE TESLA THAT HE PURCHASED AND TOUTED IN A SPECTACLE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. TESLA STOCKS HAVE ALREADY LOST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SINCE ELON MUSK'S FORAY INTO GOVERNMENT. DONALD TRUMP COULD NOW WEAPONIZE GOVERNMENT POLICY AGAINST ELON MUSK AND HIS COMPANIES, WITH TRUMP THREATENING TO CUT ELON MUSK OFF FROM THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FROM WHICH MUSK HAS BENEFITED. HERE'S DONALD TRUMP ON AIR FORCE ONE TODAY WHEN ASKED ABOUT THOSE CONTRACTS. WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT EVERYTHING. HE'S GOT A LOT OF MONEY. A LOT OF SUBSIDY, SO WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. ONLY IF IT'S FAIR, ONLY IF IT'S FAIR FOR HIM AND FOR THE COUNTRY. I WOULD CERTAINLY THINK ABOUT BUT IT HAS TO BE. SO EVERYBODY'S PULLING BACK A LITTLE BIT. THIS IS THE COMPLETELY PREDICTABLE OUTCOME OF ALLOWING SOMEONE TO BUY AN ELECTION. BUT I GUESS DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WHEN ELON MUSK SPENT NEARLY $300 MILLION DURING THE 2024 ELECTION, SHOCKER. MUSK MIGHT WANT SOMETHING IN RETURN. WHAT DO THEY CALL THAT IN BUSINESS? RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT. THIS RIDICULOUS FIGHT ESCALATED BECAUSE ELON MUSK REPORTEDLY DID NOT GET WHAT HE WANTED IN THE REPUBLICAN BUDGET BILL, A BILL THAT HE'S CALLED A DISGUSTING ABOMINATION AND IS NOW DEMANDING THAT REPUBLICANS KILL. SO DEPENDING ON HOW ALL THIS PLAYS OUT, IT'S POSSIBLE THE MOST TRANSACTIONAL PERSON IN THE WORLD, DONALD TRUMP, JUST GOT OUT TRANSACTIONED BY ELON MUSK. IN A NEW PIECE TODAY TITLED THE REAL REASON FOR THE TRUMP MUSK FEUD IS UGLIER THAN YOU THINK, GREG SARGENT WRITES, QUOTE, THIS IS REALLY A BATTLE OVER HOW COMPREHENSIVELY TO SCREW OVER POOR AND WORKING PEOPLE, LARGELY TO THE BENEFIT OF THE WEALTHY. TRUMP IS ACTIVELY DECEIVING HIS BASE BY PRETENDING THOSE CUTS ONLY TARGET FRAUD. MUSK SIMILARLY WOULD USE THE WASTE FRAUD AND ABUSE CANARD TO ABSOLUTELY ANNIHILATE THE STATE IF HE COULD. FOR TRUMP AND MUSK ALIKE, THE US STATE PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR SEEMINGLY ENDLESS GRASPING AND TAKING. IT'S SOMETHING TO MANIPULATE FOR MEGALOMANIACAL ENDS. THEY ARE AT ODDS, BUT MAINLY BECAUSE THEY MERELY FALL AT DIFFERENT PLACES ON THE SAME SPECTRUM OF IMPULSES, AND THOSE IMPULSES ALL TILT TOWARD THE SAME PLACE, TOWARD MAKING OUR SOCIETY A LESS EGALITARIAN, MORE UNEQUAL, MEANER, CRUEL, CRUELER, AND MUCH MORE SAVAGE PLACE, END QUOTE. MEDICARE, MEDICARE, NOT MEDICAID, IS NOW POTENTIALLY ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK ALONG WITH MEDICAID AS SENATE REPUBLICANS LOOK TO FURTHER CUT THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET, ALL TO PAY FOR TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH. POLITICO IS REPORTING THE IDEA CAME UP IN CLOSED DOOR MEETINGS THIS WEEK AND CRUCIALLY, SOME REPUBLICANS BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP IS ON BOARD WITH TOUCHING THE PROGRAM AS LONG AS IT'S LIMITED TO WASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE. POLLING SHOWS THAT A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF MEDICAID CUTS. 72% ARE WORRIED THAT CUTS TO MEDICAID WILL LEAD TO MORE ADULTS AND CHILDREN BECOMING UNINSURED. 78% OF LOW INCOME ADULTS LIVING IN RURAL AREAS SAY THEY'RE WORRIED THE CUTS WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON. HOSPITALS, NURSING NURSING HOMES, AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. 73% OF LOW INCOME ADULTS, INCLUDING 53% OF REPUBLICANS, WORRY THAT MEDICAID CUTS WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THEIR OR THEIR FAMILY'S ABILITY TO GET AND PAY FOR HEALTH CARE. BUT VULNERABLE REPUBLICAN SENATORS WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL WITHOUT FACING FIERCE BLOWBACK FROM VOTERS. WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THIS IN TOWN HALL AFTER TOWN HALL, SO YOU COULD SAY AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THE TRUMP MUSK WAR IS HIGHLIGHTING THE CRAP THAT'S IN THIS BILL, A BILL THAT HAS SOME HOUSE REPUBLICANS ALREADY REGRETTING SUPPORTING. NBC NEWS REPORTS TODAY THAT 13 HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED FOR THE BILL, WHICH ONLY PASSED, BY THE WAY, BY 1 VOTE, SENT A LETTER FRIDAY URGING SENATE GOP LEADERS TO SCALE BACK SOME OF THE CLEAN ENERGY CUTS. THE UNUSUAL CRITICISM OF THEIR OWN BILL INDICATES A MODICUM OF REGRET BY THE GOP LAWMAKERS, END QUOTE. AND THERE'S A PUSH TO MESSAGE AGAINST THE BILL WHILE IT'S BEING NEGOTIATED IN THE SENATE. AXIOS REPORTS THE TWO NONPARTISAN GROUPS ARE LAUNCHING A $5 MILLION ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN URGING VULNERABLE REPUBLICAN SENATORS TO OPPOSE THE GOP'S MEGA BUDGET RECONCILIATION BILL. DEMOCRATS ARE MOBILIZING AGAINST THE BILL THAT ELON MUSK CALLED A DISGUSTING ABOMINATION TO ENSURE THAT IF REPUBLICANS VOTE TO GIVE MORE TAX CUTS TO RICH PEOPLE, CUTTING MEDICAID AND MEDICARE, AND THROWING MILLIONS OFF HEALTH INSURANCE. AND THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO WEAR THAT VOTE AS A BADGE OF DISHONOR IN THE NEXT ELECTION. JOINING ME NOW, REBECCA COOK, DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE IN WISCONSIN'S 3RD DISTRICT. UH, REBECCA, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. I, I THINK IT'S AMAZING. WE'RE WATCHING THIS, THIS BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND ELON MUSK, AND IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHO WINS. THE REST OF US LOSE. AMERICAN PEOPLE LOSE. ELON MUSK, I DON'T REALLY THINK HE CARES THAT MUCH ABOUT, UH, CUTTING GOVERNMENT. ELON MUSK CARES THAT THIS BILL IS CUTTING MONEY THAT ELON MUSK WAS GOING TO GET IN TESLA AND IN, IN SPACEX. NO, ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THIS IS A BATTLE BETWEEN THE ULTRA RICH, AND ELON MUSK IS ALWAYS BEEN SELF-INTERESTED, AND I'VE SEEN SOME DEMOCRATS WHO ARE WORKING TO SORT OF ALIGN WITH MUSK NOW, UM, BUT WE HAVE TO REMIND OURSELVES THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, UM, ISN'T JUST LIKE A PARTISAN WAR, IT'S A CLASS WAR, UM, ABOUT THE ULTRA WEALTHY AND WORKING CLASS PEOPLE, AND THAT'S THE KIND OF BACKGROUND THAT I COME FROM. UM, AND IT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING TO SEE HOW THEY'RE PLAYING POLITICS WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES, UM, AND THE WAY THAT THAT'S GOING TO IMPACT WORKING FAMILIES ACROSS A DISTRICT LIKE MINE, UM, HERE IN WISCONSIN 3. YEAH, I MEAN, TAKE A LOOK AT THESE, THESE CUTS, RIGHT? THE, THE ISSUE THAT SOME REPUBLICANS HAVE WITH THIS, IT HASN'T GONE FAR ENOUGH BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO INCREASE THE DEFICIT BECAUSE OF TAX CUTS. THAT SOME MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE WILL GET, BUT MOSTLY THE OVERWHELMING BENEFIT OF THESE TAX CUTS WILL GO TO THE WEALTHY. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CUTTING SNAP FOR. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CUTTING MEDICAID FOR. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE NOW THINKING ABOUT CUTTING MEDICARE FOR, TO PAY FOR ALMOST $5 TRILLION IN TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY. ABSOLUTELY, AND WELL, THAT'S, THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE. UM, THIS ADMINISTRATION IS BEING RUN BY OLIGARCHS, PEOPLE LIKE DONALD TRUMP AND ELON MUSK, THEY HAVEN'T HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PAYING THEIR RENT OR PAYING THEIR GROCERIES, AND REGULAR PEOPLE, WHEN THEY GO OVER THEIR BUDGET, THEY GET OVERDRAFT FEES. UM, THIS ADMINISTRATION SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE, UM, YOU KNOW, NOT BEHOLDEN TO ANYONE, ESPECIALLY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE JUST DOING WHAT THEY WANT. UM, AND WHILE THEY'RE DOING THAT, THEY'RE, THEY'RE SCREWING EVERYDAY AMERICANS AND UH MY OPPONENT, DEREK VAN ORDEN, UH, VOTED FOR THIS BILL, VOTED TO CUT MEDICAID, VOTED TO CUT SNAP BENEFITS THAT EVEN HE RELIED ON, UM, AND IT'S GOING TO HAVE SERIOUS. IMPLICATIONS AND I THINK TO YOUR POINT, UM, WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW, UH, THE PERSPECTIVE CUTS TO MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY, THESE ARE EARNED BENEFITS, THESE ARE EARNED BENEFITS BY WORKING AMERICANS, UM, AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT LIKE SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO IS THAT THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE WORKED FOR YEARS OF THEIR LIVES, RIGHT, EXACTLY, UM. AND SO, YOU KNOW, I, I PERSONALLY, I WANT TO EXPAND MEDICARE TO COVER VISION, DENTAL, AND HEARING, THE THINGS THAT DETERIORATE AS FOLKS AGE. I WANT TO SCRAP THE CAP WITH SOCIAL SECURITY. UM, BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION IS, IS WORKING TO SEEK CALM, UM, IN, UH, OUR PARENTS AND OUR GRANDPARENTS WHO JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO AGE WITH DIGNITY. BY THE WAY, YOU COME FROM AN AREA THAT THAT IN WHICH YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO WORK IN AGRICULTURE, UM, CUTTING SNAP HURTS FARMERS. IT'S, IT'S, IT'S, IT'S, IT'S FOOD. CUTTING SNAP HURTS FARMERS AND, YOU KNOW, GOING BACK TO ELON MUSK AND THE THINGS THAT HE'S DONE IN HIS TIME AS THIS BREAKUP CONTINUES, HE CUT USAID UM AND IT ALSO HURTS AMERICAN FARMERS, UM, AND SO YOU KNOW. IT'S, IT'S VERY SHORTSIGHTED, UM, AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, FARMERS AREN'T PLANNING, UM, A COUPLE OF DAYS IN ADVANCE OR A WEEK IN ADVANCE. THEY'RE PLANNING THEIR CROP SEASONS MONTHS IN ADVANCE. AND SO THE WAY THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE HARMING FOLKS, I WAS JUST, JUNE IS DAIRY MONTH IN WISCONSIN. SO I'M ACTUALLY A DAIRY BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING AND I WAS AT WEST SALEM DAIRY DAYS LAST WEEKEND. AND I WAS TALKING TO A WOMAN WHO TOLD ME THEY JUST SOLD THEIR COWS UM LAST YEAR, AND THAT THEY WERE FOCUSING MORE ON CROP PRODUCTION. BUT THAT SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE A LOSS ON HER BEANS BECAUSE OF WHAT THIS NEW ADMINISTRATION WAS DOING BETWEEN TARIFFS AND CUTS TO USAID. UM, SO STORIES LIKE THIS WOMAN SUSAN FROM WEST SALEM, UM, ARE STORIES THAT I'M HEARING ALL THE TIME ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, AND I THINK THAT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IN 2026 ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO ANSWER TO WHAT THE ULTRA WEALTHY HAS DONE TO WORKING FAMILIES IN A DISTRICT LIKE MINE. REBECCA, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS EVENING. REBECCA COOK IS A CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE IN WISCONSIN'S 3RD DISTRICT. I WANT TO STAY IN WISCONSIN BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE ALL THESE STORIES COME TOGETHER FOR US. JOINING ME NOW IS BEN WICKLER, WISCONSIN DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHAIR. BEN, AGAIN, THIS IS, I DON'T CARE WHETHER DONALD TRUMP AND ELON MUSK LIKE EACH OTHER. LIKE I JUST COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT IT, BUT IT IS REMARKABLE THAT MUSK HAS THIS IDEA THAT HE THINKS THIS BILL, HE'S HE'S WORRIED ABOUT THE DEFICIT. NOT REALLY SURE THAT ELON MUSK'S WORRIED ABOUT THE DEFICIT. I'M WORRIED, I THINK ELON MUSK IS WORRIED ABOUT ELON MUSK AND DONALD TRUMP'S WORRIED ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. AND ELON MUSK HAD THIS FANTASY THAT HE COULD SLASH $1 TRILLION.02 TRILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HE CAME IN, HE'S CAUSED THE DEATH OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD. HE'S UH CURSED PRETTY MUCH EVERY AMERICAN WHO COULD HAVE BENEFITED FROM CANCER RESEARCH, ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH, THAT THIS RESEARCH THAT IS NOW BEING GUTTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF HIS DOGE CHAINSAW, AND NOW HE'S BEEN PUSHED OUT BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP WATCHED HIM GO UP IN FLAMES IN THE WISCONSIN SUPREME COURT ELECTION. AND NOW THEY'RE BATTLING OVER JUST HOW MUCH THEY SHOULD GUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S PROTECTIONS FOR REGULAR FOLKS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, HEALTHCARE THAT PEOPLE RELY ON, EARNED BENEFIT PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO FUND A MASSIVE TAX CUT FOR THE ULTRA WEALTHY. THEIR FIGHT IS KIND OF A SMOKESCREEN FOR THE REAL BATTLE THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW, WHICH IS REPUBLICANS AND THEIR MEGA BILLIONAIRE FAR-RIGHT ALLIES AGAINST THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND THAT BATTLE WILL ULTIMATELY BE DECIDED BY HOW MUCH THE PUBLIC RAISES ITS VOICE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS TO PRESSURE REPUBLICAN SENATORS TO BACK OFF THIS MONSTROSITY. AND IT'S, THERE ARE SOME REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO ARE BACKING OFF. RON JOHNSON IS, BUT NOT FOR THE RIGHT REASONS, ALTHOUGH THERE IS ONE THING THAT RON JOHNSON POINTS OUT, AND THAT MIKE, MIKE JOHNSON AND OTHERS HAVE SAID WE, THIS, THIS WON'T INCREASE THE DEFICIT BECAUSE IT'LL CREATE SUCH GROWTH THAT WILL, WILL UNDO THE DEFICIT. RON JOHNSON POINTS OUT THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL THAT SUGGESTS THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN. SO ONE THING WE CAN AGREE WITH HIM ON, IT'S NOT REALLY A GROWTH-ORIENTED BILL. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. SO THAT'S A, A BROKEN CLOCK THAT'S RIGHT TWICE A DAY. UM, RON JOHNSON IS CORRECT. THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF THESE PROMISES THAT TAX CUTS FOR THE ULTRA WEALTHY WILL PAY FOR THEMSELVES, AND THEY NEVER DO. WE STILL, STILL THINK ABOUT TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS, ALSO STILL WAITING FOR IT TO TRICKLE DOWN. YEAH, THEY, THEY PUT A TARP UNDERNEATH THE TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH, AND THEY JUST TRICKLE ON TO THE TARP AND THE, YOU KNOW, THE FOLKS ON TOP OF THE TARP ROLL AROUND IN THEM. FOR EVERYBODY ELSE, THIS IS JUST A, A CASH GRAB. IT IS, IT IS KICKING MORE THAN 10 MILLION PEOPLE OFF THEIR MEDICAID, INCLUDING PEOPLE IN MY STATE OF WISCONSIN, RON JOHNSON'S OWN CONSTITUENTS. RON JOHNSON WANTS TO CUT MEDICAID EVEN MORE. IT'S AN EVEN WORSE IDEA. BUT UH 11 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS LOOKED AT ALL THE CUTS TO PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT POOR AND WORKING CLASS PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND UH COMPARED THOSE TO THE TAX CUTS FOR THE ULTRA WEALTHY, AND THEY ALMOST PERFECTLY EVEN THEMSELVES OUT. YOU COULD END ALL THOSE CUTS BY SIMPLY DO PEOPLE GET TAXES BECAUSE THAT'S, THAT'S THE KEY THING, RIGHT? EVERYBODY SITS HERE AND IS WONDERING HOW IT'S A STRUGGLE, HOW MUCH YOU CAN CUT OUT OF MEDICAID AND SNAP AND NOW MEDICARE, OR YOU COULD JUST NOT GIVE ALMOST $5 TRILLION IN TAX CUTS LARGELY TO THE WEALTHY. I MEAN, IT'S, IT'S A LOT EASIER THAN FINDING LITTLE THINGS TO CUT IN MEDICAID AND MEDICARE. YEAH, IT'S, IT'S VERY SIMPLE. IF YOU WANT TO NOT DO ONE BAD THING, WHICH IS TO, UH, COST TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN LIVES EVERY SINGLE YEAR BY RIPPING PEOPLE OFF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS NOT HAND GIANT PILES OF MONEY TO THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. AND FRANKLY, THE AMERICAN PUBLIC DOESN'T LIKE TAX CUTS FOR THE ULTRA WEALTHY OR CUTS TO THE HEALTHCARE THAT PEOPLE RELY ON. SO YES, IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE POPULAR IF YOU DID NEITHER OF THOSE TWO THINGS. BUT WHAT THIS REVEALS IS WHAT THE CON HAS BEEN THIS ENTIRE TIME. DONALD TRUMP DID NOT RUN A CAMPAIGN. IN FACT, HE RAN A CAMPAIGN PROMISING NOT TO CUT MEDICAID. HE DIDN'T RUN A CAMPAIGN TALKING ABOUT HOW HE WOULD UH ENRICH THE ULTRA WEALTHY. UH, THIS WAS A CONSTANT GAME OF DISTRACTION AND ATTACK AGAINST, UH, YOU KNOW, A DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN. THAT WAS VERY CLEARLY ON THE SIDE OF WORKING PEOPLE. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION DID NOT WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR GOAL, THAT THIS IS THEIR FIRST BIG BILL, THEIR NUMBER ONE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY, JUST LIKE LAST TIME. IT IS ATTEMPTS TO RIP AWAY HEALTH CARE FROM PEOPLE THAT NEED IT IN ORDER TO ENRICH PEOPLE THAT HAVE EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD. THAT'S THEIR ONE GOAL. THAT IS WHAT THE ELON MUSKS OF THE WORLD POUR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO THEIR CAMPAIGN TO GET THEM TO DO. AND ONLY THE PUBLIC AT THIS POINT STANDS IN THEIR WAY. YEAH, IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER A BUDGET IS THE IS THE WILL, THE EXPRESSION OF THE WILL OF A PARTICULAR ADMINISTRATION, AND THAT'S WHAT THE WILL APPEARS TO BE. BEN, GOOD TO SEE YOU AS ALWAYS. BEN WHICKLER IS THE WISCONSIN DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHAIR. COMING UP, THE LATEST ON TONIGHT'S BREAKING NEWS, WHICH IS THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS OBEYED THE SUPREME COURT'S ORDER AND RETURNED KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA TO THE UNITED STATES. THAT'S NEXT. BREAKING NEWS TONIGHT. 57 DAYS AFTER THE SUPREME COURT UNANIMOUSLY ORDERED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO FACILITATE THE RETURN OF KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA AFTER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SENT HIM TO EL SALVADOR IN PRISON BY MISTAKE. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS RETURNED KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA TO THE UNITED STATES. WE'RE HERE TODAY TO ANNOUNCE A MAJOR UPDATE IN AN IMPORTANT CASE. ABREGO GARCIA HAS LANDED IN THE UNITED STATES TO FACE JUSTICE. ON MAY 21, A GRAND JURY IN THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE RETURNED A SEALED INDICTMENT, CHARGING ABREGO GARCIA WITH ALIEN SMUGGLING AND CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT ALIEN SMUGGLING IN VIOLATION OF TITLE 8 USC 1324. WE WANT TO THANK PRESIDENT BUKELE FOR AGREEING TO RETURN ABREGO GARCIA TO THE UNITED STATES. NOW HEAR WHAT YOU SAID THERE. MAY 21. MAY 21ST WAS THE DAY THAT KILMAR ABRAGO GARCIA WAS CHARGED WITH A CRIME IN THE UNITED STATES, EVEN THOUGH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SENT HIM TO A NOTORIOUS MEGAPRISON IN EL SALVADOR ON MARCH 15TH. NBC NEWS DETAILS THE NEW CHARGES. ABREGO GARCIA HAS BEEN NAMED IN AN INDICTMENT CHARGING HIM WITH TRANSPORTING WITHIN THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE NOT LEGALLY IN THE COUNTRY. THE TWO COUNT INDICTMENT SEALED BY A TENNESSEE COURT LAST MONTH ARGUES THAT ABREGO GARCIA PARTICIPATED IN A CONSPIRACY OVER SEVERAL YEARS TO MOVE PEOPLE FROM TEXAS DEEPER INTO THE COUNTRY. NBC NEWS HAS LEARNED THE INDICTMENT. ALLEGES THAT FROM ABOUT 2016 TO 2025 ALBREGO GARCIA AND OTHERS CONSPIRED TO BRING MIGRANTS ILLEGALLY TO THE UNITED STATES FROM GUATEMALA, EL SALVADOR, HONDURAS, ECUADOR, AND ELSEWHERE THROUGH MEXICO AND ACROSS THE TEXAS-MEXICO BORDER. ABREGO GARCIA HAD HIS INITIAL APPEARANCE APPEARANCE AT A NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE FEDERAL COURTHOUSE THIS EVENING, AND ARRAIGNMENT AND THE DETENTION HEARING HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR NEXT FRIDAY. HE'LL REMAIN IN CUSTODY UNTIL THEN. SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN, THE ONLY PERSON IN AMERICA WHO HAD MET WITH KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA SINCE HE WAS SENT TO PRISON UNTIL TODAY, POSTED THIS. AFTER MONTHS OF IGNORING OUR CONSTITUTION, IT SEEMS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS RELENTED TO OUR DEMAND FOR COMPLIANCE WITH COURT ORDERS AND DUE PROCESS FOR KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA. THIS HAS NEVER BEEN ABOUT THE MAN. IT'S ABOUT HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND THE RIGHTS OF ALL. EARLIER TONIGHT ON AIR FORCE ONE, DONALD TRUMP DODGED QUESTIONS ON WHETHER HE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE RETURN OF KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA. DID YOU SPEAK WITH DIRECTLY TO FACILITATE THE RETURN OF ABREGO GARCIA? I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT. I DON'T WANNA SAY ANYTHING, BUT HE'S RETURNED. THAT WAS A YES OR NO QUESTION. I DON'T WANNA SAY THAT. IT'S NOT AN ANSWER TO A YES OR NO QUESTION. HE RETURNED. HE SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAD TO BE RETURNED. YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH HIM. YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THEY FOUND IN THE JURY AND BRING HIM BACK TO THE UNITED STATES I DON'T WANT TO. AGAIN, IT WAS A YES OR NO QUESTION. WAS IT YOUR CALL AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO BRING UP BREGO GARCIA BACK TO THE UNITED STATES? LET'S REMEMBER WHAT TRUMP'S STATED POSITION ON OBEYING THE SUPREME COURT ORDER WAS. HERE'S TRUMP IN AN INTERVIEW WITH TIME MAGAZINE ON APRIL 21. 1ST, 25TH, TIMES SAYS. THE SUPREME COURT RULED 9-0 THAT YOU HAVE TO BRING KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA BACK. YOU HAVEN'T DONE SO. AREN'T YOU DISOBEYING THE SUPREME COURT? TRUMP SAYS, WELL, THAT'S NOT WHY MY WHAT MY PEOPLE TOLD ME. THEY DIDN'T SAY IT WAS. THEY, THEY SAID IT WAS THE 9 TO NOTHING WAS SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT. TIME ASKS, HAVE YOU ASKED PRESIDENT BUKELE TO RETURN HIM? TRUMP SAYS, I HAVEN'T. UH, HE SAID HE WOULDN'T. TIME SAID, DID YOU ASK HIM? TRUMP SAYS, BUT I HAVEN'T ASKED HIM POSITIVELY, BUT HE SAID HE WOULDN'T. CRYSTAL CLEAR. JOINING US NOW, BARBARA MCQUAID, FORMER US ATTORNEY AND A LAW PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAW SCHOOL. SHE'S AN MSNBC LEGAL ANALYST. UM, THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN THIS STORY. UH, AND BARBARA, BUT, BUT I, THE ONE THING I WANT TO GET TO IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S BROUGHT HIM BACK AND THEY HAVE, UH, THEY'VE, THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME CHARGES AGAINST HIM, AND THERE MAY BE MORE COMING, WHO KNOWS. THE ISSUE WAS ALWAYS ABOUT DUE PROCESS. THE ISSUE, NOBODY KNEW ALBREGO GARCIA. HE, HE MIGHT BE GUILTY OF THINGS HE MAY NOT BE. THAT'S FOR A COURT TO DETERMINE OR A, A, A PROCEDURE TO DETERMINE WHETHER HE GETS TO STAY HERE. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, ELLIE. I MEAN, THE FIFTH AMENDMENT TO OUR CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES THE RIGHT OF DUE PROCESS BEFORE ANYONE CAN BE DEPRIVED OF LIFE, LIBERTY, OR PROPERTY. CERTAINLY SOMEBODY WHO IS WHISKED OFF INTO A FOREIGN COUNTRY, INTO A JAIL IS BEING DENIED A LIBERTY INTEREST, AND THERE'S NO DISTINCTION WHETHER YOU ARE A US CITIZEN OR A NON-CITIZEN, IF YOU ARE PHYSICALLY IN THE TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES. YOU ARE ENTITLED TO CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS, INCLUDING THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE THAT HAS BEEN HELD BY PRIOR COURTS AND THE SUPREME COURT AS RECENTLY AS THIS YEAR IN RELATION TO THIS CASE, SAYING THAT HE GETS DUE PROCESS, THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS, IMMIGRANTS, ARE ENTITLED TO DUE PROCESS. SO THAT IS WHAT THE STINK HAS ALL BEEN ABOUT UNTIL TODAY. SO THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS A PROSECUTOR YOU HAVE GOT TO STAND. UP FOR THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WHO YOU THINK ARE GUILTY, WHO YOU ARE PREPARED TO GO TO COURT AND PROVE ARE GUILTY. THE PROCESS THEIR DUE PROCESS STILL HAS TO EXIST. SO THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE SAYING, WELL, DON'T YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GOT EGG ON YOUR FACE FOR FOR DEFENDING ABREGO GARCIA NOW THAT THERE ARE ALL THESE CHARGES AGAINST HIM. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ALLEGATIONS ARE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EVIDENCE IS, DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE'S GUILTY OR INNOCENT OF ANYTHING PAM BONDI SAYS HE'S GUILTY OR INNOCENT OF. NONE OF THIS EXCUSES THE GOVERNMENT'S BEHAVIOR. NO, IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT ITS FAILURE TO RETURN ABREGO GARCIA TO THE UNITED STATES AFTER HE WAS ACCIDENTALLY ERRONEOUSLY ERRONEOUSLY DEPORTED. THE WHOLE REASON, ALI, WE HAVE DUE PROCESS IS TO PREVENT MISTAKES FROM BEING MADE. I MEAN, WHAT DUE PROCESS MEANS IS FAIR NOTICE, AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A HEARING, AND A NEUTRAL ARBITER. THAT'S JUST SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE A CHANCE TO CONTEST SOME GOVERNMENT ACTION BECAUSE THERE MAY BE A MISTAKE, AND AS EVERYONE CONCEDED INITIALLY, THE INCLUSION OF MR. ABREGO GARCIA ON THIS PLANE LOAD THAT WENT DOWN TO EL SALVADOR INITIALLY WAS A MISTAKE. AND THEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, FOR WHATEVER REASON, REFUSED TO BRING HIM BACK. WHEN IT WAS CLEAR, I MEAN, EVEN TONIGHT NOW THAT MR. OREDO GARCIA HAS BEEN BROUGHT BACK, PRESIDENT BUCHELE OF EL SALVADOR HAS SAID, WELL, YEAH, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ASKED ME TO SEND HIM BACK, SO HE DID. YEAH, AND DONALD TRUMP, FOR WHATEVER REASON IS NOT TAKING CREDIT FOR THIS. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE IDEA THAT HE WAS SENT AWAY IN MARCH? THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT WAS A MISTAKE. THEY DIDN'T LISTEN TO THE SUPREME COURT OR ANYBODY, ANY COURT'S INSTRUCTIONS TO BRING HIM BACK. MAY 21 IS WHEN THE, THE INDICTMENT CAME DOWN, IT WAS UNSEALED. ONE WONDERS WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT WAS PUTTING A SQUARE PEG INTO A ROUND HOLE HERE, THAT THEY HAD DONE SOMETHING AND NOW THEY NEEDED TO FIND SOMETHING TO TO CHARGE THIS GUY WITH. YEAH, NOW THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE SERIOUS. IF THEY'RE TRUE, THEY ARE A SERIOUS THING. THEY ALLEGE THAT HE TRANSPORTED AND HARBORED MORE THAN 100 UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE IN EXCHANGE FOR MONEY FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER INTO THE UNITED STATES. THOSE ARE SERIOUS CHARGES, AND A GRAND JURY HAS MADE THAT FINDING. SO, UM, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN MAKE UP OUT OF WHOLE CLOTH, AND WE'LL SEE WHETHER THEY'VE GOT THE PROOF. IT'LL GO TO TRIAL. NOW I, WE WILL GET DUE PROCESS. THERE WILL BE A TRIAL. THERE WILL BE RIGHT TO COUNSEL. CROSS-EXAMINATION OF WITNESSES AND OTHER THINGS, BUT YOU KNOW, IT USED TO BE, ELLIE, THE GOVERNMENT WAS ENTITLED TO THIS PRESUMPTION OF REGULARITY, AND I HAVE TO THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS KIND OF LOST THAT PRESUMPTION OF REGULARITY BASED ON ITS CONDUCT, NOT ONLY IN THIS CASE BUT IN OTHER CASES INVOLVING IMMIGRATION. SO YOU KNOW, IS IT JUST SOME BIG COINCIDENCE THAT HE GETS CHARGED IN MAY WITH THIS CRIME, OR DID THEY START DIGGING FOR THIS CRIME AFTER THEY HAD EGG ON THEIR FACE? AND FOUND HIM TO BE IN THIS SALVADORAN PRISON. BASED ON THE LANGUAGE IN THE INDICTMENT, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE CHARGED ONLY MR. ABREGO GARCIA, EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE 6 UNINDICTED CO-CONSPIRATORS. WHO ARE THEY? DO THEY CARE ABOUT THEM? WHY AREN'T THEY CHARGING THESE OTHER PEOPLE? IT SEEMS LIKE THE WHOLE CASE FOCUSES ON MR. ABREDO GARCIA WHEN HE'S NOT REALLY EVEN THE RINGLEADER. IT ALSO RELIES, IT APPEARS, ON TESTIMONY FROM ONE OF THESE CO-CONSPIRATORS. AND SO IT MAY BE THEY HAVE OTHER EVIDENCE, BUT IT COMES DOWN TO MOSTLY THE ONE SUBSTANTIVE COUNT THEY HAVE IS THIS TRAFFIC STOP FROM NOVEMBER OF 2022, WHERE THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR, BUT EVEN THEN THE POLICE LET HIM GO, DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT. THEY CHECKED HIS LICENSE AND SENT HIM ON HIS WAY. SO IT FEELS LIKE PERHAPS THIS WAS AN EFFORT TO KIND OF RECONSTRUCT AFTER THE FACT AND PIN SOME CHARGES ON HIM THAT WEREN'T ALREADY EXISTING. BUT AS I SAID, A GRAND JURY HAS FOUND PROBABLE. CAUSE I THINK A GRAND JURY IS AT LEAST ENTITLED TO SOME PRESUMPTION OF REGULARITY. AND SO WE'LL SEE HOW THIS CASE SHAKES OUT WHEN IT GETS TO THE COURTS. THIS IS A FINDING OF PROBABLE CAUSE, NOT GUILTY BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. BARBARA, THANKS AS ALWAYS FOR MAKING THINGS CLEAR FOR US. BARBARA MCQUAID IS A FORMER UNITED STATES ATTORNEY AND A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAW SCHOOL. ALL RIGHT, COMING UP YESTERDAY, DONALD TRUMP ALL BUT GAVE THE GO-AHEAD TO VLADIMIR PUTIN TO KEEP ATTACKING UKRAINE, AND THIS MORNING, VLADIMIR PUTIN ATTACKED UKRAINE. FORMER US AMBASSADOR MICHAEL MCFAUL JOINS US NEXT. TODAY VLADIMIR PUTIN LAUNCHED NEW ATTACKS ON UKRAINE'S CAPITAL, KILLING AT LEAST 4 PEOPLE. THE CITY'S MAYOR TOLD NBC NEWS BOTH A DRONE STRIKE AND A MISSILE STRIKE HIT KIEV EARLY TODAY. 20 PEOPLE WERE INJURED. IT WAS PART OF A WIDER OVERNIGHT ASSAULT AND THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF LARGE SCALE ATTACKS TARGETING REGIONS ACROSS UKRAINE. THIS COMES TWO DAYS AFTER DONALD TRUMP'S LATEST PHONE CALL WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN AND HOURS AFTER TRUMP SAID HE LIKENED THE TWO SIDES IN THE WAR TO FIGHTING CHILDREN DURING THAT CALL WITH PUTIN. FOR GOOD MEASURE, HE ALSO BLAMED THE UKRAINE AGAIN FOR THE WAR. SOMETIMES YOU SEE TWO YOUNG CHILDREN FIGHTING LIKE CRAZY. THEY HATE EACH OTHER AND THEY'RE FIGHTING IN A PARK. AND YOU TRY AND PULL THEM APART. THEY DON'T WANT TO BE PULLED. SOMETIMES YOU'RE BETTER OFF LETTING THEM FIGHT FOR A WHILE. AND THEN PULLING THEM APART AND I GAVE THAT ANALOGY TO PUTIN YESTERDAY AND YOU SEE IT IN HOCKEY, YOU SEE IT IN SPORTS. THE REFEREES LET HIM GO FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS, LET HIM GO FOR A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE YOU PULL THEM APART. IT WILL BE VERY, VERY, VERY TOUGH, AND IT COULD BE ON BOTH COUNTRIES, TO BE HONEST, YOU KNOW, IT TAKES TWO TO TANGO. SO HOW TOUGH IS VERY, VERY TOUGH? TODAY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTS, QUOTE, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO GET SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM, REPUBLICAN OF SOUTH CAROLINA, TO SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKEN HIS RUSSIA SANCTIONS BILL WHILE THE WHITE HOUSE SEEKS TO PATCH UP ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH MOSCOW INSTEAD OF PUNISHING IT FOR THE CONTINUED INVASION OF UKRAINE. OVER THE PAST WEEKS, WHITE HOUSE AND OTHER ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS HAVE QUIETLY CONTACTED GRAHAM'S OFFICE. URGING HIM TO WATER DOWN HIS BILL, NAMELY BY INSERTING WAIVERS THAT WOULD ALLOW TRUMP TO CHOOSE WHO OR WHAT GETS SANCTIONED, CONGRESSIONAL AIDES SAID. ANOTHER WAY TO WEAKEN THE LEGISLATION WOULD BE TO TURN THE WORD SHALL INTO MAY WHEREVER IT APPEARS IN THE BILL'S TEXT, REMOVING THE MANDATORY NATURE OF THE PRESCRIBED REPRIMANDS, CONGRESSIONAL AIDES SAID, END QUOTE. IT'S A HELL OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WE SHALL BE VERY, VERY TOUGH AND WE MAY BE VERY, VERY TOUGH. TONIGHT ON AIR FORCE ONE, DONALD TRUMP AGAIN BLAMED UKRAINE THIS TIME FOR THE DEADLY ATTACKS PUTIN LAUNCHED TODAY. HE WAS ALSO ASKED ABOUT THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORT, AND I LEAVE TO YOU TO TRY TO MAKE ANY SENSE OUT OF HOW HE ANSWERED THAT QUESTION. WELL, THEY GAVE A REASON TO GO IN AND BOMB THE HELL OUT OF HIM. I SAID, HERE WE GO, NOW IT'S GOING TO BE I I THINK I THINK RUSSIA WILL NOT BE MAKING. DEAL OR STOPPING THE BLOODSHED IF IT'S REALLY GIVE ME THAT OPTION. I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO THEM ABOUT IT. THEY HAVE A BILL THAT'S GOING TO BE UP TO ME. IT'S MY OPTION. THEY MADE IT THAT WAY AND IT WOULD SAVE A LOT OF TIME IF THAT HAPPENED, SO I'M OK WITH IT. I HAVEN'T DECIDED TO USE IT. IT'S A VERY STRONG BILL. JOINING US NOW, MICHAEL MCFAUL, FORMER US AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA AND AN MSNBC INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS ANALYST, A MAN WHO STUDIED HISTORY, READS HISTORY. IF YOU WANT TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, AH, MICHAEL, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY OF RUSSIA AND UKRAINE AND WHAT THIS FIGHT'S ABOUT, AND DONALD TRUMP CANNOT SEEM TO ARTICULATE WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON THERE IN ANY WAY THAT WOULD SUGGEST HE COULD END THIS, THIS, THIS FIGHT. TRAGICALLY, I AGREE. UH, I FOUND HIS ANALOGIES RECENTLY TO BE JUST COMPLETELY OUTRAGEOUS. THIS IS NOT TWO KIDS FIGHTING ON THE STREET AND YOU JUST GOT TO LET THEM FIGHT TILL THEY GET TIRED. THE ANALOGY, IF WE HAVE TO USE THESE CRAZY SIMPLISTIC ANALOGIES, IS THAT SOME GIANT KID WALKED INTO THE HOUSE OF A VERY SMALL CHILD WITH ALL KINDS OF WEAPONS AND STARTED TO BEAT THAT CHILD UP RELENTLESSLY AND SAYING, I'M NOW GONNA OCCUPY YOUR HOUSE AS WELL. THIS THIS FALSE EQUIVALENCY THAT BOTH SIDES, IT TAKES TWO TO TANGO IS COMPLETELY INACCURATE. ONE COUNTRY INVADED THE OTHER FOR NO REASON. THERE WAS NO PRETENSE FOR THAT. THERE WAS NO THREAT FROM UKRAINE TO RUSSIA. AND NOW IN THIS FIGHT, HE SAYS, WELL, OF COURSE THEY'VE GOT TO RESPOND. DID YOU NOTICE? YEAH, OF COURSE YOU DID, BUT I WANT EVERYBODY TO NOTICE YOU WERE SHOWING THE FOOTAGE OF WHAT THEY BOMBED. THEY DIDN'T ATTACK AIRPLANES. THEY DIDN'T ATTACK TANKS. THEY DIDN'T ATTACK MILITARY TARGETS. YOU JUST SHOWED VIDEO OF APARTMENT BUILDINGS OF CIVILIANS IN UKRAINE, AND THE FACT THAT OUR PRESIDENT. KEEPS SUGGESTING THAT THERE'S AN EQUIVALENCY BETWEEN THE TWO THINGS. IT'S JUST WRONG EMPIRICALLY AND IT'S WRONG MORALLY. THERE ALSO DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY MEANINGFUL MOVEMENT TOWARD ENDING THIS WAR THAT HE SAID HE WOULD END ON DAY ONE, WHICH WAS A SORT OF A RIDICULOUS PROMISE TO MAKE BECAUSE THIS IS COMPLICATED. GETTING IT TO STOP WILL BE COMPLICATED. THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE EITHER EXPERTISE OR PROGRESS. YOU SEE A LOT OF STUFF THAT DONALD TRUMP POSTS ON TRUTH SOCIAL. YOU SEE, YOU KNOW, WITKOFF AND OTHERS GOING OVER THERE AND COMING, COMING OUT EMPTY HANDED. HOW IS THIS GOING FROM A FROM A DIPLOMATIC PERSPECTIVE? RUSSIA SEEMS TO BE PLAYING THE US. SO INITIALLY WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAID HE'S GOING TO END THE WAR, I SAID THAT'S GREAT. WE ALL WANT THIS HORRIFIC BARBARIC WAR TO END. AND WHEN HE ENGAGED WITH THE RUSSIANS, THAT WAS CONTROVERSIAL WHEN SECRETARY RUBIO MET WITH FOREIGN MINISTER LAVROV IN SAUDI ARABIA, BUT I ALSO APPLAUDED THAT BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO MEDIATE, YOU'VE GOT TO TALK EVEN TO PEOPLE THAT YOU RADICALLY DISAGREE WITH. BUT THE STRATEGY HAS BEEN COMPLETELY FLAWED. THE STRATEGY HAS BEEN, AND MR. WITKOFF, IN PARTICULAR, GO TO MOSCOW, ASK PUTIN WHAT HE WANTS, UH, GIVE HIM ALL THE CONCESSIONS HE WANTS, AND THEN GO TO THE UKRAINIANS AND PUT PRESSURE ON THEM. AND IF IT WORKED, WE COULD APPLAUD IT AND WE COULD TALK ABOUT NOBEL PEACE PRIZES, ETC. BUT IT HASN'T WORKED. ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED IS PUTIN. ASKING FOR MORE. IN THEIR LATEST NEGOTIATIONS, HE NOW SAYS THE WHOLE WORLD HAS TO RECOGNIZE WHAT IS THAT WHAT HE HAS ANNEXED ON PAPER. SO HE'S ESCALATING HIS DEMANDS, AND THAT MEANS THAT IF THE PRESIDENT IS SERIOUS, HE HAS TO GO TO PLAN B, WHICH IS MILITARY SUPPORT FOR THE UKRAINIANS AND SUPPORTING THAT SANCTIONS BILL. PRESSURE ON RUSSIA. AND ONE MORE THING I WANT TO SAY, WHEN YOU SAY YOU'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING AND THEN YOU DON'T DO IT, THAT'S THE WORST OF ALL POSSIBLE OUTCOMES. THAT MAKES US, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, LOOK WEAK. IT MAKES US LOOK LIKE WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING, AND THAT HAS IMPLICATIONS NOT JUST FOR UKRAINE, BUT FOR TAIWAN, FOR EVERY ALLY AND PARTNER WE HAVE AROUND THE WORLD. AMBASSADOR, GOOD TO SEE YOU AS ALWAYS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANALYSIS. FORMER UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA MICHAEL MCFAUL. TOMORROW MORNING I WILL SPEAK WITH THE FORMER US AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE, BRIDGET BRINK, WHO SAID TRUMP'S POLICY ON RUSSIA, UKRAINE LEFT HER NO CHOICE BUT TO RESIGN. THAT'S 100 A.M. EASTERN ON VELSHI. ALL RIGHT, COMING UP, TRUMP'S TARIFF WAR IS BANANAS, AND NOW EVERYONE KNOWS IT, THANKS TO A VIRAL VIDEO OF ONE OF TRUMP'S ECON GUYS, HOWARD LUTNICK, BEING QUESTIONED IN A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING. I'LL SHOW YOU THAT NEXT. ENDGAME DEFINED AS THE FINAL STAGE OF A GAME SUCH AS CHESS WHEN JUST A FEW PIECES REMAIN AND A PLAYER IS CLOSE TO ACHIEVING THEIR OBJECTIVE. DOES DONALD TRUMP THINK HE'S WINNING THIS CHESS MATCH ON TARIFFS? IS HE CLOSE TO ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVE? THE ANSWER IS NO, BECAUSE 65 DAYS AFTER SO-CALLED LIBERATION DAY, MOST OF US HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TRUMP'S TRADE WAR OBJECTIVE IS, WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO. MAKE SOCKS AND BARBIES AND IPHONES IN AMERICAN FACTORIES WITH AMERICAN WORKERS OR HAVE THE CURRENT TRADE ARRANGEMENT WHERE MOST PRODUCTS ARE MADE OVERSEAS IN CHINA AND ELSEWHERE CHEAPLY AND ABUNDANTLY WITH SOME SLIGHT TWEAKS. IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER TRUMP HAS ANY IDEA, AND APPARENTLY NEITHER DOES COMMERCE SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK, AS EXPOSED IN THIS LINE OF QUESTIONING FROM PENNSYLVANIA CONGRESSWOMAN MADELINE DEAN ABOUT THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS ON AMERICA'S FAVORITE AND MOST PURCHASED FRUIT, BANANAS. WHAT'S THE TARIFF ON BANANAS? AMERICANS, BY THE WAY, LOVE BANANAS. WE BUY BILLIONS OF THEM A YEAR. I LOVE BANANAS. WHAT'S THE TARIFF ON BANANAS? THE TARIFF ON BANANAS WOULD BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COUNTRIES THAT PRODUCE THEM. AND WHAT'S THAT TARIFF? GENERALLY 10%, CORRECT, 10%. WALMART HAS ALREADY INCREASED THE COST OF BANANAS BY 8%. COUNTRIES DO DEALS WITH US THAT WILL GO TO ZERO. AS COUNTRIES DO DEALS WITH US, AMERICAN CONSUMER NOW. IF YOU BUILD IN AMERICA AND YOU PRODUCE YOUR PRODUCT IN AMERICA, THERE WILL BE NO TARIFF. WE CAN'T. WE CAN'T PRODUCE BANANAS IN AMERICA. WE CAN'T BUILD BANANAS IN AMERICA. THE POINT OF A TARIFF IS TO PUNISH FOREIGN PRODUCERS IN A MARKET THAT A COUNTRY IS TRYING TO GROW DOMESTICALLY. WE LITERALLY CAN'T GROW BANANAS IN MOST OF THIS COUNTRY. AMERICA PRODUCES A FEW MILLION POUNDS OF BANANAS EACH YEAR, BUT WE CONSUME MORE THAN 6 BILLION POUNDS OF BANANAS A YEAR. JOINING US NOW IS THE BANANA CONSUMING REPRESENTATIVE, UH, MADELEINE DEAN, DEMOCRAT OF PENNSYLVANIA. SHE IS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. UM, CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU FOR, FOR BEING HERE BECAUSE YOU, YOU ILLUSTRATED, IT COULD BE ABOUT BANANAS OR A MILLION OTHER THINGS THAT WE DON'T EITHER MAKE HERE OR IT'S DIFFICULT TO MAKE OR WE CAN'T MAKE ENOUGH TO TO TO SATISFY OUR MARKET, OR PERHAPS WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE HERE BECAUSE MAKING, GROWING, PRODUCING WOULD NOT, WOULD NOT PAY WHAT IT SHOULD. THERE ARE A LOT OF EXAMPLES OF THINGS THAT SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO A BLANKET TARIFF BECAUSE ALL IT'S GOING TO DO IS END UP COSTING YOU MORE TO BUY YOUR BANANAS. AND THAT IS WHY I BROUGHT UP THE EXAMPLE OF BANANAS. IT IS SOMETHING WE BUY EVERY SINGLE DAY, UH, AND UH YOU MIGHT SEE IN THE BACK I SEE THEM. IT'S MY BIRTHDAY. MY HUSBAND DECIDED THAT WAS MY GIFT TODAY, A BUNCH OF BANANAS. BUT THE POINT OF BRINGING IT UP WAS TO SAY THAT THE TARIFF POLICY OF THIS ADMINISTRATION IS JUST SET IN CHAOS AND ABSURDITY. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TRADE. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GROWING BUSINESS, WHICH IS LITERALLY WHAT THE COMMERCE SECRETARY SAID HIS JOB WAS. HIS MISSION IS TO GROW AND ENHANCE BUSINESSES IN AMERICA. OBVIOUSLY IT ALSO SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE COST OF GOODS FOR AMERICANS BECAUSE AFTER ALL, THAT'S WHAT MR. TRUMP RAN ON. UH, I BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE OF BANANAS BECAUSE THAT'S A SINGLE PRODUCT THAT IS SOLD OVER AND OVER AGAIN BY WALMART AND MY LOCAL GROCER, UH, AND THEY ARE ALREADY INCREASING THE PRICE OF BANANAS RIGHT NOW ON YOU AND ME BECAUSE THERE IS THIS RIDICULOUS. TARIFF 10%, AT LEAST 10%, UH, ON BANANAS, UH, AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING HE LITERALLY SAID WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE AND BUILD THESE HERE. AND I ULTIMATELY SAID WE DON'T BUILD BANANAS HERE. WE JUST DON'T. IT'S JUST THE ABSURDITY AND THE INCOHERENCE, UH, OF THE TARIFF POLICY. UH, AND, AND BANANAS SEEMS LIKE A VERY SMALL SIMPLE EXAMPLE. I'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE RIGHT IN MY DISTRICT. A MACHINE, UH, A MACHINIST COMPANY ORDERED THREE VERY EXPENSIVE LATHES, $80,000 LATHES COMING FROM CHINA. UNFORTUNATELY, THOSE LATHES HIT IN THE TWO WEEKS THAT CHINA HAD 125% TARIFF. HE PAID $340,000. IN TARIFFS, TAXES ON THOSE LATHS, AND HE'S ASKED ME, IS THERE ANY WAY HE CAN GET A REFUND BECAUSE NOW THE TARIFF IS DIFFERENT FOR CHINA. IT'S ON, IT'S OFF. BUSINESSES CANNOT PLAN, AND THAT'S WHAT I TRIED TO SAY TO MR. LUTNICK, SECRETARY LUTNICK. BUSINESSES HERE, BANKERS HERE, INVESTORS HERE AND ACROSS THE GLOBE. I'VE GONE TO, UH, EUROPE, THE AMERICAN CHAMBER. HAS SAID, WE ARE SO CONFUSED. HOW CAN WE PLAN? HOW CAN WE INVEST? HOW CAN WE MERGE? HOW CAN WE GROW BUSINESSES WITH THIS TOTAL CHAOS? IT'S AND EVERYBODY'S NOT APPLE OR WALMART WHERE THEY CAN MAYBE EVEN, YOU KNOW, THROW THEIR WEIGHT AROUND THAT THAT THAT THAT COMPANY YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT BOUGHT THE LATHES, AND NO CHOICE IN THE MATTER. THEY HAD TO BUY THE LATHE. THERE IS FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, THERE'S A COURT THAT SAYS THAT THE GOVERNMENT MAY HAVE TO REFUND. UH, THIS MONEY, BUT THAT'S GONNA HAVE TO WORK. WE'RE GONNA FIGHT FOR IT. YEAH, I PROMISE YOU. REPRESENTATIVE DEAN, GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. HAPPY BIRTHDAY AND ENJOY A COUPLE OF BANANAS BEFORE THE NIGHT IS OUT. HOW ABOUT MY BOUQUET OF BANANAS? I LOVE THE BOUQUET OF BANANAS. IT'S A GREAT IDEA. MADELEINE DEAN IS A. THANK YOU FOR COVERING IT AND. REMEMBER WHAT WE'RE NOT COVERING. WE'RE NOT COVERING STARVATION IN GAZA. HOSTAGES NOT HOME. WE'RE NOT COVERING PEOPLE DYING EVERY SINGLE HOUR BECAUSE OF USAID SHUTTERING. YEAH, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ABOUT THAT, AND THANK YOU FOR RAISING THAT AND MAKING US REMEMBER THAT. TONIGHT'S LAST WORD IS NEXT. OK, QUICK PROGRAMMING NOTE BEFORE WE GO. WHEN THE ANIMALS ON MANOR FARM OVERTHROW THE FARMER WHO LORDS OVER THEM, THEY DREAM OF A UTOPIA BUILT ON THE IDEAL THAT ALL ANIMALS ARE CREATED EQUAL, BUT POWER IS CORRUPTING, AND SOON AN AUTOCRATIC PIG SEIZE, SEIZES CONTROL AND IMPOSES A NEW. CREED ON THE FARM. ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL, BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS. TOMORROW ON THE VELSHIBAN BOOK CLUB, WE'RE GONNA EXAMINE ONE OF THE MOST SALIENT AND ENDURING POLITICAL SATIRES OF ALL TIME, ANIMAL FARM BY GEORGE ORWELL. TOMORROW STARTING AT 10:00 A.M. EASTERN. I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN US." />

          <attvalue for="1" value="“Worse Than McCarthyism”: Historian Ellen Schrecker on Trump’s War Against Universities &amp; Students" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="democracy depends on a free press please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org/give president Trump's crackdown on academic institutions in the United States was the focus of protests and commencement speeches this week as universities like Harvard held commencement ceremonies the Trump administration's now directed federal agencies to review all contracts with Harvard after it already cancelled nearly $3 billion in federal research grants for the university and moved last week to revoke its ability to enroll international students harvard has two separate suits pending against Trump arguing the moves violate due process as well as free speech protections under the First Amendment because they target the university staff curriculum and enrollment in his address at Harvard's commencement ceremony Thursday Stanford University professor doctor and novelist Abraham Bergiz praised the school's defiance of Trump and spoke to students facing threats of deportation or having their visas revoked when legal immigrants and others who are lawfully in this country including so many of your international students worry about being wrongly detained and even deported perhaps it's fitting that you hear from an immigrant like me perhaps it's fitting that you hear from someone who was born in Ethiopia when it was ruled by an emperor someone who then lived under the harsh military leader who overthrew the emperor someone who had at least who had at least one of his medical school classmates tortured and disappear more than a quarter of the physicians in this country are foreign medical graduates [Applause] so a part of what makes America great if I may use that phrase is that it allows an immigrant like me to blossom here just as generations of other immigrants and their children have flourished and contributed in every walk of life working to keep America great that's the novelist and medical doctor Ethiopian Indian American Dr abraham Vergiz addressing Harvard's commencement ceremony on Thursday his latest book The Covenant of Water meanwhile down the road in Cambridge the IndianAmerican class president at MIT the Massachusetts Institute of Technology spoke about how MIT's undergraduate body and graduate student union had voted overwhelmingly to cut ties with Israel mega Viruri wore a red and white kafia and said MIT students would never support a genocide and praised them for continuing to protest despite quote threats intimidation and suppression coming from all directions especially she said your own university officials last spring MIT's undergraduate body and graduate student union voted overwhelmingly to cut ties with the genocidal Israeli military you called for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and you stood in solidarity with the pro Palestine activists on campus you faced threats intimidation and suppression coming from all directions especially your own university officials but you prevailed because the MIT community that I know would never tolerate a genocide [Applause] right now while we prepare to graduate and move forward with our lives there are no universities left in Gaza we are watching Israel try to wipe Palestine off the face of the earth and it is a shame that MIT is a part of it the Israeli occupation forces are the only foreign military that MIT has research ties with this means that Israel's assault on the Palestinian people is not only aided and embedded by our country but our school as scientists engineers academics and leaders we have a commitment to support life support aid efforts and call for an arms embargo and keep demanding now as alumni that MIT cuts the ties that was MIT class president Mega Vuri now Indian-American graduate of MIT this comes as Galani Cobb the dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism another school facing attacks by the Trump administration writes for the New Yorker magazine this week about how quote academic freedom in the United States has found itself periodically under siege in his piece headlined A tumultuous spring semester finally comes to a close he describes how he consulted with Ellen Shreker a historian and the author of No Ivory Tower McCarthyism in the Universities along with other deans at Colombia they spoke about government repression on college campuses in the 1950s through to the present shreker told him quote &quot;I've studied McCarthyism's impact on higher education for 50 years what's happening now is worse,&quot; he quoted her saying well we begin today with Ellen Shreker in person joining us in our New York studio she's the author of Many are the crimes McCarthyism in America No Ivory Tower McCarthyism and the Universities shreker is also the author of the right to learn resisting the right-wing attack on academic freedom and she just wrote a piece for the nation headlined worse than McCarthyism universities in the age of Trump shreker has been active in the American Association of University Professors AUP since the 1990s i should note she has three degrees from Radcliffe Harvard and formerly taught there she's a graduate of Radcliffe 1960 ellen Shreker welcome to Democracy Now it's great to have you with us um as we look at these universities under attack you've studied higher education for over half a century let's talk about what was happening then and what's happening today okay uh the main thing that happened then to universities was that about a hundred faculty members most of them with tenure were fired and blacklisted that happened in every major institution of civil society within the United States and although the uh universities pride themselves on academic freedom whatever that means uh they collaborated with the forces of repression uh through that were actively imposing a climate of fear and selfcensorship throughout American society today what's happening is worse so much worse that we have to really find a new phrase for it i don't know what it'll be but um during the McCarthy period it was attacking only individual professors and only about their sort of extracurricular political activities on the left uh in the past and in the present then present uh today the repression that's coming out of Washington DC it attacks everything that happens on American campuses i'd like you to start off we have a very young audience we also have their parents and their grandparents around the world and I'd like you to start off by talking about who McCarthy is what do we mean by the McCarthyism of for example the 1950s okay that's a very good way to start because McCarthyism unfortunately is misnamed it is not just the career of Senator Joseph McCarthy who came in onto the stage of history in 1950 after uh the ism that he gave his name to uh had been really dominating American domestic politics since the late 1940s 47 is when the Truman administration imposed a loyalty test uh an anti-communist loyalty test on its employees so uh if we wanted to name this phenomenon of political repression anti-communist political repression and I want to specify that it didn't attack randomly people on the left but very specifically people who had some kind of connection usually in the past with uh the communist movement uh that during the 1930s and 40s was the most dynamic dynamic force on the left even though it was a very flawed very flawed uh uh political group it was nonetheless uh very uh influential on the left and um if we wanted to give that political repression of the 1940s and50s a name it should have been Hooverism after the FBI director Jay Edgar Hoover um you know the move uh the movie Good Night and Good Luck um they showed real black and white footage of McCarthy and test audiences thought he was too harsh unrealistic not realizing it was actual footage and now you have Good Night and Good Luck on Broadway uh George Clooney starring in it um and it is the financially most successful Broadway show we've seen is going to be now for free on CNN in a few days but the significance of that that that what people feel today was a cartoon character was in fact much harsher and sharper than people ever dreamed yeah um he was beyond the pale because like the current president he had no guard rails as it were not to mention Roy Cohen his sidekick in the hearings who would later go on to mentor Donald Trump until at the very end of his life Donald Trump rejected him when he was dying of AIDS exactly so there are lots of similarities with the fact that uh there's this very aberrant character at the heart or at the uh sort of public heart in of this repressive movement but what we should have known in the 40s and 50s and should know now is it's not just a one-man show it has been this moment of trying to crack down on dissent constitutional disscent free speech uh the ability to say uh what Israel is doing in Gaza is a terrible thing uh that is something that has been uh building up for decades and what that was the same thing during McCarthyism there was a kind of network of right-wing activists uh similar to groups today like the Heritage Society that brought us the uh 2025 project blueprint for Trump's attack on the institutions of civil uh liberties and uh civil society uh that uh has come to fruition since he uh entered the White House so I mean you speak as a Jewish author active member of the American Association of University Professors would you say that the McCarthyism of yestery year is the charges that President Trump with his sidekick Elon Musk giving the Hal Hitler salute charging anti-semitism for what he's doing anti-semitism is a pretext we know that Trump has been all his life a racist uh clearly befriending these uh fascist individuals and groups uh for years and uh what we're seeing is a kind of uh a melding of uh Trump's own uh right-wing proclivities reactionary proclivities pro-fascist proclivities with a uh long-term attempt within some pro-Zionist organizations to eliminate uh all uh uh support for Palestinian freedom and Palestinian liberation from American uh universities uh in particular but from uh within American society you have uh earlier this month a federal judge Jeffrey Crawford ordering uh the release of Columbia University graduate Palestinian activist Mosan Madawi from uh prison in Vermont he was picked up by masked hooded ICE agents at his naturalization interview in Vermont he was beyond holding a green card um the judge writing in his ruling quote &quot;Our nation's seen times like this before especially during the Red Scare and Palmer raids of 1919 1920 and during the McCarthy period of the 1950s and I I wanted to take it beyond that um you note that you know that we're not just talking about individual professors anymore we're talking about current attacks being much broader and you write that um this interesting paradox quote despite higher education's much larger footprint within American society today the academy is in a much weaker position to resist political intervention why is it weaker it's weaker for two reasons one because the state is stronger the state does much more in with regard to higher education than it did in the 1950s you know it supports most important basic scientific research it regulates things on campus with regard to uh shall we say diversity equity and inclusion uh with trying to uh ensure that all Americans have a good shot at higher education that was a push by the federal government so you can see that uh the government is much more involved it funds student loans most uh smaller universities without huge endowments rely on students who have to get federal loans in order to pay tuitions so what he's doing by withdrawing federal money from higher education is essentially threatening to destroy American higher education today i wanted to turn to the clip of Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaking in March following the arrest of the Colombia graduate student now graduated graduate student albeit he was in jail in Louisiana when he got his diploma at Colombia mahm Khalil if you tell us when you apply hi I'm trying to get into the United States on a student visa i am a big supporter of Hamas a murderous barbaric group that kidnaps children that rapes teenage girls that takes hostages that allows them to die in captivity that returns bo more bodies than live hostages if you tell us that you are in favor of a group like this and if you tell us when you apply for your visa and by the way I intend to come to your country as a student and rile up all kinds of anti-Jewish student anti-Semitic activities I intend to shut down your universities if you told us all these things when you applied for a visa we would deny your visa i hope we would if you actually end up doing that once you're in this country on such a visa we will revoke it and if you end up having a green card not citizenship but a green card as a result of that visa while you're here in those activities we're going to kick you out of course uh the Trump administration not proven any of this um and a number of students have been released from prison with very angry judges talking about where are the grounds for these people to be imprisoned mahmood Khalil has been now imprisoned for three months as his little baby was born um here in New York uh if you can talk about what this leads to these kind of harsh attacks when it comes to speech and when it comes to universities you were just addressing the deans at Columbia University some compare Harvard not uh fighting Harvard fighting back against the Trump administration and Colombia conceding and the pressure it's put on its students yeah um this has been a constant in the history of American higher education to collaborate with political repression uh they universities do not fight back they didn't fight back during the McCarthy period they're not were not fighting back until of this miracle it really was a miracle totally unexpected of the president at Harvard saying no I cannot uh go along with what you were asking and what they were asked the Jewish president right Alan Garber who um President Trump has accusing of anti-semitism well of course we're all anti-semites as long as we feel that maybe you shouldn't be killing babies in uh Gaza every day but uh what we're seeing is the beginning of a push back against uh what Trump is doing what his entire apparatus of hoodlams I think is trying to do to the universities and that wonderful quote you had from Secretary of State Rubio when he said you know paraphrasing these supposed terrorists that they wanted to shut down the universities he's doing more to shut down the universities than probably anybody else in America at this moment threatening to revoke the visas of all international students what about the role of your organization the AAUP the American Association of University Professors we are a group that is over a hundred years old and when we were founded it was a period very much like today where outsiders politicians and especially very wealthy business people uh on boards of trustees were interfering with what faculty members were saying and doing with regard to at that point there was a lot of labor unrest and attempts to create unions and university professors were sort of saying well look at the working conditions under which uh American workers are are uh being uh oppressed uh let's do something about industrial accidents and things like that uh today we're seeing uh that uh in every way uh the federal government state legislators interfering with the academic work of university professors and that is what my organization is trying to do is to protect the integrity and the educational value of what goes on on American campuses do you hold out hope in this last minute we have together uh yes because unfortunately we have no model we can follow from McCarthyism because there was no push back but today we're seeing people marching to commencement at Harvard uh wearing labels saying you know enough is enough President Trump we're seeing uh huge crowds showing up to welcome uh Mosen coming back from uh Vermont after having been picked up by ICE we're seeing a growing movement within civil society that has to be maintained and has to be maintained for years i mean the damage that the Trump administration is doing is absolutely beyond the pale and has never never been equaled in American life with regard to higher education so we've got to get out there in the trenches and even begin to think some more about okay if they're not paying attention to the judges if the Supreme Court folds and let us pray that it does not um what do we have to do we're going to have to leave it there ellen Shreker author of Many Are the Crimes: McCarthyism in America No Ivory Tower MacArthurism and the Universities also the author of The Right to Learn: Resisting the Right-wing Attack on Academic Freedom we'll link to your piece in the Nation headlined Worse Than McCarthyism Universities in the Age

          <attvalue for="7" value="how then do we end up uh with the Gulf War I and the brutal sanctions which are posed on Iraq afterwards so we got a naughty GCC State doing something they shouldn't have been doing so in the aftermath of the war the Iran Iraq war it's 1989 Iran and Iraq both go to the OPEC States and say look we're dying over here we need to get back on our feet is there any way you can help out and the the answer was and Saudi Arabia was at the at the center of this um what we'll do is every OPEC state will cut their production and then Iran and Iraq can increase their production by that amount so that the supply of oil in the marketplace stays the same so the price doesn't change but it gives Iran and Iraq a larger share of the oil Market that way they can use that extra Revenue to to repair and recover from the Iran Iraq War so everybody's happy Kuwait began flooding the marketplace with oil which caused the price of oil to plunge which meant that any break that Iran and Iraq had gotten from their increased sales was was evaporated um Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of doing this he brought in a un team to examine this and the UN team discovered that what Kuwait was doing was literally stealing Iraqi oil by both there were oil fields on the board they were they were pumping oil at an excessive amount on those oil fields and they were slant drilling into Iraqi fields that were entirely on the Iraqi side of the border and then flooding the market with the Iraq's stolen oil causing the price to collapse Saddam Hussein brought in April glasby the US ambassador Iraq and said I've tried everything the UN I brought the UN in the kuwaitis won't stop doing this I'm G to attack and and he basically told her look we have a historical claim to Iraq to Kuwait Kuwait was carved out of the bus province of the Ottoman Empire and we want to attack it and Annex it and she said what happens between Arab states is of no concern to the United States and so he interpreted that as a green light he attacked George Bush Senior initially says I don't see any issue with this at this moment but I'm going to consult my team he flies to Aspen Margaret Thatcher flies to Aspen they come out of the Aspen meeting and George Bush Senor goes he's a Hitler he's a Hitler thousand points a and the next thing you know uh we're doing Operation Desert Shield and then the next thing you know we're doing Operation Desert Storm so to be clear invading Kuwait is wrong that's not the answer I don't want to sound like I'm a apologist for Saddam Hussein but on the flip side of it blowing Iraq up and and smashing all its bridges blowing up its schools tearing up its government buildings and Wrecking the place probably also isn't the answer in the other direction so you know this this problem that we have in our world is a wrong is committed and then the response to fix the wrong is to do another wrong that doesn't make the world a better place Kuwait could have easily been liberated from Iraq without blowing Iraq up it there was no need to to to do the kind of Destruction that was done we're talking about an international Force the Egyptian arm is there the the the syrians sent troops the Saudis are there the French are there the British are there the Americans are there like there's nothing in the world that could have prevent that Saddam Hussein could have done to prevent the the military capture of Kuwait the bombing campaign that the United States unleashes on Iraq for one month they we bombed the hell out of the country has no reasonable explanation other than we just wanted to test weapon systems and kill as many people as we could and I think the result was kind of shock and horrify the world like what was that for this was so excessive in any case uh that's what we do the second war is even more irrational like at least in the case of the first war you can say well we're liberating Kuwait in the case of the second war there is no explanation for it so in the aftermath of the first war the United States announced George Bush Senor announced that as soon as Iraq got get got rid of its weapons of mass destruction it would be let back into the the community of countries right the Iraqis misund misunderstood what was being said they misinterpreted they took their their chemical weapons out into the desert in multiple sites and blew them up they did this in August of 1991 so the war had ended you know like six months earlier the Iraqis go out in the desert they blow up all these chemical warheads and they think they're done and then the UN weapons inspection regime shows up first of all chemical weapons aren't a weapon of mass destruction they're a terror weapon the number of people killed by them is actually shockingly low it's just a horrific horrible death that's scary weapons of mass destruction are nukes and biological weapons um also you can use Conventional Weapons as a weapon of mass destruction you know we killed 20,000 people when we firebomb the city of Dresden in World War II I think burning 20,000 people alive it constitutes a weapon of mass destruction at that point right obviously we killed a lot more people when we nuked toosa and Nagasaki but you can even turn a conventional weapon into weapon mass destruction in any case we'll use the terminology because that's the terminology everybody uses even though it's wrong and I just want to be clear that it's wrong the UN weapons Inspection Team shows up and they're like where are the warheads and Iraq goes we we don't have any and they whip out the receipts who delivered those VX sarin and gas mustard gas Warheads nerve gas Warheads to the Iraqis it was the United States during the Iran Iraq war so they had the serial numbers for every single rocket we just handed over the receipts so the UN weapons Inspection Team says okay we have to find the serial numbers and the Iraqis go you're kidding we blew that stuff up and the weapons team goes show us where you blew it up we're going to sift the sand to find the little metal serial numbers so we can check them off by 1998 Scott Ritter a US Marine who was the guy leading the the inspection team at that point had confirmed that he found 98% of the serial numbers the life expectancy of those weapons were expired they were past their expiration date but Bill Clinton was in the middle of the Monaco Lewinsky scandal he need to distract the American public so he ordered the UN weapons Inspection Team out so he could bomb Iraq he does it and then Saddam husin goes that's it I we were clean you knew we were clean you're playing dirty I'm not letting the weapons Inspection Team back in in 2002 George Bush Jr threatens to go to war Saddam Hussein lets the weapons Inspection Team back in because he doesn't want to get bombed he gets bombed anyway and we go to war a second round for weapons we knew they never had because Scott Ritter had identified 98% you got to figure when you're blowing up Warheads some of those serial numbers are going to melt or be shredded 98% shocks me I can't believe they found 98% you at that point I would have treated that as a clean bill of health but obviously Bill Clinton didn't care about that he was right Wag the Dog kind of situation created a distraction for the public why George Bush Jr did the second war may be explained by a thing called the project for The New American Century I what happened was a group of conservatives in the United States had actually written a series of letters to Bill Clinton beginning in 1998 and then they ended up part of the George Bush Senior or George Bush Junior government and those letters said that what the United States ought to do is invade Iraq conquer it create it turn it into a base of operations and then either invade Syria or Iran next conquer those two because whichever only didn't do second you'll do third then the United States is going to invade and Conquer Saudi Arabia So the plan was to backstab Saudi Arabia and then invade and Conquer Egypt and in the process encircle Israel secure Israel make it safe and then change the borders of the region to create even more divisions and and like I I've seen the map it's it's crazy they were going to split the hzz off of nudged and and make it so that there were at least two states where Saudi Arabia was um they were going to carve Iraq up into three states they were going to carve Syria up and the goal was to just make it so that the United States would would now have an imperial foothold in the Middle East the United States military named the Middle East centcom as in Central Command so the United States is in central command the United States is northcom it's north command the center of the United States is the Middle East and that that was the mentality that they brought into that war of course it turned into a disaster and the and the Iraqi people you know Vietnam the United States and and the United States left humiliated and and in disgrace um the United States got Vietnam by by Afghanistan as well so it was it ended up being completely catastrophic for the United States Empire in the end but the loss in life and the loss to the global economy is also catastrophic" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="we haven't yet actually discussed the origins of of Israel um and Palestine let's discuss the Genesis of Israel yeah so in the aftermath of World War II uh the Zionist movement finally had a little bit of uh of legitimacy so Zionism was born in the end of the 19th century as a result of the dfus affair so dfus was a Jewish German officer in the French army it's a little a little convol he gets busted by the French for being a spy for Germany the Jewish population in Europe interpreted that as an attack on a on a Jewish person it it's just as possible if not as likely that it was it was actually an attack on an ethnic German living in France right yeah there was probably I'm not denying that there was anti-Semitism in France obviously was but but he was also German so there was probably also a component of anti-german the reality was is he was scapegoated he had nothing to do with what he was being charged with and so um zionists like Herzel are Bor the the Zionist movement is born Herzel kind of being the father of it in the Jewish population it had already existed as an idea we described earlier Napoleon wanting to send Jews to Palestine so the dominant anti Jewish ideology was originally called uden hos in Germany which meant Jew hatred the problem with the name was it sounds like an emotional thing as opposed to a logical thing so they coined the phrase anti-Semitism so that they could say look it's I it's not that I have an emotion I just I disagree with the presence of Jews in Europe part a component of the anti-semitic movement was we just wanted the Jews to leave the initial ideology didn't want to kill the Jewish population obviously it morphs into that and turns into the Holocaust but the orig goal wasn't to kill them it was just to evict them um you know in the same way that uh there's a there's a portion of the United States population that wants to evict undocumented immigrants or that the German population wanted to evict undocumented polish immigrants or that the British wanted to evict the Polish immigrants and that's why they voted for brexit right it's that it's that mentality and so here are these profoundly racist anti-semites they coin the phrase anti-semitism the Zionist movement goes maybe they're right maybe we should leave Europe maybe we're not we can't make a good life for ourselves here um Herzel wasn't interested initially in Palestine he want he was thinking someplace like Uganda so in a really weird way what happened was the creation of a population of White Europeans who were who wanted to conduct a colonial Enterprise not unlike the colonial Enterprise that ended up with Argentina and in the United States in Canada and Australia where there would be a population of white people going to another country and ethnically cleansing and genociding the local population to take it from them ultimately the zionists really just wanted to go to Palestine um the balfor Declaration sort of reinforces the idea of going to Palestine um balfor was a British Lord who said that's where they should end up um and then World War II happens before World War III happens a lot of Jews decide to do this and they begin migrating to Palestine the Palestinian population welcomed them they they saw this as sort of a natural outcome um in part because historically Jews and Muslims and Christians in the Middle East got along you have to remember that even during the Crusades the native Christian population if it had been open to the Crusader states in the beginning totally rejected the Crusader states by the end and were siding with the the the the their fellow Muslims against the Crusades the Crusaders and the Jewish population was always against the Crusaders there was this history of Muslims knew the Jews were their allies and so the idea of Jewish Europeans coming to Palestine the Palestinians welcomed them in uh there's count account after account after account of Palestinian families letting like Jewish poles move into their homes and live with them and then they would do something foolish like go on vacation and come back and the Jewish population in the home said no no this is our home now and you can't come back into it and and and so there was this strange effect of the Palestinians going yeah sure come the Jewish immigrants to Palestine sorry this was like 1910 20s like tens 20s 30s some of them began to do terrorism and so they terrorist organizations formed they began attacking British assets they attack hotels British military bases um so there's a violent element to this um there was a also an attempt to Simply legally purchase land and the the Zionist ended up purchasing somewhere around 5 10% of Palestine legally and then in the process uh there was attempts to create land confiscation where they would just go onto a piece of land that nobody owned and begin colonizing it um the World War II happens there's the Holocaust which is a catastroph event and the world becomes open to the idea that yeah there needs to be a Jewish State the irony is if you're going to create the Jewish State let's do it so I'm part Austrian just I want to out that because I'm I'm GNA suggest the Middle East peace solution let's make Austria a new Israel Hitler was an Austrian the the Germans Austria is German they speak German you can talk to austrians and go I'm not a I'm not I'm not German I'm Austrian whatever they're Germans the Germany did the Holocaust Germany annexed Austria and did the Holocaust so put Israel in Austria call it Israel make the danu be the the boundary between the Austrian area you know so instead of calling it The the West Bank call it the North bank right and put the austrians there Vienna will rename it Jerusalem and then tro will call up the terroll strip and we'll just shove a bunch of the Austrian population into the North Bank and the terrol strip but then let's colonize the the North Bank and and create little walled off sections and ghettoize the I mean I think that's the solution the natural solution instead the world thought let's do this to Palestine which is ironic because it's the Palestinians have nothing to do with the Holocaust in any way shape or form uh during the war some Jews from Palestine actually joined a Jewish uh Brigade that fought with the British the British wouldn't let Palestinians do that because they didn't want Palestinians to have had combat experience but but they did employ Palestinians as stors so Palestinians did serve on the docks loading and unloading ships uh so that so that white people could fight the war because the British were nervous about having brown and black people fight they they did BR and black people definitely fought for the British they were just reluctant they didn't want anybody getting an idea and leading a rebellion when they went back home to Kenya or South Africa or Palestine um ironically the BR British love to put giras and Maes into combat situations but that's a different story so in the aftermath of all of this the UN votes to divide Palestine and and create an Israel and a Palestine the division the vote for the division gave Israel about 55% of Palestine and gave the Palestinians 45% so the 55% that was going to go to Israel that land was to create a Jewish only state and then the 45% that was going to go to Palestine would be for Christians Jews and Muslims but the problem was is that the the land didn't belong to the Jewish population right because they bought 5 to 10% of the land so basically you're gifting somewhere between 45 and 50% of the land to this Zionist movement what about the Palestinians already living there so the Arabs rejected this the Israelis invaded they declare they declare their independence what it is is it's a colonial Enterprise they invade and Conquer Palestine there's a war the 1948 War and the you know the Egyptian army goes in with rifles that don't work they had tanks that were profoundly flawed like tanks that could only turn in One Direction or the turret didn't turn or the machine gun didn't work um they were mostly I don't know if they were mostly but a lot of them were stewards which were these little itty bitty tank cats uh the Israelis were better armed better equipped they had more combat experience there was a bunch of them there was a huge Invasion Force you know the jordanians made an attempt to stop this the syrians fought there were Iraqi units that showed up as volunteers nobody could stop the Israelis from creating the state by the time they were done the Israelis ended up with 78% of Palestine so the UN division of uh Palestine created three Israeli wedges one in the middle one in the north east and then one in the South and then it created four Palestinian wedges one that was about twice the size of the Gaza Strip where the Gaza Strip is like the remnant of it one that was probably about one and a third times the size of the West Bank where the West Bank is and then one in the Northwest um so you know like Bethlehem was supposed to be in the west bank and then uh hia was supposed to be Palestinian and by the time the Israelis were done they had Shrunk the West Bank they had dramatically Shrunk the Gaza Strip and they just took the remaining piece there were four pieces because yaffa was going to become a little Enclave in Palestine that was completely surrounded by Israel and the sea and then uh Jerusalem was going to be a neutral zone and it was going to be administered by the United Nations that was the plan and uh the Israelis of course broke the whole thing Old Jerusalem or west or east Jerusalem ended up in Jordan West Jerusalem ended up in Israel and uh the Israelis during the conquest committed some acts of terrorism so there's a place called darene where they do they conduct a massacre and the Hope was to cause panic in the Palestinian population to cause them to run away and they did a huge portion of the Palestinian population flees fearing that darasin was just the beginning of a series of massacres one of the catastrophic ironies of all of this is yod vashem the Holocaust Memorial is across the Valley from Dar so it's almost like there's there's the commemoration of a terrible cruel Injustice across the Valley from a terrible cruel Injustice instead of the world creating more Justice it heaped more suffering on a population of people that had nothing to do with the initial suffering" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="I want to welcome you all to this special set of episodes that we're going to be doing on the 1 and particularly looking at the companions who embraced Islam out of the place known as may Allah send his peace and blessings upon our messenger Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam and be pleased with all of his companions Allah a so I want to kind of walk back to where we left off we talked about and we talked about also from the tribe of now these two men who are the most prominent figures from T ironically their stories don't actually intersect with the most famous incident of the rejection of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam from right if you kind of go back and look to how both of them find their way to Allah subhana wa ta'ala it's a very different pathway for both of them right and Subhan Allah a strange beginning a strange ending and as I said every single person that we have a story about from which is the main tribe of every single person enters Islam strangely and then dies in a strange way Subhan Allah and so so we covered those two of course comes to after literally murdering 13 of his companions in Egypt and making Toba after looting them and coming to the prophet Salli was in Medina to embrace Islam Embraces Islam after and he wasn't present as we said in the siege of T because he was out in jash actually learning how to use and and you know when they say the tanks of the day and the catapults of the day obviously they are uh very primary ways of looking at these types of devices these you know military devices back then but the point is he's out he was out learning how to defend how to fight and then he came to the prophet Sall alaihi wasall again to Medina to embrace Islam so here's what I want us to do inshallah tal as we go through the next sort of five sections here of T I want you to imagine being the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam in Medina after almost two decades of past and then looking back at what has transpired since the worst day of your life you talk about trauma you talk about a devastating moment in your life the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said the worst day of my life was that day in right now as we start inshallah tal the the way we're going to do this over the next five sections is we're going to look through how the fruits of showed themselves to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam over time starting from the earliest Muslim in t does anyone know who that is we're talking about him tonight in starting from the earliest Muslim until the last known Muslim who embraced Islam from at the hands of the Prophet so we're kind of going back now we've covered may Allah be pleased with them as the Chiefs ofif we're kind of going back now to the prophet and walking through how this wisdom all unfolds and from the wisdom of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is just as much as the prophet Salli wasallam did not expect anything to come from Al from the city known as at the time he had lofty expect of the city of and from the wisdom of Allah subhana tala that the two most prominent men to embrace Islam from were not directly tied to the incident of the Prophet going to himself to give them da so you think about that Subhan Allah that you truly do your part and then you do not guide who you love and by extension as the mention you do not guide when you love and how you love Allah chooses how to guide when to guide who to guide and each one of these people Subhan Allah it is a a strange path towards Allah subhanahu waala towards the messenger of Allah sallallahu Al wasallam so let's walk back to the prophet s going to give in for the very first time and how inshallah T this will all unfold with the messenger of Allah s first and foremost what is the city of T has anyone in here ever been to the city of T by the way all right Mah one person two people T is probably the most beautiful and stunning city that you will see in that entire area T is an incredible place it is in the mountains it doesn't look like the rest of Arabia I mean you go there and you're like Subhan Allah what am I looking at you see Greenery you see trees you see Rivers flowing it has Seasons so it's not just hot all the time the way that Mecca would be hot all the time they actually have a winter in t so they have seasons it's one of the most Pleasant atmospheres that you can be in and it's a place Subhan Allah that is full of fruits all types of fruits grow in th all types of flowers grow in th right so the most famous perfume and in fact you know the greatest exporter one of the biggest exporter of roses in the world is and so what's the perfume called right you hear it when you're reading in the sh of the Prophet wasallam the rose of that famous perfume that scent that comes from because T actually produces literal roses so it's a beautiful place roses uh they say that they used to give examples of about its raisins were the size of its T were the size of its dates so people loved the the raisins of T and plus the scholars say there were no fruits that came to Mecca except from T So T was the food exporter the fruits exporter and all of that came to Mecca so the types of people that live in t are supposed to be the richest and and the most affluent and the most thoughtful people in that sense right and in that they are truly Elites and that's why despite their distance from Mecca they're looked at in a certain way and that's why by the way their Idol who was their Idol named what was their Idol we talked about the idol being destroyed byot a lot was huge humongous Idol all sorts of jewelry on it decked out with all the rubies and the pearls and by the way Subhan Allah side note we talked about when he was killed by his people when he came out and he madean and some people shot him with arrows killed him and the prophet s wasam likened him to the man from Surah right who came to his people and and he said right this person who saw and called his people to Allah subhana wa tala the son of when he came to the prophet wasallam he asked the prophet Sall alhi wasallam for permission to pay off some of the debts of from the jewelry ofat and it was about 200,000 Dirhams and the prophet allowed it like take that jewelry the gold and pay off some of the DBS of the righteous Chief from so everything in is elaborate everything is beautiful and Powerful in in in T and that's what it represents to the people in Mecca as well so no wonder why when the prophet s alaihi wasallam saw the dream of a place with Greenery his mind sallallahu alaihi wasallam immediately went to T and not to not to Al Medina because geographically speaking and socially speaking T is the place to go and can you imagine Subhan Allah if T would have embraced Islam how many Muslims would visit T every single year if the prophet Sall alaihi wasall was taken in by the people of T and buried how many people would go there how many people would enjoy the geography of T and enjoy the city but Subhan Allah the fortune the risk the sustenance was to the the transaction was successful look what Medina became and how many Muslims visit T right what is T in the history of the Muslims as a city still again a place where Muslims came out a city that bore greatness but not like the greatness of al- Med so is the place that the prophet Sall alaihi wasallam thinks he's seeing in his dream is dead is dead there is no one to protect him and Allah subhana wa tal is sending the prophet alaihi wasallam an image a vision of a place that should embrace him now furthermore the prophet sallai wasallam is smart enough to make connections before he goes to a city so in Al Medina he has his maternal relatives from Ben as far as the prophet sallai wasallam knew AI woman uh who was J she's from the tribe of J and she was a wife of one of the chiefs of all right so an elderly woman who was and the prophet s thinks he has a connection there to make things easy because she has a soft spot for the of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam to so to sort of ease his way in so what happens the prophet sallallahu Al am goes to a with high expectations and in the lowest point of his life the year of grief those two things together can be absolutely paralyzing why is Allah doing this to me the prophet s was does not ask he simply goes with itat and he goes to the three Chiefs at the time and they were known as the children of and names I want you to write down the names in and or Mas his name is either or Mas and then the third one isib okay so three children or and and the prophet s meets them and he says to them from the very start that what I'm coming to you with is a call to embrace Allah subhana to embrace Islam to embrace the message of the Oneness of Allah but the prophet sallai wasallam is already stipulating or he's putting in some contingencies in his he said s wasallam if you don't accept the da itself then at least you take me in and you grant me safety until until Allah subh makes a situation a way out between me and my people and the Quran completes it its descent upon me meaning let Allah subhana descend whatever is left of the Quran while I'm here in let me cultivate my da from here so basically give me a like situation ABA right I'll take that if the only thing that we have now because mecah is is a terrible situation that we can be situated here and that we can cultivate our da this can basically serve his HQ with the protection and the leaders of T are respected by the people of Mecca then give me that and the prophet s wasallam says if you don't Embrace these two things at least Subhan Allah such a small request at least don't tell the people in Mecca that I came to you seeking shelter why because things are already on the edge in Mecca they have already made life absolutely unbearable for the messenger of Allah alaihi wasallam so at least don't tell Abu jahal don't tell the leaders of qur what I am doing here so that they don't cause me more trouble than I already have now Subhan Allah the response could not have been worse and truly the response from these three men was possibly more hurtful to the prophet Salli wasallam than the stones themselves that would cause him to be drenched in his own blood sallallahu alaihi wasallam as he ran away from th the first one and they wouldn't look at him they kind of you know when you're in the room but you're not in the room that's how low you are that's how low they're making you the first one he says like couldn't couldn't God find someone other than you you like couldn't Allah find someone other than you to send how degrading right the second one he says that if you are the one he said that he is going to tear up he'll go to the and tear up the clothes the cloth of the if you're the one that Allah chose the arrogance right like you're the one I'm going to go protest at the Kaa and tear the cloth of the Kaa cuz I don't like you being the messenger of Allah right and the third one he said I swear by Allah that I will never speak to you he said I'll never speak to you if you are who you claim to be a messenger of Allah then you're too great for me to have a conversation with you I can't respond to you because you might actually be a messenger of Allah you're too small for me in one narration if you're not the messenger of Allah you're too small for me to talk to you so you're either too great for me to talk to or you're too small for me to talk to but I I want nothing to do with you so the three men all gave the prophet s alaihi wasallam this disgusting response on top of that right they sent the message to when the prophet said please don't tell them what I did if you're not going to accept me they they sent the message to Mecca to let them know that the prophet Salli wasallam had come to them seeking that type of refuge on top of that they gave the prophet s that disgusting parting punishment where they lined up the children and the slaves and the hoodlums right of T the fools of T and they said form two narrow lines and as he's on his way out sallallahu alaihi wasallam Stone him kick him spit on him make sure that he has an unbearable exit contrast that exit to the entrance into Medina and right Subhan Allah like contrast the exit of thought of and how bitter The Taste that'll be left in your mouth where people who don't even know you won't speak to you they hate you so much they're punching you spitting at you wounding at you wounding you and doing all these things to you and you don't even know why they hate you they don't know why they hate you and the people of Medina of course will embrace the prophet not even knowing how he looks and they're further from him than is to meca but they'll Embrace Himi later on and they will take him in and love him more than they love themselves so IM is is a risk Iman is Faith and it is risk it is sustenance that Allah gives to some people and he doesn't give to others now subh Allah I'm actually going to start with uh one thing here the reason why I told you to memorize the names of these three people in the very beginning can you imagine if in that delegation of Ben that came in in the year of the delegations if one of those Chiefs was there oh God you gave me the worst treatment in my entire life well guess what one of them Habib was actually in the delegation According to some of the narrations and the prophet accepted his Islam and forgave him sallallahu alaihi wasallam Subhan Allah so it's there's the story of forgiveness here which is the story of fatah as well right it's a story of forgiveness it's a story of Da on the one hand it's a story of how Magnificent the heart of the Prophet Sall alaihi wasallam is to forgive people who really have no business from just a human perspective of being forgiven but it's also a story of right the prophet saying Allah guide and bring them to me after all that they did to Himi wasallam and not punishing them under siege nor taking revenge or at least giving him a little bit of a shakeup and reminding him right like when you come to my city now then I will you know at least hey remember when I came to your city what you said to me remember what you did to me Prophet s wasam left him alone he was the oldest M of the delegation and the prophet accepted his Islam it's another dimension to YF yam the prophet recall him when he entered into meca I will forgive you the way that Yousef forgave his brothers but remember Yousef also received his brothers in a new place and he forgave them there as well Prophet Salli was let it go so there's a story of forgiveness that's embedded in all of this but there is also the story of Da which is what we are focused on inshallah tal over the next five sections of the people embracing Islam and the fruits starting to show themselves over time with the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam so the messenger of Allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that I was beaten and spit on or or I was humiliated until I didn't even know where I was some of the historians say that the span of torture how far out if you trace where the Prophet ended up from the place that it started it's about 14 miles it's a long walk to be beaten to be trashed to have someone come out and and you know throw another word of humiliation and you know Subhan Allah you don't forget that type of stuff right like you'll remember every word that was said to you you'll remember everything that happened to you but the prophet Sall alaihi wasall said that by the time I got out of it I didn't even know where I was I found myself in a place called which was an area outside of so it's like he's coming down from the M the mountain area right beaten up um Stones all in his sandal sallallahu alaihi wasallam I mean you imagine trying to run down downhill a mountain right so the stones are collected in his Sho s alhi wasallam so he's bleeding from the hits and he's bleeding from the stones that have collected in his sandals sallallahu alaihi wasallam and the rapid Pace at which the beating and the humiliation is coming the messenger of Allah does not even have a chance to pick the stones out of uh his out of his sandals sallallah alaihi wasallam so this is the rate at which the torture of the messenger of Allah sallallah alaihi wasallam is coming and the prophet Salli wasallam he passed by thisi woman and she felt so bad right she was the wife of the chief because she wanted to do something and the prophet Salli wasallam simply said to her what did we find from your family it was nothing but beatings and rejection and humiliation right and this is where you find that the story start to come the fruits start to show themselves the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam is in his lowest low right and he has no one to go to and he is sitting under a tree in this garden and the garden happens to belong to two men from meca and might sound familiar to you by the way he's the father of hint B right the wife of Abu sufyan who wants the Revenge takes revenge on ham and a staunch enemy of the Prophet until she actually Embraces why does she want all of this Revenge right Subhan Allah look what happens and Sh are both two evil men who would die in the Battle of bad fighting the prophet s alaihi wasallam Subhan Allah so this is just the Fate but they're looking out at the messenger of Allah sallallah alaihi wasallam covered in blood sitting under a tree in the garden weeping am making Dua to Allah tala with absolutely no friend no support no one to help him so at that point as they look out to him and they see him in this way Subhan Allah even the most evil and wicked men can sometimes have a moment an opening where they could change something can happen to them right they don't go to him sallallahu alaihi wasallam and welcome him into the house say come clean yourself up and at least you know due to our familiarity with you and our history with you we'll take care of you after all of this this is a beating that you never had no to show their idea of nobility was called the slave who was named Adas and tell Adas to take some grapes to him just go take some grapes to him give him some food that's their idea of sympathy to the prophet s in this moment not to go and comfort him or give him s us but to son Adas uh to them with grapes Adas comes to the prophet sallu alai wasallam with these grapes and he enters upon the messenger of Allah Sall alaihi wasallam gives him the grapes and you can imagine Subhan Allah the risk how Allah drives people the sustenance how Allah drives people what brought ad to at that moment to be the slave of those two men to end up being the one who will meet the messenger of Allah wasallam in the garden at those moments brings the grapes to the prophet Sall alhi wasallam he hands The Grapes to the messenger of allahi wasallam the Prophet s says bis in the name of Allah Subhan Allah the same basah bis it sparked the curiosity if you remember in the story of abdah who was a slave on the outskirts of Mecca right when the prophet Salli wasam said bah and he put his his his hands on the utterers of the sheep and he said what is it that you said what is the special prayer that you just made but in the case of it's different Adas sees the prophet sallai wasallam sayah and this is a sign subh Allah that bis opens doors when you talk about bis opens Baraka opens blessing he says to the prophet Salli wasallam he says the people around here don't say those words people in this part of the world people in these lands don't say these words Adas has never met a mu a monotheist in that entire area where he's at how many years has he been living in slavery there where did he come from in the first place but Adas hears Bas right the Bas being recited he says people here don't say those words where did that come from and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam instead responds to the question with a question he asks uh Adas where are you from right if if people in this land don't say these words where are you from and he says I'm from Nino say Neva in Iraq and the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam he says after he says that ah the land of my brother says how do you know who Jonah is how do you know who is how do you know he's a prophet who are you was he was a Christian man as says he was a Christian from right how do you know he's a prophet and the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam he says that is my brother who a he is a prophet and I am a prophet and Allah subhana T sent us all with the same message to call people to the Oneness of Allah subhanahu waala is with the prophet Salli wasallam in and shba are watching from the house an interaction happening between Adas and the prophet wasallam and they could see Adas changing his eyes getting bigger his curiosity like what is going on here the next thing they see is Adas getting down to kiss the hands of the Prophet Salli wasallam to attempt to even kiss the feet of the Prophet sallam to prostrate towards him just admiring the prophet Sall alaihi wasallam and treating the prophet Sall alaihi wasallam entirely different and they said you know they they called Adas back and and they said this man even poisons our slaves said what are you doing he said no one knows what he knows except that he's a of Allah except that he's a prophet of Allah and they started to laugh at Adas and they mocked him and they sent the prophet Sall alaihi wasallam away Subhan Allah this moment of Allah sending the first man to embrace the prophet Sall alaihi wasallam in to be out of all people who the prophet Salli comes across by accident in the midst of his greatest pain in the midst of his humiliation who wasn't even the direct audience of The Da Who belongs to the lower class of society the lowest class of society the most inconsequential from a material perspective is one of the greatest beauties of how this da actually works right of how Allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala puts this particular message in the hearts of people as a result of whatever Allah subhana deems fit to be the perfect situation by which a person would Embrace Islam so here you have and not mention a few things think about the Journey of who we have nothing about him except for the moment that he embraced Islam what happened to him afterwards where did he go who were his children did he ever get married all of that is unknown to us but Allah subhah wa tala sending a person all the way from n in irq nway in Iraq to end up in the presence of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam serving him and acknowledging his so think about the sincerity of Adas and sometimes Allah subhana T brings people to Islam in Chains Sal was that sincere Seeker who was brought to Alina after being enslaved 13 to 19 times he said I passed behind the hands or I passed through the hands of 13 to 19 slave owners before I ended up in Medina to be in the presence of the Prophet s alaihi wasallam to acknowledge his so what did Allah subh see in this young man to choose him to come to this moment to meet the prophet s wasallam and to have Islam gifted to him the second thing is that Subhan Allah in every single Society Islam did not start with the elites started with the it starts with the weak ones it starts with the vulnerable ones that is the way that this da spreads and that is of the ethos of the dean and that's one of the most beautiful things about it that it wasn't a top- down message from the elites the prophet s wasallam said find me amongst the weak ones find me amongst the down Trent you're given support and victory through your weak ones and Subhan Allah The Message of Islam resonates with the weak ones of society first because they have the the least barriers in terms of material and worldly barriers between them and Islam so this was the religion of the B and theab and in Medina it was the Youth of the ansar and some Chiefs but they were young enough that Allah opened their hearts to this message of Al Islam that caused these people to embrace Islam now for the prophet Salli wasallam to see the fruits what else do we take from this one of the most beautiful l that we take from it is that of all the prophets who Allah sent him a follower a follower of to embrace Islam and Allah sent him a follower of eunus not a follower of m not a follower of in that sense from the St the place of not ibim not the rabbis of Medina first a follower of Eunice how rare are followers of eunus and why unus the very first prophet who Allah revealed to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam in the order of the revelation of the Quran was unun be patient with the command of your lord and don't be like the companion of the whale when he called out to Allah subhana wa tala as he was swallowed as he was swallowed so Subhan Allah the first message to the prophet s alhi wasallam the first time a nebi a prophet was mentioned to the prophet was unun because yunas had a unique experience what was it he gave up initially he walked away from his people before Allah gave him permission too that was something that only he did now no one no one should degrade or say that the prophet wasam is better than him in terms of belittling yunus or taking him down from the prophets why Allah chose him and made him from the righteous so his station at the end of the ordal was greater than how it started but he's the only Prophet that gave up on his people at some point and walked away from his people prematurely no one else and the first message to the prophet s was about the prophets was don't walk away prematurely from your people you don't know who your people are and what's going to come out of your people and so for Allah to send the prophet s alaihi wasallam someone like that in of all places where he just got the worst reception and the blood is still fresh from the wounds and any one of us would say forget these people crush them right make Dua against them for the rest of our lives Allah subh sends him a follower of unun and I'll give you one more narration insh then we'll move on to the next section of this uh it's a narration of and I think about this uh when when I go to Mecca when we go for Hajj or we go uh for may Allah subhana allow us to be amongst those who have accepted and it's a narration from it's an authentic narration he says that we were with the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam between mecah and Alina and we passed through a valley so the prophet sallallahu alai wasallam said what valley are we in right now they said we are in the valley of the Prophet sallam says who's the narrator he says that it's as if I'm looking at M and the prophet wasam described the length of his hair he said that he had his fingers in his ears and he was raising his voice he was raising his voice to Allah subh saying passing through this Valley what does that mean mam at some point in his life made a pilgrimage or to meah M made that pilgrimage there and showed the prophet a vision of passing that Valley saying the pure so that's number one then he continues then we went on Until We Came Upon another Valley so the prophet s wasallam said what valley is this so they said this is they said this is the valley of har or left another Valley the prophet sallam [Music] said he said s Al wasallam it's as if I can see on a red she camel and he's wearing this cloak of wool and he's holding the RS of his she camel and it is woven from the fiber of palm and he's passing through this Valley saying here I come oh Allah here I come here I come oh Allah here I come so the prophet Salli wasallam saw yunus or Allah showed the prophet s was a v a vision of that same Prophet who at some point walked away from his people and showed him a follower from uh that prophet and then showed him a vision sallallah alaihi wasallam of yunus proceeding to the same place that he was expelled from saying here I come oh Allah Here I Come And so there's a special connection that's established between the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and unun and it was the of Allah that the first follower that the prophet would see is from yunus then go back as well in Mecca when the prophet Salli wasallam went to said that the one who has come to you is who came to M the one who came to you is the angel that came to M so Allah is preparing the heart of the Prophet s alaihi wasallam and showing the prophet sallai wasallam that you are upon the way of the prophets before you both in terms of the message that you're delivering but also the process that you have to go through is similar to the process that all of those prophets uh had to go through and so the first fruit that the prophet s alaihi wasallam saw in the midst of his torture was and we don't know anything else about him except that he was a Christian who embraced the prophet Sall alaihi wasallam on the spot from nin in Iraq from Neva in Iraq from the land of eunus [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] thank you so much R Shir for sitting here with me today talk about many things that Hing we can explore together one being Judaism in relation to Zionism and vice versa what you've turned uh Israel's armed materialism then possible new for of allyship between Palestinians and Orthodox Jews and everything in between those things but perhaps we can start with this question which I know is one you've explored so thoroughly is this relationship or lack thereof between Judaism and Zionism and for you if I understand correctly um they are not only different but at odds yeah it's more than at odds they work as kind of a team actually in the sense that a disease works as a team with its cure Judaism is the disease and Zionism is the cure Zionism was designed to create a new type of Jew the reason they wanted to create a new type of Jew is because because the uh old zionists back in the day 1800s uh they looked at the Jews as disgusting they looked at the Jews as weak they looked at the Jews as cowardly unmanly was a word that they used often they basically absorbed the anti-semitic tropes of Jews and they believed it see a little history is in order over here Jews for thousands of years were religious uh people a monastic people we lived in what they called ghettos but about a thousand years ago the Jews themselves requested to be segregated because we are loyal citizens to the countries we live in but we have a mission in the world as a religious people it's not just merely a religion that you have to believe in God and then you're saved but rather it's a actual lifestyle and a job description that governs every facet of our lives and not only are there dos and don'ts but but there's actual uh a job that we have to do we study and we pray and we the more scholarship you have of God's Bible and the Torah then the higher level you are the closer you are to God and the the deeper your prayers are the higher you are and the closer you are to God and it's a it's a lifetime it's a lifetime uh program being a Jew and the reason why it's a lifetime program is because after the lifetime is over then we stand before God and however much we accomplished in this world that's how much we can retire with for billions and billions of years forever more that's Judaism in a Nell we're here in this world to prepare for the afterlife and if you ever prepared for a test you know that you shut the doors and you shut the phone and you just lock everybody out and you say come back to me in a couple of weeks when the test is is over we're also preparing for a test but takes our whole life so we had our our way of living Imagine by way of analogy I know shaol and monks on a Hilltop but without the martial arts you know instead there's biblical studies and that's the way Jews were now not everybody uh wanted that lifestyle but Jews were forced to have that lifestyle there was a old historian a Cambridge historian Sao Baron who had a very good line he said that the locks on the inside of the ghetto doors were there before the locks on the outside but there were people that wanted to get out but they weren't allowed to get out until then came the Enlightenment and the Emancipation and we had freedom of religion and freedom from religion and there were Jews that said who whoop we do now we could assimilate and be like everybody else and they tried to assimilate and instead of studying the Torah they wanted to be artists and they wanted to be writers and they wanted to be like everybody else um it didn't work though that was the problem it started in Russia in about 1881 there were programs and the anti-semitic programs attacks lethal attacks against Jews which included the assimilated Jews as well as the religious ones these guys figured that why would anybody attack us why would anybody hate us we're the same as the Russians we're the same as the ukrainians they that led to kind of an identity crisis amongst these assimilated Jews they didn't want to be Jews because they thought the Jews were disgusting um weak pathetic cowardly unmanly um not part of History uninterested in anything useful um but the non-jewish world will not let them be non-jews so what do they do there are various different answers um communism was one of the answers the idea of communism if you believe in it is everybody's going to be treated equal and then the Jews will also be treated equal one of the ideas was Zionism and that ended up the dominance one because at the end of middle of the 20th century um the Jews in Europe were pretty much W wiped out and um because Zionism took place in Palestine to a large extent they ended up the dominant Jewish movement because the others were just wiped off the face of the Earth Zionism believed that the Jews need to change that the reason why people don't like Jews is because the image of the Jew is still of that religious Jew of the disgusting Jew in addition there's something else uh hatable about Jews they don't have a country nationalism in those days was a very strong movement Empires were becoming nation states and the Jews don't have a state and the Jews aren't the people like other people now we weren't because we were religion but they figured look if we could change the Jews into a nationality we could be like everybody else that will have two important results result number one people will look at the Jews differently now you're normal because now you have your own land you have a language you have a culture you're not these weirdos and two more importantly it'll change the Jews themselves the aspirations will change they instead of wanting to finish volumes of the talmud they'll want to win Olympic gold medals they'll want to win euro vision song contests they'll want to be like everybody else they'll want a strong Army so the Zionist set out to create a nationality out of the Jews this was a very it was a daunting task because the Jews had no National characteristics because we were not a nationality we had no common land language or culture h there was no common land cuz for thousands of years the Jews were all over the world and there was nothing wrong with that absolutely nothing wrong with that that's what God wanted and that's where we were God is all over the world we could also be all over the world we had no language or culture because they were Jews in Ethiopia there are Jews in Morocco Yemen uh there are Jews in Syria there are Jews in Germany Spain Russia England these Jews have nothing cultural in common they had one thing in common their religion that's it but the Zionist said no land language culture we need it for the Jews we'll make the Jews a flag like old people have they made a flag that's what's today's Israeli flag which existed before Israel did will create a language so they sat down aen Yehuda his name was to create modern Hebrew a Biblical Hebrew or Rabin Hebrew is not really a speakable language there only few hundred uh root words um so he created an actual modern language modern Hebrew um a national anthem they created H they created uh a culture they had various different ideas about what the culture should be it should be right-wing leftwing fascist socialist and that those differences of opinion led to differences of political parties today in Israel um long story short the religious Jews were very much against this they considered it a form of idol worship it's an actual denial of jewi Jewish identity because Jewish identity is only religious uh for many many centuries the Jews understood the only thing that unites the Jewish people is the fact that God gave the Jews the Torah at Mount Si as the Bible says and that's the only common denominator that Jews have the definition of a Jew is somebody en joined by God to fulfill the Torah being a Jew is a job description the Zionist said no that will not do we will become a nationality and there was always this not tension it was it was worse than tension the zionists wanted to cure the Jews of the aspirations which were to be meek mild humble uh Priestly uh the Bible says the Jews areos a Priestly people you will become strong men Warriors especially Warriors Jews did not like Wars it was very much against our values um you you will become Warriors you'll become strong men you will stop with this cerebral um lifestyle and the studious Pious lifestyle you will be like the kacs you will be like the Germans you will be like the Russians exactly how exactly which country you'll be like in what culture okay there are different Zionist opinions about that and again that resulted in different Zionist political parties today um and that was Zionism designed to wipe out Jewish identity uh destroy it and replace it with Zionist identity very simple and that way the Jews would be normalized and everybody will and the Jews will be normalized will be normal in the eyes of the world they had educational centers they created history books that changed Jewish history that the Jewish aspirations all throughout history was not for a messiah to come and make a renewal of the world and the world become spiritual place no Jewish aspirations were always for National self-determination we were always looking to 2,000 years to come back to our land no we were looking for a Messianic renewal of the world for an esoy for God to come back and end of days no that's not what we were looking at for said the Zionist we were looking for return to our homeland and the the Holy Land Palestine Israel it is never our homeland a Homeland in English the word homeland doesn't say much about what a Homeland is but in other languages including Hebrew Homeland like in French La Patria Fatherland there's Mother Russia it's motherland his Fatherland in Hebrew moles the place you were born and there's a certain in nationalist philosophy a certain organic connection between a people and the place that where the people were born where the people were formed according to Judaism the Jewish people were created at Mount Si in the desert there was no country according to Zionism the Jewish people were created as Israel's Declaration of Independence says in Israel before Israel weren't real Jews Moses never went into Israel but Israel is where the Jews were created and Israel is therefore the Homeland for us it's a holy land Israel for the Zionist it's a Homeland change all the Jewish Concepts change everything from spirituality to politics or from spirituality to physicality from spirituality to materiality keep the names keep the the symbols yes the holy land is valuable to us but not because of the way the Jews think and Jews think it's holy no it's your what Russia is to the Russians and German is to the Germany is to the Germans Israel is to the Jews we wanted an es eschatology in End of Days spiritual spiritual renal of the world said the Zionist no we want National self-determination the Jews are a people only United by our religion by our God we Jews are brothers because we have one father God no it's not true Jews are brothers the same way the Russians of Brothers we are Nationals and that's it now that's why Zionism is opposed to Judaism and never mind the fact that the zionists violate the Jewish religion in all sorts of ways um the most blatant is that we're not allowed to have uh sovereignty over that land until the Messiah comes but set that aside for now the very definition of a Jew according to Zionist is different than the definition of a Jew according to Judaism when I say Jew and Benjamin nanyu says Jew it's only hins so if you want to know the definition of Zionism really the Zionist won't even tell you what the definition of Zionism is they'll every Zionist will tell you that whatever you say that's not really the definition definition is the right for the Jews to do the all Zionism instead of talking about the definition of Zionism it's better um to realize that every Zionism presupposing is two things thing number one the Jews are a nationality not just the religion thing number two Israel is the state of that nationality in the words of Israel's own website aan wrote an article there that says the following and Dani alone said the same thing uh the zionists say this Netanyahu wrote this kind of different language but same idea in one of his books what Japan is to the Japanese and France is to the French Israel is to the Jews okay and therefore by the way that's why Netanyahu and all of these guys say anti-zionism has to be anti-Semitism this is coming from Benjamin Netanyahu you cannot say I'm against the existence of the United States of America but I want an American identity you can't say I'm against the existence of France France and say I want a french identity so too you can't say I'm against the existence of Israel and want a Jewish identity without Israel it's like French without France it's like the Japanese without Japan now the whole thing is baloney because the Jews existed way before Israel did we exist now independent of Israel there was no connection between the existence of the Jews the identity of the Jews and the state of Israel yet the state of Israel wants to own Jewish identity to the point where Japan is to the Japanese what Israel is to the Jews that's Zionism it's the nationalization of Jewish identity okay it's not even Jewish nationalism it's more than that a Christian nationalism let's say would say that would agree that Christianity is a religion but it should rule the nation um white nationalism would agree that whites are whites but they should also be a nation Zionism doesn't say merely that being Jew is a religion but this religion should run a country the Jews are primarily a nationality they also had a religion like the Greeks had a religion they had they worshiped Zeus and I don't know what the Scandinavians had Odin the Jews had our God but the Jews are a nationality like Greeks are a nationality okay that's Zionism and that's a absolute eraser of Jewish identity now this idea of Zionism it causes a lot of problems for the Jews and for non-jews first thing is that I am a Jew by religion I'm a citizen of the United States of America my family's from Poland we've been there for hundreds of years is Israel my country there is United States of America my country well Israel has a nation state law 2018 that Israel is officially the nation state of the Jewish people remember Zionism means the Jews are nationality and Israel is the state of that nationality but I thought I'm an American and America is my country this was one of the biggest objections to Zionism from both religious and non-religious Jews in England when they had the ball declaration there was one Jewish member of the um cabinet his name was Edwin montigue he was against the bord Declaration he was against Zionism he said you're going to make Jews um strangers foreigners in their own countries he says you want to make a Jewish state that means that the Jews will be strangers in their own countries and indeed Netanyahu comes to America he did so when he he came to speak to Congress about Barack Obama's Iran deal which he wanted a squelch and he said I come here representing not only the people that elected me but I represent all Jews all over the world Netanyahu claims to be my prime minister na toi Bennett said after Barack Obama insulted nanyu he called him a coward using a nasty colloquialism that insulting Netanyahu is insulting all the Jews all over the world Netanyahu is not only the prime minister of Israel he's the prime minister of the Jews Jonathan Pard the Israeli spy that was convicted for spying on America he did his time he would move back to Israel he had not long ago said it was in all of Israel's papers he would advise Jews to spy on America for Israel according to Zionism Israel is my country when Israel says that Japan is to the Japanese what and France is to the French what Israel is to the Jews imagine there's two people in France a Jewish guy and a non-jewish guy Fran is to the French what israels to the Jews he doesn't mean the Israeli Jews he means the French Jews too so Fran is to the non-jewish Frenchmen what Israel is to the Jewish Frenchmen Zionism by definition is anti-Semitic therefore because it it makes Jew it's a it's a um dual loyalty Trope not only dual loyalty Trope it demands my loyalty it demands that it claims that it represents Me by its own law now mind you there is not a single country in the world like that there is no other country in the world that claims to be the state of people that are not its citizens never were its citizens don't live there never did live there I have a right by international law to change my nationality if I don't like my President Joe Biden I can move to Mexico and then Mexico is my nation states if they'll have me but no matter where I run what country I live in Benjamin who claims to be my prime minister because I was born Jewish that sounds like a dictatorship not a democracy to me you know they may give people equal rights over there but if I can't escape from that that being my nation state doesn't sound like a democracy to me there is no other country in the world like that now we need to understand this Israel is different than all other countries in the world all other countries in the world are the countries of its citizens Israel is not the country of its citizens by Israeli law Israel is the country of the Jews meaning if you are an Israeli citizen but you're not Jewish Israel is not your country by that I mean Israeli law says you have no self-determination rights in Israel unless you're Jewish so if this is the country of the Jews and the non-jews are there yes they're there with equal civil rights they are citizens but Israel is not their country Israel could never allow non-jewish people to run the country has to be a Jewish majority now more than that by Israeli law remember I said that the Jews are a nation and Israel is a state by Israeli law there was no such thing as an Israeli nationality Israel census uh it has various different categories for people there's religion and there's nationality and citizenship nationality is Jewish nationality is Arab nationality is Jews citizen Israeli Israel is the country not of its citizens Israel is the country of a nationality now you have to understand how Israel looks at themselves and if we understand this we'll understand a lot of things about why Israel behaves in many ways that they do and why they look at themselves in certain ways as opposed to the rest of the world looking them at them in other ways there are people who have said that Israel is a racist State because it favors Jews okay is turkey a racist State because it favors Turks over people who are not Turks I'm talking about Turkish citizens well obviously not countries are there to serve their people Turks turkey is there to serve the Turkish citizens France is to there to serve the French citizens but Israel is to serve the Jewish Nation they look at all the Jews as other countries look at the citizens of those countries it is the country of the Jews it was made to be to be the country of the Jews now you're going to tell me well okay but every other country you can become a citizen of that country regardless of your nationality well you can convert to Judaism and then you are officially an Israeli National which is weird because even though Israel claims Zionism claims that being a Jew is not a religion it's a nationality if you go through a religious conversion not a naturalization process you go to a rabbi in Belgium and you go through religious conversion maybe anti-zionist rabbis rabbis that don't recognize Israel if you are a Jew by religion you are now a Jew by nationality and by the way that doesn't apply to all Jews by Israeli law even if you're an atheist obviously you you're a Jew and you're entitled to the law of return because has nothing to do with religion although it's kind of contradictory to the fact that if you become if you convert with a religious conversion now you're Jewish National however according to Israeli law if you're born Jewish and you believe in another religion other than Judaism you believe Jesus is the Messiah you believe Muhammad's the prophet you're not a Jew you you believe in no God then you are a Jew you believe God's a trinity no Jew there was a case of a Jew that was born uh Jewish his name was Daniel refusion polish guy he later converted to Christianity he was no anti-semite he helped Jews Escape in World War II because of his status um and after World War II 1948 he like when Israel was formed he wanted to move to Israel and become a citizen on the law of return Israel Supreme Court ruled no he's not Jewish he's Christian but wait if an if a Jew could be an atheist why can't the Jew be a Christian imagine this this brother Daniel that's what was a commite monk if he would say all right I don't believe in Jesus anymore I don't believe in anything anymore I'm an atheist oh now you're Jewish now you can come I'm Christan you're Christian you're no good okay fine I don't believe in Christianity anymore I'm an atheist oh now you're an atheist come to Israel now you're Jewish now you're none of this makes any sense and the reason it does doesn't make any sense is because Israel tried to create something that doesn't exist they tried to create added the Jews a nationality had they wanted to create a new nationality they were pseudo kind of zionists that did want to create a totally new nationality have nothing to do with the Jews they were called cananim never never got off the ground that would be one thing it was a valid idea it was also a fiction but they had no nobody to buy into it nobody what they did was they tried to Gaslight the Jews and change the Jews and re-educate the Jews to look at themselves differently as a nationality rather than a religion the problem is the Jews for thousands of years have been very very solid in their identity that they're nationality and that they are a religion they have no National characteristics and this whole idea that well if you're a Jew anywhere uh you could come to Israel what's the definition of a Jew Israel has never defined what a Jew is Israel claims to be a Jewish State the Jewish State what's a Jew" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="l'ennesima scalinata salita da [Applauso] Doković la seconda semifinale del Rolanga Rossa 2025 il numero 1 del mondo Jannick Sinner contro il tre volte campione di Parigi titolare di 24 slam e di un'altra serie infinita di primati nel tennis Novak Dokovic la loro nona sfida il bilancio dice quattro vittorie a testa però ci sono un po' di postille da mettere a questa rivalità che è cominciata nel 2021 è la seconda volta soltanto che i Sinder Jokovicć si sfidano sulla terra battuta il loro primo incontro era stato a Montecarlo al Country Club nel 2021 con Sinera ancora in formazione e una vittoria piuttosto semplice da parte di Doković tutte le loro sfide successive si sono giocate sul duro che fosse cemento all'aperto o sintetico indoor un bel vento e non è facile giocare quest'oggi sbaglia ancora dal lato del dritto Sinner e credo che stia proprio facendo riferimento al vento doković cerca ancora il dritto di Sinner doković tiene la battuta tiene la battuta S o pari è anche scivolato Sinner dopo aver giocato la controsmorzata vediamo se ha preparato tatticamente questa soluzione per Doković lei farà le palle corte anche per insomma muovere il suo avversario e e creargli qualche fastidio negli spostamenti questa non era la scelta corretta in diagonale ancora una smorzata da parte di Doković che fa il pollice in su al recupero questa volta vincente di Simner eh sì ha giocato una palla corta e poi è stato un po' lì in mezzo al campo e Sinara ha potuto vedere spazio in diagonale e ha giocato in maniera perfetta da quel lato tiner ci arriva ma ha fatto un giro troppo lungo perde le proporzioni del campo ancora una smorzata per Dokovic poi più attento a fare il pallonetto successivo beh d'altronde sul ritmo da fondo è nettamente superiore Sinner quindi deve chiamarlo avanti deve chiamarlo in una zona dove lui si sente meno meno comodo servizio al corpo può parare la palla niente più Doković 30-0 no no male eseguita questa smorzata incrociata e Sinera la chance del 5-2 e l'ha seguita male anche perché ciè arrivato malissimo in ritardo e non è la prima volta che succede siamo sette smorzate di cui sei di rovescio solo due punti ottenuti che bravo Sinner difesa clamorosa da parte di Sinner doković in difficoltà con lo smash non lo scopriamo sicuramente questa sera era difficile per tutti non soltanto per lui sì anche in queste condizioni non è facile con la palla che si sposta ma che difesa di Sinner sì la smozzata di Joković è alta invitante Sinnerva e chiude e sceglie di chiudere incrociato anche se Gokovi c'era da quella parte cercando la violenza la potenza però Doković adesso aspetta prima di utilizzare questa soluzione ha capito e avverte dall'altra parte del campo dell'incertezza della tensione però ha alzato il volume con il dritto Doković in questo scambio quindi ci pari abbiamo raccontato tante volte di come Doković si sia messo a lavorare su ogni singolo [Applauso] colpo pazzo come si è tolto dalla palla sinner la risposta mirata ai piedi bravissimo 30-0 cioè i riflessi incredibili S ma ci lavora e tante volte lo vediamo mentre si riscalda lavorare sulla coordinazione e basta il primo set point a Jan Xer la differenza tra i due in questo momento è notevole bravissimo Sinner mantiene il controllo delle operazioni trova la via della rete a Doković non si alza il lob 4030 gli ha tagliato le gambe alla fine sembrava proprio non riuscire a arrivare più sulla palla doković una palla destra una palla a sinistra ritmo alto grande profondità oh che ci arriva no incredibile e chiude Doković che punto che punto hanno giocato fantastico eh sì ancora una volta cerca la smorzata per uscire da quella pressione Doković insomma sul tocco alla fine l'ha vinta [Applauso] lui però smash di rimbalzo che per Dokovic vale 10 lode per come l'ha giocato e poi Joel Fritzongas apprezza giocato un gran punto Dokovic che poi come al solito ingaggia una sfida anche con chi a suo dire lo ha disturbato salva la palla Break sì però che gran punto ha lasciato andare i colpi ancora una volta il lungolinea di [Musica] dritto e buona applaude anche Doković mamma mia come se n'è uscito da questo scambio durissimo sinner alta di diritto nel campo aperto Dokovic che ha salvato la prima palla break e si prende questo quinto game mane corto il colpo di Dokovič ne approfitta subito Senner a segno [Musica] 15-30 e se ne va il dritto di Dokovic arriva quindi il break in un punto che può essere di importanza capitale per questo incontro dokovic un mostro in difesa ma ancora meglio Sinner che chiude con questa splendida volè smorzata 30-0 sì ha dovuto fare il punto tre volte [Musica] di la insomma lezione di gioco da fondo campo gran servizio eh di [Applauso] Joković questa attenta a non rallentare troppo Sinner e Doković si prende dei rischi 15-30 e si ferma in rete il dritto di Sinner giocato un game passivo solo con la seconda di servizio e per la prima volta nell'incontro subisce il break cinque pari ancora riga esterna il dritto splendido di Dokovic e gioca con la gran risposta di rovescio Sinner ancora palla break [Musica] bravo lo schiaffo di dritto janni Sinner riesce a portare dalla sua parte questo game che per lui si era messo davvero male doković si è fatto massaggiare la coscia sinistra ace di seconda questo è il numero uno del mondo 30 pari ace di seconda ancora ancora Ace traiettoria Slice da destra vincente altro set point Sinner un'altra prima di servizio 203 kmh jannixtiner vince anche il secondo set di questa seconda semifinale de Rolang Gaross vediamo il fisioterapista alle prese con la gamba sinistra di Doković che ha chiesto 3 minuti di medical time out protegge la rete Jokovic av punto difficoltà nella risposta si è dovuto arrangiare lasciato spazio libero al giocatore serbo che si aggiudica il turno di battuta conduce 2-1 è l'ennesima scivolata di Sinner ma Doković non ne approfitta e si infuria oh incredibile ha scavato la palla da sottoterra Doković però Sinner aveva l'opportunità di chiudere al volo e non l'ha [Applauso] fatto eccolo qua ancora una volta 30 pari ace esterno sul 30 pari che fenomeno sì sì fenomeno fenomeno fenomeno einera arriva ma il campo rimasto sguarnito palla break Dokovic ci credo entro questa è lunga un gancio cielo di Novak Dokovic per rimanere nello scambio [Musica] non ce la fa a tirare sul passante di diritto [Applauso] sinnerovic sostenuto in primis dalla famiglia rimane in campo devastante il forcing di Sinner si deve arrendere Dokovic quattro giochi pari [Musica] eh eh bravo a segno Sinner con un diagonale che lascia fermo [Musica] Dokovic incredibile sì però Sinner ce l'ha avuta la possibilità di mettere le mani su questo scambio non se l'è sentita e il coraggio lo mette Doković larga però deve scendere Dum che è vicina quanto vicina m [Musica] è molto vicina ma c'è spazio ci sono due segni vicini e secondo me Doković sta osservando quello sbagliato sì due marche dice Doković [Applauso] preso in contropiede Dokovic perde l'attimo e allora Sinnerva che fatica però tre set point cancellati poi con Leis il quarto messo a segno da Dokovic il secondo del set serbotti il servizio dovuto frenare la sua corsa verso l'avanti Sinner e poi a segno con il diritto [Musica] 40-30 la resistenza ironica di Dokovic ma va a segno Sinner 2-0 che disastro che disastro persa di vista completamente è finita nelle luci artificiali se ne va la risposta di Doković questo è un bel regalo non come lo smash ma a mezza rete il rovescio di Dokovic un altro regalo colossale al tennis italiano da parte di Jannick Sinner 64 756 si guadagna la prima finale al Rolanga Ross e non ci arrivava un giocatore italiano dal 1976 quando trionfò Adriano Panata e sarà quindi per la prima volta Sinner al Carazze una finale slam incredibile questa partita secondo me importantissima e per per Sinne perché è stata molto equilibrata tanti punti importanti giocati ha sempre risposto bene come nel tiebreak quindi veramente eccezionale questa vittoria con un Jokovic sorprendente" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] you know the conflict in Gaza is a conflict that has generated uh different reactions and this is to be understood we saw this in the early years of the nakba in 1948 we saw this in 1967 in yum kipur we saw this in 1973 we saw these kinds of reactions in the intifada and uh I note that there have been quite a number of reactions since I made my position known on the ongoing conflict in Gaza first of all is always good to preface a response to reactions with the caveat that nobody has a monopoly of knowledge nobody has a monopoly of wisdom that what one does is to share one's perspective with the others in the hope that that enriches the debate I see uh a number of comments about the Bala declaration and it must be remembered that the Bala declarations was a series of uh events uh culminate beginning as it were in 1917 and there were also similar declarations in 1948 that uh were an offsho of that declaration and I can't agree more with those who say that because of the disease at that time in 1917 initially and 1948 culminating in the creation of what was fundamentally a Jewish State and the failure of the world at that time to create a Palestinian state that that in many ways has been the Genesis of the conflict so that the Israelis have always been seen by the Palestinians and the Arab neighbors as an occupying force and many of the wars that have been fought have been on the basis that we are dealing with Israel which is a Zionist regime which is an occupying force and it is in that context that all these attempts that have been made through successive administrations whether it's yakin whether it's manim be and a little earlier even during the reign of of of the administration of game and of course during the Netanyahu periods and we saw that all these particular problems have gained the attention of the world culminating much more prominently in the oso Accords and the oso Accords were designed to resolve the problem for all times by creating two states but that was never to be we ended up with a Palestinian Authority and that Palestinian Authority also had its own problems leading in the bitter fight between the Hamas and and fata and with Hamas occupying Gaza so when we say that the conflict has brought about many nonstate actors such as Hamas Hezbollah and all these others we are actually admitting that this is the time that the world should come and say with no equivocation that if we are to resolve the problem in the Middle East we must have a two-state solution a two-state solution whose fundamental anchor is that Israel exists and is recognized as such that Palestine is recognize as such and they exist side by side subject to international law as to whether that will immunize the region from the conflicts that we continue to see and including the Gaza war is one that is out for debate but what has happened and continues to happen in Gaza is creating enmity which will be difficult to eliminate for Generations to come the other concern that I've seen or response is the question of what has been described as white supremacy you know there are those who argue that those who occupy and control Israel are not Jews in the strict sense that these are white supremacists who are hiding behind the cloak of jewishness in order to visit pain upon the Palestinians in fact I've heard even in the continent of Africa some arguing that the Israelis who are of Caucasian origin are racists and they have given the example of how they treat the ethiop Ian Jews who are brought to Israel under the operation Moses there is Merit in that but I think that the question that we ought to preoccupy ourselves with at this time is how to eliminate conflict in the long run and the way to eliminate conflict as we have said times without number is to find a lasting solution the danger is is that we now see a world that is divided particularly at the political level uh in the western world everybody almost to a man that is to mean politician is reluctant to condemn the Israeli response to the activities on the 7th day of October the year 20203 and those who argue therefore because of the European support the Israelis are thus encouraged and there are those who on the other side are saying that it is important that the organizations such as Hamas Hezbollah and we have now seen the hes ought to be reigned in as a condition precedent to any lasting peace it is an egg and chicken kind of situation what do you deal with the International Community through the un have now said that there is need for a pose or a ceasefire which will enable the world to look at these issues squarely in the face and find a long-term solution whether that is going to happen is another debate we now see within Israel herself that there are centrifugal forces which say that President prime minister Netanyahu must find a different approach to the war in Gaza because the Israeli military thought that it would be a quick fix but is now appearing that it is for the long ha so my own view is The Sooner Europe and America encourage the Israelis to seize fire with a reciprocal understanding that hamash and other non-state actors such as Hezbollah and the Hues will also seize fire so that the world can engage in a constructive way the safer it is because the whole world is affected by this War I see here for example of a comment from my friend Douglas moama and Douglas says unfortunately the Hamas has used all his time and energy to radicalize all gazans to hate their longtime neighbors Israel completely true in fact it is now argued uh that every other person in Gaza is being told you have a perent enemy in Israel and and this is bound to happen when somebody loses their family in a bombardment then the only reason why they continue to leave is for revenge and and this is one of the reasons why the sooner this war is brought to a halt the safer everybody is and and and can't agree more with Douglas moama who takes this view that there is radicalization and it's not only within Gaza you can see it even in in Lebanon by heah you can see it even from the rhetoric that one sees coming out of yeni through the huis so we are living in quite difficult times particularly as regard this war and one must comment that is a war that affects all of us because when you interfere with shipping in uh in the Gulf of Aiden and in the Red Sea then everybody suffers Joseph also Joseph hudo have you asked why Israel has blocked two State solution if stateless Palestine can hurch October 7th then what could happen with the State security is Israel's prime fear they are an existential threat secondly how do you expect Israel to defend itself against rockets launched from hostiles un facilities presidential homes please give an example of how to make the war proportionate a very very valid question from Joseph there because it is very easy to say that this war is not proportionate the response is not proportionate and we have had I'm answering this question by Joseph at a time when the icj has pronounced itself on the representation made by the South Africans asking Israel to ensure that genocidal acts are not carried out effectively just stopping short of saying we need a ceasefire but I hold the view which view is capable of inter being interrogated that you are safer dealing with a state which is recognized under international law which is obligated to act in a responsible manner if you don't have a state and is not a state within the understanding of or within the meaning of international law then it allows organizations such as Hamas to exist it allows organizations such as alasan Brigade it allows organizations such as Hezbollah it allows other organization to operate outside of international law and when they operate outside of international law in my view they are greater threat to Israel because the weapons that they acquire are acquired in an irregular Manner and you do not know but if it was a Palestinian state which is recognized as such which acquires arms in a regular way then they would be under obligation to behave properly then they would not use human beings are shield they would not use civilian facilities for purposes of military reaction So to that extent you are safer with a state which is recognized as such which exists and which is obligated to respect international law that is not to say that a state within the meaning of international law does not occas does not threaten Israel but then it is easier to deal with it because you and me know that states are involved D in Conflict not withstanding that they are obligated to act otherwise internationally once again we are not engaged or involved in any mathematics so as to know that this is proportionate and this is not proportionate but if you look at the rhetoric of the military officers in Israel or the politicians in Israel they have said we are going to fight a war like no other War so that Hamas will never operate we are going to ensure that Gaza is not habitable and that is not proportionality not easy to argue in favor of and it's easy from the comfort of our armchairs to argue the way we are arguing but is not easy for those who are actually in the theater and the arena of War you and me can afford the luxury of intellectual and cool analysis but yet the realities on the ground do not lend themselves to the kind of cool analysis in which we are engaged a man who calls himself Curious George and and and let me speak to your curiosity super Curious George most of these mistakes makes sense but the point about non-state actors going after civilian Target is scar make me question the logic why can a state actor deem a Target necessary for its own political gain but a non-state actor which in some of these places and be acting on behalf of their people cannot go after targets it deems threat either countries abide by international law or they don't you know the world has known pain and let us understand after 1945 war the so-called World War II the very reason why the genocide uh genocide became the focus of International Community and we had a treaty on on genocide in 1948 with Israel being the first signatory was out of what was visited upon the Israelis by the German Administration is now accepted the nearly 6 billion Jews were targeted because of their race they were targeted because of their religion and then the world said we must never allow this to happen again no more genocide and we even said in Geneva in 1949 we even said even when we conduct War as human beings somehow accept that war will always exist we then obligated combatants that even in circumstances when Wars are being persecuted there are certain things that must not be done this is the basis of the for Geneva conventions of 1949 but even after that we have seen genocide or genocidal activity activities we've seen that in Sabia we have seen that in in places like Rwanda which tells you that both state and non-state actors tend to conduct themselves in a manner that is inimical to the prescriptions and the injunctions that are placed upon them by law and this in itself is is a sad thing and that is why we have international institutions which punish such individuals we've SE we saw that with slobot and milosovic after the Bosnia war and we have seen that the very reason why you created the international court of justice and international criminal court is to ensure that those who do not conduct themselves in a manner that is in keeping with the law will be punished in accordance with the law and we have these permanent institutions because prior to that you had ad hoc trials such as the nurenberg trials such as the Tokyo tribunals such as sier Leon such as Rwanda but we now know better that these institutions to the extent that is humanly possible are going to do that once again always easy to argue in the manner that we do but yet the reality is that it is not easy I I see here this is a very interesting argument by Samuel Zion was made by the Ashkenazi which are from Russia Ukraine Romania Hungary Czech and Australia there is in this that the ashkanazi actually are the dominant but the sheerin those who came from Morocco and Northern Africa really Israel became a home for all Jews it is very easy to try and divide the state of Israel as it is now but the reality is that we are dealing with a state that is recognized as such and which is under existential threat in that part of the world but what we are telling the Israeli that there is a solution to this that solution is to State you cannot in the nature of things having suffered in the manner that you did under the Holocaust having been dispersed all over the world deny another population a right that you yourself are benefiting from this is what we are saying and the world will be safer that way and and and that I think is what the world is telling Israel yeah Julie oo I am very happy uh you support My Views and and I and I think there is a reason why uh there is Merit in holding the views that we do because all that we desire is to live in a peaceful environment all that we have appetite for for the continent of uh Asia and the Middle East and Africa and indeed is to ensure that we live in an environment that is favorable to all and this must be understood in the context of the reality in the world that if there is a war anywhere it affects all of us who for example knew that because there is war in the Gaza there would emerge a h threat that would entail the disruption of Maritime activity in the Red Sea in the Gulf of Aiden in the Gulf of Oman and and therefore affect the supply of oil in the world so all of us really have a duty to ensure that there is Security in the world somebody is saying a very interesting I have an idea to end all wars how about we elect an international president who all leaders of the world have to answer to the world is now you know I believe that we have contri utions to make there was a time when I believed and I still haven't abandoned this belief that the occupation of political office gives one a platform to really put into practice what one is saying but we must remember that we live in a world where the best intention of men are and women are not necessarily the ones that appeal to the electorate the electorate is moved by different consideration particularly in Africa the electorate is moved by money the electorate is moved by ethnicity and in as much as one would want to be in such a position one finds oneself in a position where what one can do is to contribute informally and it is never lost on me personally that some of the people that are most attracted to were never occupants of any political office I'm attracted to the IDE years of mandas Karam Chand Gandhi known as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr and they became moral forces in the world because it is much more difficult to become a person who is a moral Warrior than to be a person who is a political Warrior who is beholden to many interests but never say never you never know which Voice May call and which voice one may answer answer to in order to play a much more visible role in the Affairs of the world that is Hilo who only hides behind the mask 09 a z but the mask is peeled you know the question of the war in Gaza is one that is alive and well it continues to generate reactions and questions and in reaction to my sentiment my sentiment there are hundreds of questions that have come about raising pertinent issues is two State solution the solution how do we deal with non-state actors what is the nature of the state of Israel what is the nature of Palestine what is the role of the international Community what should the international court of justice do in the face of the representation by South Africa too many questions to answer but it sends the clear message that the world is concerned that people are concerned and that people want a solution to the problem we will not answer all questions but we must continue the debate we must continue to talk about these issues because the day we stop talking about them that is when danger comes in and solutions die so thank you very much for your comments those which are interrogative those which are commendatory and those which outrightly disagree the beauty of any debate is that when we disagree even then we disagree in an agreeable manner thank [Music] you" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="when looking at the difference of fee only are feebased advisors that you would hope somebody looked at what would it be I don't want to do what I know deep down inside is not right for the client it's messed up that's why sometimes I think our industry does get a bad rap and rightfully so it's crazy can it be that high oh yeah and most people don't even know that that because that's the thing it doesn't have to be transparent [Music] All right here we are welcome to New Space what do you think Robert i love it man the team did a They did a great job with all of this so I'm I'm excited to be here well you want to kick us off i do uh like Lynn said welcome to GDS Unplugged the financial team that talks about financial topics that most advisors don't want to touch and today's topic we're going to dive in to the difference between feebased advisors and fee only fiduciary advisors and I I look forward to that topic because I know that there's so there's so much controversy people don't understand because most advisors try to make them seem similar when they're not so Glenn I'd love for you to just take it away and tell us what are the main differences between feebased advisors and fee only advisors there's a million differences but I would I would start from the compensation aspect right if you're a feebased advisor chances are you're getting compensated not only from your clients potentially that quarterly fee but in addition to that you can do proprietary products you can do commission products there's a million ways that you could get paid that the client may or may not even know fee only advisor the only way you're getting compensated is from that client quarterly fee or monthly fee however it's set up but there's no additional compensation whether it's commission propritor product there's nothing going on so it's a little bit more transparent that's from a from a high level well so well back up on that so you talked about uh proprietary products and other fees can you dive a little bit deeper than that what do you mean why would a proprietary product even even matter in this topic of feebased it it generates more revenue right a lot of firms out there they have a ton of proprietary products i'm not going to specifically for now mention a bunch of them but uh we were at a couple of them in the last 20 years and as you know a lot of them have proprietary products or they have ways that they can generate more revenue for the firm or for um the individual um firms may have something called paytoplay which is exactly what it sounds like right the that product has to pay the back office money just to be on our platform when you see these financial advisors take these extravagant work trips for they call them recognition trips right why is that and who's paying for that well the the the products that they're paying six figures seven figures just to have access to the financial advisors and whoever sells more of those products they win these recognition trips and it's just a little bit it's uh I think it's a little slimy if you ask me well why are you getting paid from a third party when your loyalty should be just um just to the client that's that's paying making your living paying your mortgage so okay thank you because I I want to make sure I understand this so you're saying not only in a feebased scenario whether it's proprietary or not can the firm make more money but also the adviser pitching it can make more money is that correct that's right that's right how how can that be why is that even Why is that even legal there's a lot of things that are legal it's a gray area right we when you're uh they're held to different standards when you're feebased you're held to a suitability standard when you're fee only as are we currently and have been for a long time you're held to a fiduciary standard completely different it's it's how you're held accountable uh I I we as we do this podcast we can give you examples but I actually looked up the exact the exact uh definition of it just for our for our listeners out there so suitability standard that is your feebased advisor if you have an adviser that you work with that works at a a mers uh JP Morgan Edward Jones they're pro they're they are a feebased adviser or they're offering you commission products one or the other they are not a fee only adviser so if they're a feebased advisor then they are su they they are held to what's called a suitability standard and I'll I'll read you the following notice there's nothing about a fiduciary right right requirements advisor must have a reasonable basis for the recommendations but they are not required to recommend the best or most cost-effective option what does that mean there if you're working with an adviser on a suitability standard there could be two products that are that are are identical but one the fees maybe are two times it or three times what they need to be they are permitted to sell that product right and and who's paying that fee the client the consumer e even if a lower cost option exists they can do that in ter of in terms of ongoing monitoring if you're a feebased adviser there there is no requirement for ongoing monitoring of investments after the initial recommendation unless in a new transaction occurs that's crazy so they recommend something may or may not make sense could have been the most expensive thing on the planet and now they have no obligation to stay on top of it that's crazy in terms of a fiduciary standard completely different what the definition of that is advisor is bound by the fiduciary standard must act in the client's best interest ensuring that every recommendation prioritize a client's financial well-being over personal gain uh requirement fiduciary adviserss must seek the best possible outcome for their clients fully disclose fees potential conflict of interest and any incentives that could influence their guidance in terms of ongoing monitoring if you're working with a financial adviser who's a fiduciary a fee only fiduciary uh fiduciaries are required to provide ongoing management and oversight of investment strategies and ensuring that they continue to meet the client needs over time so it's two different completely standards so that brings a question to mind when we start talking about different financial firms wealth management firms banks institutions to me while you're reading it's it it seems like a no-brainer that I want a fee only fiduciary me personally and I would think the majority of people do but with that said why do most firms wealth management institutions banks pitch feebased or more transactional stuff and not fee only I think they they're they're driven by the revenue you know so two-part question why why are firms offering that because it generates more revenue for the firm and the adviser why are clients going with that I don't know why when somebody purchases a vehicle they get different prices they maybe they didn't do due diligence they didn't get it through the Costco program or they didn't they didn't do enough research um for us it's been as you know I've been doing this 20 years and and you're you're you're right behind me it's been a progress it's been a evolution in the 20 years I've been doing this i started as a feebased adviser quite frankly the way business is done today wasn't even available to me 20 years ago but things have evolved there's more technology people uh expect more out of a financial advisor i started my career with Lehman Brothers then went to AG Edwards i loved Ag Edwards i didn't want to work for a bank um I wanted to work for a firm that that allowed us to do what's best for the client which I felt A edwards was unfortunately they got acquired by Wakovia which was acquired by Wells Fargo um and a lot of acquiring it was it was so left Wells Fargo to not be with a a firm that's owned by a bank um went to Merryill Mel Lynch they were called at the time now they're Merryill loved it for a few years and unfortunately they got acquired by Bank of America i was there for 11 years again they they have a feebased model and I remember there's a couple things that kind of are wake up wakeup calls for me um my son who's who's a junior in high school now of course as you know I have a daughter at UT Austin and a son in high school and my son when when he was I don't know fourth grade uh he brought home a yearbook one year where he wanted to be a financial adviser he held it up that he wanted to do that that and a professional tennis player and for me that was like a punch in the gut you know that's a realization i love this industry i love our clients yet now I'm being pressured to do things that I don't feel comfortable so again I'm not doing them but now our compensation as a team's getting hit i'm being frowned upon by management because I'm not doing things that candidly I don't think are ethical right i didn't become a financial adviser to pedal credit cards to pedal lending to pedal propritor products i I half joke half serious say that you know I I want to do this job forever but I don't want to go to hell i don't want to do what I know deep down inside is not right for the client um and that was a wakeup call to to be at an institution that I would want who knows what my kids will do when they're older but if they were to work with me I would want them to be in an environment that I could be proud of and that's why in 2017 we departed um look for a firm that's not uh owned by a bank in fact Raymond James owns a bank and Raymond James for those of you who don't know that's our custodian holds our clients money they're not owned by a bank they uh own a bank raymond James Financial and the beautiful thing is we have no proprietary products we have no commissions we're able to do things at the highest level that I think any financial adviser on the planet can do i want to back up just a little bit because you talked about you talked about your kids you talked about your wife and I and I I do have had the privilege of getting to know your beautiful wife Jacella and Lucas your son and Natalia and watching them grow and I remember back in the day when we were at Mel looking to make that move and going from feebased to fee only that there was a there was something tugging on your heartstrings and I know I know the uh the story but I I'd love you to talk a little bit and tell our audience about how your family played an impact of just being able to to rest well at night knowing that you were doing the right thing and how they helped guide you to get here it's as you know in many many in many business it's a family affair even from when my kids were little it'll help me uh uh get stamps on envelopes to whether we're doing seminars or whatnot to continue to go to practice and we've always approached this business as how do we give back to others i have two amazing parents who have dedicated their life to serving others as missionaries and um obviously I'm not a missionary but I'm trying to find my own way of how do we ethically serve others and add value to to people's lives and again at the end of the day uh we life life is is is about time and I want to make sure that my time is invested on on adding value to other people's lives and not just worried about uh me or the firm or our pocketbook like how do we add value um to others as you know I I like to say I try to live for my eulogy and not my resume yeah at the end of the day that's that's much more important to me is is what's going to be said at my eulogy than than um than what what an institution that I work for thinks about me i've always loved that thank you for sharing it i I also want to touch on something you said it's a little bit off topic but you talked about Raymond James moving from Raymond James and Raymond James being the custodian can you describe what I don't think a lot of people know what custodian truly means custodian is where the assets are held right some uh some places they could have their assets the adviser could have those assets in their name we use Raymond James they're they're very uh Fortune 500 company 148 quarters of profitability in a row you might think why does that matter 148 quarters why do I care if the institution where my money's at profitable well remember of 2008 right a lot of firms got a bailout um that's that's not fun for the client nor for the adviser so we wanted to be at a firm that allows us the flexibility to run a practice like we want but at the same time is there to to help us serve clients whether they have a million dollars or north of $100 million where they need access to uh PE or or different investment research we we want to be able to to offer everything we can well let's go down that rabbit hole too because I remember when we were at Meil Lynch we were looking to make a change it wasn't just that we decided let's go to Raymond James there was a thought process we interviewed some of the top five firm what we would consider to be the top five firms out there and maybe you can dive a little deeper into why we picked Raymond James um when we could have picked any firm all the firms offered to open us an office here but we picked Raymond James for a specific reason that I think dives into the topics today i think what's important for us is some of these firms out there in the industry and again I know that's part of the podcast is we're going to dive into some things that clients might not know right some some firms out there might uh incentivize a financial adviser to go to their practice and and write them a check um for us that that wasn't a motivator we weren't going somewhere to make a quick buck we wanted to be somewhere that we could view ourselves a part of that culture a part of that firm for for many years to come um and we wanted to be somewhere going back to feon some of these firms you cannot be a fee only right if I'm at a some of the firms already mentioned a Merrill uh UBS Edward Jones JP Moran you're not a fee only and and that was not only important from a standpoint of trying to do what's best for the client but also we we wanted to expand who we're working with we're working with the NFL in order for me to continue i'm an NFLPA as you know which stands for National Football League Personal Adviser i thought it was personal assistant that's what my daughter calls it national Football League probably right sometimes but as a National Football League personal adviser you have to be a fee only fiduciary to be on the the page where the the players can see and look you up if they were trying to find a local adviser wow i think because they don't want their players to be on 30 for30 right not that it guarantees you that your financial advisor is uh doing everything perfect but it's at least one more layer of um vetting vetting that's a good way to put it yeah so can you think of a reason or or maybe name me some of the top reasons that an average person might pick a feebased advisor over a fee only advisor might be a trick question i don't know honestly I I I mean maybe somebody out there can i always think of my our clients in terms of what would I want for my mother my father my brother my sister would I want my family member I to work with a financial adviser who's feebased or fee only somebody that's always a fiduciary i can't think of a reason why I would want my mother to work with somebody who who could sell them commissionable products who could sell them proper products and I'm sure a lot of uh good adviserss are feebased and they're what they would probably say is yeah but we don't do that right we don't sell propritor products we don't sell commissionable products well if that's the case why don't you drop your series 7 your series 6 right why don't you drop your ability to do those things if you feel that strongly about it why don't they because you don't want to you want to keep your you want to retain your ability to do those eventually at some point so why would you have a tool if you were never going to use it that's right so you had a series 7 we did and that's why we dropped them yep yeah and why did we do that because we we wanted to put our stake in the ground and not just pretend that we're we're words in using words to pretend we're being true fiduciaries there's no need if you are truly not going to sell commissionable products propritor products get paid from third party in any way there's no reason to to keep those licenses right it it's almost like in anything we do in life if you're in go all in don't have a foot out the door absolutely right because then that's your escape goat that's your excuse and I think people respect that right i think hopefully it comes through people know that we're all about the client well I know I know with us that was a because I remember studying for the series 7 tough test um but when we talked about doing it we're like if we're in we're all in if we're going to be fee only fiduciaries and truly serve our clients then you got to go all in and there's there's no backing out% 100% a as we wrap up if there was one takeaway when looking at the difference of fee only or feebased advisors that you would hope somebody looked at what would it be i'll I'll give you two takeaways one is figure out which which they are right are they feebased fee only and then make sure you're comfortable with that not it's not only enough to figure out what they are but are you comfortable with the fact that they could sell you something at some point that is identical to another product but your fees are 200% of what they need to be are you comfortable with that are there ways to tell though just by looking at the investments some people might say &quot;I'm I'm I'm fee only i'm fee based or whatever.&quot; And it it's it's the same but how can you tell if if they're being honest for sure i mean you can look into mutual funds you can look if there's a commission you can look if there's trails trails are way that the the investments you have they're giving a kickback so you can do a deep dive into the investments and and figure it out you know they sell me some annuity with a 10-year clause and um you know you're paying 400 basis points a year if you're fee only fiduciary you're not doing that it's crazy can it be that high oh yeah oh yeah um and most people don't even know nope that that because that's the thing it doesn't have to be transparent right so not only are they getting taken advantage of or getting hit but they're not even upfront enough by telling the client it's all it's all in the fine print if you will and and that stinks imagine working with a doctor who you go see for thinking you need surgery and and at the end day you don't need surgery but they motivate they're motivated to maybe hit a quot of having their 10th knee surgery of that month fixing somebody's ACL and they get bonused on it and now you're you're under the knife to get that bonus that's just it's messed up that's why sometimes I think our industry does get a bad rap and rightfully so there's a lot of great advisors and there's a lot of advisors that I wouldn't want anybody near me to deal with so you're telling me that in a feebased advisor relationship client advisor relationship that a person can believe that they're paying one one and a quarter one and a half% management fee but and that's what they see on their statement but really internally they could be paying upwards of three four five% per year we see it all the time and not even know it exactly exactly that's crazy so you have to you have to add it all up you know and we I there's one client uh client now that that you and I met with three weeks ago that thought was their fee was a fifth of what it was just looking at from a surface level and in five minutes we were able to show them a couple fees that they're paying on a regular monthly basis that's coming out of their investments and she was wondering why why am I not making greater returns well it's twofold one is she didn't have the best investments but even if we put her in the exact same investments and just cut her fee by 250 basis points she's making two and a half% more in the same things right and that and she had no clue no clue it's terrible it happens more time than I like to admit agreed i appreciate it any any closing remarks that you think are valuable to us on this topic that we haven't touched on do your research uh you can always do background checks on Advisor right there's different websites out there brokercheck.fin.org is a big one if your adviserss have been sued or anything you can find out um for the record all of us have clean records but there's there's stuff you can do fee only are they a fiduciary um are they building you financial plans i think those are lowhanging fruits as you know for for all of our clients we we try to do a financial plan you want to look into to bring the future into the present and see how all these changes are going to impact impact uh your tomorrow perfect Glenn i appreciate it thanks for taking a deep dive into the difference i think everybody's going to find some value out of this so Glenn we come uh to the point to where the mailbag we get to ask some questions that were asked by dozens of people around the country uh we've picked two just for time uh constraints this one's from Taylor in Orlando she Hi Taylor hey hey Glenn uh she sent to the mailbag got a deep voice Taylor well you know Taylor can have a deep voice this time um she goes &quot;Glenn I am worried about inflation affecting my retirement savings how can I protect my investments from inflation?&quot; Inflation's tough i think that's the thing that nobody pays attention to sometimes people in their portfolio be so focused on may preserving a portfolio maybe not losing a lot but if you do that you might not make a lot right and you have to keep up with inflation the Fed is trying to keep inflation at 2% we're closer to 3% right now what that means is you have to make 3% on your money at a minimum to break even with inflation so how do you do that well one is you could do it with bonds fixed income the 10-year Treasury right now is in the mid-4s so call it four and a half so if you had all your money hypothetically in in 10-year treasuries you're making four and a half after taxes depending your tax bracket say you're at three and a half if inflation is three you're only netting a half a percent which is still good at least they're keeping up with inflation so how do you beat that the main thing to fight inflation are going to be equities stocks right if you own Coca-Cola in your portfolio and there's inflation what's the only thing that uh Coca-Cola can do to to fight fight that i mean they could increase the the price of the the soda pop and if you're like my dad who's addicted to Coke Zero you could increase the the cost of that soda can a nickel a dime uh shoot you could probably even do it $ five dollars and you'll still drink the same amount of sodas but the the cool thing about that as a as an owner of stocks right is if I own shares of Coca-Cola and there's inflation they can pass that inflation on to the consumer when you own CDs money markets treasuries your rate of return is your rate of return until that bond matures you you're you're if there's inflation you know you have no way to combat it the main way you can combat it in general in terms of investing is to make more inflation how do you do that i think you most people has should have at least a portion of their assets in a stocks right so here's our next question this is from Jerry in Atlanta we were talking about hidden fees and staying diversified but hidden fees in investments especially mutual funds um what is the best way can I as a consumer go research and is it public knowledge to find out where to find my I mean as advisers we have access to some stuff that most people will not but that being said if you're out there if you have access to the internet you can pretty much figure it out Yahoo Finance or quite frankly you can Google it look at you've mentioned mutual funds but it could be annuity it could be anything there's typically going to be a ticker right that's a typically five letters put those five letters and you can put expense ratio or cost and it'll pop up uh and and you're going to be able to dive into what the fees are and the different layers um so it's not just one fee nuhuh mutual funds could have the expense ratio they could have the 12b1 fee which is a industry jargon for a fee that goes back to the advisor if it's an annuity again it could have aort it could have an expense ratio it could have an investment fee it could have a mortality and expense fee it there's like six or seven fees that you could have in there so you have to add them up right perfect well thank you for answering these two and and I want to thank our audience for uh attending and being with us remember if you do have any questions that you would love us to answer please email us at gdsgdwalth.com and we'll be happy to answer them and uh look forward to seeing y'all next time [Music]" />

stood up to the War Industry J William Fulbright George McGovern uh Gene McCarthy Mike Gravel William proxmeyer of course Dennis kucinich but that was largely decades ago the new Democrats especially with the presidency of Bill Clinton became shills not only for Corporate America but the arms industry no weapons system is too costly no war no matter how disastrous goes unfunded the massive military budget 858 billion dollars in military spending allocated for fiscal year 2023 is an increase of 45 billion over the Biden administration's budget request and nearly 80 billion dollars more than the amount appropriated by Congress for the current fiscal year it just keeps growing when 30 members of the party's Progressive caucus recently issued a call for Joe Biden to negotiate with Vladimir Putin they were forced by the party leadership in a war monger media to back down and rescind their letter what happened to the Democratic party why has it become impossible to question war in the massive expenditures on arms why is such questioning political suicide why can't a Democrat ask especially at a time of economic hardship and huge deficits how much we are going to divert to the war in Ukraine which has already consumed some 60 billion dollars as much as we spend on the state department and Aid with no end in sight joining me to discuss the extinction of the anti-war Democrat is Dennis kucinich a former presidential candidate who served eight terms in the House of Representatives before the Democratic party Jerry mandered his district to ensure his defeat um Dennis you were consistently one of the very few Democrats who hearkened back to that Great era of those I mentioned McGovern G McCarthy and others proxmeyer who stood up to the War Industry who paid a very heavy political price for that not only being pushed out of Congress but even when you were in Congress I believe you were not allowed to caucus with the Democrats if I have that correct courtesy of Pelosi but let's go back there was a moment in time when the Democratic party had a fierce peace candidates any War candidates of course 1972 McGovern becomes the nominee uh what happened well first of all uh thank you very much for the opportunity to be on your show and I I think uh you know this is the perfect show for me to do because it's not just a matter of uh having a conversation with the choir it's about taking the discussion to a higher level to try to describe for people what's actually happening what can happen uh with respect to democratic caucus though uh I found my way into the meetings [Laughter] shut me out as much as uh it was uh uh you know who who brought this guy in but but really you know I will say this about uh speaker uh Pelosi uh that we may have had a difference of opinion on some of these uh uh spending issues that help to feel Wars but the thing that I always did was I always let the leadership know ahead of time I don't agree with you I'm taking a different approach I'm going to go to the floor this is what I'm going to say you know whether you like it or not and they appreciated the warning didn't appreciate my uh uh speeches they I'm sure didn't appreciate my votes for the most part but um to me what's happened with the uh Democratic party I think as soon as the Democratic party uh many determination could have been 35 40 years ago that they were going to take corporate uh contributions that that wiped out any distinction between the two parties because in Washington uh he or she who pays the piper you know plays the tune and that's what's happened so there isn't that much of a difference in terms of the uh two parties when it comes to war except notably partisan reasons or not there were over 50 Republicans who voted against the last triage of money that went to fuel the war in Ukraine and I I felt that was notable and of course uh the uh potential speaker of the house should the Republicans win uh uh will be um Kevin McCarthy who has made it a point to say that he's going to look at that funding let's talk about the past so uh you had a significant opposition to the Pentagon budget weapon systems were questioned was it in essence corporate money uh that was uh the factor in essentially driving a wellstone driving these figures out of the house and the senate or were there other reasons certainly plays a part I mean let's face it right now the uh arms industry is making money hand over fists with the expansion of War that's how they make their money and of course they can put money into certain campaigns but that's not all it's about uh the uh the request to fund a war goes into the larger heavily mediated environment which supports a war and if you stand against the funding then your constituents who uh who may be great Americans uh look at that and they say well why aren't you supporting America and I think that members of Congress are always concerned about being caught between on what their constituents think as opposed to what they the doubts that they have and so uh with respect to the Democratic caucus uh this event a retraction of the letter uh by a significant caucus within the Democratic party uh is a new benchmark of uh kind of a slavish obesians to the um status quo within the party which then support war and had and a majority of Republicans at this point are supporting War so you have Congress uh supporting War and this is the way it's been Seymour Melman writes about the Distortion of the economy by the War Industry he points out that one of the crucial tactics that the War Industry uses is to diversify where weapons are made uh I believe f-35s are made in Vermont uh and this really ties the hands of House and Senate members because it it it becomes at a constituent level a debate about jobs well it is a factor can can ignore it so what happens is uh when the uh Pentagon budget comes up there are parade of of various uh businesses small and large who will make appointments with the Congress person or staff and lay out how many jobs are in the district and and uh and how important it is to a district business to have this budget passed I mean I mean I had that happen to me and it was uh you know I invariably have to inform my constituent that I didn't support uh the war that was going this was going to be fueling and so I wasn't going to vote for the budget I'll tell you this Chris that I may have once when I first started in Congress uh voted for a budget that went to the Pentagon but it didn't take me long to figure out what the what the racket was I had a hearing I went to as a member of the government oversight Committee in which An Inspector General uh testified that there are over a trillion dollars worth of accounts in the Pentagon that couldn't be reconciled that they had over 1100 different accounting systems deliberately I suppose I suppose constructed so as to make obfuscation a rule the day so from that moment on I just said wait a minute they're not keeping track of how this money spent why in the world should I vote for for for this budget so from that point on right through to the conclusion of a 16-year uh service in the United States Congress I didn't vote for a single budget of the of the Pentagon because or any of the supplemental Appropriations to keep Wars going because I knew it was a racket I knew there would be billions of dollars thrown away and you know I can cite chapter and first inspector General's reports once the money goes out of this country overseas on behalf you know whether it's Iraq or whatever Adventure we were in the money's blowing the thing that I was always concerned about even more than money was the fact that we were committing American servicemen and service women in the case of Iraq to uh Ally and and the constituency that I had in Congress Chris primarily working-class men and women many veterans Halls uh people really believe strongly in America uh serve the country themselves or their fathers and grandfathers served and and they they support the United States of America so I'm in Congress and I'm I'm seeing what actually is going on and I'm going wait a minute you know I'm not a sucker and I'm looking at this and I'm saying No this is wrong and then I have to go home and explain my vote and I had some people were in a happy because they thought I wasn't being patriotic enough and and that's what a congress person is supposed to do but the truth is the members of Congress are always under enormous pressure not you know locally from their constituents from uh contractors within their constituency uh from the the mediated environment and and the party and and so it's a rare individual and I'm not you know doing this to elevate myself but it's a rare individual who will go against that because you risk uh at times you may risk your political career well if if you won't take their money uh there's always someone else who will uh and they will throw a lot of that money at a candidate to take you down well that's true no matter if you're talking about the arms industry the oil companies the health care industry uh there was a Congressional candidate in 1972 who ran against a darling of the AMA and uh and he told the AMA when they came to him as uh look give the other guy the money because I'm not going to help you well they did and this uh young uh Congressional candidate lost a close race that was me by the way so I I understand the price that you might have to pay for not going with the crowd but my feeling is that public office comes and goes I mean if you you know who are we if we want to take a stand who who are any of us if we're not willing to put it all on the line in any given vote and say look this isn't only what I believe and this is who I am and I and I'm someone who I don't feel I know more than anybody else I do my homework Chris I make sure that I any vote that I take is informed and and as I did when I led the effort against uh the war in Iraq and that's not the way it goes in Congress a lot of people are flying by the seat of their pants or they look at the vote board to see how everyone else is voting because Congress is a place of tremendous peer pressure because and the votes go right up on this uh most people don't know us but but the votes aren't imagine a big gym and the votes go up on this big wall okay and people uh the lights go on green light for yes yellow light for I'm not sure and red light for now and everybody can see how everybody else is voting it helps enforce party discipline and it helps uh uh it it helps to feed the hurt Instinct in time inside the Congress it's a lot of pressure there uh let's talk about the effect of unchecked militarism on our civil society and our democracy well we live in a in a time where there's an acceleration of polarized thinking it's uh Us Versus Them whoever they are and uh the government helps to feed that the government generates uh perceptions and uh and people think well you know there must be there must be a reason for for this uh uh for the government's position on this war the truth of the matter is that we're in a heavily militarized Society driven by agreed uh lust for profit and Wars are being created just to keep fueling that and it it it it it it moves right into uh this idea of of of this old idea of a manifest destiny and then you kind of leap into the 21st century where there are still people believe who believe as in the project for a new you know a new American Century that it has to be that America must rule the world that it is our destiny I mean that is such old thinking but that's where we are and we um see we don't always consider that we're inheritors not only of a physical world but we're inheritors of a uh of a Consciousness where inheritors of thought structures and the thought structures that we've inherited no longer serve a practical purpose in this country we are are we move into a false consciousness of fear of of uh of separation from the rest of of the world see I I see the world as one I I think that human Unity is the is the is the truth that surrounds all of us and when we start separating ourselves and we engage in this polarized thinking polarized thinking is a precursor of war and so we need to try to go back to uh it's a really a spiritual principle that says that look uh we're all one we're interconnected we're in a dependent and the world is one uh you know we may have uh uh different races colors Creeds but there's a there's a Oneness and and if you look at the first model of the country e pluribus unum out of many one it it's the Paradox of a unity in multiplicity and many people can't handle that but but that's that's the truth so we're when we go to war we're living a lie we're separating ourselves from from part of humanity it's a belief that we don't have an ability to be able to solve things and somehow uh the power of our weapons is greater than the power of our of our reason or even deeper the power of our heart and so that's where you know I've gone away from the Orthodoxy which is now part of politics that says well keep that war going and for whatever reason we're going to die we're going to beat the Russian we're going to beat the Chinese what we're bidding ourselves to what extent are these conflicts and I would include the expansion of NATO driven by this lust for greed on the part of the War Industry and the arms manufacturers you know when I was in Congress I put in legislation to uh uh forbid the United States to uh to go into any war that NATO was operating because I felt that it was a subversion of the constitutional principle in Article 1 Section 8 which is a Congress of the United States has the power to to take our country from a condition of peace to war that that was in the Constitution NATO has evolved it wasn't it was first a defensive organization then after Clinton had turned into an offensive organization and it has become now a kind of a sock puppet for uh West Western Powers notably my own Deer Country in the United States and as a result uh NATO uh punches above its weight uh makes statements that are uh ridiculous and look I will make a prediction right here that as a result of of NATO and the eu's role in helping to fuel uh this this war in Ukraine give it a couple years but there won't be a NATO and there won't be an EU as a result why well first of all look at what's happened the U.S actually you know I think the way this unfolded uh in Ukraine you know we all know from 2000 um uh 14 how the U.S engineered a coup and and knocked out uh Ukrainian government and put in one that would serve the U.S interest which was to uh nullify the um the power of the constituency in in eastern Ukraine which was a Russian speaking and they they wanted to basically uh by any means necessary uh keep that uh uh out of influencing the policies of the region in which they did I mean 14 000 by some estimates uh russian-speaking ukrainians were killed from 2014 until 2021. uh most Americans have no idea about that but but anyhow once the once the U.S uh once the intelligence started to say hey we can knock Russia out like like that okay we'll Crush Russia economically these sanctions are going to put Russia away and the EU bought into it what's the result well the war goes on but in the meantime the uh the sanctions have created a dramatic uh increase in the cost of energy uh plus the look The Pipeline that another increase in the cost of energy so you've I've heard from people in Europe where they're seeing increases in in Basic Energy costs anywhere from six to nine times of what it used to be businesses can't survive that individuals are under hardship the pressure is going to go back on the government this is going to cause a lot of problems with the EU and NATO is there as you know a cat's paw for war and frankly people are going to say well who's NATO making decisions for me I would imagine that already you're starting to see protests in Europe where people are saying get out of the EU get out of NATO because they're they're paying an economic price right now for the misjudgment of the European officials who were coaxed into it by the U.S and this ends up being a nightmare a night and you know not only for Europe though but we're getting visited with it somewhat here uh you're seeing of increasing in food prices increases in gas prices uh the accelerant knock-on effect on inflation uh interest rates have gone up mortgage rates uh are gone up there's a there's a cycle of economic violence which is visited on the people of this country who really don't have a straight story about what happened in in Ukraine I represented ukrainians in the United States Congress and proudly so I want to Ukraine I met with people I stood in the square in Ukraine in defense of journalists who were who were under attack there one of whom was killed Gonzaga and so I just felt that you know ukrainians have a right to exist they have a right to their own country and uh what's happened is this is being twisted and suddenly Ukraine becomes a a blood bath of a chessboard where these innocent people are just being used as Pawns in a in a game of Nations and I resent that I mean I resent that on behalf of every every decent person who's trying to keep their family together in Ukraine and who doesn't want to be dominated by anybody U.S Russia anybody and they just want to live their lives but because there there's a game of Nations going on and the US was concerned about Russia's pivot to Asia well guess what this whole thing is blowing up in the face of the West Russia's not we we've forced Russia to Pivot to Asia and now you know Brazil uh Russia India uh China South Africa then Saudi Arabia there's a whole new world being formed and the Catalyst of it is the misjudgment that occurred about uh about Ukraine and the effort to try to control you Ukraine uh that began in 2014 that most people aren't aware of I would say let's talk about the Press because you spoke about going back to your constituents as an anti-war candidate and feeling blowback uh but isn't that because essentially we have a press that is locked out and he wore critics well I think it was a librarian of Congress Daniel borsten who wrote a book about the media being spear carriers for the government and that was true Generations ago and it's true today uh and and that's a problem when you don't have um a all when you don't have many Alternatives that present a different point of view you're locked into a a world view that might be based on on a falsity and I'll give you a great example go back to Iraq because I was really involved in that you know and challenging The Narrative right from the beginning and uh you know I did my homework I saw that back in and I gave congress a memo and on October 2nd 2002 that said look there's no proof that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction but moreover Iraq didn't have anything to do with 911 with okators were on 911 didn't have the intention or capability of attacking the United States so what is this about and I talked to hundreds of members of Commerce about it but the drum beat in the media war war from the White House war war no one bought you know and this is what so many people heard it was just drowned out and so you know I saw this I I've seen this Dynamic before and the media we have a heavily mediated Society even more so today than 20 years ago there there's uh there's and and we also know that the government can have Legions of people working computers sending out messages that phrase those who are for the war and attack those who aren't you know we're living in a in a hall of marriage here when it comes to trying to find out what is really going on and so how do you figure it out well you do your homework but you also have to trust your God your intuition too and and when I you know when I looked at what happened and and um in Iraq that led me to understand what was happening in Libya what was happening in Syria and you know and then I do some more homework I'm you know uh William Blom Chalmers Johnson and others who did the studies case after case after case of U.S interventions that were all about uh lies and our country I love this country and it is being uh uh it is being done a disservice by people who in power who have made book with interest groups who are going forward just to cash in on war and uh and I and I think it's horrific and and in this case Chris we're uh we're playing with the flash of world war three uh you know there are sometimes I think that people in the White House are like something out of uh The Sorcerer's Apprentice you know they're playing with their their they've taken this broom and they're moving out chemical forces around that are going beyond that can easily go beyond their control and and you know so I'm also concerned that things could spin out of control with even now with respect to uh to Russia with respect to China uh North Korea um and what a tragedy what an immense human tragedy when the truth of the matter is we we must find a way to live together as John Kennedy said you know we have to you know learn how to live together as brothers and sisters so we perished together as fools I I want to ask about these pimps of War these shills for War I covered the war in El Salvador I had to deal with Elliot Abrams Robert Kagan worked for him they're wrong about everything they were wrong about the interventions in Iraq Afghanistan Syria with a so-called moderate Rebels Libya and now they're beating the drums of course for endless war with Ukraine it doesn't matter how uh mistaken they were in the past they are perpetuated their think tanks are perpetuated they never lose their purchase on uh the cable talk shows you've dealt with these people I know some of them Abrams and others they are truly human mediocrities uh and I would include the generals like Petraeus and others and yet they're like this uh bacteria or anti-resistant bacteria that we can't uh Vanquish uh talk about them well you know Chris I see the way I looked at it is that even people with whom I I strongly disagree and you just named a number uh I I think we we have to continue to find ways of showing people you know they've they've gone um uh astray and that we have to make an effort to bring them back now how do you do that well um if there ever was a country that was in need of a process of Truth and Reconciliation it's America we really need to have people come forward and admit that they were wrong that you know whatever their motivation was so that we can heal this country because we're divided right now in this whole idea about about war and uh you know this misuse of power in some ways a misunderstanding of the material world itself that we think there's only so much and we have to control it uh if you look at physics the material world you know the the universe keeps expanding but you wouldn't know that talking to some people because their their physics is a very confined almost uh uh pre uh uh Galileo view of the world Dennis I just wanna just in the last two minutes I mean you talked about Truth and Reconciliation there was a certain amount of accountability after the Vietnam War I mean we did as a country ask questions about ourselves that we hadn't asked before and there was a brief period of time when I would argue we became a better country now there's no accountability uh I spent seven years in the Middle East I mean millions of people's lives were destroyed not to mention the tens of thousands of families in the United States who are caring for wounded and crippled veterans or lost loved ones but there's no accountability at all you know uh this is uh there we must find a path to accountability or it's it will be our undoing uh you know I I made an attempt to uh follow a procedure which is one way of achieving accountability through the legislative process and that is that I introduce articles with Patron uh of the president and the vice president I was with you at the Canon building when you did that you remember that and yes and uh you know there were at least 48 articles with respect to uh President Bush and a smaller number for uh vice president Cheney uh the Democratic Leadership however sent that to uh uh those those proposals to committee uh never to be discussed see we it's you know when I when I got on the floor of Congress and I did hundreds of speeches opposed to opposed to the war and and after the war started and proposals to get out of Iraq and other features to not go to war against Iran and and each time there was a a a a a kind of a uh Amnesia that took place with gorbid alcohols the United States of Amnesia it just takes place where people forget the the mistakes not mistakes the misdeeds of the past and and unless we have some measure of accountability uh we're always going to be uh wearing the stain of of uh of war waged against innocent people around the globe and there's a point Chris where we have to start asking ourselves what are we about as a nation are we about endless war about being King of the mountain about uh you know telling other nations how they should live or wouldn't it be nice to start focusing on the education of our people put the resources into education and health care and and job creation and and safe cities and a cleaner environment and all those things that we can do within this within the boundaries of what we know as the United States of America I I you know to me politically it never made sense to just go all over the world but with the media it's it's been and I that was the area of study I had University with the media it's always been pounding away at you know America has to be the the Vanguard of freedom for the world and we're losing it here at home yeah well we have to stop there we should also be clear we've lost almost all these wars going back to Vietnam including Afghanistan and Iraq that was

          <attvalue for="7" value="This has been a long battle. How much certainty does this provide? Is the entire case over? So this provides a lot of certainty for Ripple for frankly, me personally, because the SEC had sued me. The SEC has abandoned their appeal. And so we that they filed suit in December of 2020. We won on the key parts of the case in the summer of 23. Judge Torres made a ruling that XRP in and of itself was not a security. That's almost verbatim quote. The S.E.C. filed an appeal about eight months ago, and what they've now agreed is that they're going to drop that appeal. We still have a cross appeal pending, and so we go from being defendant really to plaintiff. So we now are in the driver's seat to determine how we want to proceed. Are you dropping it? We're going to see we we it feels a lot better to be on the offense than the defense. You know, for years we spent over $150 million defending that case, not just for Ripple, but for the whole industry. I think it was really important that this SEC, the Gensler SEC, was really trying to bully and continue lawfare. Filing lawsuits and lawsuits and lawsuits against crypto companies. That's over now. And I think that's great for the US crypto industry and frankly great for crypto at large. I mean, to that end, if you're looking at in the US, you see why not drop the case at this point? Why not clear the pay? Why not clear the water? Well, that certainly is an option. I mean, again, it's clear the SEC has said, you know, they I think in retrospect never would have brought this case. The the judge did rule in certain instances back in 2015 and 2016, some XRP sales that we sold to accredited investors, to institutions that those had constituted a security. And so there was a $125 million fine that's sitting in escrow. We wouldn't mind having that back. That's on the table. And I think there's some nuances to how this will play out. But it was important for us for really the whole XRP community, for them to know that the case is, for all intents purposes, the cases over the SEC's no longer pursuing them. To that end, to your point here, the court decision had ordered you to pay a $125 million civil penalty for exactly what you're talking about is that 125 million paid is what you're saying. That's still up? Yeah, well, it's not a dispute. I mean, that's sitting in an escrow and, you know, depending upon whether or not we decide to continue with our appeal, we could walk away and the whole thing can be done, done, done. On the other hand, when you have a case where there were no investor, no investor harm, no investors lost any money, you're kind of like, wait, like, why are we here? And it really goes back to Gary Gensler fighting a fight that was about power grab, that was about overreach of the bureaucracy to try to take a new industry. That what we're seeing now happening in Washington is smart legislation will come forward. You're seeing that happen to stablecoins in real time. And I think you'll have a market structure. Bill is what is described as to provide clarity and rules for the SEC and CFTC will look at the bigger picture. We're going to have you for a little while this morning. But do you think that part of this means fighting it till the very end to make sure even that part of uncertainty around being sold to certain investors classifies as a security? Is that what you are fighting for ultimately at this point? Well, I mean, at this point, all we're fighting for is do we want to fight to get $225 million back? We look, I'll be honest, would I have walked away from that before they appealed before President Trump put Paul Atkins and Scott Bessant and David Sacks as critical, key very smart leaders in this industry to bring this industry back on shore. I would have walked away. Now you look at that and make this case in this S.E.C. never would have been brought. And so where we find ourselves is great. There's a clear legal victory to say XRP is not a security that was good for the industry, but there's pieces of it that we think can be kind of cleaned up. And the question is, do we want to fight that fight, or can we come to the agreement with the SEC to drop everything? The whole idea that this wouldn't have been brought under this S.E.C., have you had that specific discussion with Paul Atkins and with David Sacks or Paul Atkins hasn't yet been confirmed? You know, he's a very knowledgeable guy about this industry and has been for a long time. But I've had conversations I won't comment on specifics with certainly, you know, I think David Sacks would agree that this is a case that didn't make a lot of sense in the beginning. Again, there was no investor harm. This was about Gary Gensler waging a war against this industry. You know, it's interesting. I want to also point out that the affiliated token, of course, IT XRP has been up roughly 14% now, about 13% in the last 24 hours. You know, one thing a lot of people have looked at, we're thinking a lot about how the administration is handling crypto assets, particularly outside of Bitcoin. Why do you think XRP wasn't specifically named in the executive order for the digital Asset stockpile? Well, XRP was named by the President in Untruth Social. He posted something saying that there should be other tokens, that there's going to be a Bitcoin strategic reserve. And then a crypto stockpile that would include things like access later. The executive order didn't include it. Why was that? I don't know what specifically was in the executive order. My understanding is there's going to be a Bitcoin strategic reserve. There'll be a crypto stockpile representing other cryptos, and I would expect that will include XRP. Look, at the end of the day, I think the stark contrast is in the Biden administration. We couldn't get a meeting with people at the White House. Now we're welcomed into the White House and that's just a massive change. I think we want this industry to thrive in the United States. We want to push it offshore where you have fewer regulations. I think the reason I keep pushing you, too, is because I think now it's widely accepted that this is a pro crypto administration. But the details, that is what's causing an overhang, the uncertainty of the details. So to the extent you have confidence right about XRP being in that stockpile or otherwise getting more support for an ETF, yeah, for example, where does that confidence come from and what kind of timeline do you see it happening on? So I have immense confidence on the ETF. I think there's 11 different filings pending with the SEC to launch ETFs from everybody from Bitwise to Franklin Templeton and a whole bunch of people in between. I think those will be live in the second half of this year. We have seen even outside the United States, you have live ETP and at a time when a lot of outflows are exiting, some of the crypto ETFs, you're seeing inflows into XRP. And I think that's because you had this false negative pressure from the SEC, this kind of, you know, a exhaustion is hand holding things down that's now being released and that's great for the market. It's great for builders within the XRP ecosystem globally. One more on the stock. Yeah. How much XRP would be in it? Where does it come from? Well, my understanding when I read about the I mean, I think there are some questions and that, you know, the devil may be in the details as Treasury implements some of this. Absolutely details. But my understanding is that the stockpile would be represented by seized other cryptos other than Bitcoin. That then will be in that stockpile. So to the extent that various law enforcement agencies have seized cryptos, which would include XRP, that those would go into the stockpile in addition to the Bitcoin strategic reserve. That's my understanding. We have been talking here about a big moment for you and for your company. Of course, a roll back really of the tensions that had been brewing with the FCC. And let's talk about the next phase. One thing I'm really wondering about now that there's more clarity for you is that it is an IPO, frankly, in your future. Now, it will talk so much about the potential for the XRP token to be wrapped in an ETF that is a method of listing. So is listing possible now for you for Ripple? Well, it's certainly something that is possible. The United States SEC under Gensler was so hostile to this industry. I mean, ironically, they approved the S-1 from Coinbase and then sued them for doing the things they said they were doing. So this SEC, fortunately, is going to be, I think, very constructive and positive for this industry. So I think that's available and the company is at a stage where we can consider that. That being said, it isn't a huge priority. You know, I think most companies are going public. Raising capital is something that is high on their on their radar. You know, we have been in a very fortunate position to be able to grow the business organically. We're also, frankly, more proactive in looking at acquisitions, that this is an industry that finally is going to be able to thrive in the United States, the largest economy in the world. And I think the industry is still underestimating the shift from the headwinds to the tailwinds That's going to make a bigger difference if people think in finally, the U.S. market is really unlocked. So it sounds like what you're saying acquisitions are almost more of a priority now than an IPO for you. So then what would you be looking for to buy and how big are you willing to go? Well, I'm not going to name names, but it will like Ripple. At its core is a blockchain infrastructure company. We sell our technologies to businesses, primarily financial institutions, and we'll look at other things that are blockchain infrastructure companies. I think there will be consolidation this year. There's a lot of excitement about some of the changes and think, you know, we will lean into that for sure. So when you think about what's possible in terms of financial institutions, there's been a lot of conversation about loosening of regulations and red tape when it comes to the financial industry and its interactions with the crypto community. What are you actually seeing happen? Are banks really warming up in a way that's significant right now? I mean, I think unequivocally yes. I mean, just in the last few weeks, I have seen U.S. financial institutions go from being like, look, we're just not going to touch it because we don't want the extra scrutiny of the regulators, which, again, may or may not have even been legal, given these are legal businesses. But you have large banks who used to say negative things, now saying positive things. I think the two areas you'll see the most activity in the short term. One is around custody. These are banks that want to be able to custody, particularly when you see real world assets being tokenized. You need to be able to safely manage and custody that for customers and potentially for the bank. And the second is around payments. I mean, the global payments infrastructure still remains very dated. You know, buyers are slow. I just had a wire. They're sending over euros disappear for five days. You know, that's surprising in a world of the Internet. So one part of that payments infrastructure that I'm watching really closely is, of course, stablecoins. There is starting to be more clarity in Washington and you're seeing people starting to use stablecoins in really interesting ways. I think about Robinhood, for example, using Stablecoin in terms of facilitating 24 hour trading. What's next? I mean, if you think about the next forefront of Stablecoins, now that the U.S. is getting toward clarity, what's possible? Well, again, I think we're underestimated how big that might get. You know, today that markets about $230 billion. I think some smart people think that may go up ten X in the next five years. I think that's probably right. I mean, the two leading players and Tether as well as Usdc are both, I think, poised to do well in that market. Ripple launched our own stablecoin at the end of last year. That's already ahead of our own internal forecasts in terms of where we are at this point in years still were small, but the goal is by the end of the year for RL USD Ripple stablecoin to be one of the top five in the market by the end of the year. And I think the whole market's going to grow dramatically this year. So what does it take you to get there? Who are you pairing up with? Are you creating some financial partnerships in order to make our U.S. more of a household name? Yeah, for sure. I mean, even today we had more listings go live for all USD on some global crypto exchanges. You know, any time you do something new, it takes a minute for that kind of. If the pain of the ripple effect of seeing how that plays out. And so we're seeing that happen in real time. So I'm really pleased. Again, as I said, we're ahead of our Q1 forecasts of where we expected to be. So we feel really good about that progress. Given through what you have gone through with the SCC, I think one major question is how tokens list in the future? What do they mean? How are they classified now that you're talking about many other say even private equity companies looking to tokenize their funds. Venture capital. As Cathie Wood told us yesterday, she's considering that for her own fund. What does this mean? What are the rules of the road? Are people going to list and put the cart in front of the horse as they do? So? Yeah, well, look, I think tokenizing like what Cathie Wood's talking about democratizing access to different investment vehicles, investing in different investment types is very compelling. Even, you know, imagine Shark Tank enabling the participation by different sharks. Like there's some really interesting stuff you could do. Right now. Congress, it seems, is more focused on getting stablecoin legislation passed that went for markup last week. And I think you'll see that potentially in front of the president in weeks. The other piece of legislation I think will move quickly after that is kind of the market structure. Bill, last summer for something called fit 21 passed. The House did not get through the Senate. I think that a market structure bill like that 21 will come before Congress, hopefully before the summer recess. We'll see that pass. Also, you know, you think about how many exchanges are now looking to loosen their listing standards already on the heels of lighter oversight and the cart before the horse. Question, Do you think that people are getting a little ahead of themselves and listing things that shouldn't be listed? Well, I don't think about it as lighter regulation because frankly, I think the industry wants to be regulated. And what we've been saying for years as an industry is we just want clear regulation. We don't want lawsuits just claiming one thing in the next week contradicting themselves, which is exactly what Gensler's FCC was doing. So I think just the fact that we have an SEC who's trying to work constructively instead of trying to sue more companies to actually work and codify and get legislation to provide that clarity. But again, if you don't have that clarity, what you saw years ago was an ICO boom where tons of things that were raising money never worked out for the people that were buying the tokens or coins. Look, I agree. And I said then that I think it some of these ICOs were a lot more like IPO as they were securities. The problem is the SEC then kind of used that to just blanket and say I mean, well, Gensler said before he was SEC chair, he didn't think they were securities and then after he became SEC chair is kind of his power grab. Gensler wanted everything under his jurisdiction. So I think I wish that ICO boom went away. And there's lots of ways this government can regulate and manage fraud and manage criminal activity. And that did happen. People did go to jail. I have one more question for you about Ripple and XRP in particular on the supply and how it's managed and the Unlocks. Is there anything you would do to change the amount of supply brought to market? Can you do that? How does that exactly work? Because there is a level of dilution for XRP when more supply is brought in on a regular basis. So this is one of the things I'm glad you asked, because there's frankly misinformation, sometimes disinformation, people spreading falsehoods out there. The amount of XRP that was created in 2012 when it was first started, that blockchain was first started, it was 100 billion units. That can't be increased. It's slightly deflationary and now there's about 99.9 billion units. Ripple owns about 42% of that supply we have had in for, I guess, eight years. We publish something called the XRP Markets Report, where we share how much we are introducing into the market because we want that to be predictable. And that has been the case for many years now. And so we will continue to make sure that's very predictable. You know, at some point maybe we won't be selling as much. We'll see how that plays out in the future. But right now, frankly, we get criticized for owning too much and then we're criticized for selling some. But we want to do that in a constructive way, which is what we've done for years." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Trump's continued  face-off with the courts has some   questioning whether the U.S. has reached  the point of a constitutional crisis. On that and more, we turn to the analysis of  Brooks and Capehart. That's New York Times   columnist David Brooks, and Jonathan Capehart,  associate editor of The Washington Post. Good evening, gentlemen. Nice to have you both. I want to talk about President Trump and  the courts. The president has wielded his   authority in, I think by any measure,  an extraordinary way, slashing budgets   and jobs across the federal government, targeting  billions of dollars at colleges and universities,   threatening major law firms. On immigration, we  have all been following that remarkable process. But the courts, David, in many instances,  have stood up to the president.   Do you think that they are doing their  appropriate role of check and balance? DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I think they are. The question  is whether Trump pays any attention to the courts. And so, to me, watching the Trump administration  is just watching the administration to say,   we have decided stoplights don't  apply to us. Yellow lines down the   middle don't apply. We're just going  to roll over it. And you stop us. And when you think constitutional crisis,  you think, like, two sides facing off   on the barricades. But I have actually  lived through a constitutional crisis.   When I was at The Wall Street Journal, I covered  the end of the Soviet Union. And it was obviously   very different in many ways. But one thing was  interesting, the mental adjustment I had to make. When I went to the Soviet Union... WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The mental adjustment. DAVID BROOKS: Yes, at the very end, because I  grew up in a country where I assumed, if a law   is passed, then things will change, it will be  enforced, and it'll be a reality on the ground. But at the very end of the Soviet Union, they  would pass law after law, and nothing happened.   Nobody bothered to enforce it. It never had  any implementation. So the laws were fictional,   because people had lost faith in the  laws, lost faith in the whole system. And so what happens now is not that you get this  big conflict, but Trump just says, we're going to   arrest a guy who -- and give him no due process,  and there's, like, no confrontation. It just   happens. And nobody's there to stop it, because  famously the judiciary doesn't have an army. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Right. Jonathan, what do you think about that? I mean,  we had Georgetown Law Professor Steve Vladeck   on the show. He says, we're not quite there  yet, because the Trump administration has not   yet formally blown through, overtly  ignored a direct court order yet. But we also heard from the League of Women  Voters, the nonpartisan organization,   who this week -- I'd like to read you this quote.  They said -- quote -- &quot;It has now been 87 days   since the start of the Trump administration.  From the flagrant disregard for congressional   authority and governmental checks and balances,  to defying Supreme Court orders to bring Kilmar   Abrego Garcia back home, one thing is abundantly  clear. Our country is in a constitutional crisis.&quot; Where do you come down on that? JONATHAN CAPEHART: I am glad you  read that, because I was shaking,   I was nodding in agreement with  the League of Women Voters. How can you say that the president hasn't defied  court orders? You have got Judge Boasberg,   who is threatening to -- says yesterday  that there's probable cause to charge   the government or lawyers arguing on behalf  of the government with criminal contempt. Why? Because the president of the  United States and his administration   ignored his order to not deport  those folks to El Salvador. So,   I know there are these formal definitions  of what a constitutional crisis is, but from   where I sit in my &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; knowledge  of how our government is supposed to work... JONATHAN CAPEHART: ... we are in one. We have  a president of the United States who on a daily   basis blows past the guardrails, pushes  as far as he can get to test the system. And what has heartened me this week is hearing  from Judge Boasberg and the judge who ruled   yesterday in that beautiful seven-page  opinion, where they are not just saying,   this isn't the right thing to do. They  are pushing back just as aggressively   from their respective federal benches.  And I think we will be better for it. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you think, David, that  -- I have been reading some Republican voices   saying specifically on this Abrego Garcia  case that this might be a bridge too far,   that they feel that this -- simply  jumping over due process completely. Do you think that there will be from the  right some real critique that's meaningful? DAVID BROOKS: It depends if you have the kind  of job where you have to get elected to hold it. DAVID BROOKS: And so one of the  things I have been struck by is   that a lot of things Trump has done,  the experts have said, this is crazy. And when Ukraine, the Zelenskyy meeting in the  Oval Office, Republican and Democratic foreign   policy experts said this is crazy. The tariffs,  Republican and Democratic experts said this is   crazy. The Garcia case, Republican and Democratic  constitutional scholars say this is crazy. But as for elected officials, I would say  we have not yet seen that. I have to assume,   from what I know of them personally, is that they  are personally appalled, but they're doing what   they have been doing for the last -- all the  years that we have -- Trump has been around. JONATHAN CAPEHART: Although we have seen  some -- well, one. I was going to say some,   one Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who  is no shrinking violet when it comes to   going toe to toe with President Trump  or standing up to her own leadership. And she is on camera, on record  saying, we're all afraid. And that's... WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We actually have that. JONATHAN CAPEHART: Oh. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's play what she had  to say. This is Senator Lisa Murkowski,   senator of Alaska. Let's listen to what she said. SEN. LISA MURKOWSKI (R-AK):  We are all afraid, OK? I'm   oftentimes very anxious myself about using  my voice, because retaliation is real. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Retaliation is real. JONATHAN CAPEHART: And that's what  Republicans in the House and the Senate   and all over the country, elected ones,  have been dealing with since Trump one. And I think the fact that we have that on camera  from Senator Murkowski, I hope it will give other   elected Republicans the courage to say even that,  to acknowledge to the American people that, we   see what's happening, we know what's going on, we  know it's crazy and wrong, but, got to be honest,   we're scared. We're not quite sure what to do,  although what they should be doing, we all know. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, you offered a  prescription, David, in your column in   The New York Times for this moment that we  are in. And you called for a civic uprising. You said in this column, I want to read a bit  of this, saying that the attacks that we have   seen on institutions -- quote -- &quot;are not  separate battles. This is a simple effort to   undo the parts of the civilizational order that  might restrain Trump's acquisition of power.&quot; So how would that civic uprising form? DAVID BROOKS: Yes, the core argument is  that Trump is really about amassing power.   And anything that might potentially  restrain his power, he will destroy. And that includes the court systems  and anything part of that livens   humanity. It includes the universities,  the scientific community, the truth,   the media. And so far, we have responded to  all these things, NATO, in separate lanes.   We think the Fed is different than NATO,  which is different from the universities. But my point is, this is all one  thing. And if institutions and   even sectors try to respond to this individually,   they're doomed. Even Harvard, with $52 billion  in this endowment, you can't do it alone. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Though that was a signal moment. DAVID BROOKS: That was a crucial  turning point because it changed   the minds of everybody in every university  I have talked to since then. They said... WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Oh, really? DAVID BROOKS: Yes. So... WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Post-Harvard,  they have all said... DAVID BROOKS: Right. A lot of  them beforehand were like, well,   Columbia made a deal, maybe that's  right for us. Once Harvard came out,   I talked to a couple of university presidents  who said, oh, this is where we need to be,   because the Trump administration made  it impossible for Harvard not to say no. And that's what we're dealing with here.  And so the point I tried to make is,   all these different sectors have to  get together and inform one big civic   movement. And it can't be political. It's  not Democrats versus Republicans. It's not   left versus right. It's institutions versus the  destruction of our institutions of civilization. And if you look down through history, there  have been social movements, these kinds of   civic uprising that have succeeded. They have  banded together across sectors. They have a clear,   simple message that appeals to a lot of different  people. They use things like lawsuits, protests,   boycotts, all sorts of things,  strikes, anything they can do. But, basically, if you're head  of a law firm or a university,   any of these institutions, you're  dealing with administrations,   it's just about raw power. So the question  you have to ask yourself is, how do we amass   power so they're not dividing us, so we're  dividing them? And that is a mass uprising. And the one turning point, if you look  even at the civil rights movement,   when you do a nonviolent protest and the people  on the other side attack you with violence,   that tends to weaken them. And then suddenly  you're dividing them, some, obviously. And so this is the kind of way we have to  think, that it's time not just to think,   well, maybe he will look at the other  guy. It's time we're all involved,   we're all in this together, and  we're going to amass power together. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Jonathan, do you think that  that movement, that uprising is going to happen? I mean, we saw protests recently. There are  major protest planned for tomorrow. Do you   think that there is this coalescing  energy that David is talking about? JONATHAN CAPEHART: I think it's happening. And I think it started when people were showing  up outside of USAID when they were going through   hell. I think we started seeing -- we're seeing  it in the town halls in Republican districts,   so much so that the leadership told Republican  members of Congress don't hold town halls anymore. We have seen it with the big rallies in red  states convened by Senator Bernie Sanders and   AOC in red states, I think just yesterday  or two days ago in Montana, hundreds,   if not thousands of people. And then you look  at what's happening. And I know the courts and   the judges are impartial, but they are also  part of this pushing back on what's happening. And then for Harvard to do what it did, I  think sent a message not just to university   presidents, but to the country that  if Harvard -- if Harvard had folded,   it would have been a devastating  thing. But it didn't happen. And I would just say this one last point. In Trump  one, Adam Serwer wrote famously the cruelty is the   point about the first Trump  administration. And I would   argue that in Trump two, it's  now the cruelty is the policy. And I think what we're seeing around the country  is people pushing back against Trump two. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Jonathan Capehart, David  Brooks, always good to see you both. Thank you. JONATHAN CAPEHART: Thanks, William. DAVID BROOKS: Good to see you." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="We Begin Today's Show with President Trump's pushed and collective bargaining rights for federal workers that have helped to lead the resistance to cuts by billionaire Elon musk's so-called Department of government efficiency by signing up thousands of new members joining protests and by filing many lawsuits on Monday the national treasury employees union which represents workers in 37 federal agencies sued the Trump Administration over an executive order Trump signed Thursday night that calls the unions hostile to his agenda and could block collective bargaining rights for nearly half the federal Workforce and overturn the ability of unions to represent them in negotiations or in court unions have called trumps order the biggest attack on the labor movement in US history the largest federal employee union the American Federation of government employees says it will also challenge the order in court this comes after a federal judge recently ruled in favor of afge and its allies in another case ordering the Trump Administration to reinstate Federal probationary workers fired at six agencies meanwhile another round of layoffs for federal workers is underway this morning this time for as many as 10,000 workers at the health and human services department for more we go directly to Washington DC where we're joined by ever Kelly president of the American Federation of government employees to say the least ever Kelly your union is under attack talk about President Trump's uh executive order and how you're fighting back okay well first of all thank you for having me here today um you know as you know uh this executive order uses uh National Security uh for the actions however we know this is just pretext not justification uh because there's no way that you've had uh employees such as nurses and doctors and scientists you know in a collective bargaining agreement for decades and all of a sudden now uh they're not uh able to be in a a an agreement you know that's strictly pretextual and has nothing to do with National Security and and and and and this is the thing that go ahead what no no go ahead you know I I was just going to say this is nothing but retaliation against our Union for standing up for his members but this is our job this is what we should do is stand up for because you know it's been proven that what this Administration is trying to do to federal employees is illegal you know and we will continue to fight for the membership we will continue to fight for America and we will continue to fight for democracy that's our job and we are outraged by this could you talk about how the uhu to what extent is this historic these attacks on federal workers how does this compared to what other administrations have done in the past in terms of the federal Workforce you know again this is you know this Workforce was under the first Trump Administration he didn't think that that was a need at that time when you had a pandemic going on when you had crisis in the world you know he didn't think there was a need to place these employees under this uh National Security uh threat you know and that's exactly what it is it's it's designed to silence uh workers is designed to make sure that employees uh keep their head down and don't say anything don't hold anyone accountable because for decades these employees have been under contract it's never been a problem like I said even under the Trump first Administration it wasn't a problem and all of a sudden it's a problem why because we've been winning in court we've been challenging this Administration and we will continue to challenge this Administration what they don't understand is this afg is here to represent the members we will be here we will we will here before this Administration came on board will be here after it leaves that's the thing that uh they hadn't understood about afge well since 1978 with the civil service for formac all federal workplaces are considered open shops which means the workers no are not required to pay union dues can you talk about what's been happening in recent months in terms of of of uh federal employees deciding to pay up union dues well you know and that's true you know this is an open shop no one is required to pay union dues when people join this Union they voluntarily join and over the past few months uh people have been noticing the attack on federal employees they're realizing the need for a union and people are joining this Union I mean it's been massive amounts of employees that have decided you know what I want to be a part of this Union because they see that the union is standing there you in the way matter of fact you know I just believe this that if we don't stand the very democracy of this country will soon be gone and people realize that employees realize that and so they are now saying you know what I want to be a part of this Union because this Union is standing for America ever Kelly I'm wondering if you can respond to the federal judge ruling in favor of your union the afge ordering the Trump Administration to reinstate Federal probationary workers can you explain what kind of Union production Pro probationary workers have and let's be clear um there's different kinds of probationary workers you've got the um workers who've maybe just uh come on board in the last year or two and you've got the longtime workers who get a promotion and so then they're in a period of probation so they could be there for 20 years um they get um elevated and suddenly they're fired yeah you know this is unheard of um first of all you know to be a Prohibition employee just like you said you know it could be a person that just been doing such an amazing job that they got a promotion and they've been on that promotion for 90 days or they've been on that promotion for a year and you know this Administration come in and said because you're a probationary employee you're fired right but this is the thing they need to understand they're not on probation they own a probationary appointment um you know and this Administration was wrong uh the court admits that they were wrong the court shows that they was wrong and you know we are going to continue to make sure that we point out these irregularities and these uh illegal uh actions that this Administration is taken against federal employees the these prois employees was very vulnerable because a lot of them have very few rights this Administration knew that and so they came after them but fge stood up for them FG going to continue to stand up for any employee that is wrongfully terminated I wanted to ask you uh dolge and the Trump Administration have pushed this reasoning uh for their aggressive dismantling of federal Services the federal government is too big uh can you talk about this issue uh that they claim that there's too many people working especially since the biggest employer is the defense department in terms of Civilian employees okay again you know it's just pretextual it is is a way of Turning People attention away from the real issue because when you look at the facts uh the population has exploded since 1970 but the federal Workforce is the same today as it was in 1970 in the 70s so that is just prote that is not true you know and certainly um you know this Workforce is needed uh the services that is provided to the American people uh these are the people that do that these are the workers these are the nurses uh that provide the services for the veterans that need assistance these are the people that provide the services for uh the food inspection to make sure that the food we eat is uh safe the air we breathe in EPA is safe these are the people that make sure that the public fly safely that's under attack you know so this is just protectable it is not that the the government is too large you know these are people that are trying to uh take over the government and give contracts to that big up but it's that's the real issue here ever Kelly as we begin to wrap up there are ma there are protests at every level you've got as we speak New Jersey senator Booker on the floor of the Senate filibustering you've got lawsuits like yours and those all over the country and you've got people in the streets you're going to be smaking at the April 5th Mass mobilization on Saturday at the hands off rally organized by indivisible um where there I think around the country they're going to be something like 800 rallies protesting Trump and Elon musk's what they're calling a power grab can you talk about give us a little preview about what you're going to say well first of all you know we want to point out the facts you know we want the American people to know that what's Happening Here is is is not what's being said by the administration what's happening is that there is a power grab because this is about power this is about an Administration wanting to have their way regardless of the rule of law you know and is so full of lawlessness and we're trying to point that out to the American people we're also trying to make the point that you know if you continue to reach and grab the uh uh Federal Workforce and disallow them to do their job is going to affect the services that been provided to the American people because you know the American the the the federal Workforce do their job so well in my uh opinion that many times they're unnoticed when the veteran get the services that he or she needs you know that veteran worker that's doing that work is unnoticed when the food that we eat is inspected and people are not getting sick by that that food inspector's job is really unnoticed when the America fly safely you know the workers at TSA it's really unnoticed when the AE breed is is is is good that work is really unnoticed so they're doing doing that job and they're doing it effectively but the minute that they're not able to do that job and they are downsizing these uh uh positions then the American people are going to feel that and it's going to be dangerous and detrimental to the health and well-being of Americans you know so that's why we are making uh this rally known that's why we're asking people to uh participate Nationwide like you said we're looking at over 800 of these events and I appreciate this uh indivisible for doing what they're doing to bring some awareness to what's happening across this country" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="welcome to another episode of Subro Sessions my name is Melissa Kenny i am an associate here at the White and Williams subregation department today I am here with my co-hosts Katherine Dempsey and Zach Sigda hi Katherine hi Zach hi Melissa hi Zach good morning everybody we're happy to be here so all three of us we investigate a lot of property damage claims involving tenant occupied buildings and residential homes and when it's determined that the tenant is responsible for causing the damage then the issue becomes whether the landlord's carrier can legally pursue the tenant for the amount paid under the claim katherine why don't you tell our audience what we're going to be discussing on that topic today thank you Melissa today we're going to be talking about the Sutton doctrine so the Sutton doctrine is a legal doctrine that regulates the landlord's ability to pursue the tenant essentially there are three jurisdictional approaches involving the Sutton doctrine there are states that abide by the Sutton doctrine where the presumption is that the tenant is considered a co-insured under the landlord's policy absent an express agreement to the contrary the landlord may not pursue segregation against the tenant the second jurisdictional approach are states that are considered anti-set doctrine the presumption is that the tenant is not considered a co-insured under the landlord's policy and therefore there must be an express agreement within the lease that prohibits the landlord from pursuing the tenant the third jurisdictional approach are states that handle the Sutton doctrine on a case-byase basis one of the most important aspects of how these states treat the Sutton doctrine is what the lease language says and what the intention was between the parties yeah thank you Katherine so today we're going to be discussing a case at the Michigan Court of Appeals this is Hastings Mutual Insurance Co verse Naidcs LLC it was a case that was reversed and remanded in October of 2024 to give you a bit of a procedural background here at the trial court level the trial judge denied the defendant who was the tenant in this case their motion for summary judgement and granted a plaintiff's partial motion for summary judgement after the trial court denied the defendant's motion for summary judgement the defendant filed an appeal to the trial court asking them to reconsider which was also denied so all three things form the basis of their appeal to the appeals court so basically here are the basic facts of the case we have a commercial building that's owned by Richard Schaefer he's operating under the business name of Richard Schaefer LLC he's insured by Hastings Mutual Insurance Co the defendant is NIDCHS LLC or Naidcs LLC naidc leased the space from Mr schaefer there is a written lease agreement naidc is in the business of coil processing what that means is that they take these large steel coils and transform them into a variety of shapes and sizes part of their business involves custom paint jobs of the products that they manufacture to do that they have paint booths now the paint booths the operation of these booths can get a little messy and to clean up they use rags to soak up all of the excess paint the fire that occurred and damaged the property that is the basis of this case occurred from spontaneous combustion of improperly stored paint racks so the defendants are arguing that the plaintiff's insurance carrier did not have standing to sue them in the subregation action based off the terms of the lease agreement and just to be clear this is a pretty big case there's over $1.1 million in alleged damages so the trial court decided that per the terms of the lease agreement the defendant was on the hook for the damages however the appeals court disagreed specifically here are the sections of the lease agreement that the appeals court considered in paragraph 16 of the lease agreement that requires the defendants at their own expense to generally keep the building in good repair and deliver up the same in like condition as when taken reasonable use and wear thereof and damage by the elements accepted that's a pretty typical term that you see in a lease agreement basically they get it in one state they have to return it in the same state minus reasonable wear and tear and damage that they couldn't control paragraph 13 of the lease agreement specifically imposes responsibility on Schaefer to repair and restore the building to good tenable condition with reasonable dispatch in the event of a fire so that's the first term of the lease agreement that deals with fire damage paragraph 14 states that the landlord will not be responsible for any repairs resulting from negligence on behalf of the tenants now there's nothing in there that says that the tenants would be responsible for repairing damages caused by their own negligence and this is where the court starts to hinge its decision and finally paragraph six states that the landlord will ensure the building for property damage and for the full replacement value at its sole discretion and shall invoice the tenant for the cost of said insurance the tenant agrees to pay the invoice within 30 days after receiving it so what the appeals court did here is they looked at the plain language of the contract and reading the plain language of paragraph 6 the trial court determined that paragraph 6 was permissive language that the landlord had at its own option it could just decide whether or not it would invoice the tenant for the insurance premiums the appeals court disagreed they said that the language of will and shall that the landlord will ensure the building and shall invoice the defendants for the cost of the insurance is mandatory language and then they also determined that the defendant or the tenant when they entered the bargain the benefit of the bargain was that they would pay these insurance premiums and specifically they say the logic dictates that a tenant would not agree to pay for insurance premiums unless it would also obtain the benefits of the policy so what we have here is the landlord thinks that combining paragraph 16 paragraph 13 and paragraph 14 where we have language that says the landlord is not responsible for the tenants's negligence the tenant has to keep the building in good and reasonable repair and that the landlord would make repairs to the building if you look at that alto together they're saying well this is clearly that the tenant has to pay for damages caused by their own negligence there's also a paragraph here that says that the tenant shall not perform any acts or carry any practices which may injure the building so they are looking at all that language and saying well the tenants's on the hook but the appeals court then went and looked at the plain language of the contract and said &quot;Well in paragraph six it's pretty clear that the landlord will ensure the building and charge the tenant those premiums and thus will be considered a co-insured under the policy or have the benefits of the policy and if that is the case then the landlord cannot prevail so the case was reversed and remanded in favor of the defendants thanks Zach what we learned from this line of case law is that it's definitely important to read the lease language in its entirety in jurisdictions like Michigan that apply the casebycase approach to the Sutton doctrine you always want to check the case in your jurisdiction to get some guidance on whether or not the tenant will be considered implied co-insured and you also want to determine if the lease language addresses who is responsible for maintaining insurance who is responsible for making repairs from the negligent acts of the tenant another important factor to consider is not all leases are written the same not all jurisdictions have the same case law so you want to make sure early on in your investigations involving landlord tenant property damage claims that you are obtaining a copy of that lease agreement and reviewing it in its entirety as Zach just stated the lease agreement that was addressed in this case from Michigan had various paragraphs that addressed whether the tenant was going to be responsible for certain repairs whether the landlord was going to be responsible for maintaining insurance and those issues obviously dictated how the court ultimately reached its decision when you are evaluating whether or not the Sutton doctrine is applied in your jurisdiction it's important to remember that there are three jurisdictional approaches one being jurisdictions that apply the Sutton doctrine this means that the lease must specifically state that the landlord's carrier can pursue the tenant otherwise there is a presumption that the tenant is an implied co-insured in other jurisdictions that apply the anti-suten approach the presumption is that the tenant is not an implied co-insured and in jurisdictions like Michigan that apply the casebycase approach the factors that you want to consider are the reasonable expectations of the parties what the lease language says what type of loss it is and whether or not the tenant is paying the landlord's insurance premiums so hopefully today's episode was

bounceback in the markets this morning follows another selloff on Wall Street on Monday All three major indexes fell at least 2.4% President Trump's demands on Fed Chair J Powell to act on rates are renewing concern about the president meddling with central bank policy Claudia S a former Federal Reserve economist says it is a real concern I take it very seriously and I you know this administration has taken steps whether it's with the tariffs or with downsizing the government that really were you know beyond expectations So I you know the unthinkable is thinkable with this administration Claudia Sam is currently chief economist at New Century Adviserss And concerns about Fed independence also have gold on the rise again this morning Earlier it topped $3,500 an ounce for the first time Right now it's at $3460 Well Nathan the S&amp;P 500 is down by 9% since Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs earlier this month on most US trading partners The chief economist of Apollo Global Management Torston Sllock says a recession is the most likely scenario if the current tariffs take place Maybe it will take a few more weeks maybe the worst case a few a month or two but we will eventually begin to see the net effect if these tariffs stay in place And that's why we think there's a 90% chance of a recession if these tariffs stay at these current levels And Apollo Global Management's Torston Sllock says foreigners own $19 trillion of US equities 7 trillion of treasuries and $5 trillion of US corporate bonds accounting for about 20 to 30% of the total market He says the unwinding of those holdings could cause substantial pain And Karen Bloomberg economics estimates President Trump's tariffs would shave about $2 trillion off global output by the end of 2027 We get

analysts find that for the US Trump's tariffs act like a massive tax hike and is considered a major shock They say one casualty could be Fed independence Whether President Trump attempts to fire Fed Chair Jay Powell or waits until the end of his term it now does look likely that the next Fed chief will be picked at least in part based on alignment with Trump's policy preferences In Washington Amy Morris Bloomberg Radio All right Amy thank you Well President Trump met with major retailers at the White House as executives sought relief from tariffs that have destabilized global supply chains and rattled US consumers Jordan Fabian is Bloomberg News White House editor that China 145% tariff looms large over this conversation and you start to do work across purposes when you have these companies

question like that we have recruitments that's at an all-time high The spirit in the armed forces is fantastic No great confidence The president spoke after a former Pentagon spokesman John Elliot

All of us who are singing the praises of his holiness will uh pray to him and also also follow his legacy Chicago Cardinal Blae Cupich even though it was clear that he was not feeling well he wanted

fall into a coma and then essentially heart failure The Trump administration says starting May 5th federal student loans in default will be referred to debt collection Aisa Canola Banz is the policy

Sports and Nathan [Music] Coast to coast on Bloomberg Radio nationwide on SiriusXM and around the world on Bloomberg.com and the Bloomberg Business app This is Bloomberg Daybreak Good morning I'm Nathan Hager Markets may be due for a bounce back from the steep declines to start the week but the pressure remains on Fed Chair Jerome Powell since President Trump had this to say in the Oval Office last week I don't think he's doing the job He's uh too late Always too late A little slow And I'm not happy with him I let him know it And uh if I want him out he'll be out of there real fast Believe me And the president followed that up this week with a social media post saying there could be a slowing of the economy if Powell doesn't cut interest rates now So let's get more on what's happening in this market We are joined by Daniel Morris chief market strategist at BNP Pariba Asset Management Daniel it's great to speak with you How seriously should the market take this pressure on Chairman Powell as President Trump uh continues pressure around trade good morning Uh good morning Well certainly it's a quite serious topic Uh something that most investors would probably be happier with the status quo than a change of that magnitude So I think it's something absolutely have to pay attention to anticipate what the consequences might be Uh and I think if you look at what's been happening with the dollar in general over the last couple weeks you know this could be another factor if it escalates that would potentially weaken the dollar Well what would the confident or the consequences be Daniel if we did see a serious threat to Federal Reserve independence well I think what ultimately in an abstract uh version of it the reason the argument that you want to have independent central banks is that you don't want the central excuse me the central government the federal government of any country using monetary policy to promote their own uh normally a growth agenda because the concern is going to be is over the medium term you're going to end up with higher inflation So it really does come down to that anchoring of inflation expectations which is so important to central bankers uh and that would be I think the primary risk uh that investors would see Would investor would inflation expectations become unanchored if you had uh a central bank that was viewed as as less independent how would the market take it if the Federal Reserve were to cut interest rates well it's not necessarily a clearcut whether they should or they shouldn't When you're in arguably or approaching a stagflationary environment meaning that in the short term at least uh prices are going to go up So by a definition of a change in prices it's inflationary even if it's not inflationary really in the sense that central banks think about uh in so far it's not necessarily going to be a permanent increase in the rate of price changes but an increase in prices uh that's likely to lead to a slowdown of growth at least in the short term Uh and then given that the Fed has a dual mandate essentially focusing on growth vis the unemployment rate but also inflation you can argue both ways they should potentially be cutting rates to offset the negative impact on growth or raising rates to offset the impact on inflation But if the inflation impact is temporary you would probably fall back to growth So them cutting in this environment isn't necessarily uh an outlandish idea We're seeing that happening in the Euro zone the ECB just cut rate exactly for that reason And we've seen some pretty dramatic estimates of the economic impact if President Trump's tariffs were to remain in place beyond the 90-day pause 90% uh risk of recession from Torston Slack at Apollo Global and Bloomberg Economics estimating $2 trillion in global GDP uh could be shaved off by the end of 2027 Do those estimates make sense well I think we should perhaps recall how bad our forecasting was during the pandemic and what I so it's not to criticize economic forecasting but at the best of times it's not particularly accurate and when you're in an environment that is unprecedented like it was during lockdowns uh your models really aren't of much use at all So I think we certainly can attempt to forecast what would happen with GDP growth in the event that tariffs came back and stayed in place Uh but I think we'd have to acknowledge that there's going to be a huge confidence interval around those estimates simply because there's really been no preceding episode like this to tell us okay that's happened then this is going to happen this time This is Bloomberg Daybreak your morning podcast on the stories making news from Wall Street to Washington and beyond Look for us on your

          <attvalue for="7" value="&gt;&gt; OKAY. RIGHT. WE WILL SEE. THANKS, JEN. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; THANKS, LAWRENCE. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, WELL, DONALD TRUMP SAID TODAY THAT HE WILL ISSUE REFUNDS OF HIS ILLEGAL TARIFFS TO EVERY AMERICAN BUSINESS THAT HAS BEEN FORCED TO PAY THOSE TARIFFS. DONALD TRUMP BEING THE MOST INCOMPETENT PRESIDENT IN HISTORY, AND THE PRESIDENT, WHO KNOWS THE LEAST ABOUT WHAT HIS OWN GOVERNMENT IS DOING, HIS OWN WHITE HOUSE AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT, MEANS THAT IT IS VERY LIKELY TONIGHT THAT DONALD TRUMP IS LEARNING THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME. IT IS VERY LIKELY TONIGHT THAT DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT KNOW UNTIL I JUST SAID IT THAT HE MADE THAT PROMISE. TODAY, DONALD TRUMP'S JUSTICE DEPARTMENT LAWYERS DESPERATELY BEGGING AN APPEALS COURT TO PAUSE THE UNANIMOUS RULING LAST NIGHT BY THE UNITED STATES COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AGAINST THE TRUMP TARIFFS. KNEW THOSE LAWYERS KNEW WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO TELL THE APPEALS COURT TO GET THE APPEALS COURT TO PAUSE LAST NIGHT'S RULING THAT THE TRUMP TARIFFS ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND ILLEGAL. AND SO DONALD TRUMP'S JUSTICE DEPARTMENT LAWYERS PUT IT IN WRITING TODAY THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL ISSUE REFUNDS OF HIS ILLEGAL TARIFFS IF THE FINAL RULING IN THE CASE BY THE APPEALS COURT OR THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AGREES WITH THE REAL JUDICIAL EXPERTS ABOUT INTERNATIONAL TRADE, THAT THE TRUMP TARIFFS ARE ILLEGAL. THE BEST WAY TO HIDE IMPORTANT NEWS LIKE THIS FROM MOST PEOPLE IN THE NEWS MEDIA IS TO PUT IT IN WRITING, IN LEGAL PLEADINGS, THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE IN THE NEWS MEDIA EVER ACTUALLY READ. THERE ARE SOME NEWSPAPER REPORTS ABOUT THE APPEALS COURT DECISION TODAY TO GRANT THE TRUMP JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S REQUEST TO PAUSE THE RULING IN THE CASE, BUT EVEN THOSE REPORTS DON'T FIND THE REASON WHY THE APPEALS COURT DID THAT. THE FEDERAL APPEALS COURT DIDN'T GIVE A REASON WHY THEY DID IT. THE FEDERAL APPEALS COURT UNANIMOUSLY GRANTED A TEMPORARY PAUSE IN LAST NIGHT'S RULING BY THE UNITED STATES COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE, SAYING TODAY, QUOTE, THE REQUEST FOR AN IMMEDIATE ADMINISTRATIVE STAY IS GRANTED. THESE CASES ARE TEMPORARILY STAYED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. WHILE THIS COURT CONSIDERS THE MOTIONS PAPERS, AND THAT'S ALL THE APPEALS COURT SAID, THEY DON'T HAVE TO SAY WHY THEY WERE DOING THAT, AND THEY DID NOT SAY WHY THEY STAYED THE CASE UNTIL AT LEAST JUNE 9TH, WHICH IS NOW THE DEADLINE THEY ISSUED FOR BRIEFS FROM BOTH SIDES TO BE FULLY SUBMITTED TO THE APPEALS COURT. ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS IN ISSUING A STAY DURING AN APPEAL LIKE THIS IS THE STAY WILL NOT HARM THE OTHER SIDE. WHEN YOU'RE ASKING FOR A STAY, YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE COURT THAT THE STAY WON'T HARM THE OTHER SIDE IN THE CASE, AND SO ON. PAGE 25 OF THE TRUMP LAWYERS PLEADING TO THE APPEALS COURT TODAY FOR A STAY IN THE CASE, DONALD TRUMP'S LAWYERS PUT THIS PROMISE FROM DONALD TRUMP IN WRITING TO THE APPEALS COURT, QUOTE, IF TARIFFS IMPOSED ON PLAINTIFFS DURING THESE APPEALS ARE ULTIMATELY HELD UNLAWFUL, THEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL ISSUE REFUNDS TO PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING ANY POST-JUDGMENT INTEREST THAT ACCRUES AND A HUGE AMOUNT OF INTEREST COULD ACCRUE ON THE TARIFFS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN PAID. SO THERE'S DONALD TRUMP'S PROMISE IN WRITING THAT IF AND WHEN HE LOSES THIS CASE IN THE FINAL ADJUDICATION BY THE APPEALS COURT OR BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, ALL OF THE ILLEGALLY COLLECTED TARIFF MONEY BY DONALD TRUMP, ALL OF IT COLLECTED FROM AMERICANS AND AMERICAN BUSINESSES AND ONLY AMERICAN BUSINESSES. ALL OF THE TRUMP TARIFFS WILL BE REFUNDED TO THOSE AMERICANS WHO PAID THOSE ILLEGAL TARIFFS. THE TREASURY OF THE UNITED STATES, WHERE THAT MONEY WAS COLLECTED, KNOWS EXACTLY HOW TO ISSUE REFUNDS. THEY ISSUE REFUNDS TO MANY OF YOU, MILLIONS OF YOU, EVERY YEAR AFTER YOU FILE YOUR TAX RETURNS AND YOU SHOW THAT MORE MONEY HAS BEEN WITHHELD FROM YOUR PAYCHECKS FOR TAXES DURING THE YEAR THAN YOU ACTUALLY OWE, THE TREASURY SENDS OUT MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF SUCH TAX REFUNDS EVERY SINGLE YEAR. TREASURY KNOWS HOW TO DO REFUNDS. AND NOW, WHEN DONALD TRUMP LOSES THIS CASE, THE TREASURY WILL BE BUSY SENDING OUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TRUMP TARIFF REFUNDS. AND WITHOUT DONALD TRUMP'S PROMISE TODAY TO REFUND THAT MONEY, IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT THE APPEALS COURT WOULD HAVE GRANTED THE TRUMP SIDE OF THE CASE A PAUSE IN BEING SUBJECT TO THE RULING MADE BY THE FEDERAL JUDGES ON THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF TRADE COURT, WHO KNOW MORE ABOUT INTERNATIONAL TRADE THAN ANY OTHER JUDGES IN OUR FEDERAL SYSTEM. THE VERY FIRST FEDERAL CASE IN A FEDERAL COURT IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WAS AN INTERNATIONAL TRADE CASE. LITIGATION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE BECAME INCREASINGLY MORE COMPLEX OVER THE CENTURIES, AND IN THE 20TH CENTURY, CONGRESS DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO CREATE A UNIQUE FEDERAL COURT WITH EXPERTISE AND JURISDICTION OVER INTERNATIONAL TRADE CASES. IN 1926, CONGRESS CREATED THE UNITED STATES CUSTOMS COURT. IN 1980, WITH THE JET ENGINE HAVING BROUGHT INTERNATIONAL TRADE TO THE THRESHOLD OF TRUE GLOBAL TRADE, THE CONGRESS CLARIFIED AND ENHANCED THE STANDING OF THE CUSTOMS COURT AND CHANGED ITS NAME TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE. DEMOCRATIC SENATOR DENNIS DECONCINI, WHO SPONSORED THE LEGISLATION, SAID THE NEW COURT WOULD BE, QUOTE, A VASTLY IMPROVED FORUM FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES DEALING WITH IMPORTATIONS. THE PROVISIONS MAKE IT CLEAR TO THOSE WHO SUFFER INJURY IN THIS AREA THAT THEY MAY SEEK REDRESS IN A COURT AND, IF THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL, THE COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD THEM. RELIEF WHICH IS APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY TO MAKE THEM WHOLE. AND SO TODAY, DONALD TRUMP, THROUGH HIS LAWYERS, HAD TO PROMISE TO MAKE THEM WHOLE, HAD TO PROMISE TO REFUND ALL OF THE TRUMP TARIFFS PAID SO FAR IF AND WHEN THEY ARE FOUND TO BE ILLEGAL AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN A FINAL COURT RULING. AND SO, AS MANY HUMILIATION DAYS AS DONALD TRUMP HAS HAD SINCE HE STARTED HIS FAILED TRADE WAR REFUND DAY WILL BE THE ULTIMATE HUMILIATION DAY AT THE END OF DONALD TRUMP'S DISASTROUS TRADE WAR. REFUND DAY IS COMING, AND IT WILL BE THE MOST HUMILIATING DAY DONALD TRUMP WILL SUFFER IN HIS LOSING TRADE WAR. TONIGHT. DONALD TRUMP HUMILIATED HIMSELF ONCE AGAIN BY SHOWING HOW IRREVERSIBLY STUPID AND FLAWLESSLY IGNORANT HE IS OF THE ACTUAL WORDS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THEIR MEANING. HE DID THAT IN A SOCIAL MEDIA POST THAT ONCE AGAIN REVEALS THE MOST SEVERE MENTAL WEAKNESS, NOT JUST IN THE HISTORY OF THE PRESIDENCY, BUT IN THE HISTORY OF FEDERAL ELECTED OFFICIALS IN THIS COUNTRY. THE TRUMP SOCIAL MEDIA POST BEGINS BY SAYING THE US COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE INCREDIBLY RULED AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ON DESPERATELY NEEDED TARIFFS. OF COURSE, THE CORRECT WAY OF PUTTING THAT IS THE UNITED STATES COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE PREDICTABLY RULED IN FAVOR OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. DONALD TRUMP GOES ON TO SHOW HIS INABILITY TO PASS A HIGH SCHOOL CIVICS TEST BY SAYING THE HORRIFIC DECISION STATED THAT I WOULD HAVE TO GET THE APPROVAL OF CONGRESS FOR THESE TARIFFS. IN OTHER WORDS, HUNDREDS OF POLITICIANS WOULD SIT AROUND D.C. FOR WEEKS AND EVEN MONTHS TRYING TO COME TO A CONCLUSION AS TO WHAT TO CHANGE, CHARGE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE TREATING US UNFAIRLY. THAT IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN FOR HOW THIS COUNTRY SETS TARIFFS, OR HOW THIS COUNTRY SETS TAX RATES, TARIFFS, THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF CONGRESS ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION. AND HUNDREDS OF POLITICIANS HAVE BEEN SITTING AROUND D.C. FOR WEEKS AND EVEN MONTHS NOW, TRYING TO COME UP WITH A REPUBLICAN BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES, WHICH THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES MANAGED TO PASS BY EXACTLY ONE VOTE. AND YOU NEVER HEARD DONALD TRUMP COMPLAIN ABOUT THE HUNDREDS OF POLITICIANS BEING INVOLVED IN THAT LEGISLATION, HUNDREDS OF POLITICIANS DECIDING EXACTLY HOW TO CUT MEDICAID, HOW TO TAKE HEALTHCARE COVERAGE AWAY FROM AMERICANS. THAT WAS THE WORK OF HUNDREDS OF REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS SITTING AROUND D.C, AS DONALD TRUMP WOULD PUT IT, FOR WEEKS AND EVEN MONTHS. AND WHILE THEY WERE SITTING AROUND D.C, THOSE HUNDREDS OF REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS DECIDED JUST HOW BIG A TAX CUT TO GIVE TO DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY, AND TO ELON MUSK AND TO THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T DECIDE THAT HE'S JUST GOING TO GET TO SIGN THE LEGISLATION WHEN IT ARRIVES AT THE WHITE HOUSE. AND IN FACT, INTERNATIONAL TRADE DEALS OFTEN TAKE SEVERAL YEARS OF PEOPLE SITTING AROUND D.C. AND SITTING AROUND GENEVA AND OTHER CAPITALS IN THE WORLD NEGOTIATING WITH OTHER COUNTRIES THE SPECIFICS OF TRADE DEALS AND WORKING ON THE DETAILS OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE THAT THEN GETS PRESENTED TO CONGRESS IN A FINAL BILL THAT CONGRESS VOTES ON, THAT SETS ALL OF THE TARIFFS THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS. CONGRESS DOES THAT, NOT THE PRESIDENT. AND THERE IS NOT A SINGLE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT IN AMERICA TAKING AN AP GOVERNMENT COURSE THIS YEAR WHO DOES NOT KNOW THAT. DONALD TRUMP GOES ON TO SAY, IF ALLOWED TO STAND, THIS WOULD COMPLETELY DESTROY PRESIDENTIAL POWER. THE PRESIDENCY WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME. EXCLAMATION POINT. NO, DONALD, NO, NO NO, DONALD. IF THE COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE'S DECISION IS ALLOWED TO STAND, THAT MEANS THE PRESIDENCY WOULD BE THE SAME AS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PRESIDENCY IN WHICH NO PRESIDENT, OTHER THAN DONALD TRUMP, EVER TRIED TO RANDOMLY SET NEW TARIFFS ALL AROUND THE WORLD, ALL BY HIMSELF. NO PRESIDENT FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON TO BARACK OBAMA AND THEN JOE BIDEN EVER DID THAT. PRESIDENTS ARE EMPOWERED BY LAW TO MAKE VERY MINOR, VERY SPECIFIC, VERY TEMPORARY CHANGES IN TARIFFS FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCTS FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID. HE PUT A 10% TARIFF ON THE ENTIRE PLANET. CONGRESS COULD DO THAT. THEY COULD PASS AN ECONOMICALLY IDIOTIC 10% TARIFF ON THE ENTIRE WORLD. BUT EVEN THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS ISN'T THAT STUPID. THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS IS NOT AS STUPID AS DONALD TRUMP ABOUT TARIFFS. AND SO DONALD TRUMP HAS LAUNCHED INTO HIS TARIFF MADNESS ALONE, THE ONLY PRESIDENT IN HISTORY TO HAVE DONE SO. AND WITH AN EXCLAMATION POINT, THE UTTERLY LOST OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE TELLS US THAT THE PRESIDENCY WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME IF WE ACTUALLY RESTORE, THROUGH SANE COURT DECISIONS, PRESIDENTIAL POWER TO WHAT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN. FROM THE DAY GEORGE WASHINGTON TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE, DONALD TRUMP'S PERMANENTLY SMILING AND TOTALLY INCOMPETENT ECONOMIC ADVISOR, WHO NEVER ACHIEVED TENURE. IN HIS BRIEF CAREER AS A LOW LEVEL ECONOMICS PROFESSOR BEFORE BECOMING DONALD TRUMP'S ECONOMICS PROFESSOR IN RESIDENCE, TOOK HIS FROZEN SMILE TO FRIENDLY TELEVISION INTERVIEWERS TODAY BY SAYING THAT THE RULING BY THE COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE WILL NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT AT ALL ON THE TRUMP TEAM'S SO-CALLED TRADE NEGOTIATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, IN WHICH THEY PROMISE TO DELIVER 90 TRADE DEALS AND 90 DAYS, AND HAVE NOT YET DELIVERED A SINGLE TRADE DEAL, NOT ONE. AND WHILE THE CHILDISH BY STANDARDS OF THE ECONOMIC PROFESSION. KEVIN HASSETT WAS PUBLICLY SPEWING HIS NONSENSE ABOUT A COURT RULING AGAINST THE TRUMP TARIFFS HAVING NO EFFECT ON THE COUNTRIES THAT THE TRUMP TEAM IS TRYING TO NEGOTIATE WITH. OF COURSE, OF COURSE, THE TRUMP TEAM WAS IN COURT PUTTING IN WRITING EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. THE OTHER POINT THAT THE TRUMP LAWYERS HAD TO CONVINCE THE APPEALS COURT OF TODAY IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A STAY WAS THAT IF THEY DIDN'T OBTAIN A STAY, THEIR SIDE OF THE CASE WOULD SUFFER WHAT THE LAW CONSIDERS IRREPARABLE HARM. WHILE INSISTING THAT THE PLAINTIFFS WOULD SUFFER NO HARM BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT WILL SIMPLY REFUND TO THEM THE TRUMP TARIFF MONEY IF THEY WIN. THE TRUMP LAWYERS INSISTED THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS ALREADY SUFFERING HARM TO HIS SO-CALLED TRADE NEGOTIATIONS BY THE RULING OF THE COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE, BECAUSE IT TAKES AWAY WHAT THE TRUMP LAWYERS CALLED THE CREDIBLE THREAT. THAT WAS THEIR THEIR PHRASE, CREDIBLE THREAT OF DONALD TRUMP'S TARIFFS, WHICH MEANS THAT, QUOTE, FOREIGN COUNTERPARTS WILL HAVE REDUCED INCENTIVES TO REACH MEANINGFUL AGREEMENTS. THE SECRETARY OF STATE, SECRETARY OF TREASURY AND US TRADE REPRESENTATIVE SIMILARLY EXPLAINED THAT THE TRADE NEGOTIATIONS CURRENTLY ONGOING WITH DOZENS OF COUNTRIES, ARE IN A DELICATE STATE AND COULD BE SHATTERED BY AN INJUNCTION AGAINST THE TARIFFS. SO THERE WAS THE SMILING CLOWN OF TRUMP ECONOMIC POLICY ON TELEVISION, TELLING YOU THE RULING BY THE COURT HAS NO EFFECT AT ALL ON THEIR NEGOTIATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, WHILE AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME, THE TRUMP JUSTICE DEPARTMENT LAWYERS ARE IN COURT TELLING THE APPEALS COURT THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN SHATTERED BY THE COURT RULING AGAINST THE TRUMP TARIFFS. QUOTE, THOSE NEGOTIATIONS ARE PREMISED ON THE ABILITY OF THE PRESIDENT TO IMPOSE TARIFFS UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY ECONOMIC POWERS ACT. JUST ANOTHER DAY IN TRUMP LAND, THE TRUMP CLOWNS ON TV SAYING ONE THING THE TRUMP LAWYERS FUNCTIONALLY UNDER OATH IN COURT, SAYING EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE, AND THE GOOFY CHAOS AGENT AT THE CENTER OF IT ALL NOT HAVING THE SLIGHTEST IDEA WHAT HE'S DOING OR WHAT THE PEOPLE ON HIS TEAM IN COURT ARE SAYING. DONALD TRUMP IS LOST IN THE WHITE HOUSE TONIGHT. HE IS LOST IN THE MADNESS OF HIS TRADE WAR. HE DOES NOT HAVE AND HAS NEVER HAD THE MENTAL CAPACITY TO COMPREHEND A SINGLE ELEMENT OF WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. DONALD TRUMP MAKES EVERY PRESIDENT WHO PRECEDED HIM LOOK BETTER, INCLUDING THE CRIMINAL RICHARD NIXON, WHO WAS NOT HALF AS CRIMINAL AS DONALD TRUMP, WHO, UNLIKE RICHARD NIXON, HAS ACTUALLY BEEN CONVICTED OF CRIMES AND WAS RICHARD NIXON WAS SUPREMELY COMPETENT COMPARED ONLY TO DONALD TRUMP. RICHARD NIXON'S WORST DAY WAS BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP'S BEST DAY IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND THAT IS NOT SOMETHING I SAID DURING THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. BUT THE SECOND TRUMP PRESIDENCY HAS TURNED OUT TO BE MUCH, MUCH WORSE THAN HIS FIRST PRESIDENCY. OF COURSE, THE TRUMP TARIFF REFUNDS WON'T MAKE SOMEONE WHOLE IF THEIR COMPANY HAS ALREADY GONE OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE OF THE TRUMP TARIFFS. AND SO, UNTIL THE FINAL ADJUDICATION OF THE TRUMP TARIFF CASE AT THE APPEALS COURT OR THE SUPREME COURT, THE TRUMP TARIFFS WILL CONTINUE TO HARM" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="Duisburg is home to Europe's biggest inland port, and in 2014 was subject to a high-profile visit by Xi Jinping. Since then the German inland port city has most definitely been on the map in China - as the destination for an increasing number of freight trains from the country.&#10;&#10;Duisburg is, together with the likes of Liège or Genoa, one of the revived Silk Road's gateways to Europe. The project is set to be completed in 2049, with the aim of consolidating China's status as a global economic and political player. The most immediate manifestation of Beijing's ambitions in Europe is the huge investment in logistics and infrastructure. The &quot;Belt and Road&quot; initiative incorporates a network of railway lines, airports and shipping routes - most of them either run or controlled by China. Supporters in Europe point to the economic growth potential, while critics warn of growing dependence on China. &#10;&#10;The Silk Road project had been powering ahead in recent years - until a succession of pandemic-related lockdowns in China disrupted its international trade routes and supply chains. Both Beijing's plans and those of its partners are being compromised by COVID-19 coupled with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The gigantic investments in ports, container terminals, railways and logistics hubs for land, sea and air links constitute both a challenge and a hugely promising opportunity. &#10;&#10;This documentary focuses on three key locations at the European end of the &quot;21st century Silk Road&quot;: the inland port of Duisburg, Liège with one of the continent's biggest cargo airports and the new Alibaba logistics hub, and major Italian seaport Genoa. The film reveals the degree to which they are already integrated into the Chinese trade network, and examines the prospects of the &quot;21st century Silk Road&quot; in light of China's zero-COVID strategy and its partnership with Russia.

          <attvalue for="7" value="Every day, masses of cargo containers arrive in Europe. A growing number come from China. What's vital for both sides is that trade continues in both directions. China has a gigantic plan for a global network of ports, roads, railways and other infrastructures to connect China to the world. This Belt and Road Initiative — dubbed the New Silk Road — has a clear strategy. Everyone knew this is about brutal self-interest — both economic and geopolitical — and had to accept that. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the risks inherent in such global trade structures. I think this should be a lesson to us in terms of dependence on China. The best place to learn about such dependency is where the new Silk Road is already a reality. We visited three cities to see how big China's presence in Europe currently is and how dependent the people affected feel. Our first stop is Duisburg in Germany, home to the biggest inland container port on the planet. Comprising 21 harbors and 130 cranes, last year alone it handled more than four million containers. Duisburg is one of the European termini of China's monumental New Silk Road project — which many, including the port authority company, see as a positive development. We're the hotspot in Europe — by far the most profitable location. It's not as if they chose Duisburg because it's pretty. Duisburg is a city shaped by the coal and steel industries and by their decline. After struggling to adapt and restructure its economy, the city welcomed the commercial opportunities from becoming a major junction on China's revived Silk Road. President Xi Jinping's first ever state visit to Germany, in 2014, included a trip to Duisburg. He welcomed the freight train arriving from China, a symbolic confirmation of Duisburg becoming part of the Silk Road. I expect to see a significant boost for our operations. The Chinese market is of such paramount importance that our port has to use this opportunity. The New Silk Road is an undertaking of colossal proportions. It includes two railway routes crossing Asia and then Europe. One via Russia, Belarus and Poland, and another further south taking in Central Asia, Iran and Turkey. There's also a sea link between China and the Mediterranean, via the Indian Ocean and the Suez Canal and new air freight routes — all designed to increase trade volume between China and Europe. But the Belt and Road Initiative incorporates far more than just trade with Europe. It has already seen the construction of countless bridges, tunnels, railway lines, roads and ports across Asia and Africa, in most cases built by Chinese firms with Chinese workers. The biggest infrastructure project of the 21st century involves enormous investments that are largely welcomed by the countries in question while ultimately serving to enhance China's power and influence. The port of Duisburg already had a highly developed infrastructure in place, making it a particularly attractive location for Chinese importers. Around 30 trains a week currently travel back and forth between China and Duisburg. Each journey covers around 11.000 km and takes around two weeks. On board are clothes, medicinal products, electronics, automotive parts and toys. Almost a third of all Chinese goods arriving in Europe by train are offloaded in Duisburg. Frankly we initially thought: What a crazy idea, a train from China to Duisburg, but let’s let them go ahead. Since then, public awareness has been greater than the economic significance. Of course the trains with all these colorful Chinese characters on the containers look interesting. But to put it into perspective: Before the pandemic we typically had close to 30 trains a week going to and from China — and we do again now. Over an entire year, that adds up to between 250 and 300.000 standard-size containers. From Duisburg, they're offloaded for further dispatch via a network of sea and land routes to 92 cities and ports across Europe or they are sent back to China. A growing number of Chinese companies have now set up business in Duisburg. The company LMAR opened a logistics center here. It capitalizes on the advantages of transportation by rail, which is cheaper than air freight and faster than by ship. China currently has a very good infrastructure. That means: If I want to make a car, for example - a VW or a Tesla — where do I get a missing bolt? I can buy it from one of the factories in the industrial park next-door. That's my infrastructure. So in the long term, it's difficult to replace China because they already have the infrastructure in place. But the New Silk Road project first and foremost serves China's strategy for greater global influence. Nobody at the port of Duisburg thought this was set up by the Chinese government or Xi Jinping for the benefit of the world. Everyone knew this is about brutal self-interest — both economic and geopolitical — and had to accept that. For President Xi Jinping the initiative was part of a long-term plan geared to the milestone year of 2049, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. For the current leadership in Beijing — so Xi Jinping’s line-up — the aim is to make China the central global power over the next decades. And that means: First keeping the US's economic hegemony in check, and then taking its place. The objective, say various political analysts, is to establish a new world order in which China is the pre-eminent power with various repercussions for Europe. One of the US's strengths is its network of alliances. Europe plays a major role here due to its economic, technological and political clout. So what the regime in Beijing wants to do is drive as deep a wedge as possible between the EU and the US. The Silk Road project could be just such a wedge. For partners, it poses a range of dangers in terms of new dependencies. Exertion of power through trade is the new reality that for a growing number of observers is cause for alarm. Maintaining trade benefits us and China. But you have to make sure trade doesn’t open the door for political power being exercised. Ultimately it comes down to the liberal values we have and want to defend. And then you have China with its dictatorial surveillance-state system, keen to ensure the same in various countries along that route. So as such, that does pose a threat to our way of life. Our second destination is Genoa, home to one of the oldest and largest ports on the Mediterranean coast. But it's in need of modernization and expansion, while the city's road and rail links are likewise in poor shape. Which is why Chinese investments were a welcome development. Genoa is now also part of the New Silk Road, and the center of the Liguria region's cluster of four trade ports. PSA, previously called the Port of Singapore Authority, opened an office here. PSA is one of the biggest port terminal operators in the world and a partner of both the New Silk Road and Chinese state-owned shipping company Cosco. Together with Cosco, it's the biggest investor in the regional port operator. The terminal's five cranes have the capacity to handle over half a million containers a year but in 2021 shifted only half that amount. Ship traffic has been down due to the pandemic, and then there's the growing size factor. Today's new container ships are up to 400 meters long and can accommodate up to 20.000 containers — too big to dock here. But there are plans to change that. This is not a regional port. It's always been international, which will increase further due to these corporations. Enrico Poggi and his fellow union-representatives face a dilemma. The foreign investment is key to securing local jobs at the port but it comes at a price. Chinese companies have different concepts of speed and efficiency and are keen to take control. It's a question of jobs on the one hand versus workers' rights and conditions on the other. The unions in Genoa are preparing for conflict. The Chinese came here with their stopwatches. They had their own system, permanently monitoring everyone. And that resulted in a serious clash with the union. This is why we're preparing to defend ourselves if need be, in order to be able to negotiate for the years to come, which will be decisive. Anxiety over Chinese dominance is growing, people fear an accelerated pace of work, permanent surveillance and a drop in standards. But ultimately, those fears are often outweighed by the prospect of job losses and financial hardship. Nobody wants to see a port with empty docks. Working at a port is very demanding — 365 days a year, 24/7. We need a system that guarantees a decent retirement for the one group, while also ensuring jobs for the next generation. Because if we can’t provide young people with jobs, poverty here will grow. The PSA logo looms large over the entrance to the new, modern Genoa-Pra container facility, 20 km west of the old port. Its deep-sea terminals can unload two 400-meter-long ultra-large container ships at the same time. Singapore-based PSA has strong commercial ties with China. One of the first big changes by the investors was to replace the old Italian crane facilities with gigantic new structures by Shanghai port-equipment supplier ZPMC, and installed by Chinese workers. But at least, people say, the port is still majority-Italian-owned. Our ports cannot be sold. The most that investors can get is a lease agreement, which has a fixed term. And after that expires, the lease is subject to a new tender process. This prevents Chinese companies from acquiring complete or at least majority ownership of a port. The lease contracts and other cooperation agreements that consolidate the influence of Chinese investors tend to have a duration of several decades. The Pra terminal has mushroomed over the last few years. 12 mega-cranes have sprung up here since the first was installed in 2016. For the investors, a port is merely a stepping stone: A gateway to the rest of Europe, and a crucial link in the supply chain to consumers across the continent. These infrastructure projects often lead to the creation of industrial parks, free-trade zones and trade-investment zones in which European companies — in this case Italian — work with Chinese firms. The aim is to boost imports and exports in both countries. The headquarter of Hong Kong-based operator Kerry Logistics in Milan. The Italian logistics service provider Tuvia Italia used to be here. But in 2017, its founder, Guido Nazzari, sold his majority stake to Kerry Logistics — strengthening China’s control over its supply chains. Our company makes extensive use of the port of Genoa's services and all of its terminals. The port operators are a vital part of the logistics chain. Unfortunately, Italy suffers from a prevailing infrastructure problem. For us that means difficulties related to highways, railways and other transportation routes. Kerry Logistics claims to be the world's eighth-largest freight services provider. It oversees the transportation and storage of all manner of products exported by China, from pharmaceuticals and chemical goods to food, clothing and electronics. Tuvia Italia founder Guido Nazzari made a conscious decision to sell his company to a Chinese firm with global ambitions. He soon saw what it was that the new owners were primarily interested in. At the time of the takeover, we thought everything would change overnight — in terms of both management and the work procedures. But the only real change came in one area: Everything connected to cost control, statistics and the capacity to gather data on our operations, all of which became a priority after the arrival of Kerry Logistics. The Kerry Logistics network encompasses around 1.000 locations in over 50 countries. The company is mainly active on the online retail front. It sells goods straight from manufacturer to consumer, or to distributors such as Amazon and Alibaba. With no middlemen involved, this means complete control over the supply chain. Stefano Poliani is head of integrated logistics at Kerry's Italian subsidiary. Five years ago, we didn't have any online operations. Today, this entire section of the warehouse is for e-commerce. And suppliers — not just from China but elsewhere in eastern Asia — have played a huge part. But the Chinese companies are naturally the most important ones, conveying both goods and trade secrets. This part of the warehouse has two areas that are unfortunately off-limits for camera crews. They are where we store material for the 5G devices of two major Chinese manufacturers, so filming is not permitted for security reasons. The activities there are very specific, and go right up to the assembly of those devices. Highly sensitive Chinese technology for the 5G telecoms networks of Chinese companies, including assembly. China's strategy of maximum control evidently extends to more than just the supply chain side. The solution we provide does everything from picking up goods from Chinese suppliers, organizing the containers and importing the goods to Italy, including customs clearance. Plus storage and final delivery. That means customers have a single point of contact and don’t have to lose time organizing the supply chain. Supply chains essentially being 100% Chinese-controlled obviously means data transparency for China. They'll know which goods are headed from where to where, which could of course weaken our competitive position. If there's only a handful of suppliers for ports, for rail transportation or for maritime shipping, then they'll control the prices — to the detriment of our companies. One end of the Chinese supply chain network comprises Alibaba and subsidiary Taobao — akin to Amazon, E-Bay and a bank, all in one. According to company figures, it sells 48.000 products per minute. And has a market capitalization of 700 billion dollars. Our third destination is the Belgian city of Liège, where Alibaba is building the biggest logistics center in Europe. I haven’t done an in-depth analysis, but Alibaba surely picked Liège because it has a cargo airport with very high capacity that’s open 24/7. Liège proper is the fourth most populous city in Belgium. And the metro-area is home to 600.000 people. It used to be called the Fiery City, due to the many blast furnaces that once fueled the local economy. But like Duisburg, the city has struggled to recover from the end of coal-mining and the almost complete disappearance of the steel industry. In the 2010s, the unemployment rate sometimes exceeded 20%. The hope now is that the cargo airport - with no night-time restrictions — will change things for good. It's quietly grown to become the fifth-largest freight airport in Europe, according to the operator. Here, too, location has been a critical factor. With increased commercial traffic going hand in hand with growth, it's a win-win situation for both Alibaba and the airport. Alibaba is helping to develop trade with China — at Liége and all other airports in Europe. China is kind of a factory for the world and is as such causing an increase in air freight to airports around the continent. Another location on the New Silk Road that's looking at growth. The airport currently supports 8.700 jobs — and that's set to increase thanks to Alibaba. The facility's management is optimistic about the expansion and Chinese commitment. Right now Cainiao accounts for 6 or 7% of our business. But it's going to be expanding its warehouses and making Liège the center of its logistics activities and trade with Europe. So Cainiao could soon be making up 20 to 25% of our business. But not everyone is happy about these developments. Local activists do not believe the promises of an economic boom. There was talk of thousands of jobs, but that's since come down to 1600. We don't have any current information. We want to see a comprehensive study that will enable us to work out the jobs actually created and also the jobs that have been lost. When you promise to resolve the unemployment crisis in the region, you have to create jobs for local people. If they’re going to Chinese people, it seems a bad deal. The airport expects freight traffic to increase. Transportation by air is pricier than by ship or train but over half of the cargo is perishable goods or needs express delivery, from flowers to live animals. And Alibaba is bringing more e-commerce. China has been part of the airport's growth. Alibaba's logistics arm, Cainiao, arrived 3 or 4 years ago. It opened its first building at the end of 2020, taking up 30.000 square meters of land and adding to the airport's growth. It remains to be seen how many new jobs the expansion will actually translate into. Critics point to the range of environmental regulations being disregarded in return for the growth promised by Alibaba. Alibaba setting up shop in Liège was supported by Belgium or more precisely by Wallonia. We want to highlight the contradiction here. The government has to take big steps to protect the climate and the health of people living here. We say that's never going to be possible with a project like Alibaba at Liège airport. Active opposition to the growing Chinese presence is especially pronounced among the younger generation. The Stop Alibaba campaigners have highlighted their cause by also staging protests at the airport itself. Over the last 2 or 3 years we've seen a growing number of complaints from residents living in the area around the airport, especially about night-time flights. So there's evidently a very substantial Nimby effect. Nimby meaning: not in my backyard. But the activists from Stop Alibaba see a far bigger picture. Their opposition stems from what they feel is unchecked and excessive growth from globalization. Alibaba's logistics center will eventually cover an area of 220.000 square meters. The consequences are foreseeable. There's the impact on people's health from air pollution. Then there's mobility. We have this appalling figure of 1500 additional trucks on the roads every day. Plus the global consequences for the environment and the climate due to the CO2 emissions from all the planes and trucks. China is succeeding in its plan to secure locations that together span the entire supply chain. Freight trains now also arrive in Liège. A further branch of the Silk Road. If the Chinese initiative leads to sound infrastructure in Duisburg and in Liège and that infrastructure is linked up, it would be commercially advantageous for the entire cross-border region. That could also benefit North Rhine Westphalia. However, there's no evidence on the ground to back that up yet. The last few years have provided dramatic examples of the fateful gaps a globally oriented strategy like the New Silk Road has. When sea or land routes are disrupted by a pandemic or a war, supply chains collapse and the full legacy of global dependencies becomes apparent. Unfortunately, the next crisis of global dimensions could happen sooner rather than later. China's conduct in its conflict with Taiwan has been increasingly aggressive. If Beijing chooses to escalate, the West may be obliged to respond as it has done with Ukraine, possibly leading to an even more worrying fallout. China has made clear that in the space of 12 hours it could block off two thirds of the world's semiconductor production without any military conflict with Taiwan. And there would have to be a response. It would be naïve to overlook this and not prepare for that scenario. But how to prepare? China might be becoming an increasingly complicated trade partner for the West, but it is also an indispensable one. So is there a solution? I'm in favor of us being more cautious when it comes to sensitive infrastructure. What I'm not in favor of is immediately demonizing all of these investments just because they're from China. Industry leaders have become more direct and open about the dilemma. We Europeans have basically no choice but to maintain dialog with China. In addition to all the products and services coming in from China, we want to access the Chinese market of course. So what has our journey taught us? In Duisburg, Genoa and Liège the New Silk Road is already firmly in place. The partnership with China promises further and significant growth. But the price to pay is becoming increasingly evident." />

now begins to feed on each other in this video we will be asking what makes this economic downturn so different from the Great Recession in 2008. this is a recession that is unlike perhaps the financial crisis recession that was due to finish crisis that is being felt but every single individual definitely for the years to come we are going to witness a world from a Chinese perspective that we are not accustomed to we will discover the paradoxes that make this downturn unique so the labor market actually looks quite good which is one of the confusing things about today's economy we will assess how easily this crisis can be remedied compared to the last we don't have tools at the moment that could address the recession that we're facing and we will look at the countries who are bucking the negative Trend that's all coming up on business Beyond both the IMF and the World Bank are warning that we are edging towards Global recession but determining what counts as a recession and what doesn't can be complicated there is no official definition a common rule of thumb is that when an economy experiences two consecutive quarters of negative growth it's in recession but a decline in GDP isn't the only indicator other metrics like unemployment levels and consumer confidence also play a role people lose their jobs they have to cut into their savings unemployment can be extremely disruptive personally not just for economic reasons but for one sense of well-being for a recession to happen many factors are at play that's why declaring a recession is often in the hands of national organizations that analyze business Cycles like National recessions Global ones also don't have a clear-cut definition they happen when a large number of major economies are going through an economic slump in our globalized economy a recession in one place spells trouble for another knock-on effects reverberate throughout the globe and that's what has analysts worried right now certainly a global recession is a major risk but our current forecast has what we would call a growth recession we do not have a contraction in the global economy but we have subpar growth with Rising unemployment GDP growth in the global economy is slowing down the international monetary fund predicts that a third of the world economy will likely be in a technical recession next year the US and Eurozone are facing an especially gloomy Outlook in the U.S economic growth is declining to a fifth of its 2021 levels next year in the Eurozone growth is almost completely stalling for many of us the phrase Global recession still conjures up images of publicly shamed bankers and people losing their houses to understand the current economic downturn better it's worth revisiting what happened in 2008 during the financial crisis pushed the world's banking system towards the edge of collapse and left borers no longer able to afford their homes and it all started with a housing bubble in the U.S a whole industry ballooned around giving people mortgages mortgage brokers eventually got greedy they started giving out loans to people that didn't make enough money to pay them back those mortgages were combined into big packages and sold to Banks ultimately the inevitable happened borrowers couldn't pay their loans back and the House of Cards collapsed causing a banking crisis the first recession was a recession that was essentially one that was built on fear of Banks and mistrust people that were in Banks because they weren't sure anymore which of the banks was solvent and which one wasn't so they stopped Landing all together Banks had to be rescued from roon by government bailouts and the crisis spread beyond the United States European Banks had bought a lot of Bad Mortgages from the US so they also collapsed and had to be bailed out by governments many European countries eventually could no longer pay their own debt government budgets were squeezed resulting in years of austerity and dramatically impacting the lives of millions of Europeans so how is the current economic downturn different this time around money isn't the issue there is no Capital shortage in fact if anything Banks and the cap the the the capital markets are sitting on loads of money that at the moment they can't really spend because there is nothing that comes into the EU economy so this time the world isn't short of cash but it's sort of almost everything else when the pandemic struck the fragility of Supply chains became apparent factories from Asia to Europe and North America halted production sending the global economy into a free fall as countries emerged from lockdowns demand for goods and services returned faster than Supply now swelling orders have outstripped availability businesses across the economy have struggled to hire workers food and energy prices are on the rise adding to that the world's manufacturing Powerhouse has closed shop in China lockdowns continue to wreak havoc chienping's zero covet policy aims to isolate every individual case of covet 19. a strict implementation means regular shutdowns make business and Manufacturing extremely difficult when they get waves you know entire cities are shut down and that affects the supply chain throughout the world now shortages of one thing have turned into shortages of another a scarcity of semiconductors has halted car manufacturing and unlike during the us-led financial crisis it's Europe that feels unique pressure now with the world Supply chains and trouble are ready one added Factor made for the perfect storm on the continent the war in Ukraine [Music] which woke us up to the realization that Europe is relying on is for one of the most important inputs for its production namely energy on a very very unreliable partner for decades Russia was Europe's main provider of gas delivering almost half of the Block's gas supply but that's drastically changed this year as Europe has rushed to find alternative energy sources Europe needs to reduce energy Demand by 10 percent that already means that we will get into an economy that produces uh produces much less but it's not just energy that's become a casualty of the war Ukraine is one of the biggest agricultural exporters in the world since the Russian invasion food prices are on the rise for the European and for the global economy supply shortages and a drastic rise in food and energy costs make for a toxic cocktail if the demands stay the same and the supply of a good falls in the price Rises if you have that across the economy as a whole in the labor market in many Goods markets in energy markets and in Food Markets then you have a generalized inflation for the first time the world is facing an inflation crisis the U.S the United Kingdom and the Eurozone are especially feeling the price surge in the EU inflation is the highest it has ever been in the US it's at a 40-year high inflation is a major challenge for all of us around the world too much money is chasing too few goods that means items we need for our day-to-day lives are getting more expensive it's also what makes this economic downturn so different from the last this is a recession that is unlike perhaps the financial crisis recession that was due to finish crisis uh that is being felt but every single individual simply because all of us have to use energy at home and and all of us understand that when inflation is high with the pregnancy power of our salaries or of our income and of our wealth reduces the cost of living crisis confronting the world is now causing a shift in global economic policy making Central Bankers say they've had enough of Rapid price Rises we took today's decision and expect to raise interest rates further because inflation remains far too high and is likely to stay above our Target for an extended period we have both the tools that we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the Bedrock of our economy and the U.S reduced a boost to encourage Banks to start lending and help economies weather the storm this time they're flipping the script for every Central Bank that is currently cutting interest rates there are now 25 that are raising them according to Deutsche Bank a ratio that hasn't been seen in decades by making it more expensive to buy a car get a mortgage or use a credit card they hope to reduce people's spending and slow inflation but the tools that will fix Rising prices also stall economic growth it means that we have two problems and we have both low growth and high prices and therefore the policy makes then is to address this crisis needs to be quite different and also the policy mix is a little bit more Awkward if you like in terms of meeting the two problems central banks are facing a difficult Balancing Act raising interest rates could further sink a rudderless economy doing nothing means letting inflation run loose there's several real questions that we'll determine how the next year plays out first how effective are central banks in reducing the inflation without sending the economy into you know worse recession that would be required it's very difficult to get monetary policy just right because there are substantial lags in the system right so what's perfect for today policy wise we often can't tell until six months down the road and something else feels different about this economic downturn especially in the world's biggest economy the United States for many people the word recession means worrying about losing your job that's because the two usually go hand in hand in the U.S GDP went down in 2008 and unemployment went up this July the country's unemployment rate was the lowest it has been in half a century and it has stayed exceptionally low since despite an economic downturn so the labor market actually looks quite good which is one of the confusing things about today's economy you have some indicators that look very positive and and consistently so and you have some indicators that are far more worrisome but the the labor market indicator in the U.S in particular is very strong unemployment is quite low labor force participation is good job openings are high relative to the number of people seeking jobs so this is a time of enormous labor market opportunity and strength for a lot of American workers this is a unique time in the U.S companies can't afford to lose employees because many of them are having problems finding workers in the first place but the US is facing a paradox despite a strong job market people are worried especially those looking to start their careers current class of 2023 is certainly worried about the current economic situation so about 50 percent of our respondents from one of our most recent surveys shared that they absolutely have some concerns and anxiety [Music] things are looking good and gloomy at the same time and that is making Americans feel uneasy sumer's sentiment is a measure that shows how people feel about the economy and whether they will spend or save their money right now people are only feeling slightly more optimistic than during the 2008 recession and what does that mean for the future of the US economy the job numbers are looking much Rosier than during the last economic downturn but how people feel is a core driver of economic growth and a pessimistic Outlook can turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy a very different economy but one which is also going through a turbulent period is the world's second largest China Decades of surging growth have seen China dramatically catch up with the U.S economy in terms of size but policy makers in Beijing are now grappling with a multi-faceted economic crisis the pandemic and the real estate bubble have combined to take a hammer to something which China had come to take for granted economic growth China's annual GDP growth has steadily declined over the past decade somewhat inevitable given how Hyde has been before the pandemic the country was still recording growth of around seven percent but following a bounce back in 2021 the IMF now expects the Chinese economy to grow by just three percent in 2022 what we have been witnessing for the past nine months roughly is a continuous slowdown of the growth dynamic in China during the 2008 financial crisis China introduced a huge fiscal stimulus package many analysts created this as the reason China weathered and recovered from that storm much quicker than other major economies if you look at the 2008-2009 recession the Chinese fiscal response was quite um strong like they did a good job keeping the Chinese economy going despite that recession and that was helpful to the world economy as a whole if Chinese growth helped the global economy out of the last crisis it's unlikely to do so this time around China's zero covert policy and the Draconian rules that accompany it are a big reason that largely send a message to Chinese consumers and investors that now in China politic trumps everything when politics would come as a as a hindrance for economic growth the Chinese Communist Party would would make the right call and and let economy Prevail what zero covet has notified is that that perception is if not wrong at least no longer viable um in in in XI jinping's China zero covet has dampened Chinese economic sentiment and sapped domestic consumption Chinese consumer spending is more than 10 percent less than it was before the pandemic another major factor driving China's problems is its housing market China's property sector has been in crisis since 2020. new government regulations on debt aimed at Cooling and overheated real estate market saw companies like evergrant run out of cash soaring property debt has been described as a systemic risk for the entire economy and since the Crisis began China's housing market has experienced a severe downturn between zero covid and the real estate crisis China has enough problems of its own to contend with and that's having a knock-on effect around the world if China is not buying that means that Europe is not selling so I think there is there is there is an element of sort of bad news if you like coming also from the Chinese economy slowing down so what does this all mean for China and the world economy as a whole well the Chinese economy is still growing not Contracting but a Slowdown has already begun and it may be part of a longer term shift there was this almost unbreakable feeling that the Chinese leadership or the Chinese Communist Party put it as you wanted would guarantee that their children or a decade to come will be richer than the decade that has just passed and indeed that was rooted in almost five Decades of astonishing economic success nowadays it seems that the Chinese households understand that the growth driver that they've experienced for the past decade has run out of fuel and that the Chinese leadership in Beijing is ambitioning to redirect the economy towards a new form of equilibrium it appears that the engine which helped jump start the world out of the last Global recession won't be up to the task this time around it's clear that the world's biggest economies are facing a storm but one area of the world has been bucking the trend during the 2008 crisis China was still outpacing its Asian neighbors now for the first time since 1990 other Asian countries are set to outperform China economically growth is still outpacing inflation here I would have never thought right I think it's it's just the difference in Cycles because uh Asia asean and India you know they were they were really buffeted by our first The Wave in 2020 then the Delta Delta wave in in 2021 but thankfully not So Much by Omicron and you know they are coming out of their lockdowns for most of this year as China went into a lockdown uh this year because of the zero covered uh approach so just you know it's still very much Kobe Centric that that difference and in terms of their demand emerging economies are benefiting as China's zero covert policy is worrying investors if China goes into lockdown where is your alternate production base in Asia you know should you be moving to an Indonesia in the Asia Pacific Indonesia has been thriving especially Against All Odds economic growth has been outperforming forecasts here and inflation is still slightly under six percent the cost of living crisis is crashing down on Europe and the us but in Indonesia government fuel subsidies have softened the blow the Indonesian government is setting its own prices for gas so-called administered prices Indonesia is definitely benefited from a lot of policy support so the reason inflation is so low is because it's administered price there and you've and because that has kept that low the central bank has not been under so much pressure too high the subsidies have amounted to a hefty bill for Indonesia's government and might not be sustainable in the future at the same time Rising commodity prices around the world have actually helped this economy Indonesia's coal exporters are bringing in record earnings the country is looking at a promising 2023 so at 4.7 I would still say that growth Outlook is is looking pretty resilient uh next year especially you know when we talk about our major economies entering recession at the beginning of this video we looked back on the recession of 2008 and we asked how this economic downturn will be different what the experts we spoke to described was a crisis not triggered by Banks but when partially set off by War and by politics are there some things that are inevitable like standing up for democracy as the Europeans and as Ukraine and as the United States are trying to do right now I think you know the cost of that um is not zero right and but some things are worth paying a cost for um of course governments should do whatever they can to cushion their citizens from these costs but I don't think telling citizens that the cost is zero is is realistic or true and there are some things in life that are you know worth making a sacrifice for with bank bailouts and regulation policy makers have the tools to react to the financial crisis but much of what's happening right now is outside of policy makers control the mechanisms to address the supply side crisis are you know nothing more than invade China and force them to produce semiconductors invade Russia enforce Putin to to to to to stop invading Ukraine and and loosen energy superbly and so on and that's obviously not going to happen so we don't really have tools in the normal State of Affairs we don't have tools at the moment that could address the recession that we're facing while central banks intervene to stimulate the economy in 2008 they are adding to a downturn this time the medicine against Rising prices is also poison for the economy and unlike the 2008 financial crisis this downturn is having a much more obvious impact on our daily routines everybody understands that we cannot switch on the heating at the coming winter as much as we did in other years or we are going to see an exorbitant Bill everybody who has a car will have seen it in the run-up to the uh to today to the financial in the run-up to the energy crisis how petrol was so expensive in filling up the car so this is a crisis that I think dissipates across everybody in the society and therefore it's much more felt it's not just about the economic impact the households feel it you you feel it immediately in your uh in your household income but there are also positive developments that run opposite to the financial crisis we are in a moment where there is great talent shortage and so even if we do go into a recession there's still a lot lots of jobs that are available that are out there we are at a unique inflection point in the global economy compared to the last crisis the one we are facing now is much more multi-faceted war in Ukraine an energy crisis soaring living costs and widespread pessimism are combining into an unpredictable economic concoction and that's all from this business beyond episode if you enjoyed it please hit like And subscribe

          <attvalue for="3" value="La crisis financiera asiática fue la mayor a escala mundial desde 1929. Por primera vez, desde la Segunda Guerra Mundial, hubo un peligro real de colapso de la economía global. Y la crisis llegó sin previo aviso...&#10;&#10;A fines de la década de 1990, el mundo parecía estar en un camino de crecimiento sostenido, impulsado principalmente por las economías emergentes del sudeste asiático, la región con el crecimiento económico más fuerte. En muy poco tiempo, millones de personas perdieron sus medios de subsistencia. El hambre, el desempleo masivo y los disturbios volvieron a países que hasta entonces prosperaban. Lo que fue particularmente preocupante para todos los gestores de crisis en ese momento fue que no anticiparon la crisis y, por lo tanto, no estaban preparados para ella. Sus medidas precipitadas no dieron frutos durante mucho tiempo; al contrario, solo empeoraron la situación. ¿Cómo pudo suceder esto y cuáles fueron las causas?&#10;&#10;Diez años más tarde, en 2008/09, durante unas semanas el mundo estuvo nuevamente al borde del colapso económico. La &quot;crisis financiera global&quot; mostró la dependencia de la economía productiva mundial de los mercados financieros. En este reportaje, expertos de renombre mundial se plantean si el peligro del colapso no es inherente de nuestra economía global. Hasta la fecha, no hay una respuesta satisfactoria.&#10;La conclusión es que, en sentido económico, seguimos viviendo sobre un volcán.&#10;&#10;&#10;#dwdocumental #documental #crisisfinanciera #globalización #economia &#10;ـــــ&#10;DW Documental le brinda información más allá de los titulares.

          <attvalue for="7" value="septiembre de 1997 la élite financiera mundial vuela a Hong Kong para la reunión anual del fondo monetario internacional y el Banco Mundial estas instituciones se crearon a final de la Segunda Guerra Mundial para promover el crecimiento económico y agilizar la gestión de crisis cuando los líderes del mundo financiero se encuentran en Hong Kong llevan a sus espaldas más de 10 años de un fuerte crecimiento la caída de las economías comunistas y el impulso en el este de asia desencadenaron un gran auge la economía mundial ha evolucionado hacia una división del trabajo cada vez más interconectada los países del sudeste asiático han contribuido enormemente al crecimiento de los últimos años pero en Tailandia sufren desde hace unos meses una crisis monetaria que se está convirtiendo lentamente en una crisis económica masiva y ahora amenaza con extenderse a otros países como Indonesia y Filipinas de modo que en la conferencia de Hong Kong no solo hay éxitos que celebrar los delegados de Asia Están preocupados y exigen una comisión de crisis con todos los ministros de finanzas [Música] los líderes del mundo financiero vienen principalmente de occidente y son los verdaderos reyes de la nueva economía global cuando se encuentran en Hong Kong no creen que su maravilloso mundo de crecimiento constante este en peligro sin embargo la crisis que comenzó en Tailandia en realidad se acabará propagando por toda la región y traerá miseria a millones de personas la crisis financiera asiática es la primera crisis financiera moderna en el mundo globalizado sin embargo la élite no está preparada para los elementos destructivos que a partir de este momento definirán todas las futuras crisis económicas apenas 10 años después el mundo se encuentra literalmente al borde del Abismo cuando en 2008 y 2009 primero los bancos en Estados Unidos y en consecuencia el sistema financiero de todo el mundo occidental amenazan con colapsar los líderes occidentales no aprendieron nada de la crisis financiera asiática Si hubiesen entendido las causas de los problemas en Asia y los hubieran combatido con firmeza se habrían evitado la enorme crisis del sector financiero 10 años después el problema era que la velocidad de los mercados financieros no coincidía con la velocidad de la política hasta la crisis financiera estadounidense de 2007 no soy tomar un realmente en serio las lecciones de la crisis asiática se creía que no nos afectaría y hoy donde nos encontramos el mundo se enfrenta actualmente a muchas crisis Qué tan grande es el peligro de que la economía financiera mundial vuelva a colapsar son los políticos más capaces hoy de seguirle el ritmo a los mercados financieros actuales en retrospectiva es Sorprendente lo poco que se aprendió de la crisis financiera asiática de Cara a la crisis financiera de 2008 lo que ocurrió en el 97 y 98 se olvidó o se consideró algo exótico desde los años 80 los países emergentes y en desarrollo del sudeste y este asiático se convirtieron en Los denominados tigres asiáticos importantes motores del crecimiento económico mundial a medida que la crisis los golpea a uno tras otro colapsa parte de la clase media millones pierden sus empleos el hambre regresa a estos países y estallan levantamientos se necesitaron cinco años para volver a 1996 fue una crisis profunda y larga Tailandia era el modelo de la nueva división global del trabajo a partir de 1980 fue uno de los primeros países de la región en atraer gran cantidad de capital extranjero al principio fueron empresas japonesas las que invirtieron aquí fabricaban piezas o productos completos en el país la mano de obra era barata al igual que las materias primas A mediados de los años 80 la tasa de pobreza en Tailandia rondaba el 30%. el 30% de la población era pobre hoy ha bajado al 9%. Así que tomó tiempo pero muchas personas realmente se beneficiaron de este crecimiento casi todos los países de la región vivieron un auge cada vez salían más jóvenes profesionales de las universidades los países de Asia pasaron a la antecámara de la prosperidad sostenible en ese momento creció muy rápidamente porque fluía mucho dinero a Tailandia a través de créditos del exterior las empresas tailandesas lo usaban para invertir no debemos olvidar que en 1993 el Banco Mundial publicó un libro muy influyente que causó furor El Milagro económico de Asia Oriental pueden imaginarse que si el Banco Mundial una organización tan influyente le pone el sello a toda una región Entonces los inversionistas querrán ir a esa región y eso fue lo que hicieron el Banco Mundial y el fondo monetario internacional tienen su sede en Washington sus análisis y pronósticos tienen gran peso en el mundo financiero internacional su valoración de la región en la primavera de 1997 es positiva sin excepción Joseph stiglish era en ese momento el economista jefe del Banco Mundial especializado en Asia Oriental Y compartía esa opinión seguían una política de equilibrio social eran sociedades mucho más igualitarias que Estados Unidos sus gobiernos habían convertido en prioridad invertir en infraestructura tecnología y políticas educativas que es lo que hubiese deseado que hiciera también Estados Unidos era el tipo de política que yo había impulsado cuando estaba en el consejo de asesores económicos del presidente Clinton en la década de 1990 siempre se observaba el mismo fenómeno en el sudeste y este de asia en poco tiempo se desarrollaba una cultura económica urbana con muchas oportunidades de Progreso social en solo una generación los campesinos se convertían en ingenieros gran parte de los créditos pedidos en el extranjero se invirtió en el futuro de estos países son los ingredientes de una historia de éxito Pero qué desencadenó la crisis asiática en el verano de 1997 y llevó a toda una región al borde del colapso [Música] en la década de 1980 se inició en Estados Unidos la reestructuración neoliberal del sistema financiero internacional la desregularización de las instituciones financieras significó que las normas para otorgar créditos Se volvieron mucho más laxas un banco Llano debía tener reservas por el capital que prestaba esta regla limitaba automáticamente el volumen de créditos a partir de Entonces se multiplican en Wall Street las sumas que sobre todo los empresarios pueden pedir prestadas el crecimiento de la economía mundial se debe en gran parte a esta política financiera liberal la desventaja de la política monetaria liberal es que cada vez más actores muchos de ellos nuevos cambian el mundo de las finanzas piden créditos a inversionistas adinerados y lo invierten con la intención de generar la mayor ganancia posible lo más rápido posible los mercados asiáticos con sus tasas de crecimiento por encima del promedio son extremadamente atractivos para ellos a partir de Entonces el mundo financiero se vuelve inestable en su base es un cambio de era y cultura que primero parte de Nueva York y que sigue vigente en la actualidad a partir de entonces las instituciones financieras y el sector económico global crecen a un ritmo inimaginable hasta ese momento las expectativas de los inversores impulsan a los banqueros las ganancias a corto plazo se obtienen mejor de las fluctuaciones a corto plazo en la economía global de las fluctuaciones monetarias en los países del sudeste asiático de las ganancias variables del petróleo los minerales y el trigo Cuando comenzó la desregulación A fines de los 70 y principios de los 80 explotó el sector financiero a los expertos financieros se les pagaba extremadamente bien y las crisis se hicieron inevitables el negocio de estos nuevos actores no da respiro para muchos el tiempo en que tardan en mover su dinero no supera el mes las dos semanas o incluso Solo un día la economía financiera tiene sus propias reglas independientes de la evolución de la economía real otorgan tantos créditos como sea posible porque les pagan por volumen es como una planta de energía nuclear que paga los empleados por la cantidad de Electricidad que producen y no por la cantidad de Electricidad que los consumidores realmente necesitan y surge un nuevo tipo de banqueros se definen a sí mismos como codiciosos porque eso es lo que se espera de ellos compiten con otros compiten por el gran capital de los inversores esto crea una dinámica propia un factor importante es la escala es enorme la crisis de Tailandia ya es una crisis de decenas de miles de millones de dólares cuando los líderes del mundo financiero se reúnen en Hong Kong en septiembre de 1997 muy pocos de ellos tienen idea de lo que ya se está gestando el fondo monetario internacional es la institución que debería supervisar los mercados financieros mundiales y garantizar su funcionamiento si se producía una crisis de deuda en un país el fondo podía otorgar créditos que generalmente estaban vinculados A duras medidas de recuperación para los países afectados la reunión de Hong Kong en 1997 estuvo perfectamente sincronizada como si la hubiese planeado spielberg es decir el fmi y el Banco Mundial tienen sus reuniones de otoño fuera de Washington cada cinco años y justo en medio de la crisis se reúnen en Hong Kong las empresas y los inversores privados de Tailandia habían pedido prestado mucho dinero en el extranjero para seguir aumentando sus exportaciones o beneficiarse de la valorización de los bienes inmuebles como más tarde en la crisis financiera estadounidense el Frenesí inversor se basaba en las oposición de que el crecimiento sería constante por eso las empresas y los particulares se endeudaron a corto plazo para poder amortizar sus créditos rápidamente a partir de los beneficios esperados cuando el auge de las exportaciones de Tailandia comienza a estancarse debido a una recesión económica en Japón y las primeras empresas comienzan a tener dificultades los bancos japoneses se ponen nerviosos y resinden créditos en Tailandia se invirtió mucho en inmuebles Y estos inmuebles lógicamente también generan ingresos pero en la moneda tailandesa el bat si usted se endeuda en dólares estadounidenses para financiar estos proyectos inmobiliarios en Tailandia y el tipo de cambio del bat se desploma frente al dólar estadounidense entonces tiene un problema para evitar la devaluación del bat el gobierno tailandés envía emisarios a pequeña Tokio a principios de junio para solicitar créditos bilaterales en una moneda fuerte las empresas tailandesas necesitan dólares estadounidenses para poder pagar los créditos en el extranjero ambos países se niegan a proporcionarle al Banco Central de Tailandia suficientes Divisas en yenes y dólares estadounidenses para mantener estable el tipo de cambio y desalentar la especulación El Banco Central puede mantener el tipo de cambio sin embargo al mismo tiempo se puede observar que las reservas de Divisas disminuyen lentamente pero en algún momento y no es fácil prever Cuando será de repente mucha gente piensa que después de todo Tal vez no esté yendo también Y entonces corren hay una estampida en las reservas del Banco Central Y de pronto colapsan Entonces se genera una crisis cambiaria esta espiral descendente ahora previsible desencadena actividad en los fondos de alto riesgo y en los especuladores de Nueva York su mascarón de pro es George soros Así es como funciona la especulación un inversionista deposita mil millones de dólares en garantía en un banco en algún lugar del mundo entonces va un banco en Tailandia y solicita un crédito por 25 mil millones en la moneda local el bat Ese es el equivalente oficial de mil millones de dólares vende la moneda local en el MercadoLibre de inmediato lo siguen otros comerciantes de Divisas temiendo que el precio de la moneda local caiga esto provoca una caída en el cambio por ejemplo si el tipo de cambio del bat ha caído un 30% respecto al Dólar el inversor vuelve a comprar los 25.000 millones de bats con solo 700 millones de dólares estadounidenses y así cubre su crédito ha obtenido 300 millones de dólares de ganancias y con eso abandona el país me han acusado de casi todo mi trabajo es ganar dinero no puedo ni quiero considerar las consecuencias sociales de mis actos hay un comportamiento de manada y actividad a gran escala del sector privado contra los estados que solo los estados muy fuertes pueden resistir Tailandia no es lo suficientemente fuerte como para resistir una corrida coordinada de su moneda por parte de los fondos de alto riesgo del mundo Estados Unidos Sí pero no Tailandia el cambio se disparó de 25 a 50 dólares estadounidense como resultado las empresas que se habían endeudado en el extranjero se encontraron en grandes dificultades porque no podían pagar sus créditos que de repente se duplicaron con respecto al momento en que los aceptaron esto causó mucho pánico entre los acreedores extranjeros por lo que muchos exigieron la devolución de su dinero pero los bancos tailandeses que intermediaron estos créditos no podían pagarlos el 2 de Julio El Banco Central de Tailandia se rinde en la lucha contra la especulación y libera el tipo de cambio del bat lo que provoca una devaluación inmediata esta fecha marca el estallido de la crisis asiática que aún se considera un problema local el 28 de Julio Tailandia solicita créditos al fmi sin embargo este se muestra reticente el problema fue que el fondo monetario internacional lo encasilló relativamente pronto y dijo que esa crisis era principalmente un problema interno el resultado es una recesión masiva produjo un shock psicológico en este país que creía tan firmemente en su ascenso a la liga de los países ricos cuando los inversores extranjeros huyen de Tailandia No hay ninguna instancia que controle el pánico debería haber habido un actor que durante la fase de especulación dispusiera de dólares de ser posible en cantidad ilimitada a los bancos centrales afectados que lógicamente no pueden imprimir dólares y nadie lo hizo en la conferencia de Hong Kong A fines de septiembre chocan dos realidades diferentes en occidente celebran los éxitos del neoliberalismo una economía mundial en Rápido crecimiento y el crecimiento exponencial del sector Financiero en Asia en cambio Reina el miedo los ministros de finanzas de los países afectados vislumbran las masivas convulsiones sociales que están a punto de enfrentar como resultado de La retirada de Los inversores Internacionales y el pánico en los mercados financieros pero los reyes de las finanzas mundiales no los escuchan cuando se reúnen en Hong Kong el fmi se reunió para promover la desregulación y una liberalización a un mayor de los mercados de capital impulsaron una serie de medidas que empeorarían aún más las cosas el fondo monetario internacional obligó a los países en medio de la crisis a recortar toda inversión incluido el consumo elevando drásticamente las tasas de interés Y eso estuvo mal en Tokio antesala de la reunión existe la preocupación de que pueda colapsar el pib de toda la región en los últimos años el comercio con los países del sudeste asiático ha cobrado más importancia para la economía japonesa a medida que la crisis se extendió de Tailandia a Indonesia teníamos que pudiera extenderse a otras partes de Asia pero en ese momento no contábamos con que se expandiría a Corea del Sur [Música] en el distrito gubernamental de Tokio el Ministerio de finanzas pasa noches de liberando como evitar la recesión consideran incorrecta la estrategia del fmi para Tailandia e Indonesia ambos países precisarían ante todo nuevos créditos a largo plazo para poder reformar sus economías sin que quiebren muchas de las empresas y bancos la capacidad de crecer y pagar la deuda no se aumenta provocando una depresión Como hizo el fmi había alternativas claras Y expliqué muy claramente porque las altas tasas de interés la política monetaria estricta y las medidas de austeridad como era previsible empeorarían las cosas pero es lo que hicieron el gobierno japonés quiere crear un fondo monetario asiático provisto de 100 mil millones de dólares estadounidenses esta gran suma calmaría los mercados financieros internacionales y al mismo tiempo podría ofrecer grandes créditos a los países afectados Japón solicita el apoyo y la participación de los gobiernos de Singapur China y Corea hasta noviembre de 1997 las instituciones internacionales no desempeñaban absolutamente ningún papel real en la prevención de una crisis de este tipo ni siquiera la gestión de las crisis eso era un verdadero problema [Música] durante la reunión de Hong Kong A fines de septiembre las noticias del mercado de valores y los tipos de cambio indican que la crisis se estaba extendiendo sin frenos en Hong Kong el gobierno japonés propuso crear un fondo monetario asiático sin embargo sé que el gobierno de Estados Unidos en particular Larry Summers que representaba el departamento del tesoro en ese momento estaba en contra de la creación de un fondo monetario asiático entre bastidores en Hong Kong tanto sacakivara como Summers buscan el apoyo de las otras delegaciones importantes en la antesala de la conferencia el departamento del tesoro de Estados Unidos había informado a todos los gobiernos del este de asia que estaba estrictamente en contra de un fondo monetario asiático y finalmente se impuso nadie se atrevió a oponerse a los Estados Unidos la conferencia de Hong Kong habría sido una oportunidad para evitar la crisis sin embargo los créditos que se les ofrece a los países afectados son demasiado bajos se sigue una táctica y se espera mientras la crisis se agudiza rápidamente la crisis financiera global de 2008 y 2009 finalmente se supera por la determinación del gobierno de Estados Unidos de inyectar el máximo capital para detener el pánico y la especulación esa disposición política faltó 10 años antes en Hong Kong hasta 2007 existía la arrogancia de decir que ellos eran asiáticos y que nosotros podíamos hacerlo mejor ese es un patrón común en los mercados financieros [Música] Hong Kong es el centro bancario bursátil más importante de Asia cuando los precios de las acciones colapsan allí un mes después de la reunión queda claro para todos que la crisis no ha terminado sino que apenas comienza [Música] finales de noviembre de 1997 en el distrito gubernamental de Tokio el gobierno japonés sabe que se necesitan de inmediato grandes cantidades de dinero para rescatar a Corea de la insolvencia y de una recesión económica masiva exige sobre todo al departamento del tesoro de Estados Unidos que actúe con rapidez y decisión Corea era entonces la décima economía más grande del mundo como lo sigue siendo hoy y solo tenía 8.900 millones de dólares en reservas sin contar las reservas que había perdido el gobierno en los últimos días el presidente Clinton habló personalmente por teléfono con el presidente Kim Hyun Sam por la crisis financiera de Corea del Sur interviene el presidente de los Estados Unidos esto deja claro que Corea es de otro calibre que Tailandia o Indonesia económica y sobre todo geopolíticamente es el bastión de occidente contra Corea del Norte y China este país compite con éxito en el mercado mundial en importantes industrias como la electrónica la producción de automóviles y los Astilleros las grandes compañías coreanas al igual que las tailandesas habían contraído grandes deudas en dólares en el exterior cuando la cotización del wong la moneda coreana se desploma son incapaces de pagar sus créditos Recién ahora a finales de noviembre los líderes de la Administración estadounidense se dan cuenta de que tienen que actuar lo que les hace cambiar de opinión es la dimensión geopolítica Pues si Corea tuviese que declararse insolvente la reputación de Estados Unidos como Potencia garante de Corea del Sur también sufriría enormemente a los ojos del mundo [Música] en Tokio el gobierno presiona al departamento del tesoro de Estados Unidos para que se apresure se prevé elaborar un gran paquete de rescate en el que participan muchos Corea ya ha aceptado muchos requisitos del fmi todo parece estar listo para el acuerdo [Música] cuando finalmente el director del fmi vuela también a seúl todos esperan que se ratifique el paquete de rescate para Corea pero sorprendentemente candezú exigen más condiciones pide que la tasa de interés de los créditos se eleve al 25% para atraer capital extranjero el ministro de finanzas de Corea responde que entonces quebrarían Muchas empresas y colapsaría la economía y por lo tanto ningún extranjero invertiría pero cambia su insiste en su demanda Claro en 1997 la bolsa de valores de Corea cayó un 49%. es decir a la mitad de su valor Pero eso no es lo peor el tipo de cambio entre el one coreano y el dólar estadounidense cayó un 65,9%. si combinamos la devaluación de la moneda y la caída del índice bursátil concluimos que gran parte de la riqueza acumulada en los últimos 20 años ha desaparecido lógicamente el estado de ánimo era sombrío muchas personas perdieron sus trabajos quebraron empresas fue una época deprimente [Música] el paquete de créditos para Corea es de 55.000 millones de dólares estadounidenses la mayor suma jamás aprobada bajo el liderazgo del fmi el propio fmi quiere aportar 21 mil millones el Banco Mundial 10.000 el banco asiático de desarrollo 4000 los 20 mil millones restantes vendrían de las ricas naciones industrializadas sobre todo de Estados Unidos y Japón que había instado a Washington ha recaudar una gran suma el secretario del tesoro Bob Robin en particular se había resistido durante mucho tiempo a contribuir con sus propios fondos presupuestarios creo que en el último momento Summers logró persuadir a Bob Robin Para apoyar a Corea con dinero Y entonces junto con el gobierno de Estados Unidos inyectamos una gran suma de dinero para resolver la crisis en Corea Robin era un hombre muy difícil en ese momento [Música] los negociadores del fmi en Corea presionan por una transferencia rápida de lo contrario predicen la quiebra del país Cuando se enteran de que el gobierno de los Estados Unidos no quería desembolsar su participación en efectivo sino que solo quería depositarlo como garantía se sienten decepcionados en la semana previa a Navidad en Nueva York se discute acaloradamente durante noches un plan b que involucraría los bancos de Wall Street en el rescate de Corea el último recurso los bancos tienen que diferir los créditos que vencen a fin de año y aceptar vencimientos a más largo plazo Pero quién sería el moderador entonces toma la iniciativa El director de la reserva Federal de Nueva York dirige la sucursal más poderosa después de la reserva Federal de los Estados Unidos es el quien reúne a los directores de los principales bancos comerciales estadounidenses llevan a los banqueros a una sala de la reserva Federal entonces ruega que den a Corea más tiempo para pagar los créditos vencidos en lugar de avivar El pánico general deberían contribuir a restaurar la confianza y la estabilidad y permitir que la economía coreana se recupere [Música] es la Navidad de 1997 mucha gente sale a comprar a Time Square en ese momento los principales bancos comerciales de Wall Street efectivamente aceptan el argumento de McDonald's este los amenazó con que tendrían que cooperar si no querían arriesgar a dar por perdidos todos sus créditos ahora aumenta la posibilidad de que los bancos europeos y japoneses hagan lo mismo si Corea hubiese tenido que declararse insolvente la crisis asiática se habría convertido en una crisis económica mundial magdana salvó a Corea [Música] en Washington Nueva York Tokio y otras metrópolis se respira alivio los funcionarios del fmi también recuperan el aliento muchos de ellos han trabajado en las últimas semanas prácticamente sin parar están realmente agotados todos esperan que lo peor haya pasado pero se equivocan porque a principios de 1998 se hizo realidad el impacto combinado de la crisis monetaria la crisis bancaria y la crisis económica A mediados de enero el presidente de Indonesia su jarto firma un acuerdo con el fmi que prevé masivos recortes sociales muchos interpretan esto como el sometimiento del sudeste asiático [Música] sin embargo cuando se firman los acuerdos Ya es demasiado tarde para evitar la crisis económica en Indonesia estallan disturbios mueren más de mil personas y la pobreza vuelve al país el fondo monetario internacional insiste en que el gobierno elimine muchos de sus proyectos de infraestructura y subsidios a alimentos y gasolina Indonesia tardará una década en recuperarse de esto [Música] Corea del Sur se recuperará mucho antes ya a finales de 1998 pero hasta entonces la sociedad vivirá una pesadilla social mucha gente se quedó sin hogar hay que tener presente que en Corea del Sur no había personas sin hogar excepto el período inmediatamente posterior a la guerra de Corea pero ahora de repente había personas sin hogar viviendo en los parques y en las calles [Música] además quebraron muchas pequeñas y medianas empresas y aumentó el número de suicidios los niños ya no podían ir a la escuela fue un completo trauma en la sociedad coreana fue uno de los momentos más trágicos de la historia contemporánea en Corea del Sur [Música] es marcadamente jerárquico Los costos y beneficios de los programas impuestos fueron muy asimétricos unos son rescatados y otros tienen que pagar los costos del rescate no le salió gratis la crisis fue aprovechada por algunos actores de Estados Unidos por ejemplo para comprar empresas a muy bajo precio después de que Corea se hundiera en la crisis pero también hay reformas estructurales exigidas por el fmi que beneficiarán a la economía coreana se distiende la estrecha interconexión entre el estado y el sector privado el sector privado se convierte en el motor del cambio cuando puede volver a pedir dinero prestado y lentamente retorna la confianza del mercado financiero internacional había vínculos estrechos entre el gobierno y las grandes corporaciones eran simbióticos en el pasado cuando las empresas tenían problemas financieros el gobierno siempre estaba ahí para rescatarlas por eso la crisis financiera de 1997 fue para nosotros una maldición pero al mismo tiempo también fue una bendición pero Otro aspecto del renacimiento de Corea fue que el gobierno coreano se negó a cumplir con otras exigencias del fmi que habrían obligado a las empresas orientadas a la exportación a reducir significativamente sus operaciones cuando en el mercado mundial la demanda vuelve a mirar hacia Corea logran pagar sus deudas más rápido de lo esperado a partir de Entonces el sector bancario es monitoreado de manera eficiente el Antiguo banco más grande es vendido a un grupo de inversión para el que trabajaba washion Sun él dirigió las negociaciones en ese momento no solo aprendieron la lección y entendieron que los llevó a la crisis sino que reestructuraron las bases del sistema bancario vendieron bancos débiles a inversores extranjeros como nosotros recapitalizaron otros bancos y aún más importante introdujeron la supervisión de la gestión de riesgos así evitaron acumular una gran cantidad de créditos riesgosos por eso Cuando comenzó la crisis de 2008 los bancos asiáticos estaban en muy buena forma a finales de 1998 Hong Kong es atacada por fondos de alto riesgo liderados nuevamente por George soros apuestan a la caída de las cotizaciones de la bolsa y la devaluación del dólar de Hong Kong como resultado de la profunda recesión en el sudeste asiático pero Hong Kong es capaz de defenderse Pues el gobierno de la ciudad y el Banco Central construyen juntos un cortafuegos en moneda fuerte de más de 400 mil millones de dólares la especulación se derrumba es exactamente la misma estrategia que se utiliza en el mundo occidental 10 años después en 2008 para restaurar la confianza en el sistema financiero global [Música] después de la crisis los países del sudeste asiático tomarán medidas para protegerse contra la inestabilidad del mercado financiero supervisan sus bancos más de cerca que occidente e invierten cantidades muy grandes de Divisas para poder defenderse de una nueva especulación esto se interpreta como un distanciamiento del este de asia con respecto a occidente Pero cuando la crisis financiera mundial de 2008 y 2009 provocó un colapso temporal de gran parte de sistema financiero occidental estos países tenían suficientes reservas para poder mantener la estabilidad de sus propios bancos la crisis financiera de 2008 cambió la perspectiva del fondo monetario internacional desde entonces ya no son su máxima prioridad las duras medidas de austeridad que en su mayoría conducían a la recesión y a la Pobreza de muchos sino más bien se ofrecen sugerencias sobre cómo con la ayuda de créditos del fmi los países en problemas podrían volver a ser economías prósperas a medio plazo creo que instituciones como el fmi y las instituciones internacionales en general desempeñan un papel muy importante en este entorno actual de fragmentación y polarización porque para los desafíos a los que nos enfrentamos ya sea el clima la digitalización la desigualdad las respuestas deben ser multilaterales Una institución independiente que disponga también de la experiencia necesaria sería Sensato dada la complejidad de nuestra economía global sin embargo el fmi solo puede tomar acción si los gobiernos de los países individuales solicitan su asesoramiento y asistencia si me preguntan Sería bueno que tuviésemos un organismo supranacional que pudiera ejercer una influencia mucho mayor entonces La respuesta es sí nuestro sistema monetario y financiero internacional actual sin duda no está organizado de manera óptima porque hay muy poca cooperación y muy pocas oportunidades para tener en cuenta las consecuencias de lo que hace uno en los otros queda patente que no sea detenido el peligro de las crisis mundiales tampoco el peligro de que se produzcan grandes crisis financieras eso se debe a que el tamaño del sistema financiero mundial sea más que duplicado desde la crisis financiera asiática en 2020 comprendió 463 billones de dólares estadounidenses la industria financiera mundial mueve esta gigantesca suma Cada año los mercados son miopes no calculan Los costos de las emisiones del cambio climático ni tampoco los riesgos el resultado es una sociedad una economía que no es tan resistente como debería trato de usar metáforas para describir esto en algunos de mis escritos construimos autos sin ruedas de Auxilio la crisis asiática fue la hora cero de todas las crisis en la era de la economía mundial globalizada recién después de la crisis financiera de 2008 y 2009 se comenzó a pensar en medidas de precaución y regulación la paradoja básica de las finanzas globales no ha cambiado un ápice el sector financiero tiene una influencia determinante en el funcionamiento de la economía global y a menudo Sigue pensando en términos de semanas o meses una sociedad compleja no puede funcionar sin un buen sector financiero de modo que no solo debemos evitar que el sector financiero nos cause daños sino que debemos asumir un papel activo en la organización de nuestra economía y en la organización de nuestro sector financiero para que haga lo que se supone que debe hacer los desafíos para el mundo en el que vivimos hoy ya no se limitan a lo regional sino que afectan a todos los países cambio climático superpoblación guerras y una competencia geopolítica cada vez mayor entre Estados Unidos y China las consecuencias de cada crisis moderna afectan a millones de personas durante la crisis financiera asiática esta fue también una amarga lección para los países del sudeste asiático la pobreza y la miseria regresaron para quedarse por muchos años la crisis financiera asiática podría habernos enseñado que en un mundo altamente complejo los problemas lejanos inevitablemente tendrán un impacto en nosotros [Música] [Música] [Música]" />

going to feed me for 2 days hammock the medical kit Compass fire box I don't go outside I'm like guys you guys should prepare you should I don't want to be that guy you know the weirdo preacher staying on the street corner fire pouch is not needed as well torch duct tape I don't want to be that dude I just like I told you so my wilderness belt might go to life when something does finally happen when it does collapse they're on their own a fire kit flick small handy personal [Music] s love with a crookie world and everything that comes with it I love when you they it won't you I once believe but I took it all myself with none of it I love when you take it so I got an emergency preparedness because I read a book uh 1 second after and in the book all hell broke loose because of an EMP attack so that's a electromagnetic pulse that detonates in the Earth's atmosphere and creates a blackout there was part in a book where the hero he realizes that he wish he would have gotten prepared more and I'm like well I don't want that to be me so I started preparing I am a retired New York City fireman I run a group here in New York City called The NYC Preppers Network it's City Preppers the disruptive event that could be happening guys I don't think every time Putin opens his mouth I get an influx of people joining and then nothing happens for a while and people drop out anyway guys this is the angry prer thank you for watching the biggest misconception is that we're all crazy or rather that we're all waiting for the apocalypse right and so clearly the apocalypse the end of the world whatever you want to call it if that does happen it doesn't matter how much prepping you do or how prepared you are for the situation it's the end of the world uh we're just ready for basic things like uh earthquakes tornadoes things of that nature maybe Financial collapse has any of these things happened yeah earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes bad winter storms the idea of the group is to get people reliant on themselves and not coming downstairs and stand on the line for water or food like we saw in Sandy and Irene so you don't want to be that person though everything was was in order imagine chaos and you have to wait online for an m box you are definitely undoubtedly going to get mugged before you get back home listen there are people who St started preparing because they thought the Walking Dead was going to happen you know one side of me says well if they got prepared because the a TV show good for them as long as they grew up I Was preparing for an EMP attack now I'm prepared for all of it right with the exception again for media decides of Texas smashing into us there's no preparing for that right uh maybe spiritually but not you know not supply wise my major concern is another depression that is going to to make the 1929 depression look like a walk in the park only 50 of them I guess joined the program I have a YouTube channel the angry preer it's not like I'm yelling at the people in the group like get it together you bag it's not like I'm doing that the angry prepper just came from a guy in a firehouse actually cuz he calls me angry and I couldn't use the black prepper cuz it was too on the nose and the chocolate prepper me and wife laughed at it the angry prepper just made sense I mean am I really angry probably there's a million things you could be angry about I mean listen nine times out of 10 I'm not I'm not walking around [Music] [Music] stewing the downside to being a prepper is especially people who have family who you know make fun of them but in the back of their head they're like well man if this does fall apart we know Jim has enough food to support us then you go over to Jim's Place when it collapses and Jim's like kick rocks you guys thought this was funny now it's not and Jim's going to tell you I only have enough food for 3 years for my family now if Jim's a good guy he's going to let them in and he's going to adapt accordingly Jim's he's going to sit there and tell him beat it a lot of us will help even though it's against our better interest Community is so important without Community you're you're in and always will be in a place of survival until your skills are so good that you become this Wilderness ninja right but no it's community and there's also laughter and joy within the community and that's important you know we are the most underdeveloped species of animal on the planet you know we are filled with ego and our intellect thinks that we are superior you are we are so new you don't have fur you have to wear clothing you have to rob the fur off another animal in order for you to live on this planet holy now we make textiles and things right our primary focus is to pass off the Primitive skills come on up here folks you know that there's the Cardinal skills which are the shelter water the multitude levels of fire making the Plant World of the Edibles medicinals utilitarian the hunting and the trapping parts of the tracking science Healing Arts and the presence and the awareness skills and the cognitive development Arts the movement skills those Shadow skills the higher forms of all of these things that's what this place is it's a home for those skills and a home for people that want to come and train and have a safe place to do it classic design is the two y sticks classic design with the long ridge bow twice the length of them if this is the case I've got the person in here right things that I hear in the school from students of why do they come here well it's the current affairs and the current affairs exist on this same things that we can always count on conflict religion politics Finance War nonsense so there's two worlds to this there is the urban emergency preparedness and then there is the Wilderness Survival Let's Talk willing to survival first they're not panicking there's no doomsday talk or Armageddon kind of things it's on people's minds for sure because I think they're starting to realize of how volatile our systems in our modern place actually are be it the electricity the food operations and so on it's very delicate people are coming out to to answer those unknowns it's coming out and joining the circle around a fire once again as we once did all right you got three minutes I think people are are really starting to reconnect to Nature and their relationship to Nature whatever that looks like for them all right time there are some folks that come who are nervous and have like environmental anxiety and and want to you know feel that they're prepared for whatever could potentially happen right so we don't add anything to it and we don't need this cuz NASA can see it so how big of a fire do we actually need you know years ago it was sort of the machismo full of ego nonsense you know Soldier of Fortune idiot you know like the Doomsday prepper kind of person as well that's shifted drastically now it's everyone it's families it's Elders it's young kids the one of the fastest growing demographics we've had in the past three four years has been women I'm one of the volunteers here at Mountain Scout I am also a Wilderness first responder and I'm also an AMT by trade I was working in Hospice Care during the pandemic and I needed to get away and that's when I kept finding myself in the woods more than usual and every time I went out I wanted to know more and more about how I could bring less and less with me and feel more and more confident on the landscape without you know all of this technical equipment so I looked I searched and I found Mountain Scout you don't have to put it in the ground at all you can literally just set it just yeah those you just lean them I know we have a bunch of sticks lying about but yeah I think Co really really accelerated a lot of things um because it really kind of laid bare a lot of the systemic issues and if there was one time where we going to come together and do something for the greater good it felt like that would have kind of been it and it really just kind of fractured us even more in a lot of ways we have the imaginary idea of what the shelter is supposed to look like oh my God you need to build it 3 this is not effective at all right now we are so not even done just come off oh yeah the rain comes in and you kidding me the rain is just going to push this right down yeah so we have to build this 3 to 4 feet for Summertime Summertime okay now look in the door looking through the door now this was the question you were asking before can I make this for two people or a family yes I don't really have faith in us to fix the systemic issues I think it's there's hard times coming and a lot of us well to-do people in North America have kind of been shielded from a lot of it so the debris on the outside is we've known about so much of this stuff for decades and haven't done anything about it and now it's going to take such drastic actions that and we can't even get on board with the smallest little First Steps so that that definitely worries me but yeah I mean we only have a li limited time on this Earth anyway and and I try to I try to zoom out and keep the proper perspective and even if we created this ideal society that would one day crumble and you know nothing nothing's going to last forever so I think it's it's important to to keep things in perspective and and even and try to make the best of it it's producing the dust that we need so now people should also keep this in mind it's one thing to be prepared and to be concerned about all of these things but please go enjoy yourself have an apple enjoy some ice cream have a strawberry look at the sunset go skip a stone live your life go have fun have fun knowing that you took the time and you're responsible and you made contingency plans in case something goes weird but don't stay in the world of paranoia or be in the world of prepper kind of a mentality live your life you know enjoy the love ones go [Music] Adventure this is a dream for a lot of people to come and see the reath they saved a lifetime to come here and there showing them it seeing how they appreciate it it is quite an amazing entity it was on our bucket list I took up to Great Barrier Reef this a dream come true never thought it would happen once in a lifetime [Music] experience we got our first boat in '96 and we've been running uh operations ever since with our little 16 M Sailing Boat we were actually diving um you know two three times a week together that was our our passion just to be under the water together and then showing people the the amazing great bar Reef when we first arrived there wasn't so much I guess talk about climate change and in those early days it was already a poster child as well but for the good you know it was an amazing icon in the world and it was bucket lless for everybody to visit and then over the years I guess you know you had a little bit of media coming in are you okay if you are okay tell me a lot of people come here thinking oh I better see it before it disappears they also come with a misconception of what it should look like I'm afraid um Hollywood didn't do us any favors by showing us the best you could ever see you will find that but it's not everywhere I wanted to do the coral reef and also I want to see some whales and dolphins maybe in the South let's see but the coral reef was very important for me also because I know it's an ecosystem that it's in danger so I want to see it before it's gone I hope it's not gone I definitely think seeing stuff before before it goes away while you can still see the majority of it is is important and taking steps to make sure that it doesn't disappear being a to go dive on the Barrier Reef is quite spectacular cuz i' I've grown up watching D atra documentaries as well as stuff on YouTube about the Great Barrier Reef um and how it used to look for climate change that all that sort of happened I found it quite interesting to see how it has changed and how it actually looks when it isn't G through [Music] filters we've had four Mass Coral bleaching events in the space of 7 years this is much more frequent and severe than what has happened in the past it's caused by climate change which exacerbates heat waves and leads to stress on the coral great bar being the poster child of for climate change I mean the Doomsday I think that's not just about the Barrier Reef I think there seems to be this notion in the world at the moment about everything if you connect somebody to the great bar Reef if you explain you don't throw a bit of plastic there because it looks like a jellyfish for the turtle to eat you know if you give that a meaning then you know you are going to have people coming off thinking oh I might you know not use plastic anymore if you're just making everything so hopeless in this world which everything seems so hopeless in this world well what is the poor Young Generation coming through got got to live for you know nature is very strong very resilient we've just got to give it a little bit of help sometimes and stop putting rubbish everywhere it's one of the snal wonders of the world and I can see why it's huge and it's beautiful this just reinforced the fact that it needs to be protected protected at all costs people said like it's different now with the change in the Eco system so I'm glad I got to see it if it is actually going away um hopefully not I'm also worried that we have too far but let's not get into that if you learn about something it's easier like to care anyone should do it everyone should do it and then I feel if more people saw it then they would care be like this is something weth [Music] [Music] protective even [Music] this [Music] for [Music] e night for for for for for for for for for for to yeah" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="the Palestinian people are being starved bombed and forcibly displaced by Israel they're unlawful occupier the International Court of Justice here is another case against Israel in what could be a test of Israeli defiance of international law more than 40 nations argue its ban on the UN agency for Palestinian refugees is a breach of the UN charter so can the World Court hold Israel to account this is inside [Music] [Music] story hello and welcome to the program i'm Fib Batibbo on the first of five days of hearings at the International Court of Justice in the HG Palestinian officials have told judges that Israel is using humanitarian aid as a weapon of war more than 40 countries are arguing that Israel's November decision to stop all coordination with the UN agency for Palestinian Refugees or UNRA is a breach of the UN founding charter but however the court rules the result will be an advisory opinion that means it's a suggestion non-binding and Israel has shown in the past it has no issue ignoring international law so can the ICJ make a difference this time and will any decision made in Europe have an impact on the millions of Palestinians in Gaza struggling to find food under an Israeli blockade that's now lasted nearly two months we'll get to our guests in just a moment first this report from Laura Khan children among the huge crowds pushed to fill their empty plates knowing that food is running out in Gaza this desperate situation has been made worse by Israel's heavy bombardment and more than 2 months of its total blockade on food medicine and fuel to the strip the coming days in Gaza are going to be critical uh today people are not surviving in Gaza those that aren't being killed with bombs and bullets are being are slowly dying everyone is suffering from malnutrition especially the children what are the children eating they spend all day standing in the line at the food kitchen to get rice or beans and sometimes there is none in stark contrast to the streets are these empty distribution centers belonging to UNRA the UN agency for Palestinian refugees not only is it facing severe shortages but also Israel's total ban on its operations across the Palestinian territories far beyond the blockaded fences of Gaza israel is facing legal pressure at the International Court of Justice at the Hague monday's hearing goes beyond Israel's blockade of aid and examines whether Israel's ban on UNRA violated the UN's founding charter the court can only offer an advisory opinion but can carry political weight israel has long advocated for the dismantling of the UN agency it accuses some of its members of involvement in the October 7th attacks of its 14,000 members working in Gaza UNRA found nine people may have been involved and no longer work with them now the agency has been forced to shut down schools clinics community centers and Israel has revoked visas for international staff 66 back in the ICJ Palestinian representatives were the first to speak in the hearing this campaign of erasure was a central hallmark of the Nakba that started in 1947 and whose darkest chapter yet unfolding before our eyes and yours on three separate occasions in the past years the court issued provisional measures ordering Israel among other things to ensure and facilitate the unimpeded flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza israel did not comply weaponizing food and humanitarian aid and negating refugee issue and and their rights including by banning onora are prohibiting now the focus will be on the ICJ and UN states decisions as to whether they will defend the UN body or whether the hearing will result in further Israeli defiance of international law laura Insight story Alazer now let's take a closer look at UNRA the United Nations Relief and Works Agency was created in 1949 to provide assistance to Palestinian refugees there were 750,000 back then now 5.9 million Palestinians are eligible for UNRA support the UN agency runs schools healthc care facilities and also women's centers and micro financing unra doesn't just operate in the occupied territories it's also in Lebanon Syria and Jordan but it's in Gaza where the small strip has been bombed besieged and starved that the AY's operations are most needed and most in danger of complete collapse well let's bring in our guests now in Oxford in the UK Sam Rose who's the senior acting director of UNRA affairs in Gaza in the Canadian city of London Michael Link who's a human rights lawyer and professor emeritus f at the faculty of law at Western University and in Tel Aviv Gideon Levy who's a columnist with the Israeli newspaper Harets gentlemen welcome to you all thank you so much for being with us on Inside Story sam Rose if I can start with you um the UN General Assembly first asked the ICJ to weigh on Israel's legal obligations a year ago uh since then we've had tens of thousands of Palestinians killed and for the past two months there's been a total blockade of Gaza what are you hoping this new case is going to achieve what value do proceedings like this one uh have in the immediate thank you and thanks for for having me on look firstly we we hope that that we we welcome the case it's very timely but it's also increasingly and incredibly urgent we have been talking to the media advocating with member states every day several times a day for 18 months now about the plight of the civilian population in Gaza whose misery uh the inhumity and the cruelty and humiliation that they face is just deteriorating on a daily basis right now things are quickly going from very bad to to to worse the colleagues that we speak to on the ground the refugee communities that we speak to on the ground they have they have nothing this is beyond any level of suffering that we've seen in this most dehumanizing of of conflicts uh and conflicts in Gaza and Israeli Palestinian conflicts over the past 75 years so now is the time for the lawyers to deliberate but more than that now is the time for for action because we are running out of time to meet these needs of the population in Gaza which has immediate implications for them but longerterm implications for everyone in the region sam let me ask you what uh has the ban meant for UNRA the ban by the Israeli Nesset which uh came into effect in January last year what have been the real life consequences of that ban for the people who work for UNRA but also for the people who uh depend on on UNRA yeah I mean the ban had two elements to it one was banning UNRA's activities on the sovereign territory of of Israel the other element to it was prohibiting contact between uh UNRA and Israeli officials uh now I work for UNRA and I represent UNRA in in inside of Gaza so in theory of course the laws do not impinge on our activities inside of Gaza the the reality is is though that we have to coordinate and we have to communicate with the Israeli authorities on a daily basis to do our our work to bring the supplies into Gaza we're going through Israeli controlled borders and for our international staff to move in and out that has to be done in liaison with the Israeli authorities who control all the borders right now so I am speaking to you from Oxford because I as the director of UNRA in Gaza i'm not able to enter the Gaza Strip right now we still as as you said at the top have 15,000 colleagues working on on a daily basis but it impacts the ability of international staff to enter it impacts our ability to bring supplies in as well that also have to go through through Israeli controlled borders and of course we can turn to the situation in in the West Bank in a bit but the impact on our services in East Jerusalem for children for patients etc all right Gideon let me bring you into the conversation we we've have yet to hear Israel's defense in this case because it's absent from the proceedings at the Hague but we do already have an idea of what it's saying to try and justify uh terminating the agreement with UNRA and banning the AY's activities how is this new case first of all at the ICJ against Israel being viewed in Israel and does Israel's refusal to cooperate with UNRA uh represent a legitimate uh security concern or is it a part of a broader political strategy first of all Israel is not concerned at all about it because it's even hardly informal the hearing in the Hi it took me some time to find it in Israeli media out israel turned toward the world and this is just one chain in this behavior in this perception that the whole world is anti-semitic and therefore we turn our back to the world we don't participate in the Pope's funeral because he criticized Israel we are expelling an UNRA senior worker who lived here for 17 years married to an Israeli has three Israeli children she came to Israel for a short visit and they expelled her from the airport israel is doing anything possible to turn into a par state even by its own policy not only by the attitude of the world and this hearing now will have no effect on Israelis because for Israelis UNRA like the ICJ like the UN like any other international organization is anti-semitic and therefore we can we can only ignore their advices you know for so many times I asked myself what does Israel want you killed 50 55,000 people you destroyed Gaza what do you want now why not to give human aid to those displaced poor people what is the logic yeah it's an important question you ask Gideon no doubt michael Link let me come to you and and to this ICJ case and these new hearings there uh legally speaking Michael how does international law weigh a state's right to sovereignty against its responsibility to uphold human rights and international humanitarian law in other words does Israel today have any legal basis for blocking UNRA no i guess the short answer is and I think that's going to be heard all week long by most of the states and international organizations who are going to be speaking to the court um there are two legal issues uh both of them related to each other that are before the court first is uh what are the u privileges and immunities of the United Nations and it's very clear in the charter of the United Nations which Israel is bound by and but by the 1946 convention on the privileges and immunities of the United Nations that um the facilities and buildings and work of the United Nations in whatever territory uh of a state that they're in are to be absolutely protected and that includes obviously uh their presence in the occup by territory the West Bank including East Jerusalem and Gaza um so that's one of the issues in front of the court the other is the one that you've uh you've spoken to with with Sam is what are the obligations of an occupying power under the international humanitarian law and particularly the 1949 Geneva Conventions which is the beating heart of uh of IHL and basically you know one of the one of the absolute fundamental obligations any state has particularly in a zone of conflict or a zone of occupation you cannot harm the civilians who are under your control and particularly you cannot starve them we thought that was something that was all done with uh with the end of the second world war the creation of a modern body of international law and here we are 80 years uh after the end of the second world war and we see vast starvation deliberately imposed so what happens uh um Michael before I come back to you Sam what happens if it's found that Israel is indeed in violation of the UN charter what action could could the United Nations take i mean could the UN General Assembly decide to expel Israel as one of its members for example that certainly uh is something that may be on the table let's keep in mind that Israel is in defiance of more than 30 Security Council resolutions over the last five decades it's ini in violation of scores of resolutions coming from the general assembly and the human rights council um much less was needed back in 1974 for the United Nations General Assembly not to recognize the credentials of apartheite South Africa and indeed kept that state out of the organization for the next 20 years if Israel defies this again and proceeds with this man-made famine um then I think you're going to start seeing action by some members of the General Assembly to question whether Israel should continue uh its status as a member uh of the United Nations all right uh Sam uh your thoughts about what is likely to happen here and what you are hoping this uh uh this new hearing is going to achieve some countries like the US uh have said that uh uh perhaps if if aid is not delivered through UNRA that other UN agencies uh could step in uh what do you make of that and and would that undermine uh UNRA's mandate if other UN agencies were to step in and fill uh the void that that is being left by UNRA thanks i mean look we're hoping for immediate action given the urgency of of the situation inside of Gaza we also recognize how polarizing this situation is as as as as Michael alluded to and Gideon as as well uh but ENRA is the provider of key basic services in Gaza and has been for for 75 years as you showed in your in your graphic educating in Gaza alone hundreds upon hundreds millions over a million children have gone through through UNRE schools some of the most literate people in in the region in including girls everything's been reduced to a supply of aid and boxes of aid and and food parcels through a border which is both incredibly dehumanizing but also uh ignorant uh of what people need to to live a dignified life and yes WFP could quite easily bring the aid in to to Gaza they need UNRA's assistance to get it to the people who need it as as quickly as possible what we're talking about here are the the 16,000 people a day who go to UNRA's health clinics the 500,000 people a day who receive uh clean water who receive garbage collection services from UNRA these are systems that we've put in place with the support of the international community over decades and it's those that will not be easily replaced and that's the plight of the civilian population of Gaza if UNRA's services are further constrained gideon UNRA as uh Sam said there is the only UN agency specifically dedicated to uh Palestinian refugees and which explicitly maintains the political definition of Palestinian refugees so are Israel's attacks on on UNRA also part of a broader campaign perhaps to to erase not just the Palestinian suffering but also uh Palestinian uh identity and Palestinian rights altogether that right to return uh that is part of Unoir's mandate no doubt that this step is just as I said before one chain and it has a much broader context namely and above all to tyrannize the life of the Palestinian and to make them leave that's the wet dream of of Israel that's the way dream of the right-wingers in Israel and anything is permitted in this anything is legitimate to reach this goal i I don't see any alternative to UNRA and you know what let's say that Israel has its own thoughts about UNRA and they think that UNRA is destructive in the middle of the war after destroying Gaza that's the time to close UNRA this shows the real intentions and the real intentions is to starve Gaza to death not less than this how how domestic political dynamics Gideon uh within Israel shape its approach to to international rulings and and to these humanitarian criticism that it's facing right now as the late Kissinger Henry Kissinger once said &quot;Israel does not have foreign policy it has only domestic politics.&quot; And it's being quoted in the recent months again and again many of Israel's steps in Gaza have their sources and their rationalization in domestic politics and this is this makes it just much more outrageous because there is no strategic goal right now in continuing the war it's all about satisfying the right-wingers in all and the fascists in order to keep the government in power because otherwise it falls apart but we have to remember that it didn't start now it is part of the thought of Israel and be it right or wrong you'll ask any Israeli he will tell you the whole world is against us no matter what we do the world is against us and if he is against us it's his blame not our blame and therefore we can do whatever we want not to speak about the fact that we are the chosen people and nobody is going to tell us what to do that's the mindset all right thank you for explaining that to us so clearly Michael so then given that the ICJ is an advisory body and that Israel as we're hearing from Gideon there is unlikely to comply with with any ruling what do you think are some of the mechanisms or international pressure even that could be helpful here to to pressure to enforce any ICJ guidance that will come about as a result of of this latest hearing well you're absolutely right i mean the ICJ can issue advisory opinions as you've said these are non-binding but they are a very authoritative statement on international law by the most respected international court that we that we have um and the the ability of ICJ uh advisory opinions or rulings depends upon the political will of the security council to fulfill them and that's not going to happen as long as the Americans have a veto so I then I think we shift our attention to the other international court that's in the HEG the international criminal court where which actually does have teeth 125 states in the world are members of the uh of the international criminal court when arrest warrants are issued all 125 states are obliged under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court to arrest those but as we saw I mean the ICC issued arrest warrants against uh the Israeli prime minister Netanyahu and the former defense minister but that hasn't led to anything no and you're right with the the one trip that um Benjamin Netanyahu has made to an ICC member has been to Hungary um and not ironically enough Hungary is one of the two states along with the United States that is appearing before the International Court of Justice this week on this advisory opinion request likely to argue in in protection and in favor of um uh of Israel but don't underestimate the uh the scope of the of the ICC's power uh with respect to this most just to clarify just to clarify Michael could the the IC ICJ's findings contribute to further action at the International Criminal Court and other courts yes of course i mean what the ICJ does is paid attention to by the ICC and vice versa if and when the ICJ decides on the separate advisor advisory matter with respect to the application by South Africa under the genocide convention that is going to be paid by close attention to by the ICC with respect to the prosecutor's decision to perhaps expand the number of arrest warrants and perhaps to expand the number of grounds for which uh these Israeli officials will be charged with all right Sam let me come to you now and you know ask you about what next i mean the legal ramifications of this case are profound but there's also a real human cost here um how do we ensure that the people on the ground in Gaza in the occupied West Bank are not forgotten in these legal debates especially when international aid and resources as we've been seeing for the past two months are being blocked by Israel i mean it's a very good question i mean this is a conflict that has received unparalleled levels of of attention the the the pictures the images that we'll never forget said into our minds in terms of what's happening to the people we are committed as ENRA and the rest of the humanitarian community inside Gaza inside the West Bank to continue pushing those messages out to make sure that the needs the suffering the rights of the population aren't forgotten the civilian population and that there is accountability for wrongdoing on on on on all sides but look this will only be addressed through political will if there's political will to open the borders now to ensure an orderly and respectful immediate release of of hostages but to put this conflict on the path to to to a solution so that Palestinians can enjoy the same rights and freedoms as their neighbors in in Israel without that uh we'll just repeat this again and again every few years and if this conflict and it's shocking to say after 18 months is not yet a wakeup call to the world on this then I then I I dread to think what what will be Gideon Levy in Tel Aviv will that political will that Sam talked about there will it ever come in Israel no it will not come in Israel but the challenge the real challenge is for the international community There's a member state of the UN which banned which is banning a very important UN agency there must be some kind of consequences to this there is a member state of the UN which violates the international law on a daily basis there must be some consequences to it and the challenge is not Israel the churches of the international community which is hugging Israel again and again and preventing any kind of accountability and if this will continue there will be no solution the solution will not come from within Israel israelis will not wake up one shining morning and say &quot;Oh what's going on in Gaza is not so nice let's put an end to it.&quot; No it will only be when they will be taken accountable and will also pay a price for it by the international community so the challenge is on the shoulders of the international community michael Link where do you think the solution will come from and what will we get at the end of this latest ICJ hearing and could could also the states that provide military support and political support to Israel uh ultimately be held complicit uh under international law if the ICJ were to determine that Israel's blockade uh constitutes a serious violation yes look um well international law doesn't have its own judges and it doesn't have its own armies that depends upon the political will of the UN uh and its leading members in order to be able to enforce there is a huge amount of legitimacy attached to decisions by the international court of justice and uh the international criminal court so with this number of decisions that Israel has been defined from the security council the general assembly the uh previous advisory opinions coming from the international court of justice and obviously as well these arrest warrants that have been issued by the international criminal court israel's legitimacy as a fair-minded uh player in the international system is taking yet more hits uh with respect to this but it only will we will only end the occupation we'll only have uh the realization of the Palestinian right of self-determination uh when the international community becomes mobilized enough to u finally impose a cost upon Israel israel has had an occupation now for 57 almost 58 years with virtually no cost at all uh politically or economically for this only when Israelis wake up and realize gee now I need a visa to go to Europe gee the prices uh of our goods are now becoming much more expensive because of the increasing blockades or the divestment coming from the international community only then I think will you see a significant change in Israeli public opinion and perhaps then the path to Palestinian self-determination thank you very much gentlemen for

on countries like Kenya which do business with both economic superpowers this is Inside Story [Music] hello and welcome to the program i'm Fib Batibbo kenya's President William RTO is in Beijing on a state visit his third trip in three years underlying the importance of China to his country china is Kenya's biggest lender funding major development projects including road and rail infrastructure but the trip comes as the trade war between China and the US worsens kenya and other developing countries find themselves in the middle after imposing tariffs on most countries US President Donald Trump is now seeking deals beijing is warning it will take action against any nation that makes agreements with the US that damage Chinese interests media reports also suggest Beijing is opening up another front reducing investment in private US funds so how is the trade war affecting countries like Kenya which do business with both sides will they have to pick a side and with China holding around threequarters of a trillion dollars in US debt what risks does that pose to both sides we'll talk to our guests shortly but first this report from Laura Khan the economy trade and development are on the agenda for Kenyan President William R's 5-day visit to China as is a significant debt his country owes to its biggest lender billions of dollars it's struggling to pay off but now it seems Kenya may be entangled in a trade war between Beijing and Washington president R was originally seen to be western leaning to suddenly start leaning to the east uh for to seek assistance but I think in terms of how Kenya is attempting to navigate its debt issues we've seen it trying to widen its scope of partnerships almost a year ago then President Joe Biden named Kenya a special US ally during President R's visit to the White House but this year the Trump administration has cut more than $200 million in aid and added a 10% tariff on Kenyan goods entering the US the East African nation is just one of many caught up in a tit fortat trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies china increased duties on American goods to 125% after President Donald Trump raised levies on Chinese goods to 145% we advocate for inclusive and beneficial economic globalization including a multilateral trading system with a world trade organization at its core we must consistently uphold the principles of openness inclusiveness and mutual benefit oppose all forms of unilateralism and protectionism last week President Xi Jinping visited Malaysia Vietnam and Cambodia to strengthen regional ties signing dozens of cooperation agreements and sending a message that Beijing is a reliable trading partner in the US stock markets are volatile with investors fearing the knock-on effects a trade war will have on the global economy and on the streets many are concerned that President Trump's trade policies mean familiar liquor and food from abroad will be served up with a higher price tag i mean it's so soul crushing and deeply saddening uh coming from the largest Chinatown in the United States which is the Chinatown in San Francisco uh to see what could possibly erase some people's ability to obtain things they grew up with ingredients that they know and love china's GDP grew in the first quarter beating expectations but economists have warned of a sharp downturn in the coming months as the US tariffs come into effect laura Khan inside story alazer let's now bring in our guests joining us from Beijing is Aar Tangen a senior fellow at the Teahi Institute robert Scott is an independent international economist he joins us from Rockville Maryland in the United States and in London David Omo an emerging market economist at Capital Economics he specializes in African countries a warm welcome to each one of you thank you so much for your time today um Robert uh let me start with you if I can and these latest developments Chinese investors reportedly changing their approach to US private equity just how serious is this for uh the US financial sector especially private equity well I I think private equity is is feeling uh pressured not only by threats from Chinese investors but by the tumult in markets caused by President Trump his his massive tariff increases that were imposed already uh especially the the 145% tariff on imports from China have have uh threatened to disrupt global trade and stimulate more inflation in the United States and the stock market is down uh more than 20% since the first of the year and uh so I think the the bigger problems here are based in domestic investors at the moment uh you the markets are in freef fall because of President Trump's actions also his threats yesterday to the independence of the Federal Reserve saying he wished to replace Chairman Powell indeed do you think Robert Do you think Robert that this additional pressure on private equity will pressure the Trump administration to rethink its stance towards this trade uh war frankly I doubt that the the the biggest uh component of China's investment in the US United States is public uh China has over $3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves in the that are held by the central bank in addition the the uh sovereign wealth funds hold nearly$2.5 trillion dollars as well so China is by far America's biggest lender and most of that is public funds all right Anarr Tangen from the Chinese perspective what strategic purpose does cutting off private equity investment in the US serve is it more about economic leverage or or diplomatic uh signaling here well I think it's diplomatic signaling remember uh if you start looking at this you know at arms length Donald Trump's problem isn't China it isn't the rest of the world it's what he's doing to the American public it's purely a bluff uh within two months people will be calling for his his head um he was elected uh by people who perhaps didn't care for his personality but thought that he was the best uh candidate to control prices and instead of doing that he's raised them so I used to run political um elections in the US and I can tell you for certainty that people vote with their pocketbook and they are not happy and they're going to get less and less happy as these tariffs wind in uh David let me come to you i I will of course ask you about uh President R's visit to to Beijing and the significance of that at this time but I wanted to get your thoughts first about what uh Robert alluded to earlier and the growing concern that China might escalate the trade war even further by dumping US debt um h how realistic is that scenario in your view and what would be the ripple effects of that not just within the US but for the rest of the world and the African continent uh especially yeah um to to to talk about the realism of um how how likely it is I think maybe a bit outside my expertise but in terms of its potential implications for kind of African economies um in terms of the market dislocation it would cause um there was a worrying rise in say um the interest rates that many African countries have to borrow on on international capital markets in relation to the um the kind of trade turmoil that's happened if we got an escalation we'd worry that that would kind of happen again and that would leave many countries who need um this kind of money from international markets to finance their kind of budgets in a really worrying place i think that's the biggest worry um not the kind direct trade implications of say um US trade with Africa but more this how global trade turmoil kind of impacts all of Africa's kind of trade partners and the global economy kind of in total okay uh so David now let me ask you about President R's visit uh to to Beijing uh which comes at a tense time as we've seen in in the US China trade war what opportunities uh whether economic or diplomatic do you see for African countries like Kenya what can they extract from from this deepening divide between uh these two economic superpowers um it's it's a tricky one on on the US side i think we've been making the point that the transactional style of politics that President Trump has kind of proceeded with it's probably the buzz word we constantly hear transactional means that countries with leverage of sorts whether it's mineral wealth or in Kenya's case kind of strategic um kind of importance from a security perspective um have the most to gain I guess or can really play off with the US what they can offer in that regard to perhaps get better kind of economic terms whether it's on the trade perspective whether it's FDI investment that type of thing on the kind of China perspective we think the relations with China already quite deep anyway in terms of the amount um China is a much bigger trading partner for many kind of African countries than the US is and you've seen over the last kind of few decades the importance of the loans that China has given to many kind of kind of African countries and that financing there's a question as to whether this pushes kind of countries to decide that China is a bit more of a reliable partner um they're less likely to kind of engage in the stick approach that we're seeing but that's really dependent on what state China is in to carry on um with kind of economic engagement they're going to kind of suffer from this trade war does that have any implications for what they lend to Africa the kind of investment they put in different countries let's ask aar about the China perspective ana why is it beneficial to China to make investments in a country like Kenya for example well quite frankly I mean the way that China sees the world is quite different they're not out to conquer it they're not taking over other lands they haven't suggested that they should own Canada uh what they do is they have these principles that uh countries should be secure that there should be a path to prosperity and that they have to be respected and along that line they for the last 10 years they put a trillion dollars into the belt and road initiative it has not always been smooth and there have been problems with loans especially when they were uh government to government because the only thing you know for certain is the next government that comes in is not going to be happy about what the last government did but overall Kenya has the last 10 years been exceeding over 5% uh growth it's actually outperformed uh the developed countries uh well still having uh major issues uh with wealth disparity but it's in the right direction so China is not going to destabilize the world it has no interest in selling off all of its bond bonds uh that would create a global cataclysm and that's exactly the opposite of what China has been trying to do he saw this very clearly when the Xi Jinping was first in Vietnam then um in Malaysia and then finally in Cambodia he was assuring people that China will be a reliable partner that they'll continue to open up so this is China's story very different from Donald Trump's as has been put out by my colleagues uh your thoughts about this Robert do you see this moment as a a moment for Africa to pivot towards China uh uh towards deeper integration with China or is there a risk here on becoming too reliant which some have said you know African countries like Kenya uh like uh uh the DRC are already too reliant on on China the African countries are at risk for becoming too dependent on China because China is uh investing so much in their development infrastructure roads as as the general China has has mentioned the the the huge belt and and road initiative has made these countries dependent on loans and those loans at some point are going to have to be repaid and that's going to uh sort drag on the countries of of of Africa so there's no free lunch here there's nothing that you get for for for free and there are costs involved what are your thoughts aa I saw you shaking your heads there uh Robert says African countries are already too reliant on on China on loans and that there's no free lunch what do you say to that yeah I mean this is the debt trap diplomacy uh call saying oh China is somehow taking over these countries you know where is the United States where is the rest of the world uh in terms of helping these countries develop i mean the track record is clear the last 10 years Kenya's been growing why because it has had these loans it's been able to use these loans to develop its infrastructure if you didn't do that Kenya would just be a subservient country at the mercy of the colonial interests that originally abused it i I I find it odd that there is always this oh well China's lending money that's that's bad right why Why would that be bad these countries need to develop and I I I I would love to hear from my colleague about what what it is that the US or Europe has done to help African countries get out of it and we'll ask we'll ask Robert about that in just a moment but But let's hear from David on this david what do you make of what we just heard there from both Robert and uh Inar i I don't want to be the middle ground and stand on the fence between um kind of Robert and I know um I I I think it's it's quite interesting i take that point of what's the alternative i I think we I talked about earlier the kind of worrying rise in kind of yields um that many of these kind of African countries are wanting to borrow at so they're quite boxed in in terms of financing kind of budget deficits that many of them are running so where do they turn to and you're seeing the US in a way retreat um from the kind of pivot we that the kind of former administration was talking about in terms of relationship with Africa to a lot more transactional so it leads them to okay you can't borrow international capital markets and um kind of issue euro bonds you the concessionary kind of lending from say the IMF and kind of other kind of organizations might be a bit more tricky too so you've got to increasingly look to other players and that's where China does kind of step in i would say in terms of that debt trap diplomacy point um I think it is a lot more nuance as kind of Robert mentioned but there is this sense of debt restructuring talks when countries do kind of go over the precipice and default have become more difficult because of not just China but it's simply because there are just so many um kind of different organiz stakeholders that African countries are owing debts to your private bond holders the IMF and kind of other organizations are getting involved bilateral lenders are getting involved so that needs some kind of resolution and I think from a China perspective in terms of transparency around the debt terms that needs to be addressed um other stakeholders need to address the issues that they're kind of introducing into debt debt negotiations too so it's it's it's a bit more nuanced I think is the final point I'd make all right Robert your thoughts and and as Anar mentioned Robert I mean we've seen China engage African countries with high stakes infrastructure deals like in Kenya for example in Ethiopia as well in Zambia the Loito corridor with the DRC and so on if the US administration is right now signaling to some of these countries that they should not engage too closely uh to China we've heard some of the threats from the Trump administration what exactly is it offering in return are we seeing any comparable uh US-backed initiatives that can match the scale at which China is engaging with the African continent right now no I'm afraid it's just the opposite president Trump shut down the US aid which provided aid to to African countries it was not on the scale as offered by ch by China uh but it was still significant especially for countries suffering from uh famines and other kinds of acute acute uh food shortages so uh Trump has moved in the wrong direction in terms of its relationship with Africa and the developing countries and this is not helping so uh in a sense we're pushing these countries into the arm arms of China and uh this is not good for either the US or Africa right so Anar where does China stand right now we've seen it warn countries not to engage in deals that damage its interests at the behest of the US we have right now as we've seen uh African countries like Kenya deepening ties with Beijing while other countries like Ghana and Zambia for example are negotiating debt restructuring um is China drawing a red line here and how far is it willing to go uh if countries pursue USbacked uh alternatives i mean whether it's in you know digital infrastructure or transportation energy or military corporation as as is the case for Kenya for example well it's it's a very different perspective I mean uh China has never said to anybody up to this point you can't deal with the US and they're not saying that they don't care about anyone's cooperation I mean they deal with the Middle East states they have very good relations in most part with the United States they have military cooperation it isn't an issue it's about trade but Donald Trump is saying to these countries that if you want uh I'm going to slap you with tariffs now if you don't want the tariffs you have to do as I tell you and what I tell you to do is stop trading with China and China's saying &quot;Look we're we're not going to countenance that.&quot; I mean this this is really troubling that you have this bully wandering around slapping people around taking their lunch money and then saying &quot;You should thank me for it.&quot; As pointed out Donald Trump isn't interested in the rest of the world he's interested in only one thing and that is quote what can those countries give America i mean this this is the definition of you know hijgemy I mean he's just he doesn't care right David what can African countries give America today they're they're working they're walking a really tight rope here do you do you think they can realistically afford to alienate uh either China or the United States um on the United States point I mean like currently we've got 10% kind of universal tariff a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs um I think our kind of expectation is that the pause may be extended so African countries aren't going to be hit yet or it doesn't look like they're going to be hit by those kind of doomsday style tariffs that we're expecting but I think we were making that point in that the direct implications of the trade hit from the US isn't as kind of doomsday as many would think certain countries yes but on the whole the African countries are doing much more trade with China it's a bigger trading partner that's probably where the bigger concern should be not saying that they won't want to negotiate with the US but this transactional style of politics as I said if you're not a mineral producer or you haven't got strategic security kind of importance it's hard to see what the US are going to or what President Trump is going to say can get out of um kind of these talks with the African countries on the on the China perspective I I'm not sure that China has to do much more to um kind of convince African countries to align with it um we've got a global fracturing um kind of proprietary measure and a lot of African countries align with China um based on that measure and we kind of expect that to continue as well so um I I don't I don't think it's necessary China going to have to do much when America's already probably alienating kind of countries that haven't got loads to offer in terms of leverage all right Robert before I come to Anar for his thoughts what are your thoughts about where this is headed i mean are we seeing the beginning of a financial decoupling between the US and China and is this a great time then for the global south for African countries to to move even closer to China i am concerned that that's the case uh what and what if we look at what China did during the first Trump term uh between 2016 and 2020 uh Trump raised tariffs initially on China to substantial levels well below the current uh 100% plus tariffs but in the range of 25 to 30% uh China responded by uh shipping mass quantities of exports uh diverting them from the US to countries like Vietnam and Cambodia and Malaysia exactly where President Xi is today and uh in turn those countries rerouted the exports from China to the United States so although US exports from China to the sorry Chinese exports directly to the United States fell dramatically after Trump imposed tariffs China's exports to the world increased overall so China was not hurt particularly by the tariffs they simply diverted trade to these other countries and I expect them to do that again and perhaps to expand that diversion through Africa as well all right uh your your thoughts in about where this is headed is it again the beginning of of a financial decoupling between the US and China not just in trade but in capital flows and investment philosophies okay well you know this story stop me before I spend again american consumers spend one out of every four dollars on imported goods whether they come from China Vietnam or wherever it is still is not coming from the United States so and they're not going to it cannot they cannot be produced at uh the kind of prices in the United States so let's put that aside let's talk about this 10% since it's going against everybody all right it doesn't make any difference basically American consumers are going to foot the bill or at least the majority of it so you know this idea that this is going to sink the world no it will depress demand on the American side and that has an effect that ripples onto the world stage because US although it's only 4 and a.5% of the world's population manages to consume about 18 19% of the world's GDP on a on a yearly basis so at this point you know we're talking about a bluff by Donald Trump he cannot decouple is the long-term looking like there's going to be less cooperation between these twos i would say yes the book ends have been reset and they're a lot more conservative uh America is justifiably concerned about its economic uh condition but the way to do that is to out compete nations not try to bludgeon them to death with tariffs all right uh David I'll give you the final word where do you think this is headed and also David are there lessons that African countries can can take from this geopolitical tension in shaping their own uh sovereign wealth fund strategies um on on the first point I think the the the worry I have is if you do get this kind of pivoting by China in terms of they've got huge manufacturing capacity and they decide to instead of exporting to the US even if rerouting does work if it doesn't work you may see there's been worries about potential dumping and kind of manufacturing manufactured goods going to kind of other countries increase if that happens on the kind of African kind of side um you've already seen trade deficits in Africa between Africa and China kind of increasing i think the worry is what happens if that kind of stops the kind of fledgling kind of manufacturing kind of growth models that perhaps we we kind of hope for in terms of Africa moving up the value chain um so that that that's kind of one worry I have on just how Africa decides to engage geopolitically i think it's going to continue to try to position itself in it in the most optimal way kind of ensuring that it's able to get what it can from the US and what it can from kind of China so not necessarily it there may be it may be more aligned towards China but not necessarily at the expense of completely kind of severing kind of ties with the kind of US as I think one of the guests mentioned in terms of say um kind of Middle Eastern countries having strong relations with the US despite um also doing having deep kind of economic relationships with China all right thank you gentlemen to all three of you for a great

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] the french president charms southeast asia offering a third way for foreign relations emanuel mcron pitches france as an alternative to the us and china while signing tens of billions of dollars in trade deals so are polarizing superpower dynamics giving european countries an edge in asia and elsewhere i'm andrea seni and this is the newsmakers [Music] now to be honest if you google the french president's trip to asia you'll see how tabloid coverage of a shove to the face got the best of his visit but behind those headlines manuel mcron stops in vietnam indonesia and singapore marked a turning point of sorts in foreign policy one where third countries are seeking opportunities between the us and its punishing tariffs and china which some say seeks to dominate the region here's a look now at france's strategy in asia honest words from french president emanuel macron during his one-week trip to southeast asia he was of course referring to the us and china but he then went on to present france as a third way amid the current global turmoil macarron began his tour in france's former colony vietnam the southeast asian nation is at risk of facing 40% us tariffs which could hit its export-driven economy extremely hard hanoi is negotiating a trade deal with washington that would see it buy more american goods and reduce some chinese trade to avoid high levies and vietnam is not alone president trump is threatening the eu with 50% tariffs by july in light of this macron is pushing closer ties with the region in an increasingly unstable international environment marked by the erosion of the pillars of the global order there is an urgent need to give even more substance to this special partnership between states and organizations that share a commitment to the multilateral framework and to international trade based on robust rules the two sides have signed 10 billion worth of agreements covering defense energy and trade that includes a deal with vietjet air to buy 20 airbus planes macron also expressed his support of vietnam in safeguarding the south china sea amid increasing tensions with china we share the same desire to defend international maritime law in particular the united nations convention on the law of the sea france has constantly reiterated this commitment that of freedom of sovereignty which is at the heart of our indo-pacific strategy macron's second stop was indonesia he described his counterpart pauo sububanto as a great friend and presented him with france's legion of honor defense cooperation was the highlight of that visit indonesia ordered 42 french raphael fighter jets in january last year and more could come after the recent meetings jakarta also announced the purchase of french submarines and radar systems and the two sides are looking to develop better ties in culture trade and agriculture i believe and i am optimistic that our partnership will continue and can be a bridge for cultural experts artists and creative industry workers as well as all figures in both our countries industry creative macron's last stop is singapore where he opens asia's top security summit the shangrila dialogue china is attending with lower ranking officials but us defense secretary pete hexath is going as he left the us hexith said he would pitch the trump administration's policy of peace and deterrence through strength we're going out uh to singapore to hold a series of meetings to ensure that region understands america will be strong we seek no conflict uh with anybody including the communist chinese but we will deter that we will stand strong for our interests as the great powers battle for control of the global order and trade others are trying to find a balance for southeast asia france and the eu want to be a reliable alternative but can they really challenge the dominance of the superpowers well it has been a decade since a french leader visited southeast asia so joining me now to talk further about what macron wants and how it could change france's geopolitical standing in the region are from london associate professor in politics and international relations at the university of nottingham simon tubo from hong kong senior economist for apac at natixus and research fellow at the central european institute of asian studies gary ning and also from london senior lecturer in international relations and politics at aston university joseph downing thanks all so much for being with me simone i i'll start with you because you've said you actually see this visit as a strategic repositioning of european powers in the asia-pacific region so explain what you mean by that and what's driving this shift that you're talking about okay so there's the immediate um let's say incentive of the the french government to try and renew uh direct uh economic ties and relationships with some of the countries of uh south asia uh and that follows um in particular recently from the fact that the french government had been uh denied a contract that had been uh uh put on offer from the australian government for the provision of um nuclear submarines and uh i think that the french government is so sort of looking to try and rebuild uh some some of these defense contracts and has uh been looking for some new uh customers say in in in that region so that that would be a kind of immediate uh uh interest trying to renew economic uh ties but also uh defense ties security ties uh and ties that will benefit the um the the french uh defense industry there's a broader picture of course which is that um there's a change in in in the overall context and and the french it wants the french government wants to position itself as an as some kind of uh intermediate power that some of these countries can rely on that so they don't have to turn to china or to the united states the china the chinese government has been increasingly assertive in that region the united states is becoming increasingly unpredictable and so france wants to present itself as a predictable reliable uh partner that wishes to conduct uh business and trade on on an equitable basis right so gary yeah france sees this as it's now been said by macron as a third way or you know another alternative really for all azion nations but are azion nations i mean other than china looking for a third way or are most of them perfectly happy kind of being part of china's biggest trading partner block well um indeed if you look at the aan uh countries it is always about economics and security so um obviously when you look at uh the case of china then it is indeed a big economic power then with uh the fact that it is uh the biggest trading partner then it does bring some economic benefit but having said that it doesn't mean that arson want to uh you know uh totally uh give its destiny tied towards china because obviously a lot of the uh ant demand of their exports still goes to the us and then for the case of eu it is really uh power that can be a bit more neutral in the way between this us china competition so i would say that yes china is important economically but i wouldn't underestimate um the role of other countries uh in the assean diplomacy simply because um it is really about how to gain the most from all this inflow of investment aim at this very uncertain environment but do you think france's moves now gary might agitate china well um i would say that uh france and china has been uh in uh disagreement in certain issues we do see there are different uh tariff being put on uh france uh certain products like corn etc so um because of the um uh basically the retaliation on the ev um tax uh that uh the eu put on china so for the case of aen well i wouldn't think that uh europe would be able to completely uh replace china and i wouldn't think it is a move to irritate uh china as well i mean if the whole purpose it's really about uh business trying to pay for towards the uh you know um uh economic side then i mean it's normal for france to pitch different ideas on defense on aviation and also on certain sectors like green energy for collaboration so um i would say that france is trying to project it in a comic way there's a certain element to offer alternative option for uh in the case of china but it is not really into that direct confrontation uh that someone may project that to be okay joseph what's your take and what do you think are the real benefits of european partners for asian countries are european partners less ownorous or less complicated than the us and china i mean emmanuel mcron wants to sell this is look we're equals no strings attached well i think i think there's there's a player here that we've not mentioned which i think is really important in macron's pivot because it speaks to the needs of many of these asian countries and that is a state that in fact doesn't exist anymore which is essentially the soviet union and the successor state the russian federation because the defense and security dna of vietnam indonesia and china uh essentially chart a line from inventions made in the soviet union and with russia demonstrating that it's an unreliable uh export partner in terms of defense industries it its recent war in ukraine has consumed much of its sort of very diminished uh domestic production asian country and also the poor performance of many russian assets in theater in ukraine have have made many around the world not just in asia but but but much further a field take a second look at their own um defense architecture and to actually look at russian weapons as perhaps quite inferior right and so both macron and france needs uh export earnings and foreign direct investment to continue down macron's uh road of of trying to boost the french economy and asian nations also need to upgrade their uh defense architecture and to do that without relying on russia and and its its problematic relationship to defense manufacturing and export so i think that there's a meeting of interests here in a way that there perhaps hasn't been between france and by extension the eu and southeast asian nations um a meeting of interest that hasn't necessarily been there before our european partners are no strings attached i wouldn't say so i think macron's treading a very fine line here we have to remember one of the states that he's visited uh vietnam is still by all intents and purposes a socialist uh single party dictatorship um so are these exports are these deals going to come with no strings attached or will macron be be pushing the vietnamese government at some point on you know human rights freedom and democracy type concerns that's something that remains to be seen at the moment everything is is is smiles and the signing of contracts but but some of these issues may raise their heads uh further down the road interesting okay simone i saw you agree at least it seemed that uh through the defense lens uh that joseph was describing you seem to agree that there is certainly that angle but about the no strings attached i mean would you foresee any issues on on human rights really playing a role in trade relations in particular going forward with with these asian partners i i haven't seen any uh explicit uh mention uh of that uh at all um and uh so i haven't you know i don't anticipate that that's at least not something that's on the agenda um i think that at the moment they're they're concentrating on on uh commercial interests and and and security uh relationship they want to really build the infrastructure that enables them to cooperate uh in some of these matters in the future uh around uh you know the the sort of modernization of manufacturing of of of domestic energy uh of agriculture and so so they're really setting um in place a framework for them to develop a relationship into the future uh and this is the kind of the beginnings of it now in terms of in terms of their their their uh let's say how they may use these uh economic ties in order to develop political clout uh i i like i said i haven't seen it being mentioned they have to also i think take on board the fact that uh a lot of these countries are sort of you know more or less well functioning democracies i mean they're they're not sort of advanced western uh democracies uh but but they they have transitioned away from authoritarian regimes in in most cases and so you know the these are these are these are working democracies for the most part the only uh case uh in that region where there's been flagrant human right violations uh recently is in the case of of the philippines uh with some of their kind of domestic law and order policies uh and in the case of myanmar where where the ja has uh you know massacred civilians in order to reassert it its authority after after the coup but i think in in those domains the the the france and and europe can rely on the assan countries to try and manage uh some of these uh tensions uh internally and i think asean has been very good at managing these things quietly and kind of beneath the surface and maintaining a consensus among those countries to to to try and try and keep keep some of these issues uh negotiated sort of internally so yeah i i i think that we're not likely to see that that very soon okay gary let me ask you what you think france's kind of embedded interests in the asia-pacific region are i mean it it does have some territories in the indian and in the pacific ocean they are not necessarily of strategic relevance in southeast asia uh but it also has you know some 1.65 65 million french citizens across the greater area so what what real direct interest does france have uh to be there to be involved and to be as active uh a trade partner as possible well i would say that uh i would go back to the same uh factors of the economics and geopolitics and uh if we look at what happened in europe over the past few years especially after the uh ukraine uh war broke out there's a very strong emphasis on security it is not only about you know preventing whether there would be another war etc it is also about the supply chain security in u making sure all the products are can be under control and then the certain production being moved back to europe and obviously in this case asia is the biggest manufacturing hub in the world it is also important for a lot of french company as well both as a production base and the market so i think this is really the number one reason for france to have a even deeper involvement in asia i mean forget all the overseas territory and even uh the uh citizens living here but commercial interest is indeed here to secure this um economic um security question so um i guess this is pretty much uh driving the trend that we are seeing uh right now um this is really a business and geopolitical uh driven move okay joseph let me ask you something slightly uh well in a slightly different direction but still quite relevant in seeing how france has actually lost rather significant influence with its former colonies in africa could asia be seen as a sort of decent replacement for what has been lost arguably there i i think they it's it's a bit like comparing apples and oranges right i mean france's influences in africa were much more not a relationship of equals right they're a relationship of france being at a much higher level of of geostrategic and economic power than places like nishair marley bikina faso these these places in africa also much closer to france so they presented issues more immediately in terms of any instability in that region would drive um migration to france there were there are significant uh diasporas in france and many of these african countries that could be used as a conduit for internal security threats uh whereas um asia has a lot more to offer france in terms of the economic clout the supply chain um security that our previous guest has just raised the fact that many of of the sort of global manufacturing hubs you know cheap labor in china right that era is kind of over and many industries are moving their manufacturing bases to places like vietnam and indonesia because of lower labor costs so i do think i don't think we can really see this macaron will try and present it as as a relationship of equals but i don't think france really likes to treat the rest of the world as equals i think like many postcolonial countries it prefers to be in the driving seat but but if we are to talk about relationships of equals these the they are much closer in terms of their positions um politically and geostrategically globally than france ever was with its previous colonies in africa i i don't think we can really see it as a neat a neat switch because the two regions are so radically different um let me ask simon if you would agree there i mean arguably southeast asia does not have the same bitter and tragic uh colonial history i guess as the maghreb does looking at cases like algeria in particular so even though it might not be completely relationship of equals it's a cleaner slate per se um yeah i would i would i would agree there with with what um with with what has just been mentioned um i think i think that um the the relationship that france had with its its french african colonies that was informed by this sort of france uh policy was a much more uh is a much more kind of a deeper relationship the the the french foreign um foreign policy had a very strong influence on these countries uh foreign policy they were very established french commercial interests inside of these countries and it was a kind of neoc colonial relationship and it was a very the i think the african states were in a much more kind of subordinate positions i think in this case it's it's a much more let's say equitable relationship not it's not purely equitable uh the the french do uh present uh you know a certain uh amount of advancement in in you know the kind of techn technology that that they're able to offer when it comes to let's say civil nuclear energy um some of the very advanced weaponry systems that that they're going to be delivering um some of the collaborations around data centers artificial intelligence and so on i think in that position it's it's trying to present itself as as a leader as some as a country that has something to offer but of course but of course the the the asian countries are also able to to to provide uh something which interests france and that's really to do with the their their geographical location at this kind of crucial nexus between the indian ocean and the pacific ocean where france has has its departur and some of its uh some of its overseas territories um and and these are also important uh places for manufacturing and and they're important trading routes uh and and it's there this is also an important flash point in some of the global uh geopolitical tensions between uh china and some of its uh neighboring countries and and i think france wants to be able to play an influence in that in the way in which that unfolds and so these these countries offer an opportunity for that influence yeah i mean on the flip side of this gary you know we have the united states and and as as far as the us is concerned is concerned is this part of what some analysts see as kind of trump's general strategy backfiring on the us in that new alliances are now forming and becoming stronger in order to work around uh the united states as a partner in most part because of punishing tariffs well i would say uh yes and no because uh if you look at uh the collaboration between aen and europe it has always been that case anyway the one difference that we see right now is that the us may not be really holding that root based trade system of which the world and especially asia has benefited over the last few decades and with that uh regard um indeed the eu is the one who is trying to push through a rub based uh agenda uh right now in trade and investment so what i would continue to observe is really whether this would be a catalyst for aren to and eu to really sign the free trade agreement because without that it seems quite hard to france for france to really uh accelerate this trade investment relationship with aen and especially in some of the countries that mccoy visited this time vietnam indonesia and singapore those are all important french economic partners okay joseph we just have a minute left so let me kind of get your your final thoughts on where you see the southeast asia france relationship going uh i think we're going to see a lot of strengthening in economic uh defense and political cooperation because of many of the reasons that we've highlighted um already today one thing that i think should really be raised here are some of the differences in in in terms of the way that these regions perhaps view the world although france has many and many of its western allies have begun to criticize uh israel's current military campaign in gaza and this is something that macron has used today sort of as a diplomatic sort of olive branch to indonesia indonesia being the world's most populous muslim country and a place where there is significant support for palestinian self-determination things like this make nice sound bites and macron can say um that he supports a two-state solution and he supports you know palestinian self-determination but when it comes down to it it's going to be much more difficult to put that into practice right we're not really seeing uh france in a position where it's it's going to stop military collaboration with israel or it's going to impose sanctions or anything like that to coersse its behavior i don't think any any of these kinds of diverging interests are big enough uh to get in the way the political and economic um collaboration but but they they could be flies in the ointment that may make some of these uh deals more politically contentious for those leaders in uh the southeast asian region particularly in indonesia to to sort of sell to their domestic populations interesting okay joseph you will have to have the final word for this edition of the newsmakers so unfortunately we're completely out of time but i'd like to thank sincerely all three of my panelists for being with us and uh to thank our viewers for joining us as well remember

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] [Music] hello I'm Adrian finigan and this is counting the cost on aler your weekly look at the world of business and economics this week the US has dominated the global economy for decades but the world is fractured by geopolitical tensions and globalization is facing a backlash is the economic order changing is it the US versus China the trade war between the two Nations is heating up the competition between Washington and Beijing could accelerate the collapse of the old system so what's the alternative developing nations have formed economic alliances like bricks to counter the dominance of the west but will it work economic integration and globalization the free flow of trade with the us at the helm that's the economic order the world has known for decades today though the disintegration of the rules-based world order is evident for all to see countries are becoming more inward-looking regulatory fences have been erected the World Trade Organization is in limbo nations are racing to build the industries of the future and trade restrictions are increasingly being imposed now the system that's governed the the global economy since the second world war is at a Tipping Point now more than ever so is a new world order emerging we'll discuss that with our guests shortly but first let's listen to what some leaders had to say about the old one the poor countries have been and are being oppressed and terrorized by the rich countries naturally the poor are bitter and angry and have lost faith in Justice and honor Global political and economic governance created more than six decades ago have not kept PA with the changing realities of the world bricks Remains the one Dynamic element in the global economy and as such they will account for a significant share of trade the development of the emerging market and developing countries is not intended to move the cheese but to make the pie of the global economy bigger we should push forward the establishment of governing models and rules which are more balanced and inclusive we should push forward the reform of the global economic governance system to reflect the current structure and realities each night I ask myself why should every country have to be tied to the dollar for trade why can't we trade in our own currency and why don't we have the commitment to innovate we are against any kind of hegemony or exclusivity propagated by some countries and the new policy of ongoing colonialism neocolonialism based upon this assumption we have to reform global economic financial and political as well as the multilateral Trad system so that we can create a conducive environment for fair trade let's introduce you to our panel of experts and get a quick reaction from them from Singapore we're joined by Danny qua who's Dean and Lee K Shing professor in economics at the National University of Singapore from Johannesburg we're joined by Arena murisan who's a senior researcher at The Institute for Global dialogue and a specialist on the bricks block and finally in London Philip lron who's a political economist and former special adviser to the director general of the World Trade Organization Danny is the world order uh the Old World Order close to collapse I don't think it's so much as close to collapse but it's certainly being questioned from all sides the clips that you showed the clips that we heard uh a few minutes ago were ones that were from what sometimes we think of as the global self and they were critical of the international economic order one of the interesting turnarounds is that today the advanced economies the rich economies are also critical of the international economic order and how this comes out is going to be really interesting going forwards I don't think that we're going to have to be thinking about how we rethink categories it might no longer be bricks or Global south or west versus East but more groups of countries that have an adherance to economic performance that's Dynamic and forward-looking Keen to emphasize trade Keen to think about building out economic fundamentals Keen to continue to work with a Level Playing Field and on the other side a group of no Nations that might have historically had the upper hand but for whom Now growth is anemic and so that it seems to me is the increasing confrontation there will be a challenge to the international economic order Arena would you agree with that if the old world order is is not collapsing right now the economic center of gravity is Shifting isn't it absolutely and I mean part of the bricks Jo strategic intention is to use their partnership to create Windows where they can also change the world and whether the suits everyone should not be the focus because countries are pragmatic for the forces themselves but if we look at the institutions specifically from the post World War II order that we you know characterize the world order by multilateralism is and has been under attack and if you look at the bricks and their values and the sense that they advocate for a rules-based order governed by international law and celebration of multilateralism many take for granted that this may be interpreted for one's own value systems and so the criticism is that the world is in a constant state of stable Anarchy and the institutions like your WTO should be instilling these relevant boundaries to mitigate GE strategic interests and it's really the rest the smaller countries the emerging and middle powers that need to uphold institutional values to build this kind of critical mass that is needed to create a culture of accountability that people that they all want to see Philip what's going wrong with the institutions that were designed to safeguard the the old world order are they now defunct I think what's changed is the old order which is the one that prevailed since the end of the Cold War uh in the early 90s was based on four pillars four pillars that have now crumbled the first uh is Western economic dominance and as Danny has said um the West has declined and the rest um have risen uh the second was an exceptional period of us GE political Agony and and we now live in an increasingly multi-polar World which is characterized between by geopolitical conflict between a still dominant us and a rising uh China thirdly as Danny also noted um before there was a belief in open markets which Trump pretty much everything and now increasingly that is usurped um by National Security concerns and indeed industrial policy uh priorities not just in the west also in China indeed has always been the case and last but not least um a US willingness to support uh International uh rules and to abide by them most of the time and that's exceptional for he hegemonic power and now now that is no longer the case it's no longer the case in the United States it's not the case uh in China neither of them are willing to accept uh significant constraints on their economic uh policymaking and the upshot is in the old IC order the big question policy makers asked was is it going to make us richer and now the key priority is is it going to make us more secure okay before we go any further trade and investment flows are settling into new patterns built around the top two economies the US and China who are racing to shape the norms and rules of the world's economic and political order Washington is raising the heat on Beijing with investment curs and trade restrictions and China is redirecting large parts of its economy away from the West toward the developing World Kya Lopez hodayan reports the world is changing fast and so is the global economic order trade Wars between the US and China are fueling much of the shift forging new alliances and fracturing old ones US President Joe Biden recently issued a new round of tariffs on Beijing affecting about 18 billion dollar worth of Chinese products including electric vehicles batteries and semiconductors bottom line I want Fair competition with China not conflict and we're in a stronger position to win that economic competition the 21st century against China than anyone else China has repeatedly accused the US of bullying and of Market protectionism if the United States persists China will take Resolute and forceful measures to firmly defend its sovereignty security and development interests Rising tensions between the US and China are not new I heard it was going to be terrible they first escalated during Trump's presidency and have continued since much of the focus now turns to the European Union and who it will choose to do business with in the long term China's industrial policy may seem remote As we sit here in this room but if we do not respond strategically and in a United Way the viability of businesses in both our countries and around the world could be at risk China is capitalizing on divisions in a recent visit to Serbia president Chi Jinping established stronger ties with the Eastern European country which has been waiting for EU membership for over a decade with the joint efforts of both countries the China Serbia free Trade Agreement formally begins in July Beijing is also building stronger ties with Iran a longtime rival of Western governments the war in Ukraine is another factor it's disrupted energy supplies across Europe and it's also weakened ties between Russia and the west but is strengthened them elsewhere including parts of Africa Zimbabwe is open for business and and welcomes and welcomes Investments Partnerships and collaboration it's a battle between two superpowers with the US and China looking to dominate one economic order while the race for artificial intelligence digital Technologies and geopolitical influence plays out on the world stage Kia Lopez the Yan Al jazer for counting the cost new alliances are part of the changing world countries with similar agendas and priorities have clustered into clubs among them the brics Nations let's take a closer look at the Block the leaders of Brazil Russia India and China founded the group in 2009 South Africa joined a year later bricks is designed to be a new global voice opposing what it sees as a unilateral approach to geopolitics bricks nations want to change the imbalance by creating an alternative to us-led financial institutions in 2015 they founded the new development Bank to counter organizations such as the World Bank and the international monetary fund they also aimed to reduce their Alliance on the US dollar bricks represent nearly a third of the global economy and nearly half of its population their total GDP in purchasing power parity terms is actually bigger than that of the GC 7 The Block is growing too the UAE Iran and Ethiopia and Egypt joined this year Saudi Arabia was invited to join its membership is pending but its addition will only amplify the bricks ambition to become the champion of the global South Arena uh to what extent are uh the brics Nations countries like India and Brazil who are trading their way to Prosperity right now um Reliant upon the Old World Order remaining intact or is it holding them back so what's interesting about these two countries is that Brazil and India are able to leverage their relationship with the old world order and they've also proven to be more flexible and adaptable powers in the International System so with bricks coming into play the success of bricks is really dependent on the strength of bilateral relationships as well as the the country as an individual power of course but as we've seen bricks host something like 200 meetings a year and so you have an accelerated growth in political and economic cooperation this constant meeting which is definitely contributing to their success Danny with with more Nations uh joining clubs clubbing together uh to to to make the most of their economic clout what's the future for the US dollar do you think will it remain the dominant currency the the future of the the world Reserve currency uh the US dollar in this case is going to depend on a whole range of factors but likely high on that list is sentiment and confidence and often that does not run parallel with or hand inand with you know facts on the ground who's got the greatest Coalition so that is definitely a space to watch but I would also be maybe a little bit averse to suggesting that the whole world wants to uh dive into an alternative World Order headed by uh you know the bricks Nations or whichever Other Nation 80% of the world lives in countries that are not a great power and for many of us outside of that Circle what we want to see are principles that go into thinking about how World Order can be constructed rather than simply who is where in that Coalition on this front I think that we should be not so uh anxious to so quickly uh ditch the Old World Order of globalization and capitalism there were Grand ideas there that arguably the most successful of the brics Nations China leveraged and leveraged successfully the grand ideas included uh the notion of how you wanted to organize things in an economically efficient way you needed to leverage comparative advantage and countries like China and smaller Nations uh leverage these ideas powerfully in the process lifting hundreds of millions of their citizens out of poverty I don't think that the world needs to so quickly rush into an alternative World Order until we've really thought through how we can save the current rules-based one I suspect that many of the brics Nations when they come down to think about it are not averse to actually holding on to this old world order but there are many who are who are trying to pull away from it Philip I'll come to you just a moment but Arena I see you're nodding there absolutely I mean the bricks definitely do not want to throw everything out the window but in terms of pushing for more especially in terms of trade you see this this big conflict between you know the inertia that the world finds self in and when you look at the WTO going with this moment you have moments of Promise uh especially and how countries want to work together for Progressive causes and how momentum sometimes for broader reform seems just to fizzle out but countries are still trying to understand how to understand Global Supply chains China's major has a major role in this and how it's going to be reconfigured and how the future of global Commerce is also going to settle especially in the context of environmental concerns and uh sporadic geopolitical changes and challenges and all while being faced with the failure for of development amongst you know the WTO discussions and the system is clearly not working for everyone especially because the system suffers from this trust deficit we've been talking about but this really drives home the desire for Global reform while trying to really hang on to institutions that mitigate existing formats and existing platforms phip who brings about this this Global reform then I mean how how will it be done do you see the future being dealt increasingly by by clubs like like bricks like-minded or geographically grouped Nations instead of instead of This Global rules-based Order I wanted to ask you about about the IMF with um alternative creditors like India and China available right now what does the IMF have a future I think it's important to make a distinction between a desire for a fairer Global Order which is what many of the interviewees at the start of this program Express and indeed um our other panelists have also expressed and whether that's likely to happen as a result of the breakdown of the existing order and I'm all in favor of a greater fairness I'm skeptical that the moves currently in play towards geopolitical conflict between and the US CH us and China and the breakdown of international institutions like the WTO is going to lead to that fairer World um you know the bricks remember started off as a Goldman Sachs marketing slogan it was then adopted by the leaders of those countries it's not clear to me that they have a hell of a lot in common um you know India and China are geopolitical Rivals um some are commodity exporters and some a commodity importers some as Arena said um uh have closer ties to the West as well as ties to China others are are clearly in an anti-western Camp economically the ties between them aren't that significant and in any case they're only um you know a small number of countries uh in a very large world so I'm skeptical of the bricks itself okay um in terms of Reform of the international institutions um we I think the WTO um is probably the was the most successful institution of um the old world order it was created on a wave of multilateral liberalization there was the huge success of bringing China in in 2001 and since then basically its ground to a standstill it's increasingly ignored by um the US and China who go their own way the dispute settlement mechanism uh which resolved international disputes is largely uh in abeyance and I think that's a tragedy I don't think that's leading to a fairer world I think that you know the WTO rules which were not perfect but which were applied largely impartially guaranteed uh equal voice uh to small players they guaranteed fairness for pretty much everybody okay and going to a world of might might makes right and small clubs isn't going to make things better Philip how a brief answer if you can please How likely is a full-blown economic War uh as you say that with the WTO being toothless right now How likely is a full-blown economic war between the US and or the west and China well there a possibility of a full-blow um hot War if uh uh developments in in Taiwan um uh degenerate uh I think that we are moving to a different world order it's a a second Cold War and I say a second Cold War because it's a world in which geopolitics uh Trump's uh economics and therefore while of course if you're Singapore uh you want uh a world based on open markets from which um Singapore has prospered and of course if you're in South Africa you want a fair economic system from which um uh you can benefit but if the large Powers increasingly say well actually our industrial policies our national security concerns come first you need as a smaller power to accommodate yourself um uh to those positions and and some will choose one Camp some will choose another and some will try to straddle both and hopefully not be forced to choose Danny are we in a a new Cold War are we in an era of nationalis isolationism de globalization ISM well I I hear that language a lot and obviously Philip has made a a very compelling case for this I I happen to disagree I think that we need to pull back from the language that says this is a cold war and maybe focus on the idea that really the the part of contention here is economic and that we conflate the issues when we talk about cold war or even indeed when we talk about security and during the the original Cold War Americans were genuinely worried that the Soviets were building a political and economic system that would undermine their American way of life destroy the American way of government now today however much one looks at The Bullying behavior of the Chinese aggressive exporting actions in the South China Sea military buildup I don't think anyone in their right Minds would accuse China of trying to build an economic system that is a plugin replacement for western style liberal democracy truth of truth be told I don't think Xi Jinping really cares at all what kind of political system the West wants to run what he wants to do is to bring about economic prosperity in a way that hes as much as he can to the original rules-based order and right now the Nations that are Mo most pulling away from that system are not the emerging countries are not the ones that felt previously challenged by the international economic system the the Washington consensus type of economic system but instead the rich countries and you know the language about it's being now a security competition unfortunately uh Rings a lot of early era not of competition with the Soviet Union for which the competition was not economic but of us competition with Japan a lot of the language about you know Japan's uh economic superiority threatening undermining US security uh is echoed today and the peculiar thing in all of that is that Japan in all of that time was firmly a liberal democracy Japan in all of that time was a strong partner of America in America's uh strategic Alliance in the Pacific so my own sense is that you know when we give in to talk about security talk about the Cold War we might be taking our eye off of the real competition okay which is an economic one which is that there are some countries in the world feeling that China is um undermining dismantling their industrial structure uh stealing their jobs engaging in um in a program that will lead to their uh taking control of Technologies of the future and in economics the right way to deal with that is not to okay shout wolf and then rattle a saber of security but to pick oneself up raise your own productivity train your people get to a point where you can compete I'm sorry to to to cut you off but but time is is against us I want to hear one last time from Arena um are you optimistic about the future uh Arena can the huge reductions in poverty brought about by globalization and imperfect though it was the the old world order continue without it I think it's always possible to be optimistic about the future um especially it it depends who's viewing this kind of future if we look at the core for alternative anything alternative Finance sources alternative payments systems there is a demand for an economy that presents or advocates for different values and if we were just to to look at at uh Chinese loans as an example or India's loans as an example um it's it's interesting to note that in the long run maybe they're not as cheap as as your IMF and World Bank but they're attractive because I mean especially with the Chinese lo they come with a grace period of 5 to seven years where countries can start repaying then uh politically this is where it's highly practical for a sitting government uh since repayment doesn't begin until the end of the term possibly and so here the desire to have something different to have an alternative um and leverage that in terms of who is fighting whom I think that is that is an interesting time we find ourselves in and it is more about the smaller Powers finding a way to leverage this moment for themselves to find their agency in that and there we must leave it we're out of time many thanks indeed Danny qua Arena Miran and Philip lron and that's our show for this week if you'd like to comment on anything you heard in our discussion I'm at a finigan on X use the hash AJC TC if you remember or you can drop us a line

And in the pocket in the pocket it goes safe and sound with daddy musk was clearly stung by the crack about electric vehicles so he immediately fired back live tweeting &quot;Without me Trump would have lost the election.&quot; and Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 5149 in the Senate yeah you think we've forgotten that buddy buddy have you been to a Tesla dealership lately cuz nobody else has now as soon as Trump was done meeting with Chancellor Brownfiger he he clapped back elon was wearing thin i asked him to leave i took away his EV mandate that forced everyone to buy electric cars that nobody else wanted that he knew for months I was going to do and he just went crazy i'm sorry went crazy elon has always lived the geographic center of insanitude he's not the mayor of crazy town he's the governor of off his Medania also also also I want to point out he says that nobody wanted electric vehicles when Trump himself sold them on the lawn of the White House this is knowing no one wanted them in fact in fact CNN pointed out that Trump himself bought a Tesla that day and it's still parked there at the White House so now Donald Trump is a Tesla owner who hates Elon Musk he's never been more relatable i can't believe it game sees game next Trump escalated the by threatening Musk the easiest way to save money in our budget billions and billions of dollars is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts i was always surprised Biden didn't do it to which to which Elon Musk replied &quot;Go ahead make my day.&quot; Oh you two have already made mine cutting Elon Musk's contracts with the government isn't just petty it's dangerous because as one user pointed out the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft transports astronauts to and from the International Space Station so Elon snarked &quot;In light of the president's statements about cancellation of my government contracts SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.&quot; Okay okay okay so to any astronauts currently in orbit don't get too attached to your current bone density then then I got to say I got to say Yeah you got to say it elon gave us a fun one time to drop the really big bomb donald Trump is in the Epstein files that's the real reason they have not been made public have a nice day DJT oh oh them oh oh oh oh i mean is is is this Twitter war a cheesy gordita crunch wrap supreme because it's dripping hot messy filth and I am eating up every sloppy bite bring it daddy like but by the way Elon a little late on that intel donald Trump was a sexual predator that prayed on young women which is something I've only decided to tell you because he hurt my feelings i am the hero of the story wow trump's going to have to get one of those bumper stickers for his Tesla that says &quot;I bought this before Elon told everyone I was on Epstein's plane.&quot;

          <attvalue for="7" value="the IDF's Gideon's Chariots military operation in Gaza is now expanding idf chief Aal Zamir was with the troops in Gaza and said more territory will be captured unless Hamas agrees to release the Israeli hostages tv's Steve Lieuits reports the army says that combined ground and air force operations struck over 100 terror targets in the past 24 hours gazin officials say 19 were killed among the kamas operatives that were killed was the aerial commander for northern Gaza moata Deeb was responsible for planning and directing attacks against Israeli aircraft as well as launching drones that targeted Israeli civilians the army confirmed that Deeb was killed this week in an air strike other targets hit include terror cells a terror compound an observation post and underground facilities used by Palestinian Islamic jihad the Givati Brigade has now joined the fighting beginning a ground operation in Bethlehey idf Chief Aal Zamir was in Gaza where he said that the army will capture more and more territory until Kamas agrees to a hostage and ceasefire deal zamir said that the IDF was aware that a ceasefire could come at any time zamir took aim at those who have made accusations against the IDF conduct of the war amid the fighting the IDF announced that Staff Sergeant Danilo Moano was killed in South Gaza the 20-year-old from Cologne was killed in a building collapse after an explosive device was detonated thank you Steve for that report and Israel says around 93 trucks filled with humanitarian aid including baby food and supplies was brought into the Gaza Strip on Tuesday a significant boost from the five trucks that entered on Monday here's what else you need to know more aid continues to flow into Gaza although the United Nations is saying the aid has not yet been distributed after an 11-week blockade of humanitarian aid into Gaza with Israeli officials saying the aid helped Hamas the resumption of aid was made for diplomatic reasons five trucks entered the Gaza Strip on Monday and 93 trucks entered on Tuesday all which entered through the Karum Shalom crossing an official from the UN said the next step is to collect and distribute the aid through the existing system which uses several international organizations for distribution meanwhile the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation mechanism is set to open later this month for months testimony from Gazins has revealed Hamas steals aid and resells it at an extremely high value making it almost impossible to buy former Israeli officials tell ILV they worry there's no mechanism in place to prevent Hamas from stealing aid again the UN said on Tuesday they have not been able to secure the arrival of supplies into their warehouses and delivery points in Gaza the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Aid spokesperson said insufficient supplies is at a greater risk of being looted but does not mention Kamas's past involvement in stealing aid although the spokesperson did tell reporters looted products end up being sold at exorbitant prices on the black market and the US and Israel are reportedly facing differences in policy relating to both the Gaza war and a potential Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities iltv's Devo Klein has the latest cnn is reporting US officials saying that Israel is preparing for a possible strike on Iranian nuclear facilities on its own even as the Trump administration has been pursuing a diplomatic deal with Thran the official told CNN that such a strike would be a brazen break with Trump and could risk tipping off a broader regional conflict in the Middle East cnn said that new intelligence obtained by US suggests Israel is preparing to strike Iranian nuclear facilities it was not clear whether Israeli leaders had made a final decision and there was disagreement inside the Trump administration about whether Israel would ultimately decide to carry out the attack turning to Gaza where according to Axios US President Donald Trump is feeling quote frustrated by the ongoing war in Gaza and feels that ending the conflict is needed in order to bring prosperity to the Middle East a Trump administration official told Axios that the US pressured Israel to open the crossing for humanitarian aid after assistance had been blocked since early March and was reportedly upset by images of suffering children and babies axios reported an Israeli official responding that Prime Minister Netanyahu does not feel pressured on the matter by Trump the official went on to say that if the president wants a hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza he needs to put more pressure on Hamas thank you Devo for that report and as Netanyahu presses forward with an increased ground offensive inside of the Gaza Strip reports suggest Trump is frustrated with the war and wants Israel to wrap it up joining us now to discuss is former Israeli ambassador Yuram Edinger who served as congressional affairs liaison in the Israeli embassy in Washington and is a leading expert on USIsrael relations and the Middle East thanks so much for joining us today thank you it's my privilege so it seems as if the tone did a 180 degree flip after Trump visited these Arab countries last week when it comes to the war in Gaza what is making Trump so frustrated right now well I I suggest not to assess President Trump's position based on his talk uh it's much more important to judge his position in accordance with his walk and the walk has been very very positive on USIsrael relations while Biden withheld essential military systems and ammunition from Israel um President Trump uh provided has provided uh this items uh President Trump also uh did not react negatively uh when Israel uh took care of 11 of Kamas top leaders while he Trump was in the midst of his visit to the Persian Gulf supposedly it could have embarrassed him supposedly it could have undermined his visit but I have no doubt that Trump inside his hotel suite probably told his staffers finally Israel acting just like Trump would uh would do uh at the same time we cannot ignore we cannot ignore uh the worldview of President Trump uh which is not exactly compatible with the Middle East as he assumes that Middle East conflicts such as the conflict with the Houthis and with the Ayatollas and with Hamas uh are very similar to businesslike negotiation and while money talks uh in the west when it comes to business negotiations it's ideology that walks when it comes to the Middle East and negotiation that President Trump is eager to to conduct with the Ayatollas are perceived by him to be a step towards reconciliation but that Ayatollas view it as a step uh which is designed to bolster their capabilities and get ready for another assault on the so-called infidel west the great American Satan and the infidel Jew and last and not least we have seen President Trump being very much impressed with the Syrian leader with the Qatari uh leader and and again we should be very careful uh not to assume that you can approach the Middle East through Western lances the west welcomed uh Humeni back in 1978779 supposedly as a leader who wants human rights for the Iranian uh people uh a leader who is anti-communist and therefore would be very pro- US and we know that uh that leader became the number one epicenter of anti-American war terrorism uh the US also welcomed Bashar Assad in 2000 in a very positive way because Bashar Assad spent few years in Britain he's opthalmologist he was president of the in Syrian internet society married to a very modern Syrian lady educated in the US spoke few foreign languages and we know that he became a butcher a real butcher now Trump may be right about El Golani from Syria but I would suggest that before rushing into suspending economic sanctions and declaring El Golani a potentially peaceful leader I would expect American president to require the president of Syria to uh uproot all hate education in Syria before he uh gets those privileges from the US to uproot hate sermons from the mass to uproot hate uh media from the official uh media and introduced a United Arab Emirat like peaceful conduct once the Syrian does that obviously he deserves to be uh accorded a real generous uh treatment but not before that we have run out of time but thank you so much for your perspective today thank you and now President Donald Trump revealed plans for what he's calling the Golden Dome which he says is a cuttingedge missile defense shield that would protect the United States from foreign attacks similar to the Iron Dome in Israel the selected design comes with a hefty price tag ilv's Devoc Klein has the details at a press conference inside the Oval Office surrounded by space and defense officials President Donald Trump announced he selected a design for the Golden Dome missile defense shield system which he says would protect the United States from foreign attacks once fully constructed the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space and we will have the best system ever built as you know we helped Israel with theirs and it was very successful and now we have technology that's even far advanced from that trump said the system would cost a total of $175 billion and said it will be completed and fully operational by the end of his term calling it a state-of-the-art system trump says it will be utilized across land sea and space and will integrate with existing defense capabilities he says the Golden Dome aims to create a network of satellites to detect track and potentially intercept incoming missiles uh ultimately this right here the Golden Dome for America is game changer it's a generational investment in the security of America and Americans in a blow to bilateral relations with the leading ally the UK has announced a freeze on a trade deal in protest over the growing Israeli offensive in Gaza the government also placed sanctions on Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria itv's Steve Lee Woods has the latest we must coordinate our response because this war has gone on for far too long we cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve and the foreign secretary will come to the house shortly to set out our response in detail after the British prime minister's announcement British foreign secretary David Lammy announced the pause in trade talk the Israeli foreign ministry responded to the announcement of the trade freeze saying this even prior to today's announcement the free trade agreement negotiations were not being advanced at all by the current UK government the agreement would serve the mutual benefit of both countries if due to anti-Israel obsession and domestic political considerations the British government is willing to harm the British economy that is its own prerogative additionally the UK placed sanctions on a number of Israeli individuals and groups in Judea and Samaria who it said had supported incited and promoted violence against Palestinians in the territories the foreign ministry responded saying the sanctions against the settlers in Judea and Samaria are puzzling unjustified and especially regrettable after the recent deadly terror attack the British mandate ended exactly 77 years ago external pressures will not divert Israel from its path in its struggle for its existence and security against enemies working to destroy it israel bonds the heartbeat of solidarity the powerhouse of support when the Israeli Hamas war hit Israel bonds stood tall proving we're more than just an investment we're a lifeline israel bonds pledges to ensure Israel thrives and flourishes investing in Israel bonds isn't just a financial move it's a declaration for resilience strength and a better future for Israel join us and let solidarity echo through generations and the family of hostage Matans and Calker said they received a troubling sign of life from their son after they learned he was held with American former hostage Don Alexander while in captivity according to Israeli media reports new information suggest Zenalkker is struggling to stand on his own and is suffering from severe stomach pain and intestinal problems they described his condition as barely being able to stand mute and starving zincalker suffers from muscular distrophe and experiences muscle tremors and weakness so severe he cannot stand and testimony describes him as refusing to eat or speak and isolating himself as his mental health continues to decline reports say he is believed to be held by senior Hamas terrorists and is and is experiencing a lack of oxygen flea and rat bites and is eating moldy bread and contaminated water his mother told one Israeli outlet the IDF discovered a handwritten note from Zancauer in an underground Hamas compound the note included his full name in Hebrew and English his ID number and text in Arabic his mother confirmed it was his handwriting and speaking of tunnels as reports continue to detail the horrific suffering of Israeli hostages in them an Alazer reporter tooured an underground tunnel with Hamas terrorists in a video released on Tuesday al Jazer reporter Mustafa Sethan was led through a narrow tunnel by Hamas terrorist armed and with their faces covered in the video the reporter was guided with a blindfold on by armed terrorists into the narrow tunnel and is heard saying it was it was difficult for him to breathe they arrive into a small room where you can see the reporter barely being able to stand up completely in the tunnel he interviewed the armed terrorist who told him the tunnels are for quote temporary stay until Israel attacks them however one terrorist did say if Israel expands the fighting they quote will be found throughout the entire Gaza Strip now the terrorists say they had no shortage of weapons and that they're quote preparing ambushes to kill Jews and expel them from our land end quote that was all heard on Alazer and a unique educational movement is taking root in Israel's north and south where fields stretch wide and communities grow resilient the Adamava Adama schools translated as man and woman uh man and land are redefining what it means to uh learning by doing supported by Jewish National Fund USA these schools are cultivating more than just crops they're growing a new generation of young leaders grounded in Zionism sustainability and a deep connection to the land today we are joined by two students um Adho and Shahar Stalber to take you inside the classrooms and green houses where Israel's future is being shaped by one student at a time thank you guys so much for joining us thank you for being here i have seen one of your amazing uh campuses before tell me why you decided to join this program um I can tell about myself that I grew up my grandparents they met in the agricultural school Mikv is they've been together for almost 50 years now and I've always grown about their stories i've always learned about I have always seen their excitement when they're talking about their experiences from waking up in 5:00 a.m to go to work and agriculture or um being in a room with 10 other people always the the light in their eyes when they're speaking about those experiences is always something that brought me so much joy and I always knew that I will go somewhere that is similar like that and I started looking in in 10th grade I started looking for agricultural schools for something that will expand my eyes expand my seeing of the Israeli culture and I came for Danma amazing now you told me you're from Ramatan which is nothing like where the school is located which is in Arava literally right next to Jordan what do you enjoy so much about this program i love I usually I do nothing at home i used to go to school where you work you you don't work you learn from 8:00 a.m to 3:00 a.m to 3:00 p.m and you don't do nothing at all here in this school we wake up at 5:00 a.m we go to work we work in the fields with the farmers and after this we finished something like 11 11 and a half a.m and in 100 p.m we start learning we're doing the whole we're studying till 6:00 a.m and after it we uh have study groups we have dinner and study groups and there I remember both of you told me before we went on set you can't believe how much day you typically wasted before going to this program now you're farming in the mornings tell me uh briefly just one life lesson that you learned from this program and how it might have shaped um how you envision your life in Israel uh like I said you said earlier I'm from Ramadan which is a city and I've never even thought of going to a gap year before the army and doing something meaningful for the country for our people not only like joining the army straight after school doing something that makes the next to the people i never even thought of going to a gap year so now now in this school I thinking of it and I want to do it in my school again i want to be here till like five years not four years of of learning of high school oh it's amazing to see uh how much you you have learned and grown um tell us just how old you guys are um I'm 16 i'm in 11th grade i'm 15 15 15 and uh 10th grade wow and and for anyone out there who's interested just give me a brief sentence of what you would tell them about this program um like what you what your biggest takeaway so far h how much connection we how much the land especially in Israel means for our culture how much without the without the farmers how much without the community that it brings to us i remember David Benuan said where the that agriculture should be a part of the school system it teaches us so much about our life our work ethics it brings so much peace and connects us to nature so much more i think agriculture has so many different aspects big bring so much positivity into our lives and I think I know about myself that it really changed my my aspects a lot of aspects of my in my life we do important things we help the farmers that's something that goes and it last it won't last long if we won't help them and we're doing it and we're happy for it and we chose it thank you both for sharing that thank you and now the documents and personal items of legendary Israeli MSAD spy Ellie Cohen were re were recovered and returned exactly 60 years after his public hanging in Damascus Square israel announced its recovery of the 2500 documents photographs and personal possessions relating to Cohen on Sunday saying its spy agency MSAD had worked with an unnamed foreign intelligence

          <attvalue for="7" value="donald Trump brands Vladimir Putin absolutely crazy after Russia launched its largest aerial attack on Ukraine the Kremlin is downplaying Trump's remarks describing them as emotional overload but is the US president emboldening Putin or will Trump's fiery words be put into action with sanctions this is Inside Story [Music] hello welcome to the program i'm Adrien Finnegan this week Russia launched its largest drone and missile attack on Ukraine since the war began 3 years ago but among the missiles came a war of words us President Donald Trump lashed out at Russian President Vladimir Putin on social media and he criticized Vladimir Zalinsk's public rhetoric after the Ukrainian president condemned what he called the silence of America not even former US President Joe Biden was spared trump stated this is Zalinsk's Putin's and Biden's war not Trump's so was that a warning that the US may be ready to walk away from talks on a ceasefire and is a decision by Ukraine's allies to scrap range restrictions on arms sent to Kev a dangerous move we'll put those questions to our guests in just a moment but first this report from Hamza Muhammad president Donald Trump taking aim at his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in a post on social media Trump called Putin absolutely crazy after Moscow launched a wave of aerial attacks across Ukraine killing at least a dozen people i'm not happy with what Putin's doing he's killing a lot of people and I don't know what the hell happened to Putin i've known him a long time always gotten along with him but he's sending rockets into cities and killing people and I don't like it at all okay we're in the middle of talking and he's shooting rockets into Kiev and other cities i don't like it at all russia said the attacks were directed at military targets and were a response to Ukrainian assaults on Russian civilian targets moscow said the American president was getting over emotional this is a very crucial moment which is associated with the emotional overload of everyone and with emotional reactions it's a rare public condemnation from Trump who has long maintained close ties with Putin the two leaders even spoke for two hours last week discussing a possible ceasefire in Ukraine both have praised their personal relationship despite Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Washington's role as K's top military supporter you see the hatred he's got for Putin trump also lashed out at Ukrainian President Vladimir Zalinski accusing him of worsening the conflict with his public statements in Berlin the latest Russian strikes have led to a major policy shift germany says it will no longer restrict how far Ukrainian forces can fire Germanmade weapons clearing the way for K to target sites deep inside Russia there are no longer any range restrictions on weapons delivered to Ukraine neither from the British nor from the French nor from us nor from the Americans this means that Ukraine can now also defend itself defend itself by for example attacking military positions in Russia as the rhetoric escalates and the weapons gain longer reach the stakes in Ukraine are rising fast raising fears the hostilities between Russia and the West could intensify hamza Muhammad Al Jazzer for inside story all right let's bring in our guests for today's discussion and joining us from Geneva is Mark Stella former US ambassador who served as deputy assistant secretary of state in the first Trump administration in Perth Australia is Alexi Moravv an associate professor of national security and strategic studies at Curtain University and from Berlin we're joined by Aaron Gash Bonet a senior fellow at the Democratic Strategy Initi in Initiative a political think tank gentlemen a welcome warm welcome to you all um Mark let's start with you what was President Trump doing using such undiplomatic language as what the hell happened to Putin and and and saying in in in such a a public social media forum that Vladimir Putin is crazy adrien it's remarkable and it's Trump classic um Donald Trump approaches these relationships in a way that is similar to what's happened in the past trying to get a reset with Russia trying to reestablish a relationship with Russia but his spin is really different this is not the reset of the Obama administration it's very personal he's trying to base it on his personal relationship with Vladimir Putin and that's risky business frankly Vladimir Putin does not approach these issues u based on personal and emotional considerations he is a trained KGB agent he looks at these things very coldly and he looks at relationships as things to be manipulated so I think we we see that Donald Trump for instance with Kim Jong-un tried to establish some kind of uh love letter relationship extraordinary thing to do and frankly it backfired because most other countries are uh pursuing their interests based on their interests not based on relationships that's where I think Donald Trump got himself into trouble now and he's scrambling to get out so so Mark how will Trump feel about the Kremlin calling him emotional i mean what what even does emotional overload mean well I think it it's really telling pescov's words show that the Russians are not approaching these issues from an emotional perspective and they don't know why Trump is doing so but I I think what we should see here is that um Vladimir Putin is trying to push the issue on the battlefield he really doesn't want to be forced into a ceasefire and that has been Trump's objective all along to get to a ceasefire so now I think Putin is thinking how far can we push this he's actually testing the waters so I think Trump is being tested right now and we'll really learn a lot when we see how he finally reacts will he indeed impose sanctions as your reporter asked that's the most fundamental question alexi what what was the Kremlin doing when it said that that President Trump was was suffering emotional overload was that was that an insult well I'm not sure that it was designed to be an insult i think it was intended to leave some breathing space for Trump to effectively calm down and perhaps issue a different statement because Trump has the history of saying something emotional and the following day or a couple of days later he would come back with a with a with a slightly different interpretation of the events sometimes completely um in in in the other at the other end of of of the spectrum i I certainly do agree with with with Mark that um uh Trump approaches this uh from from a very personal chemistry perspective putin does the same but does the same in a very measured way so the way visav his personal might certainly in in in Russia trust and and personal chemistry is really important i think same applies for with regards to his relations with China's Zizin pin with Trump it's slightly different i think there is definitely a degree of personal um connection between Putin and and and Trump and certainly the Russians value that connection but the Russians also make it very clear and and and make it quite public they understand that Trump will not be there forever and and they and yes they calculate they'll calculate long term and they trying to project what is going to be the approach of the United States beyond uh the second term of of Donald Trump in in in the office and that's what really drives their thinking and that what also drives I think Putin thinking towards uh towards Trump and the way how he deals he does business with him aaron the two leaders had a two-hour phone call last week which which Trump said he thought had gone very well and then he said that Russia and Ukraine would will immediately start negotiations towards a ceasefire and an end to the war we we know how that went is Trump losing patience do you think with Putin i think it's very hard to say actually i think that uh that certainly might be the case so I think that Trump is finding out really quickly just how Putin tends to behave with uh everybody he makes all kinds of uh promises all kinds of rhetoric which Trump has a history of taking at face value possibly really due to that personal uh relationship um that uh has been highlighted before um but Putin's objective in Ukraine is very clear it has been clear this whole time he is looking to uh occupy all of Ukraine he doesn't believe that Ukraine has the right to exist as an independent sovereign state um I think perhaps that uh Trump has been assuming uh that Putin has a different sort of objective than he actually has but Putin's objection objective has always been clear um and Trump may actually be uh perhaps starting to see some evidence of that which may explain some of his uh reactions here uh in that he's discovering slowly that Putin's objectives are not necessarily the same as his own mark give us some insight um from your perspective as a as a former diplomat what's really going on do you think behind the scenes right now in private could Trump be saying one thing uh in public meant for public consumption and a and a completely different thing in in private discussions uh that absolutely could be the case he also has people negotiating on his behalf and we're not seeing very much of what those folks are doing uh so it's very hard to say on the other hand one of the amazing things about Donald Trump is that he'll say almost anything right out loud so it may be that what he has said is exactly what he was thinking at the time uh and that's I think startling for a diplomat um I I teach diplomacy and we always train our students to be very controlled in what they do in a negotiation to plan extensively and never to do things unintentionally if you're going to be angry be angry because you intend to be angry if you're going to offend do it only because you intend to offend uh I'm not sure you can say that Donald Trump is falling those kinds of approaches alexi is President Putin playing a dangerous game how long can he continue to openly defy President Trump to agree one thing or at least to appear to agree to one thing in a phone call with him and then go on to do something very different or to delay or proaricate yeah i I think we look I think I think we need to to to establish definitions here on what exactly we understand Putin is trying to achieve and we need to separate the Ukraine issue from the broader issue concerning Russia US strategic relations visav Ukraine it may seem like Putin playing a dangerous game and I fully agree that Putin has no interest in slowing down the military advance because uh his forces are on the move despite Ukraine's desperate attempts to hold on Russian offensive Russia retains strategic initiative and despite despite intensive bombardment of Ukrainian cities we don't really see Ukrainians plugging um uh recruitment offices and and and and trying to enlist to to defend the country so there is definitely crisis of morale in in in Ukraine and the Russians understand it so the Russians are buying themselves time um with a view to see the Ukrainian will to resist eventually cracking but coming back to Putin's agenda I think Putin doesn't just understand that particular element concerning battle battle space situation he also understands that certainly with Donald Trump there is a space for the Russians and the UK and and the Americans to discuss and and the subsequent need for them to discuss much broader set of things ranging from issues concerning strategic stability to other hotspots like the Middle East Iran uh North Korean nuclear program the Arctic cyber space uh and and and the list goes on and and and I think Putin somehow understands or at least assumes that he thinks or or have confidence that the Americans will not give up on trying to rebuild this strategic dialogue between the two nuclear superpowers because of the whole array of other matters they need to discuss and that also gives him additional confidence of playing the hard ball and the final point is Putin knows because Trump made it very clear that um um if if if if Washington will press Moscow too hard it would only drive the Russians further into uh developing strategic approachment with China and this is what Trump is trying to avoid by all means necessary at least at this point in time aaron before I throw it back to you I just want to get Mark's Mark's thoughts on on that Mark so I absolutely agree with what Alexi is saying it's vitally important for us to look at this in the context of the whole array of relations between the two countries um I I also think that in trying to assess how Trump is going to respond and how Vladimir Putin is assessing this uh it's interesting to look at the lessons he got from his mentor Roy Conn roy Conn said &quot;Always attack never admit defeat and always claim victory.&quot; It is possible that Trump seeing that he has not been able to get this war done on the first day he's not been able to get a ceasefire he's not been able to get Putin to stop bombing the cities he is going to rather than lash out retreat a bit and actually claim victory in some way and blame others yeah and blame who president Zalinski uh European leaders Aaron um basically anyone who uh can be blamed we're already seeing uh evidence of that with Trump's comments about uh you know complaints about Zilinsk's comments in particular um but yeah I would not be surprised to uh eventually see rhetoric against Europe in particular or European leaders ratcheted up uh quite a bit um especially because Europe um has made it clear that this is uh a core security interest uh of theirs um they are of course waiting to see what Trump will do uh and you know waiting for American leadership that is a common European reflex of course but at the end of the day European leaders do have a responsibility uh to their own continent security in a way um that uh you know Trump uh may believe that he doesn't and he believes that he can simply uh you know retreat um in many cases from Europe and European leaders ultimately don't have that option and if we start to see uh parting of the ways between Trump and European leaders on the existential nature that Ukraine has for European security uh then I would not be surprised to see exactly that at all a blame game begin to start being played alexi is there any concern in Moscow at all uh that that the US may impose further sanctions against uh Russia would further sanctions force any change at all in President Putin's uh behavior and attitude well the short answer is no i mean the Russians have been collecting successfully a whole array of sections some 29,000 to believe some sources since 2014 so uh I I don't think another layer of sanctions would actually be a gamecher in terms of changing their strategic behavior and the Russians trying to put on a brave face saying that look I mean we live through that we've done that we adjusted our our circumstances and and and and we go by by uh um doing business the way we want what obviously is not is not being shown certainly in in in Russia is probably the internal conversations that Putin is having with um key uh tycoons with key uh business people some some recordings suggest that these negotiations do take place and there are obviously people with vested interest in Russia to see uh not not the imposition of additional sanctions but the lifting some of the sanctions and perhaps that's also part of the conversation that is taking place uh right now but if if if anything I think um um the west kind of reached the point when it really needs to start understanding that sanctions are not delivering the the blow effect that everyone expected them to do back in 2022 or or 2023 and I think the Russians understand that plus their level of capacity to absorb damage not only in in in human terms but also in terms of uh revenue loss or something like that is is much higher in terms of resilience and in terms of relative immunity compared to the one uh that one would expect from from say western country finding itself in similar circumstances okay Mark um how truthful is President Trump being when he says echoing uh Vice President uh Vance that we're more than open to to walking away it's Zinski Putin and Biden's war not not Trump's uh he says in in that order we I find that that quite interesting to what extent is is Trump caught between a rock and a hard place right now in that he can't fully turn on Putin and blame him for the war can he because that would be politically unpalatable uh Adrian I think you're really putting your finger on the dilemma that Trump is now finding himself in um he would like to blame others but he can't blame just Putin alone then he'll look weak for not taking some kind of action he has to factor in uh the China question how much more can he push Russia into Xiinping's hands and I think you can't forget that but the problem with this is that frankly this issue is one that doesn't go away to uh to paraphrase Muhammad Ali you can run but you can't hide um so he may try to blame others he may try to say the United States is going to wash his hands of this but actually the United States can't it's too important an issue it bears on the security of our allies and ultimately it bears on our own security as well i I would also say that if if Putin is able to uh do the kinds of things he wants to with Ukraine it's going to embolden China and we know that Trump has a real fixation with China as well and it could embolden them in terms of how they would treat Taiwan or aggressive moves in the South China Sea where we have allies the Philippines Thailand others um so Trump has to start seeing all these connections and that's not going to make it easy for him to just walk away aaron was was President Zalinski right to call out what he described as the the silence of America following Russia's largest uh air bombardment since the war began or or or should he have remained diplomatically silent after all President Trump had had already condemned Russia's in in attacks he was he was essentially pointing out the truth wasn't he that that Putin talks peace but wages war what's wrong with that i mean I don't see any issue with what Zalinsky said in terms of the actual truth as you say he is absolutely uh right and I think that Zalinski uh was making these statements really to uh just put the spotlight on Russian hypocrisy this kind of Russian hypocrisy is something that's very normal something we've seen many times um during the state of this war where uh it talks a certain amount of rhetoric in terms of ceasefire or peace it makes promises on certain things uh and then it does what it wants anyway and it attacks um Ukraine uh anyway we've seen this um many times over the course of this particular war and I think that um Zalinski was likely making these comments uh to really uh point uh this out and to also make it clear that this particular time wasn't like all of the other times that this has happened um it was uh as uh was said at the beginning of this program uh the worst um attack that we have seen against Kev really since the war began it was of an entirely different magnitude than what unfortunately has become business as usual for how uh Russia keeps attacking Ukraine over the course of this particular war and Alexi just just briefly how will the scrapping of range limits on arms by Germany and other allies uh arms sent to to Kev change Ukraine's ability to defend itself it may provide some tactical advantage i don't think it will have any significant impact on on the strategic circumstances of the battle space um and if if if these longer range weapons are to be operationalized in in in Ukraine or over over Russia it would just be a matter of time before the Russians will find a counter cure and would eventually minimize the collateral effect of of the deployment of longer range systems that's what they demonstrated by countering the himers the uh other other systems that the west was gradually building uh um uh with with Ukrainian um um order order of battle so we once again we need to understand we're dealing with one of the world's largest and sophisticated military machines an expectation that yet another attempt to find a wonder a wonder weapon would change the course of war well perhaps that's something that could have been done in the early stages of the war but not right now okay um I'll come back to you in just a moment yeah yeah go on Aaron yeah if I may add here um this is something the scrapping of these limits is something that Ukraine has been requesting for a long time the fact that this has finally happened i mean it's it's years too late already so um you know as Alex Lexi has been pointing out uh the Russians have had plenty of time to anticipate the possibility of this to adapt to this uh this sort of thing we're seeing another um example here of the West's approach being too peacemeal too incrementalist too gradual to really be able to hand Ukraine the necessary strategic advantage um to be able uh to actually push uh for victory so I mean it's a it's just another example of this massively reactive approach that the west has been having uh the entire war that goes for weapons and that also goes as well for uh sanctions that we've been mentioning earlier the question really here for the west is uh are we lifting these limits are we threatening these sanctions because we want to constrain Russia's ability to wage war or are we doing this because we actually want to try to force Putin to the negotiating table if their goal really is to get Putin to the negotiating table the measures that the West needs to take need to be a lot stronger than what we're seeing both on weapons and on sanctions yeah yeah yeah can you just very briefly elaborate on what you mean by stronger though well I think that we are for example if we look at weapons scrapping the uh range limits um we I mean that's that's been treated certainly as a big announcement uh in Germany where I'm based but we have not seen yet uh the promise to deliver for example Taurus longrange uh missiles which has been a subject of public debate uh for a while here in Germany i mean that in and of itself would not I believe be um a gamecher this sort of delivery the vundovafa as been said uh the other uh real gamecher would be the west actually announcing that it was going to confiscate 300 billion of Russia's central bank reserves that have been frozen in the west since the beginning of this war just for context it's about 450 billion or so dollars that every country in the world has provided to Ukraine in assistance uh since the war started so 300 billion would be a big game changer and saying that you're going to confiscate that would be uh that kind of big or announcement or an example of one of the kinds of things that we would need to see um for Putin to really get the message yeah okay the West is serious here until we see these kinds of things Putin is going to have those questions about how serious the West is and I'm I'm sorry to cut you off but we're rapidly running out of time uh uh Mark in his truth social post Trump said of Putin I've always said that Putin wants all of Ukraine not just a piece of it and maybe that's proving to be right now President Emanuel Mcron says that Trump is finally realizing that Putin has lied to him do you do you think that that that post on Truth Social is an indication of that is Is Trump finally realizing that perhaps he's been taken for a ride in a word yes i think that in a way it sounds pathetic it's almost plaintive the way he's talking about Vladimir Putin i don't think that Putin's objectives are different from what he said they are and that is to eliminate Ukraine as an independent country and he's going to pursue that uh I'd like to follow up what Aaron said and say that the West and uh Ukraine can do more and under the right circumstances I think there can be sufficient pressure on Russia so that it could come around but it's going to require concerted action and we should recognize right away that if that happens if there's a ceasefire it will be tactical on Putin's part he'll be playing the long game russians are chess grand masters they are playing seven 8 nine 10 moves ahead and uh they will wait out Donald Trump or they will wait out the circumstances and hope that they can get a better situation for them to advance on their grand objectives later there gentlemen we're going to have to leave it many thanks indeed for being with us

          <attvalue for="7" value="On 1,100 acres in the middle of the Arizona desert. Only one set of buildings rises above the horizon as far as the eye can see. We started construction well before the CHIPS Act came along, and that's in April of '21. This recently completed 3. 5-million-square-foot building is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's first Arizona chip fabrication plant– or fab- making history not only for its enormous size- but because it's by far the most advanced chip fab on U.S. soil. So pilot production has started in this building when we are here. Three years ago, it was steel beams and dirt. What kind of investment has it taken to get to this point? About $20 billion. When we first visited, TSMC was far from a household name. But the chip shortage and AI boom has thrust it into the spotlight. TSMC manufactures some 92% of the world's most advanced chips, in everything from Nvidia GPUs to Apple iPhones. And now, for the first time in history, TSMC is starting to make those advanced chips here in the U.S. customers like Apple are starting to make their chips here, with two more fabs planned by the end of the decade. The facility over here is our fab 2. You can see the steel has been completed. But bringing advanced chip manufacturing to the U.S. has proven difficult. Volume production, is supposed to begin this year, is delayed until 2025. The Commerce Department recently hit TSMC with new shipping bans after its chips ended up in Huawei devices, despite export controls. And incoming President Donald Trump stirred up fears when he expressed opposition to the CHIPS Act during his campaign. TSMC is getting $6.6 billion from the bill. The CHIPS Act was bipartisan and it had huge Republican support when it passed. Right now, we buy every single AI chip from one company in Taiwan. That makes America less safe, and so repealing the CHIPS Act would make Americans less safe, I just don't think they'll do that. CNBC visited northern Phoenix for an exclusive first look at TSMC's first completed fab – and asked its top executives exactly what's in store for U.S. manufacturing - under an incoming Trump administration, and ever-mounting need for advanced chips. Inside the huge new fab just completed in Arizona, there's enough concrete to make ten Empire State Buildings; over 15-million-feet of cable and wire that could stretch from New York City to Los Angeles; and steel that weighs as much as 970 Boeing Triple Sevens. Now, pilot production is officially underway. Running actual product through to make sure that the entire line works end to end. And then you use those wafers to sample the customer so that they can decide if we've met their standards. Now chairman of TSMC Arizona, Rick Cassidy has been with the company 27 years. And how close are we to full production in this building? Very close, very close. But according to TSMC's initial timeline, full production should already be happening. Getting the right talent and of course, doing so during a pandemic when there were shortages, you couldn't build a house, let alone build a chip foundry. It gives you some idea for like what is required to build like massive scale in this industry. Like, it's not a game for sissies. Like it's hard and it's expensive. When we came to the U.S., we knew we were going to go through a learning process. And I want to tell you, no surprise, we had a lot of learning that we went, whether it was permitting, learning how to work with the trades, learning how to work with the unions, local labor laws, lots of learnings that went on. Now we've overcome those. But maybe the biggest challenge that we had was MEP– mechanical, electrical and plumbing. The fab is filled with billions of dollars of machinery operating at the very edge of what scientifically possible – like these bus-sized EUV machines made by a single company, ASML - the only machines in the world able to perform the extreme ultraviolet lithography necessary for etching minuscule designs on the most advanced chips. So these are quarter-billion dollar tools. In order to hook one up requires something over 2,000 electrical connections, over two kilometers of cabling, 100,000 parts, 40,000 bolts. We're talking about massive. So learning how to overcome that challenge was something that was good for TSMC. Good for the trades, good for Phoenix, good for the U.S. And yes, we're dang near back on the original schedule. So far, TSMC has 2,000 people working around the clock to run the operation. Cassidy showed us the &quot;gowning&quot; building, where workers suit up in ultra-sterile &quot;bunny suits&quot; before crossing a skybridge into the new fab. Dust particles are the bane of wafer fabrication. If it lands on a wafer, it'll kill a die. And what kind of yield are you anticipating to get out of fab 1? You know, yields vary, but we intend to be right on par with our Taiwan compatriots. The yield - what percentage of chips coming out of the fab are usable – depends on that sterile environment and precision of the machines. But even with great yields, the biggest volume of chips will still come out of Taiwan for years to come. So the U.S. is far from self-reliant. It's difficult or impossible for the U.S. or any country to be fully self-sufficient in everything that they need to build semiconductors. I think that's a pipe dream. And although the first fab was originally slated to make 5-nanometer – it's now on track to pump out even more advanced 4-nanometer chips at a rate of at least 20,000 wafers per month. Wafers that cost upwards of $18,000 and continue to rise in price, taking TSMC's stock value with it. Over the past couple of years. We've seen TSMC been able to kind of name its price, and everyone's going to pay it because right now it's the dependability and the quality that is needed. Despite being the birthplace of microchips in the 1950s – and remaining a top chip design hub - the U.S. now manufactures only 10% of the world's chips – and none of the most advanced ones. When supply chain chaos collided with booming demand for consumer electronics during the pandemic, the resulting chip shortage exposed the big risks of relying on outsiders for such critical technology. How important is it for supply to come from elsewhere than just Taiwan? I think the pandemic is probably a good example that highlighted supply chain diversification requirements, and customers want us in the U.S., they want us in Japan, they want us in Europe. Talks with TSMC about bringing advanced production to the U.S. actually began in 2018, under President Trump's first term, and his then commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross. Well, it began with select USA, which is an annual event that the Commerce Department puts on to encourage U.S. investment by foreign companies. TSMC came to that session. TSMC has actually been manufacturing in the U.S. since 1998, at an older generation chip fab in Washington state, where Cassidy says TSMC is currently investing to upgrade and expand. But Ross says some major customers wanted advanced chips made on U.S. soil. I set up a phone call between the chairman of TSMC and the head of Apple, where Apple would became very strongly supportive of the idea of TSMC coming. By 2020, TSMC announced its Arizona plans, then broke ground there in April 2021. And now you've got, you know, atrium and building, and you'll be seeing all of the fab in the back. 26-year company veteran Rose Castanares is the newly appointed president of TSMC Arizona. It was one of my customers that had first requested that TSMC build a fab in the United States. They wanted supply resilience. The world's massive reliance on TSMC's fabs in Taiwan has made the global chip supply vulnerable to risks of the region. We can't be sure that we can make enough chips here in the U.S. in the event of, say, some sort of aggression between China and Taiwan, some sort of even earthquakes and events that take down that particular island for a period of time, the entire market, the entire world, could suffer from lack of availability of leading edge nodes. A deadly 7.4 magnitude earthquake in April briefly halted production and led to a $92 million loss for TSMC. We're used to earthquakes. We are well prepared for earthquakes. We build for earthquakes. We've overbuilt this structure because we use the same designs as in Taiwan. Relying on chips from Asia has also kept the U.S. from full control over its position in the constant race for technological dominance. Being the global technology leader in AI is the most important thing to preserve over the next two decades for economic prosperity. That's why President Biden has hit the chip industry, with export controls meant to keep China from pulling ahead with advanced tech. But in October, TSMC alerted the U.S. that some of its chips were spotted in Huawei devices, despite bans on selling to the Chinese company. This problem is as old as time. There's a lot of complex rerouting of goods to different countries that have limited access to Leading edge or the most advanced technology. But of course, TSMC, a big, successful company, is supposed to be a good partner to the U.S. It is seen as extra problematic that that happened. And of course that's going to be monitored very carefully. We stopped shipment right on schedule. We're very law abiding. Just down the road in Chandler, Arizona, another chip giant-Intel-is also building two huge new fabs. The U.S. company's business model is far different - designing and manufacturing its own chips, while TSMC is what's known as a pure play foundry, only manufacturing chips for others. Cassidy says the relationship between the two is solid. We meet with them weekly and the feedback is, is we're helping them increase their ranks. We're helping them train on the most advanced stuff. So I think they're pretty happy with what we're doing. Both companies have delayed the timelines for full production at their new Arizona fabs. But where TSMC has remained the uncontested leader in advanced chips, Intel has stumbled time and again. They're in a tough spot, you know? And I don't want to see Intel go under like we need Intel. Intel is the largest recipient of funds from the $52 billion CHIPS act, signed by President Biden in 2022, meant to offset the incredible cost of building a fab to make chips in the U.S. TSMC has said the cost of U.S. construction could be at least four times what it would cost in Taiwan. Once complete, TSMC estimates all three fabs will cost $65 billion. If you take a look at the State Farm Glendale Stadium, that was roughly about $500 million. That $65 billion that we're committed to do on this site for three fabs means 130 Glendale stadiums, and that's a huge number. In November – after some complaints over delays - the Commerce Department finalized $7.9 billion for Intel, and days before, $6.6 billion for TSMC. So their deal is done completed. They're expanding hugely in Arizona. It's incredibly exciting. The race to complete the CHIPS Act deals has sped up in the weeks since the election. Trump criticized the CHIPS act as &quot;so bad&quot; in October, suggesting tariffs could be the answer instead. If there are tariffs, that will affect our customers, consumers and the broader economy, and we're at the foundational part of that economy where we are building chips that power data centers and computers and phones. So in that respect, everyone will be affected as well as TSMC. While federal funds start getting doled out to TSMC, Intel - and other recipients like Samsung, Micron, GlobalFoundries and Texas Instruments. They'll also be competing for another scarce resource in the U.S. chip industry: workers. When we finished the construction of this fab, it was really the first advanced manufacturing fab that had been built in the United States for at least ten years. And semiconductors is a very, very tough technology. You have to build upon what you learned in the previous node. And so once you stop with one particular node, you don't have the learnings to continue. The experience is just not here in the United States. So TSMC sent some 600 engineers to train in Taiwan – like Jeff Patz, who left in 2021 for an 18- month stint there. At the time, there was no facility in Arizona, and the purpose was to go and actually make things right? And learn how they're made. So you have to have a kitchen to cook, like to physically touch the $200 million piece of equipment. Like you can't do that anywhere other than at the Fab in Taiwan. Now, Patz has had the chance to see the EUV machines inside the new fab in Arizona too. I went in once very recently, and I think the 3 to 6 month gap of when I was on the construction team to where we are now, I think was astounding. It's like, oh, it looks like it did in Taiwan. TSMC plans to hire at least 6,000 workers by the time all three fabs are complete at the end of the decade. For engineers, we are actively recruiting at universities in Arizona and all across the U.S. ASU even has what they call a TSMC day. TSMC has also brought experts over from Taiwan on 3-year temporary assignments. Getting to meet like 20-30 year old industry veterans that brought us down from micron scale to nanometer scale, and get to have conversations with them about how we were going to do that in the U.S. We've brought that to Arizona. The biggest culture difference is Hawaiian Shirt Fridays, so we don't have that in Taiwan. Arizona, we have. Water scarcity, meanwhile, is something Taiwan. and Arizona have shared. A recent drought in Taiwan means TSMC is no stranger to recycling the massive amount of water it needs to make chips. TSMC says it will take 4.7 million gallons of water daily to run the first Arizona fab, but it will bring that demand down to 1 million gallons a day by recycling some 65% of that. We are working on an air WC in industrial reclamation water center. When we get that in place, we will have near zero discharge to waste, which means basically the only water we'll lose is through evaporation. Another concern: the massive amount of power it takes to make chips. TSMC did build solar on site –but it's not nearly enough to cover the 2.85 gigawatt-hours per day needed by the first fab –equivalent to the power used by roughly 100,000 U.S. homes. TSMC says it's purchasing renewable energy credits to offset all that. Still, amid the AI-fueled data center boom. Arizona's largest utility warned it could run out of transmission capacity before the end of the decade. That's also when TSMC plans to start production at its third Arizona fab. Fab 3, which you can't see, but it's down this way. It's probably going to be 2 nanometer and more advanced. The most advanced in the world? Most advanced in the world. Its global ambitions also reach far beyond Arizona. TSMC opened its first fab in Japan in February, broke ground on an $11 billion fab in Germany in August, and has been in talks about building in the United Arab Emirates – although nothing is concrete as TSMC navigates export controls on its chips into China, a UAE trading partner. Within the U.S., TSMC's plans are likely to grow too. What about other fabs in the future? There's space, right? Well, there's space for more. I don't want to speculate on what the future might bring, but we've got 1,100 acres here plus, so there's room for lots of fabs." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Most of the stuff you buy crosses the world by sea. But shipping containers don't just hold goods. They hold something else, too: power. And China is all in. That’s why they've been investing massively in ports. All over the world. China probably has stakes in a port near you. They're creating a network. And it goes beyond trade. This is a story about promises, sprawling ambition... and a plan to dominate the seas. But let’s start small. Let's go to Kribi in Cameroon. It's a coastal town known for its sandy beaches and fresh fish. Now it's also home to a deepwater sea port built by China just down the coast. This is what the coast by Kribi looked like on satellite images about 20 years ago. Not too much going on. In 2011 a Chinese state-owned construction company started building the port with the help of the Cameroonian government. You can see how quickly it pops up here, along with a highway, that connects Kribi to the rest of the country. China invested over 1 billion dollars to open the port in 2018. The idea, as outlined in this promotional video: to turn Kribi into a key trade hub for all of Central and West Africa. China promised fireworks. And locals say the port has certainly changed things here. And it isn't just Kribi and Cameroon. China's port promise is attractive for governments. They lend you money, you hire a Chinese state-owned construction firm, they quickly build you a port .... and that connects you to global trade. China very efficient in doing so because China has a strong state-owned enterprises. China very efficient, it has hard workers. So that's basically what the Global South will need from China. That’s Wang Yiwei. He’s Director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University of China in Beijing and is a former Chinese diplomat. Also China needs those markets. I think that's a mutual benefit. And in return, China promises not to get involved in your politics no matter what. By the way, China's involvement isn't the same in every port. For example, it can vary from 100 percent ownership to a minority stake. But the pitch has been successful in the Global South. Especially in African countries. Out of around 160 ports that China has stakes in, 53 are on the African continent. Another reason why African countries might be wary of Western investment is – well – the last few hundred years of Western colonialism. China still calls itself a developing country and says it's an equal partner – as opposed to the West. But China's deals with Global South countries still serve China's interests. Like in Kribi. Because as we’ll see, each of these ports is just one small part of a bigger strategy. Enter: The Belt and Road Initiative. By building roads, railways and sea ports, China wants to connect the world in one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects ever conceived. When the Belt and Road Initiative Launched in 2013, it was initially supposed to connect China and Europe – just like China's ancient Silk Road. Now China is tapping into markets in the Global South. So we needed to find a new market for China. And those countries are also very eager to share in the experience of Chinese modernization. Like the Chinese slogan goes, &quot;If you want to get rich, build a road.&quot; Here's the network China has built up. The orange lines are overland routes. The blue lines are maritime routes. In the last few years, China has increasingly expanded the maritime part of the network. And that strategy makes sense: because remember, most traded goods cross the world by sea. These are the main routes they take. And these are some of the world's most vital chokepoints: ships with goods important to world trade need to pass through here to get from one region to another. Now take another look at those ports. They give China pretty crucial access. Which is important for the country as the world's biggest exporter. The real question to my mind has to do with whether or not these infrastructure projects that leave China as the lender, as the builder, as an owner, as an operator accord them undue influence in foreign countries. This is Isaac Kardon. He is a China expert at the US-based Carnegie think tank. His research focuses on China's maritime power. This use of economic coercion against trading partners, the threat or actuality of withholding certain trade and the sort of control over the trading network itself helps give China a bunch of different mechanisms by which it can accomplish that. Meaning: China has gained leverage over many countries. In 2022 China was accused of having used it in the UN human rights council. There was a proposal to talk – just TALK - about Chinese human rights violations against the country's Uyghur Muslim minority in internment camps. Here are the 47 countries in the council at the time. These countries said yes to talking, these countries said no, these abstained. Note that a lot of the African countries in the council voted NO. China has invested in infrastructure projects in some of the countries that voted YES and ALL of the countries that voted NO. The proposal was rejected. Of course, it could have been a coincidence. China's influence has increased, because of lots of investment into those countries. They even learn from China, learn Chinese, you know. Maybe they prefer more like more Chinese model, but that that's their choice. One thing is for sure: China's involvement in ports is cementing a global network - with political allies and trade ties. Now that China has built that trade network, it's anxious to protect it. Let's look at one of those key chokepoints we mentioned before. This narrow strait between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula is called Bab el-Mandeb. The Suez Canal is on the other end of the Red Sea here. Around 12% of world trade usually passes through here. And you guessed it - China has a port here. In the small country of Djibouti. China also has its only official foreign naval base here - right next to the commercial port it has stakes in. China said the reason for opening a base in Djibouti is to secure trade from piracy. And it's not the only country with a military base in Djibouti. Take a look. By the way, the US base is around 13 kilometers from China's base. But we'll get to that rivalry later. So many countries have set up on the strait by Djibouti... ...in part because of attacks like THESE. Most recently Houthi rebels from Yemen have been targeting commercial ships in the Red Sea. Those attacks have been so intense... ... that they changed global trade routes. Many ships are now avoiding the Red Sea altogether. And taking this, much longer route, to get to Europe. Along with Russia, China reportedly even struck a deal with the Houthis to avoid their ships being hit. The UN says disruptions to trade in general are increasing all over the world. A worry especially for the Chinese. The country is not only a big exporter, but also needs to import resources like oil and minerals to keep its economy running. There is a risk to China of the disruption of that network and that would really cause significant problems for their economic model. And political rivalries could also lead to disruption. There is this perception in China that they're vulnerable to US sanctions, to US naval interdiction, to other US efforts alongside allies to essentially cut China out of the global trading system. So it’s no surprise that giant container vessels aren't the only ships from China showing up at these ports now. Meet: the People’s Liberation Army Navy, the PLAN. The navy’s official mission is to &quot;safeguard China's overseas interests.&quot; That includes securing trade. Military doesn't just mean war, rivalry. Military also means providing public goods, securing public goods. In the last few years, China has been massively building up its navy. China can now rival the US in some important military capabilities and already has a larger fleet if you only look at ship numbers. And it's building even more. Plus, there have been rumors about potential new naval bases beyond Djibouti for a while. The most likely spots for them are – you guessed it – some of the overseas ports China is involved in. The US research lab “AidData” found eight ports that they think could become Chinese military bases within the next five years. Remember Kribi in Cameroon? Well, it's on the list. China is the port operator there, the port is deep enough to harbor big warships, ...and China and Cameroon are on good terms politically. And even without ports like Kribi OFFICIALLY becoming naval bases: The People's Liberation Army has made quite extensive use of this network of port facilities. All of the ports and virtually any commercial port is intrinsically a dual-use facility because naval ships need some of the same things that any commercial ship does, in particular fuel and water and food and the ability to rest their crews. And there's more. The US is concerned Chinese involvement in ports could block or limit US commercial – and military – access to them. And that China is using ports to spy. Like here at the Port of Khalifa in the United Arab Emirates. US intelligence said a new planned terminal there was actually a secret military facility. Just to put the US accusations in context: China has one foreign military base, and the US has... well, see for yourself. The bigger the bubble in each country, the more US military bases there are there. In the Chinese case, they're not at that level. They don't have anything resembling the US basing network. But what they have is an interesting alternative. China says it has a different foreign policy, it says it doesn’t intervene in other countries. But the ports certainly expand China’s presence around the world. The existence of this port network and the political relationships and political influence that's associated with it have really created a much more permissive international environment for Chinese military forces to be a kind of regular feature of some of these regional security environments where they didn't used to be present at all. We don’t know how the use of this port network will ultimately play out. The US is watching warily as China expands into what they perceive as their backyard in Latin America. One of the new ports: Chancay in Peru. It will supposedly slash shipping times between South America and Asia. A Chinese shipping company will be the sole operator of the port, which is why US officials have repeatedly voiced concern about the project. But China's port promise remains attractive around the world. As they expand their port network, they are gaining new allies willing to harbor their ambitions. gpersonalcordula_johannis_dw_comEuksdsYyeLlItjLa05mHI3YBtYcj5bcZFoxWmoPcaXQiMg?e=bkAvcR" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="always strong After 15 years in office Shik Cena's rule collapsed under mass protests international pressure and growing descent from within her own ranks Bangladesh's most powerful leader since independence was ousted last year marking what some now call its second liberation Bought in to help navigate the aftermath Muhammad Eunis The Nobel Peace Prize laurate once celebrated for lifting millions out of poverty through micro finance Now at 84 tasked with guiding a nation marred by repression and corruption on a new path But questions remain Is this a true break from the past or just a reshuffleling of elites Will the interim government deliver free and fair elections or build a future on its own terms or shaped by its own interests There's also a reckoning abroad Relations with India are tense Hina is in exile in New Delhi where she continues to issue statements claiming she's still Bangladesh's rightful prime minister And US President Donald Trump is threatening steep tariffs increasing economic pressure Now with the world watching and a country in flux we speak to the man at the center of it all Muhammad Eunis chief adviser of Bangladesh talks to Alazer Muhammad Ununice welcome to talk to Al Jazer So you've described the fall of Shik Husena as Bangladesh's second liberation I wonder if you can explain what you mean by that in the terms of this period of transition for the country Bangladesh came to a stage where corruptions and uh uh violations of all norms uh destruction of all the institutions we're going absolutely at 100% level So that's the time when uh young people emerged they said that's enough uh we you have to go So they raised this issue we have to go and marched on the street together and made it happen on uh 5th of August So that was something to uh see the enormous amount of uh um misgovernance and enormous amount of atrocities and and enormous amount of uh cruel things that have been done to the citizens of the country and plundering of the economy totally stolen everything that they could lay your hands on Uh so they they brought it to the end of it So that was a kind of emergence of a new Bangladesh they call it new Bangladesh Uh so the old old Bangladesh is a kind of terrifying things We want to create a new Bangladesh That's the beginning of the new Bangladesh to set things right How convinced are you that you will be able to set things right That there will not simply be the reemergence of the old god that there will be a complete break with the old and in with the new How convinced are you of that That's a fear everybody has in their mind How to avoid that That's our effort It's in telling government Our effort is to make sure we don't go back to those old days uh how to reform the institutions So reform agenda is the most important agenda for interim government We have appointed 15 reform commissions each on one subject and the constitution reform election reform civil socivil administration reform uh judiciary reform So there are 15 of them So they are coming up with their recommendations Now we are receiving the recommendations and they're handy over uh our job is to see how many of these recommendations are acceptable by people So we want to do that creating by a new uh commission It's a consensus building commission That commission goes with the recommendations to the political parties asking them the question which one you agree which one you disagree which one you partially agree etc etc in a kind of a spreadsheet uh so ultimate goal is to find out on which of the recommendations all parties agree in finding consensus I wonder how mindful you are of the role that Gen Z played in the so-called monsoon revolution They were the forefront and in many ways bore the brunt of police violence during it How you ensuring that there is consensus in terms of their involvement in the future direction of the country Here we are talking about the political parties They are representing the views of the people There are many people outside the political parties But luckily uh those young people that you mentioned they form a political party itself So as a political party same thing is asked to them What are the things that you agree disagree partially agree and so on so forth Ultimate goal is to collect all them on which items all parties agree That will be most important thing because on these are the items that all parties agree And once we is done process is done this will be put in a another piece of paper this on this all parties agree and all parties sign on this document So so you clearly have a strategy you clearly have a method Absolutely Absolutely Personally what kind of leader would you like to see take the country forward after this interim period is over Not go back to the old fascist regime that we have Not go back to plundering of the economy and so on so forth But you cannot guarantee the leader but is you guarantee how the system works So we are trying to reform You said you said fascist regime Those are strong words to use Why use them Use them because that's the features they have displayed during their regime So this is how they have been described in the entire uh program that the students were taken So uh our idea is to see that institutions are reformed policies are reformed so that we can go back and create a norm standard that everybody agrees people can say hey you agreed on this now why aren't you doing that when we have this piece of paper with all the agreements on it uh we'll name it July charter so this is the July which uprising took place the July charter will be kind of consensus for all parties and we follow the July charter how to implement those things Some of the implementation will come before the election some of the implementation will come after the election So this is the scenario that we are following right now Uh in terms of of the timeline for an election are you confident of reach reaching the target of the earliest December this year That's right Latest next June Is that correct Where do we expect it to be between those two Uh that will depend on how many of them we are agreeing disagreeing how how much time it takes So if the consensus is you have a larger number of items that we can agree on and we want to implement before the election then we take a longer time If they're not in a hurry to have the election and go a smaller version of the implementation then we have the early election in December If it takes a longer version we go up to June Beyond June we don't go How do you how do you ensure the results of those election election is respected Will international observers be allowed in for instance Everybody will be We promise interim government keep promising we'll have the best election ever taken place in Bangladesh That's the kind of election we're going to have Big implications as to whether or not the Awami League will be allowed to take part in those elections The the party of the former leader part of it will be decided by the party itself to decide that they what they want to join or not We don't know yet They have not declared anything And when it happens what is the response from the election commission and so on so forth So you're you're leaving it entirely to the election commission to to make not election There are other parties who may say that under this law they cannot participate and so on Is it fair to say is it fair to say that the honeymoon period after the fall of Shakina is probably over now There are some pretty big challenges that you need to provide concrete answers for given the fact that there is this lingering influence of the old guard others who may seek to exploit uh the political vacuum and you also of course have something like a million Rahinga refugees as well that you are minding Is this something Bangladesh can do alone Two things One about the impatience of people uh whether honeymoon period is over or not uh seeing the situation in Bangladesh still people think uh interim government is still the good answer for them they're not saying let the interim government go have the election today nobody said that so this is the direction we are going it's a uh we have not faced any such problem of uh uh people saying that hand it over as soon as possible uh but the rohinga that's a separate issue we are dealing with the rohinga issue with international organizations United Nations and also uh uh to make sure that uh these people can go home safely So our idea is to how to make sure uh uh some understanding is created between Bangladesh and Myanmar so that there's a safe uh resettlement of Rohingyas to go back and go back to their own homes Given the huge amount of pressure like I said a million Rohingya in Bangladesh and countries like the United States even the United Kingdom and others saying look for financial reasons we are not going to spend what we used to spend on international aid Does that worry you Does that concern you or can Bangladesh shoulder this pressure from other sources Uh I would say that Bangladesh will not be alone to help them There are many many countries who will help them to make sure but be even more than that it's not about helping them to stay the important thing to help them to go back to their homes They have their homes They have their land They have their professions Go back to their profession They are uh professional people like engineers doctors and uh lawyers along with the farmers their craftsmen They're all here It's a whole society sitting in out there So they go back to their professions So that will be the best solution In the meantime it's the responsibility of the whole world It's not the responsibility of Bangladesh Bangladesh has uh allowed them to stay That's best thing they could do in under the circumstances But it's assumed that it's a global community would be looking after their health and uh livelihood I suppose if a country wants to really forge ahead it does also need to look into some of the darker aspects of its near past particularly when it comes to the issue of accountability I mean you have pledged justice for those killed and disappeared under Shikina's rule Will your government invite in a UNled investigation How will you pursue accountability Already UNled investigation has taken place uh high commissioner for human rights They published a whole report full of all the details of everything So I were very happy that we we didn't have to do it and say people questioning our ability to do that They spend lot of time documented available in public domain Uh so this is a good start We have our own research own uh reports what they terrible thing they have done So the the legal system is now functioning to bring them to trial So the trial thing will start very soon probably at the end of uh this month or beginning of next month And how far up the chain would those u judicial proceedings go Are we talking about military and intelligence officials Anybody who has committed any crime crime against humanity nobody will be spared You've also alleged a widespread corruption against the the previous leadership Can you share any specific cases Many many of them It's all documented in the UN report But any specific examples now examples of stolen assets for stolen assets banking system is completely emptied out taking uh resources out of the country Banks were taken out completely by taking over the board of the bank uh under gunpoint So you replace the board and then board gives you a loan massive loan Uh understanding is you'll never you have to pay back So you although your book it shows as a loan but actually you just took the money away Where's the majority of that money gone and how do you even start talking about asset recovery Uh there are lots of investigations going on We see part of it is in Europe part of is in Caribbean and part of it in Asian countries So we are tracing them and trying to get the money back as much as we can And are foreign governments helping you with doing that Absolutely They're very cooperative All of them Uh Bangladesh has issued a arrest warrant for the British MP Chulip Sadi I mean she is Shake Casino's niece I mean she's been accused of benefiting from family corruption I think it's fair to say she firmly denies the allegations Is this part of a genuine anti-corruption drive or is there a certain degree of political retaliation here It's a a case against concrete evidence Uh so the legal system has to work out So we are not saying we are putting it to jail right away We simply department of anti-corruption The anti-corruption commission actually they brought the case Now court has to decide whether evidence is good enough to send her to jail or really can she be extradited from the UK You would like to pursue that Absolutely same way as we have done for Hassina who's left the country Um talking about Shik Hassina obviously she claims she is still the rightful prime minister She's issuing all of these statements from India Um how does the government view her presence there in India We have a BIMstick meeting in Bangkok where all the BIMstick heads of governments were there including uh Prime Minister Modi Uh I had a discussion with Prime Minister Modi and I made it very clear that uh okay if you want to keep her that probably is not something that I can settle with you but definitely uh while she's here she should not be talking because it creates a lot of problem for us She's uh giving speeches to incite people in inside of Bangladesh and we have to suffer from that What did Prime Minister Modi say uh he said if I recolct he said this is a uh country where uh social media is open to anybody I cannot control that so my my question to you is do you think that India is offering her political cover should she face justice back home and can you in any way leverage that this is a legal procedure I don't know what the law says what to do we have already sent a letter to Indian government to really send her to Bangladesh they have not responded to yet Uh but when the legal procedures begin and law will again court will give the notice to her to see how to bring her So let me get this straight You're saying that Prime Minister Modi has told you we can't do anything about her freedom of speech in a country India that has been accused of stifling freedom of speech Uh and in no way have you been given any kind of guarantees that she will be sent back to face justice No What does that do diplomatically between Bangladesh and India uh this is one of the cases that we have to resolve ourselves that uh continue to do that we understand what their legal situation is what our legal situation is uh but we are waiting for the legal notice coming from the court that brings it to a higher level of uh notice was it deliberate that you decide to visit China first before before India were you sending a message there I'm visiting everybody who uh I would like to go the neighbors uh I tried to go to India they didn't respond to it So I went to China and now I'll go to Malaysia So I'm vis and I was in Bangkok in Thailand So I'm visiting uh many countries around and I'm trying to revive SARKC as a community of South Asian countries This is all the members countries So today SARKC is a kind of in a limbo It's not functioning I'm appealing to all the S leaders that let's get back into it co collaborate with each other meet each other and so on So that's one effort I'm making Another effort is a beam stack Yes we'll say let's get together and see resolved our issues and continue together Our main issue is to how to bring nations together for a better life for the citizens of those countries Uh BIMstack currently Bangladesh is a chair of BIMstack So this is an important position for the beans take to hold those meetings and try to do that and also we want to try to get the membership ASEAN that's another large number of countries where uh we'd like to be associated with and we're very happy that we get a good so so essentially you're willing to work with anyone who will work with you regionally but India has to a certain extent given you a cold shoulder here is the alternative now a deepening ties with Pakistan instead uh I will not say cold shoulder It's maybe temporary thing something we have to resolve together So I'll not take this as a final thing It's a it's not something uh longlasting thing How to resolve this Friendship is the key to live together and move together and I'll keep on insisting on the how to bring people together in the neighborhood of Bangladesh and so on and India Bangladesh relationshipship should be one of the best relationship any nations could have together I appreciate you've pushed back on on the phrase cold shoulder but somebody who has expressed his displeasure with you is President Donald Trump I heard he donated to see me lose Uh he said talking about your donation to the Clinton Foundation in 2016 ahead of her bid of course for the presidency Do you regret that move now that Trump is back Uh we have good relations with the Trump administration We have no problem We work together Uh we look forward to build a relationship strong relationship with the Trump administration That's what we're working So you are engaged with the new administration Absolutely Very strongly and very warmly We have a very warm relationship with the Trump administration Do you see the US as a reliable partner Are you being forced to choose between Beijing and Washington DC No No This is not a question of choice They're all our friends USA is a good friend China is a good friend India is a good friend Nevertheless you've been slapped at with tariffs like most of the world at a time in which the country is emerging from years of turmoil This is not aimed at Bangladesh This is a global policy of the US We cannot question that We are trying to see how we can uh continue with our relationship in a uh way that we benefit from that Do you still believe after this trade war that free market capitalism something that you have been such a champion of is really the way the world should be run Uh I'll slightly modify it saying that I always say that this civilization is a self-destructive civilization No matter what you do you cannot escape this self-destruction So we have to redesign the system We create a new civilization There comes the free free market and economy and so on Essentially the seed of self-destruction is in the system So we have to bring it out We have to create a new civilization which is not driven by greed not driven by profit maximization but social consciousness So we saying there's a business profit maximizing business I have no quarrel with them But alongside of this profit maximizing you have to create another stream of business called social businesses Businesses to solve problem in a market way but without any intention of making money for yourself So money that you make profit into the business is rolled back into the business Problem solving I'm very interested in where you first were driven to challenge the or or or answer some of these huge challenges because you had turned your your attention to alleviating poverty after the 1974 famine one of the most devastating in recent history an estimated one and a half million people died in that What do those experiences tell you about good and bad governance and about the needs of the poor Two things one I kept saying poverty is not created by the poor people it's created by the system we built sometimes I give example bonsai I said uh you take the seed or a bonsai tree bonsai tree yeah take a piece of a tree and put it in a flower pot and let it grow it will grow beautiful tree come out of there but tiny little one it's not the tall tree that it was before I said that's what happened to our entire human race that we are put in a flower uh bonsai So we emerge as a bonsai Our our capability our ability to resolve our problem is all cut down because of the system we built doesn't allow us to release all our energy or our creativity It's a jobdriven economy As a job is not the answer of human beings So human beings are born as a creative being Job takes away creativity Job is driven by orders You take orders and perform And that's not what human beings are Human beings are not about slavery Human beings are about exploring uh limits It's a huge limits that you have inside inside of you or how to explore that So that is the kind of economy that we have to build I in brief I finally conclude that we have to build a new civilization based on social businesses No tall order A bonsai economy you say something that is perfect but is small and and it's and is fair free and fair for all I mean given Bangladesh is relying on IMF support Can you guarantee that any of these reforms that are being asked of the country as it goes through this difficult transition period will not burden the poorest even further If it does it will be shame This is what the intention of the government to do that We are trying to overcome the problems that we inherited So make sure that uh we don't have this burden on us we create an economy where we take care of oursel that's whole thing Uh and that's what the ex releasing the energy of 180 million people It's a tremendous energy Bangladesh is an amazing country 180 million people living in 150,000 square kilometers and that population is growing Half the population of Bangladesh remember 180 total Half the population of Bangladesh is under the age of 27 It's a very young population young population with full of energy handful of technology in their hand and change miracles to do that Was the monsoon revol revolution um a revolution for all between the urban and the rural between the old and the young It is such a vast population as you say a huge number are very young indeed and will be custodians of the country going forward But I wonder if there is a big unbridgegable divide between what's going on in major cities and what's going on the far-flung regions of the country It's amazing thing what the July revolution has done July uprising has done brought everybody together Whether you are old whether you are young whether you are urban whether you are rural whether you're girl whether you're a woman whether you're man as a child doesn't matter Everybody's one book That's what made it happen It happened in hours notice not months notice It all began and then it's all ended within the same month There have been I need to bring this up reports that show that there is still widespread labor abuse in Bangladesh's subcontracted um factories That's despite your own legacy of micro finance How do you respond to critics who say micro finance actually helped it didn't resolve these deeper issues of of inequality and poverty Yeah Uh micro credit is not the solution for everything We're telling that the people can have uh their own life Don't have to work for somebody else And that's a theme that I work on saying the people are basically born as entrepreneurs But the system doesn't allow us to be entrepreneurs System stops you because the financial institution doesn't work that way Financial institution lends money to people who already have lots of money and doesn't lend money to people who don't have money That's my team that I always worked So labor issue is a different issue Yes there are problems in the labor segment of our population Uh we are dedicated to solve that problem Uh we are ready getting ready to sign up the ILO convention so that we fulfill all the requirement That's the direction we are going So we inherited lots of those problem but our government is making sure that we perform at the level of the international community standard That's our commitment and we're working on it very hard As we've reached the end of this discussion I want to ask you a personal question You are clearly a very able and very lively 84 year old I got your age right Yes You are a noble laurate You're internationally known Why are you doing this now at this point in your life Uh I got a phone call from Bangladesh I was in Paris Uh they were selling that the Hassina has left Regime has collapsed Now we have to form a government we want you to become the head of the government I said no not me I don't want to get involved Uh you find somebody else So I gave arguments why I don't want to get involved and so what but they were not in a listening mood So I said why don't you think over it find somebody else give a big try I'm sure you'll find many people who are capable of running the country Uh so take 24 hours come back tomorrow and tell us uh tell me what you did So they called me back next day and they repeated that we tried but it didn't happen I said no you didn't try hard enough So it started in the 5th of August the Hassina left and I got the first call and the second call On the third call uh they said look we have been trying and you are refusing it We have been searching for everything but everybody said no this is the best solution He has to come uh and we have given our lives these young people etc all the description of what happened then I felt a little a little bad that I'm refusing this So I said okay you have sacrificed your life and give blood uh despite my uh reluctance to do that I'll accept it Uh and they were very happy immediately all over the press that he's coming he's taking the responsibility and when was that exact point that it's 8th of August on 8th of August he arrived in Dhaka and uh took charge of the government How does it feel to come full circle now I mean of course you have been uh facing smear campaigns multiple smear campaigns by the Hassina leadership You've been threatened with with jail with fines all sorts of allegations leveled against you How does it feel as we reach the end of our discussion to be in this huge position of responsibility and what country will Bangladesh be in the next decade It's a tremendous responsibility At the same time I must emphasize repeatedly it's a great opportunity History never gave us this opportunity before Certainly that opportunity came It's a clean slate You can do anything you want provided you can create a new government new Bangladesh And that's a challenge given to us We are working very hard Uh we'll try our best to make that happen and hold the election and hand it over to the newly elected government That's our go job But in the meantime we want to make sure it's peacefully done Everything done in a very correct procedures so that people feel happy at every step that we take Muhammad Ununus thanks for talking to Alaz Thank you Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity Thank you Alazer for covering Bangladesh so well [Music]" />

Emirates are how will this Gulf tour benefit Trump's America First agenda could it revive the Abraham Accords and will it serve to stop the assault on Gaza i'm Andrea Sen today's newsmaker is President Trump's visit to the Gulf [Music] well many have said Donald Trump is a transactional president not necessarily interested in the wider geopolitics but focused exclusively on the economic benefits of building relationships so that could explain why his first working trip abroad is a tour of three very wealthy Gulf States now exactly how he'll extract investment from them remains to be seen but the Qataris have already gifted their visitor a $400 million jumbo jet here's a look touching down in Riyad the US president kicks off a multi-day visit to Saudi Arabia Qatar and the United Arab Emirates big business and bigger investments will be setting the tone saudi Arabia is keen to diversify its economy away from oil and will be looking for American investments in its vision 2030 program a series of mega-cale infrastructure and development projects spread throughout the country its crown prince Muhammad bin Salman has already pledged around $600 billion worth of investments in the US trump will try to convince him to round that figure up further to 1 trillion on day one of the visit Saudi Arabia signed an agreement to purchase $142 billion worth of US arms and weaponry when the US leadership signals to US businesses that doing business in Saudi Arabia with Saudi companies joint investments in both directions are encouraged that definitely sets the tone that gives companies uh confidence and that helps change the image of of how this side of the world sees uh the US but oil prices will be a touchy subject opec nations have ramped up their output sending prices down to lows not seen in several years saudi Arabia still needs to sell oil to fund its transition away from it but while Donald Trump wants oil cheaper he doesn't want it so cheap that US oil which is more expensive becomes unprofitable compared to the much more easily obtained drilled oil from the Middle East qatar hosts the biggest US military installation in the whole Middle East qatar has also positioned itself as a mediator in regional conflicts but the president's visit to Qatar is likely to be further overshadowed by the Qatari Royal family's recent gift of a Boeing 7478 luxury jet for the president to use as an interim Air Force One donald Trump has regularly voiced public criticisms of Boeing following extensive delays on the upgrades to two other 747 jets meant to replace the current aging US presidential fleet the president defended the choice they're giving us a free jet i could say &quot;No no no don't give us I want to pay you a billion or 400 million or whatever it is.&quot; Or I could say &quot;Thank you very much.&quot; But questions about ethics bribery even legality are arising even among Republicans normally allied to the president the United Arab Emirates where his Middle East visit will conclude will hope Trump's visit results in investment in AI manufacturing and energy the US also announced a 1.4 billion dollar weapon sale to the UAE before Trump's visit gulf leaders will hope to avoid addressing normalization of relations with Israel it won't be lost on any of them that the president's visit does not include a stop in Israel itself a possible sign of Donald Trump's growing impatience with Netanyahu for failing to establish a proper ceasefire over the Gaza conflict and the US's desire to prevent Iran from further enriching uranium cannot be overstated iran insists its nuclear program is for the benefit of civilian energy but the US accuses Iran of having the goal of obtaining or building nuclear weapons something that American allies in the Gulf are keen to avoid for regional stability the US president's official visit signifies to the world that the Middle East region is increasingly important in US eyes but will Trump's self-styled image as a dealmaker get him and the Middle East what they both want so what will the US get out of this visit and vice versa well joining me now to debate that and much more are from Washington professor at the National Defense University David D ro also from the US capital CEO of Gulf State Analytics and adjunct professor at Georgetown University Georgio Cafiro and from Doha head of the diplomatic studies program at the Doha Institute Marwan Kablan thank you so much all for being with me uh let's start then with assessing what each of you thinks the US is primarily after with this visit what are the actual priorities here david go ahead well I think the first priority is business as it always is with Trump i think the second priority is ensuring uh that there is nothing uh from the Gulf that would upset whatever the Trump administration wants to do with Iran and I think a third priority is setting the conditions for a possible future normalization of Saudi relations with Israel once the Gaza situation is resolved okay i would like you to further clarify all of those things but let me start with Iran why is uh why is that a primary issue well this is a signature diplomacy effort of the Trump administration they want to you know they um withdrew from the uh Iran deal that had been negotiated by John Kerry uh they uh want to have a newer bigger better deal one of the big problems with the Obama administration deal was that it was conducted without any real consultation from either our Gulf partners or from Israel they viewed this as US making commitments uh in their neighborhood putting them at risk potentially so I think that he wants to ensure that there's no um uh public or private dissension from whatever it is that the uh Trump administration manages to achieve with Iran okay and David quickly you say business is there but where where exactly is the value supposed to be extracted for Trump well Trump wants to see money coming from other places and spent in the United States and so a lot of his delegation are the real titans of industry but uh the sector seems to be artificial intelligence computer services and automation so you have people like from high level people the head of chat GPT uh Palunteer uh IBM uh Alphabet those those kind of country companies okay giorgio you on the same page yeah you know I think uh the regional environment is quite different today compared to when Trump uh made his historic visit to Riad eight years ago this month um I totally agree with everything that Dave is saying certainly the case that the Saudis have a different type of relationship with Iran right now amid this period of dant whereas the Saudis were not so uh welcoming of the Obama administration's efforts to negotiate the first JCPOA with uh with Tehran right now I think Saudi Arabia is obviously very focused on its own economic development and diversification wanting to attract tourists and investment to the kingdom This requires stability in the neighborhood and I think Guruad and the other GCC states are very much on board with the Trump administration's plans to find some sort of a way to reach a new nuclear deal with Iran i think this trip is obviously an important opportunity for Trump and his team to have frank discussions with the leadership in Saudi Arabia as well as in Qatar and the UAE about what uh can come out of a nuclear deal and how to achieve some greater stability in the region giorgio let me ask you this though obviously Saudi then you say wants stability and security so that it can push forward its own agenda you know based on development and tourism for example but we're also hearing that Saudi would like to see US investment in some of their sectors is that misunderstanding because where would the US actually be able to invest in Saudi well the Saudi leadership obviously is moving ahead with vision 2030 and they're trying to get investors entrepreneurs businessmen from as many countries around the world to invest in the kingdom uh looking west looking east looking uh to all parts of the world and there's no doubt that um you know technology is a huge part of vision 2030 and I think you know there's really common cause here uh between the Saudi leadership and the Trump administration they really want to deepen economic links between both countries and without you know no doubt uh leadership in Riad wants American companies to be playing even more of a role in the economic diversification of Saudi Arabia for example which companies well I think you know uh I'm not going to name any specific ones but I'm sure that many of the companies being represented in today's forum are ones that the Saudis are very interested in having uh come into Saudi Arabia and you know a number of years ago it was quite controversial for some American companies to be going into Saudi Arabia um in light of the Hashoji uh killing but I think with Trump doing this visit that is going to lead to more American companies feeling increasingly comfortable going into Saudi Arabia in the months and the years ahead so I think this trip is really important from that standpoint okay Marwan what's your take well I think I agree with what David and Georgia have just said but I may add to that uh uh the personal interest of President Trump himself in terms of private business uh that something that is something that we should perhaps uh uh touch upon uh because as far as I know he's going to get uh perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars as donations from the Gulf countries to the uh Trump library you know every president actually is uh having his own library uh so I think uh Trump is getting uh I believe like 200 millions from Saudi Arabia 250 million perhaps from United Arab Emirates and uh I'm not sure about about Qatar but everybody seems to be interested actually in investing in the Trump library of course there are other aspects of this uh personal aspect of this relationship uh we have we have been hearing over the past couple of days about u uh an airplane that is uh actually presented by Qatar as as as a gift to President Trump uh so that is something also that we must take into account and um you know I mean the the business of the family also is is is also is something important that we we should need perhaps to I mean to talk about it uh in addition to that I believe President Trump believes this is the only place in the world that he feels not only at home but he feels that he can make big announcement about big deals in terms of business in terms of arms deals in terms of investment in the United States he can talks about he can talk about trillions of dollars of of of business actually so here here actually this is where he believes that he can do what other what what what others cannot here we have he he can achieve what others cannot achieve so this is let me just ask you because we have heard specifically for this visit the the figure of a trillion dollars uh jumping around do you I mean can the US get a trillion dollars out of Saudi uh well the Saudis they have already they are already already pledged something like six 600 billion dollars actually in investment in uh in the United States he's going to sign perhaps one 100 billion dollar arms deal with the Saudis the Imiratis also glitched something like 1.4 uh uh 1.4 trillion dollars in terms of investment in artificial intelligence and other sort of uh of businesses with the United States so perhaps he might actually end up announcing I mean I mean deals and uh uh uh business uh maybe trillions trillions of dollars maybe yes one trillion is is is a fair number to talk about interesting though David I'll come back to you because not long ago we were actually talking about the United States having to cut weapons supplies to Saudi uh because of its implications in in Yemen just very quickly is that completely in the past now i think so i think that the main constraint the main weapon that Saudi Arabia needs right now are um restock their uh air defense missiles uh and the problem is we just can't produce them fast enough because now the Europeans are suddenly aware of the fact that they have security threats uh so um I think that the landscape has shifted and I think that President Trump's personal considerations shifted but it's also important to note that the Saudis are now the voice of restraint and engagement with the Houthis in Yemen so there's been a change in Saudi Arabia as well and I think that they they probably there's if if they are denied a weapon system it's either because we cannot produce it fast enough or because there are technology transfer considerations fair enough uh David I'll stick with you though because as uh Marwan was talking about we have this $400 million gift does it or does it not constitute what some would call bribery if Trump can keep it for his you know personal use once leaving office or for his library as he said and why didn't Qatar just gift it to the United States and not to the president himself i I think the proposal is to gift it to the United States i mean it would be a interim replacement for Air Force One so it would go into US Air Force Service um the I I think that this is an issue to But then are we misunderstanding that he he takes it with him when he leaves office no no well so so presidential libraries are run by the National Archives Administration so um the John F kennedy Library is the one I'm most familiar with and that's basically a government museum and facility um and uh you know in Boston it's beautiful but uh it's it's not run by the Kennedy family there are uh allegations that uh sometimes the libraries have foundations and that members of the former president's family are on the board and ex you know may draw uh profit from it but I think when you look at uh where President Trump makes money I think that the presidential library in his post-presidential life will be more of a a fund and time sync rather than a source of wealth so So this is um something that I think will never be in President Trump's personal uh do domain i think it will always be in some sort of government thing but uh of course the narrative that it's a bribe plays into a wellestablished pattern that the media has had of of portraying Trump as a okay if not a bribe conflict of interest well again it's being accepted on behalf of the US government so I think I think you could say that it's unsemly that the most powerful country in the world is is taking a gift uh from uh you know a small uh uh autocratic uh benign autocratic but autocratic state uh that's perhaps unseenly but again I don't think that he's personally going to benefit from this i think that uh the issue is Air Force One has to be a 747 boeing isn't making them anymore uh they've been working uh for I think eight years on trying to upgrade a 747 to the acceptable configuration there's one here that I believe is actually in Miami with an aircraft broker so I I think it's a little bit more complicated it's it's not like he's receiving an envelope with $400 million worth of cash okay Giorgio what do you think and some have also made the point that it doesn't bode well for Israel that Trump would accept a gift from a country that's seen as a Hamas ally i think the Qataris learned a lot of important lessons from the first Trump administration of course back in 2017 actually just shortly after Trump's first visit to Riyad as president in his first term was when the GCC crisis erupted qatar really depends on a very close relationship with the United States and having rocksolid relations with the Trump administration is very important there is a way of doing business with Trump that I think the Gulf Arab leaders including the Qataris understand very well there are certain gestures that appeal to Trump flattery is certainly one way to convince Trump to do things a certain way there is a lot that the Qataris want to see from the Trump administration when it comes to the situation in Syria situation in Gaza Red Sea security and I think you know the Kuthis understand that you know these kinds of gifts and other similar gestures are a way to get on Trump's good side let's also keep in mind that Qatar has its critics in Washington there are pro-Israel groups in Washington and at times there have been these figures around Trump who do not see Qatar as a good ally of the US they see Qatar as a nefarious actor officials in Doha are always concerned that those people will convince Trump to view Doha in a negative manner and so the way I read this is the Qataris are making an investment in having good relations with Trump there are people who criticize this they see this as blatant corruption but I think when we consider this from Qatar's perspective and we look at their national interests okay this is a rational move well then Mwan I'd like you to comment on that i mean what does Qatar really need or want from the United States in this transaction well as as as Giorgio has just said the US is a very important security ally of of Qatar and also Qatar has a huge investment in the US economy as well i remember that the amir of Qatar he he he talked about something like close to $200 billion dollars of Qatar investment in the US in the US economy in different sectors of the US economy including uh healthcare uh energy sector uh uh technology and other and other things so uh so both actually the US is a security partner and an economic partner very important partner of uh ofQatar qatar is a tiny country uh in the region is surrounded by big neighbors and um uh it needs in fact some sort of US security guarantees in this very turmoil uh uh uh region uh of the of the world so it's mainly about uh about these two uh two issues and I believe President Trump it's it's going to be a very good occasion uh actually for President Trump also to to visit Alit air base in in Qatar which is perhaps one of the largest in the region hosting more than 11,000 uh US troops this is something that President Trump was not aware of its existence in his first term in when he when he came to power in in 2017 uh during the the the Gulf crisis in that that year he wasn't really aware that Qatar was perhaps hosting this uh very big US air base so it's going to be a very important uh occasion for Qatar to strengthen the relationship with with the United States uh as I said a very important partner and ally of Qatar okay we're down to our last few minutes so I'd like to get each of your opinions on on this last question um having said that uh what what especially with Marwan's just analysis there where does all of this leave Israel David i mean some are saying that Betty Man Netanyahu has suddenly become a liability of sorts uh for Donald Trump but then again others will say well it's not really that of paramount interest to the Gulf States the war in Gaza even though they've cut ties with Israel they're not interested in in reviving the the Abraham Accords that some even say they're dead in the water at this point what's your take now on the relationship and Israel's factoring into this i think that uh uh Trump and to a certain extent the Gulf partners compartmentalize uh issues israel's viewed as a separate issue i think that you know you keep hearing rumors uh you know senior people in the Biden administration say that uh Israel and the kingdom were close to normalization uh but October 7th put that off course i think that for now um what Israel does uh I think Trump will say look they they've got a security consideration i'm not going to get involved in it and uh normalization will be in the deep freeze until uh after Gaza is resolved okay Giorgio I think Trump's foreign policy agenda is very much geared toward countering a rising China and from Trump's perspective conflicts in the Middle East quagmires in the Middle East are ones the US should not get caught in and he certainly doesn't want the US to um enter new conflicts in the Middle East i think the Trump team sees the GCC countries as America's allies and partners that play a productive role in terms of helping the US get out of conflicts in the US in in the region and help the US play a role in winding them down this is the opposite of what Israel is doing israel is trying to drag the United States into a conflict with Iran i am certainly not saying that Trump is anywhere close to considering walking away from America's alliance with Israel but I think what we're possibly seeing is somewhat of a shift in US foreign policy whereby it's becoming a little more oriented around US relationships with countries in the Gulf and the White House is increasingly keen to somewhat sideline Israel when it comes to some of these sensitive issues in the region whether we're talking about the Houthis in Yemen or nuclear diplomacy with Iran possibly lifting of sanctions on Syria so on and so forth okay so Marwan if Giorgio is correct there do you see Trump somehow pushing for a ceasefire in Gaza through this i think so i mean I believe that he would be very happy actually to see a deal uh brokered uh uh during his visit to the region i mean he is hopeful perhaps that he can say something good about it when he visits Qatar to tomorrow i'm not sure if that's going to be the case but uh I mean he would be really happy because as I said earlier this man is for big announcement for big deals for something uh he would like actually to uh to be seen as as the president who can actually make deals that nobody else can can do but there's another thing here that I'd like also to mention that is the the GCC countries in my opinion are quite happy to see the US president making this uh uh detachment between the relationship with with Isra and uh and um cooperation with the GCC countries because the Saudis I believe that are quite happy actually to see that the US is willing to develop the relationship with the Saudis and perhaps agree for a nuclear reactor in in in Saudi arabia uh maybe a defense backed with Saudi Arabia without being that conditional aborn normalization with with with Isra i mean that applies also to to Qatar and other and other countries in in the region okay Marwan that will have to be the final word for this edition of the newsmakers i'd like to thank all three of you really so much for being with us our viewers for joining us as

Two-thirds of Latin American nations have already joined China's Belt and Road Initiative, while trade with the US has dropped 25% since 2013.

Well Latin America has been known as Washington's backyard and for decades the US was by far its biggest trading partner But today China has replaced that status with every country in South and Central America bar Colombia and Ecuador Not only are they aligned with China on trade but also on ideology believing in empowering the global south over a US dominated world order Now that was on

sphere of influence for the United States But in recent years China has quietly expanded its presence to become the region's largest trading partner Formed in 2011 the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States or SEALC unites 33 nations aiming to foster regional cooperation and assert independence from traditional Western powers particularly the United States On May 13th Chinese President Xiinping hosted key Latin American leaders in Beijing And after the summit he highlighted shared values while seemingly taking a jab at the US There are no winners in trade wars Bullying and tyranny will only isolate oneself China and Latin America and Caribbean countries are important members of the global south Independence and self-reliance are our glorious traditions Development and revitalization are our natural rights Fairness and justice are our common pursuits Back in 2013 the US was South America's largest trading partner with $280 billion in total goods trade By 2023 that had dropped 25% Meanwhile China's trade surged 43% reaching $34 billion and overtaking the US in most of the region While US attention has been focused on Mexican car imports the fentinil crisis and Chinese companies managing the Panama Canal China has steadily strengthened its ties across Latin America Peru is constructing a massive new superport backed by Chinese investment aimed at boosting exports and regional trade capacity China is also helping Bolivia build one of the continent's largest steel plants a cornerstone of industrial modernization and economic growth Brazil's president Luis Inasio Lula de Silva captured a shared sentiment in the region In recent months the world has become more unpredictable more unstable and more fragmented China and Brazil are determined to unite their voices against unilateralism and protectionism China is also easing travel barriers extending visa waiverss to citizens of Brazil Argentina Chile Peru and Uruguay A move designed to deepen ties beyond trade To further facilitate crossber travel China decided to include more countries in its visa waver program and extend the visa-free policy China's belt and road investments in the region span energy transport and industry fueling economic development but also raising questions about debt dependence and sovereignty In Washington Beijing's expanding influence is viewed wearily The US warns that Chinese loans could trap countries in debt and threaten their political independence Latin American leaders face a difficult balancing act embracing China's economic opportunities while navigating geopolitical rivalry and protecting national autonomy And as the region stands at a crossroads the challenge will be managing these new relationships without losing control of their future So can Latin America find that balance and will the US change course if it senses Beijing encroaching on its own proverbial backyard well joining me now to debate that and more are from Boston author of the non-aligned world striking out in an era of great power competition Chile's former ambassador to China Horge Kane From Beijing China commentator Jao Ying And from Santiago Chile associate professor at Ponteicio Catholica de Chile Santiago Mingo Thanks all so much for being with me Horge I'll start with you and have you paint kind of a general picture for us as to you know what this new dynamic means to Latin Americans Uh you know 20 years ago I think it would have been unthinkable that the US could be surpassed by China in trade but here we are So is it good for Latin America or are there you know economies now at the mercy kind of of a different superpower as as a cynic might say well let me put it this way It's important to keep in mind that China's presence in Latin America uh today marks a major shift perhaps one of the most important shifts in um the region's history over 200 years Why because for say the first 180 years of Latin American independence most relations diplomatic financial trade investment relations were with basically two other poles one the United States the other Europe So suddenly in this century China has come into the scene To give you only one number trade between China and Latin America in the year 2000 was around 12 billion Last year it was $516 billion So a 40 time increase in you know a little over 20 years What does that mean that for South America today the number one trading partner is no longer the US It's no longer Europe it is China That marks a very important difference So and as a rule it is better to have more partners rather than fewer ones So I would say that all in all big picture it's a good thing to have China in the region Okay Let me ask Santiago then from the Latin American perspective are Latin Americans themselves excited about this or again you know there's there's a reputation true or false that sometimes they can get caught in a Chinese debt trap as was said about Africa Now many people will say that is absolutely not true But what is the perspective from where you are yeah So this is very interesting because historically it has been very important to be close to to your partners in terms of distance right but now with globalization and global value change and commerce technology it is possible to have a superpower that is farther away and Latin America is very excited because now it has another another country uh that is investing strategically strategically in the region it's supporting businesses here So it's kind of a different dynamic and there's no we don't have this history or long history with China as with the US So that has helped because the US it it has sort of a the people here a view of an extractive history extractive natural resources So but with China is different Yeah Also China's you know foreign policy in general is that of non-inference While historically especially in Chile um the United States was seen as not just interfering but actively backing uh what many people define as a very dangerous tragic dictatorship So is this really welcome particularly where you are in Chile well I think as I was saying it's it's a very different situation right now the the relationship with China has not turned political as I see it right now but the region must take advantage of this in a smart way because we don't want to have some countries align with the US other countries align with China I think as a region we would be losing an opportunity uh because right now there's I mean if this turns political might might become a not as good as as we think right and I mean Xiao Ying you are aware that there are divisions in Latin America and I think most worrying about especially the US reaction to China becoming Latin America's biggest trade partner is when defense secretary Pete Hegsth said um Chinese activity in the region is is all about gaining a military advantage and an unfair economic gain So is is that what China is is really after in Latin America are there true strategic cynical interests to work against the United States well of course I I mean I do not think so I think when President Xi talks about a community of shared future for mankind the United States is definitely an important part of that vision And I think it's all about perspectives because the issue is that while China views Latin America as a region full of opportunities um the US government tend to view it as a region of um a source of illegal immigration of of um drug trafficking or transnational crimes Um but I mean you know the Trump administration one of his top priority is to send those migrants back to Latin America But let's be honest no one would you know leave their home and risk such long journey to become an illegal immigrant just to make a living in a different country What people really need is is jobs and hope at home And that is exactly what China is doing there Uh for instance under the belt and road initiative um China has been working with Latin American countries on over 200 infrastructure projects that created over 1 million jobs in the region and that also helped with the economic development in the region which will help resolve the root causes of illegal immigration So I think in this sense um China can actually help solve some of the very issues that the US is concerned about So I think uh the United States should really give up its Monroe doctrine that sees the region as its backyard or as its own sphere of influence But I mean the the region does not have to be a battleground for big power rivalry but instead it can be a platform where China and the US can cooperate It could be Yeah But let me ask the ambassador because what Jiao was alluding to there is is another issue as well You know we now are going to look at potentially millions of migrants having to return to their home countries where some economies are struggling So how much will Latin America have to adjust those economies not just to accommodate uh the returns but also to adapt to a real loss of remittances uh into their economy adding to their GDP and can can China help with that well absolutely And that is a that is a real problem because let us recall that the region in 2020 had its biggest economic downturn in 120 years on you know the year of the of the pandemic It was also the region that was hit the worst in the world by the pandemic in terms of the number of fatalities per capita and the region is not yet fully come out of that crisis It is still very much in a low growth mode So if you add to that the mass deportations of you know hundreds of thousands of people perhaps millions you can imagine what that would do uh to the region So the region must adapt to that and in that context I would say that yes trade and investment from China can make a very significant difference And here I would like to underline what President Lula and President Boric have said They when president Boris recently visited uh Brazil they made a joint statement saying we don't want to have to choose between China and the United States we want to do trade we want to do business with both countries and that is what we argue you know and with my colleagues in in this new book uh the non-aligned world we say Latin America must stand for active non-alignment you don't have to choose you can choose on and and that's that is ideal But the problem is when we talk about Latin America striking a balance they are going to have to take into consideration I'll call them US sensitivities here because there are murmurings in the United States that the US should feel threatened by China's presence in Latin America Somewhat similar to the cold war dynamics with the Soviet Union present in Latin America So how is lat how are Latin American leaders going to face that should they have to no No First of all this is very straightforward Uh the United States must offer concrete incentives must offer concrete you know carrots if you will to work with Latin America This cannot work simply on the basis of sticks and and and threats You know Latin America countries are independent nations They have their own sovereignty and they make their own decisions And therefore what we would like to see is a competition in fact that if Latin America wants to build a port or wants to build railways or wants investment in various projects that US firms put out tenders participate in bids much as the Chinese do Uh what is happening now is that basically the United States is putting out threats but it's not putting any sort of material incentives for Latin American countries to choose with them and that it seems to me is the wrong approach and it is not working right and Santiago among those threats are you know of course US tariffs which are hurting the US relationship with Latin America They're not providing those concrete incentives that the ambassador was talking about I mean are they inadvertently pushing Latin America toward China and benefiting the China Latin America relationship that the US feels threatened by yeah So it's that's exactly one of the problems that we are having these high tariffs You know many Latin American countries are struggling economically and many of them also depend on trade Okay So if the US is is is putting these high tariffs we have to we we still need to grow economically and we have China uh to replace some of that trade and we can strengthen the relationship with China to some in some ways address this problem this trade problem with the US if they start increasing and increasing tariffs and mixed with this immigration h immigration sending immigrants back We are already also having a problems with immigration here in the region So if we see the US as as a country that is exacerbating our problems of course you start looking to other regions like Asia China and even Europe to strengthen those relationship So uh what we want here and I agree with the with the ambassador is that we want a cooperation with the US and the US should take a stand of implementing measures that will help to develop the region economically Okay Do you think their America first policy though will let them do that especially when the United States right now is absolutely insistent on bringing jobs and manufacturing to the United States and taking it away from China and Latin America Yeah So that that's exactly the problem that we have right now It's I mean but one thing that that we need to consider is that we have a lot of natural resources in the region right we have lithium rare earth mining agriculture water Okay So there are many many resources that the the US will still depend on and also China and other countries Uh so so in some ways it's it's a moment to uh to the region should come together It has been historically a very fragmented region So the region should come together and and have some kind of strategy to handle that the position that that the US administration is taking and start developing some cooperations and in some ways China the the strengthening of the relationship with China helps in some ways to to try to push for a better relationship with the US Okay I mean Xiaoying is is China somewhat you know ironically benefiting because they're obviously a victim in many ways of this aggressive US tariff policy But at the same time because those tariffs are being pretty much placed on everyone outside of the United States China can actually benefit from that by by moving in and investing further in markets outside of the US Those tariffs give China an advantage in Latin America do they not well I mean the the tariffs is obviously a wakeup call for many countries that they need to diversify their economic ties and you know uphold uh multilateralism so that they can be more resilient in the face of such kind of external pressure uh but I mean China and Latin America share some more I mean the common interests and and strategic interests there that have long been there that goes beyond uh the US factor and I think I want to add a little bit to your previous question about this uh this strategic balance uh by Latin American countries that are caught in between this so-called big power rivalry I mean of course it is not difficult to strike that balance but I think that's obviously what um a lot of Latin American countries are looking for Uh for instance if you hear from um Brazilian president Lulu Silva uh he said at the China Select Forum last week that uh the the fate of Latin America does not rely on anyone else It does not rely on China It does not rely on the US or Europe It relies solely and simply on whether we want to be great or continue to be small And I think no country can really be great by just being a subordinate of a superpower So I mean they need to seek strategic independence And this is obviously not easy But I mean the only way they can achieve this especially for countries of the global south is by working together with other developing countries to build a more you know equitable uh world order a more democratic global governance system in which they can have greater agency over their own economic and foreign policies I think that is something that both China and Latin American countries are looking for and this is what fundamentally uh brings together China and Latin America Okay Well let me ask you Can I add something to that oh yeah Go ahead Yes No And what is important here is to look at the sort of more long-term complimentarities between China and particularly South America China has 19% of the world's population but only 7% of the world's freshwater reserves and only 7% of the world's Arab land What does that mean it means that China is unable to feed itself from its own agricultural production On in South America on the contrary we have about 25% of the world's freshwater reserves We have enormous amount of land It is basically you know an underpopulated region Some of the best land of the in the world is in Argentina the Pampa So what I'm saying is that South America can very well feed China in so many ways and already about a quarter of all agricultural imports from the rest of the world in China come from South America basically four countries in the southern cone So these are you know long-term complimentarities that are very important to keep in mind beyond you know today's you know great power rivalries and it's important to keep that in mind But the Latin America is also up against you know AOAN countries as well as African countries that are trying to uh fit into those markets as well But but very quickly can I add to that okay go ahead Yeah very quickly add to that So there's a risk also with that strategy of of sending resources and basing the the relationship with China only by sending resources Okay So we want to have also technological development here in the region and we don't want to turn this relationship with other countries into an extractive view of resources because we will go back to kind of the logic that we have had with the US Right so we would love to see chi Chinese companies and and the Chinese government pushing for the development of technology and resources that turn into actual products and not only exporting exporting and that is Santiago what everybody wants The problem is China is a massive producer and other countries have seen to be fair China providing a lot of cheap goods that other countries cannot compete with and in countries like Latin America where manufacturing jobs could provide so much income for impoverished communities in particular are how confident are you that that kind of paradigm can change with Latin America and China's relationship well it's difficult It's difficult but I but I think that that's one point where the US could have an advantage The US could help to develop these technology value added products and not only base the relationship on standing raw materials Okay So that's that's key with the with the pandemic We know that we want to have global value chains that are closer to the to the superpowers and it's an opportunity for the US to start developing the region and helping to develop technology and industrial development to kind of diversify their own their own trade networks because they have based their trade networks on the U on the on Asia basically during the last let me just get Joe Joe Ying's perspective then on on what China really does foresee as per sharing the economic benefit in this relationship and making it beyond extractive because China wants to keep its manufacturing uh not leaving so much space for those more impoverished communities in Latin America to get the kinds of jobs that they would have the skills for Yeah I mean I I I totally agree with with my colleague that at the current stage Latin America largely imports these uh manufactured products and high-tech products and then export its raw materials Uh but this is due to the region's historical role uh in global trade Uh because just as the Eurogran writer uh Edardo Galliano described this is a region of open veins It has uh its its natural wealth have fueled the prosperity of Europe and the United States while the region itself has remained in poverty and underdevelopment and it has been locked in this low value um you know role but I mean China actually wants to help the region change this situation So we see that in recent years apart from the infrastructure projects uh China is aligning its um investment and and and projects in the region with uh the regional development goals and also there are expanding cooperation in emerging areas like 5G artificial intelligence renewable energy and uh electric vehicles etc And also there are educational programs So I think obviously China wants to help Latin American countries uh climb up this this value chain and also I think Lula uh mentioned this this this digital gap and and China is uh t in talks with Brazil to to launch the satellites low orbit satellites that may help uh people in remote areas of Brazil to get access to the internet So I mean China view Latin America as a equal trade partner instead of um the traditional role as a backyard Yeah we'll see how that develops Jaoying that will have to be the final word for this edition of the newsmakers Very unfortunately we're out of time for for this episode but I'd like to thank all three of my panelists so much for being with us

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] hi there internet i'm john oliver uh we are off this week but i wanted to quickly check back in to talk to you about a subject that is near and dear to my heart and that is rocks that's right rocks so congratulations whoever just completed their last week tonight topic bingo cards but but i'm not going to be talking to you about just any rocks i'm going to be talking about specific rocks although not straight away because for reasons that will become clear i'm going to need to lay some significant groundwork we really have to ramp up to this one so before i talk to you about specific rocks i'm first going to talk to you about furries and before i talk about furries i need to talk to you about the georgia republican gubernatorial primary remember the rest of my staff is on vacation right now my family went to an island i think and i'm here so we are all where we're supposed to be now if you know anything about the georgia primary it's probably the front runners involved incumbent brian kemp and challenger david perdue but this piece isn't about them to be honest i don't even have time to point out which is which they're both old white republican men who look a lot like that meme of two spider-men pointing at each other instead i want to talk about a third candidate in the election candice taylor she was also running in the republican primary although polling far behind kemp and perdue at around just four percent so she had a real uphill battle on her hands which may be why she came out swinging in this debate appearance donald trump won he won we have a fraudulent pedophile in the white house i'm going to put the constitution first and i'm going to put jesus first every single time and we're going to fix our schools we're going to get rid of this anti-white racism and we're going to get rid of kindergarten teachers men with beards and lipstick and high heels teaching our children we're going to get back to being moral in georgia now obviously there is a lot of offensive on display there from the baseless accusations of voter fraud to naked racial grievances to anti-trans panic too and this is the big one how she spells candice because that is simply incorrect that looks like how a cartoon snake would pronounce the word candies but was that fiery debate performance enough to win her the primary probably not since it was this past tuesday and she lost it um at least i'm assuming that she lost it we take these ahead of time so there is a small possibility that she won but honestly if she did we'll have deleted this video anyway and pretended it never happened so if you're watching this right now that means candice taylor definitely lost and one of these two guys who shared many of her terrible views but in a more media savvy package they won instead and if you're thinking john if you're thinking john why on earth john are you devoting one of your precious few web exclusives which many consider to be a far superior product to the dreck you put on television why are you wasting this yammering on about a barely scene also ran in a primary that just ended i would respond hey hey you don't have to be here why are you watching this to which you might respond because you promised me rocks goddammit where are my rocks and we will get there we will get there i promise but first a little more about candice taylor this was her campaign bus and look you can put whatever you want on a bus like jungkook from bts or this big snake or this although ideally never that but my point is candace's bus made some weird choices i don't know whether it's the i'm the one you've been waiting for with one emphasise for no clear reason or the mixture of cursive and stencil fonts usually reserved for epsy signs like together is my favorite place to be or home is where the wine is waiting or the fact she listed her three campaign priorities as jesus guns babies it is the sort of brain dead knee-jerk culture war buzzword platform that you would expect to appeal solely to mike lindell and guess what you'd be absolutely right because she once tweeted mike lindell understands our movement for jesus guns and babies but for whatever reason the handshake of a deranged pillow baron didn't do much for her numbers and candice seemingly spent the final months of her campaign how any republican who desperately wants attention would and that is by frantically seeking out culture war issues that would give her campaign traction and people do like to see a fighter don't they which is presumably why she posted this campaign video the governor's race in georgia has four establishment politicians and then there's candace taylor and i'm one of you that's the whole clip we didn't edit that down that is the complete video that she posted along with a tweet that said that's it that's the tweet and yeah candice i guess i guess i guess agree to agree on that one i suppose also not for nothing that is the least convincing portrayal of a boxer that i have ever seen and i have seen ed sheeran's shape of you video he looks like ron weasley failing a zumba class now for a while for a while it seemed like candace's chosen enemy would be the manufactured panic the public schools have been formally accommodating the needs of furries which brings me as promised to furries if you are not aware earlier this year a bunch of conservatives fell for some very weird online rumors about what was happening in schools and i will let nebraska state senator bruce bostelman explain i'm a little shocked i guess is what i would put it it's called something called furries we don't know what furries are it's where school children dress up as animals cats or dogs during the school day meow and they bark and now schools are wanting to put litter boxes in the schools for these children to use how is this sanitary [Applause] i mean none of that happened bruce [Applause] first and this is the least of the problems here dogs don't in litter boxes but also neither do furries that is not what furries do what they do do is they use regular toilets where elaborate fursuits and many offer art commissions where you can get yourself done up as a sexy river otter at very reasonable prices they are harmless but candice taylor an adult seeking office remember actually ran on this anti-furry issue issuing 10 proposed executive orders one of which instructed no fury related items will be worn in schools also tweeting the furry days are over when i'm governor which is just an all-time thing to tweet honestly it's an all-time thing to say just try it walk into any room and announce the furry days are over when i'm governor do it right now and see if you don't feel an electric rush of power don't explain yourself why should you after all you're the governor and furry days are over and the replies to that tweet are exactly the sort of response that you would hope for and expect from the furry community one person said if schools are for academics not fairy tales then how come people still teach supply side economics to which i say roasted well several others simply posted furry cartoon asses and if you absolutely had to reduce the furry presence online right down to his bones critiques of conservative economic theory and fuzzy butt shots really are the guiding principles of the whole movement anyway i mentioned candice taylor's ten executive orders she initially only released nine of them and made it clear that number 10 was going to be a major drop even spending days hyping it up online saying evil cannot be negotiated with and must be crushed eo number 10 is going to shake the nation stay tuned which yeah you're right it does sound pretty major doesn't it and you know what when number 10 finally dropped it turned out candice was right the new world order is here and they told us it was coming it's a battle far greater than what we see in the natural it is a war between good and evil [Music] yeah candice isn't around she tweeted that alongside i am the only candidate willing to stand up to the satanic cabal the georgia guidestones must be demolished that was the closing argument of her campaign raising the obvious question hey candace taylor what the are you talking about and at this point it is finally time to talk about rocks and not just rocks remember specific rocks and specifically the georgia guide stones because it turns out they are a roadside attraction in alberts county georgia and taylor is actually not the only one with a sense of animosity towards them the guidestones are the centerpiece of a lot of online conspiracy theories which kind of makes sense they were erected centuries ago by ancient druids except they weren't they were put up in 1980 and the man who commissioned them did so under a pseudonym there are also a functioning astronomical calendar and some think they have paranormal properties like this guy when you take pictures of it [Applause] when you put your head down in there like this and look through it the ball of energy comes through that sucker man i try to get up here three to five times a week you know what i for one believe him not about the blue orb that is ridiculous what i believe about is the scheduling i fully believe that some days that man thinks to himself oh no i've only been up to see the ball of energy twice this week i'm gonna have to move some stuff around the stones also feature massive engravings that have been the subject of a lot of investigation as you can see on this episode of the history channels decoded looks like there's a bunch of different languages i just googled this and we've got english spanish swahili hindi hebrew arabic chinese and russian it seems like to me it seems like a weird new 10 commandments is it 10 [Music] 10 that's weird yeah good catch is it is it a good catch is that the weirdest thing about the 20-foot stonehenge outside of atlanta the number 10 also to television editors everywhere next time you're sitting in the edit bay watching footage of a middle-aged man slowly count to ten don't put it to dramatic music you can just edit it out people will honestly thank you in fact here are 10 reasons why you should do that what but they are right in that the stones feature weird aspirational instructions mostly vague catch-all edicts like protect people and nations with fair laws and balance personal rights with social duties and guide reproduction wisely improving fitness and diversity you know some broad feel good precepts mixed in with some light to medium eugenics but but the line that the controversy focuses on reads maintain humanity under 500 million in perpetual balance with nature and i will say at this point you could see how anyone who believes in say a satanist new world order cabal might see that as a bit of a red flag and as long as these stones have been around which is again since 1980 people have been scared shitless by them some believed they were a satanic altar while in 2014 conspiracy theorists cited the guidestones as proof that the ebola outbreak would kill off much of humanity and in 2018 marjorie taylor green oh yeah she is involved here too i mean how would she not be she endorsed the idea that the guidestones revealed a world genocide plot and after hearing a bunch of theories that dumb instinctively i am tempted to defend the guidestones and point out that a far more common interpretation is that they are directions for rebuilding civilization after an apocalypse which would make some sense given that they were built at the height of the cold war and the client who went by the alias robert christian by the way had told the builder he wanted it to be capable of withstanding the most catastrophic events i could also point out the ridiculousness of thinking that some sort of global illuminati wrote down their plot for killing off 95 percent of humanity on a giant granite post-it note and left their secret plan somewhere no conservative would ever find it rural georgia i am tempted to say all of that but here is where this piece gets a little weird that's right at this point not with the snake boss not with that thing that you had to look at earlier and are having to look at again now this right here is the weird part because while researching this piece as far as we knew no one had ever definitively uncovered who was responsible for the guide stones none of the reporting that we looked at ever dug that deep and it was only after we wrote everything that you've seen up to this point right now that we discovered this kind of shitty 2015 documentary from a born-again christian filmmaker who decided to investigate the guide stones in it the producers tricked the one man who knows robert christian's real identity and who had promised never to reveal it into allowing them to open this case containing their correspondence on camera and in doing so seemingly revealed that the guidestones were ordered by a man named a man named dr herbert kirsten and if that documentary is right and kirsten is the man behind the guide stones that is pretty troubling because he was a doctor from fort dodge iowa with multiple interests conservation certainly population control absolutely but he also wrote at least two letters in newspapers praising david duke yeah that's david duke the clan leader and neo-nazi arguing among other things that duke voices many beliefs held by reasonable americans it is unfortunate that more acceptable public figures are not pushing similar views which is the sort of thing that makes a line like guide reproduction wisely hit a little bit different now doesn't it so unfortunately this web extra which was supposed to be a light piece about this silly southern fried stonehenge suddenly got much less fun which is very disappointing i mean what other roadside attractions are harboring dark past how many mini golf dinosaurs are secretly race zealots who rolled up this giant ball of twine hitler it doesn't bear thinking about and i know that you like me may be blindsided by this revelation although i'm also willing to bet that others saw this coming the very moment i said a monument in georgia i mean this is a state that carved confederate generals into the side of a mountain it's not like white supremacist stonework is light on the ground there but in the end i guess what this really means is that reluctantly i do have to hand it to candice taylor in a way not to her policies which are terrible or her platform which is incoherent or her campaign ads as which are ridiculous or her bus which is very bad or her position on furries which is extremely funny or her ability to spell her own name which again is just objectively wrong that's not how you spell that but i will admit that when it comes to the georgia guidestones she may have been partially right albeit for completely wrong reasons when she suggested that they were a problem which is totally heartbreaking because if there's one thing that should bring our country together is a good mysterious roadside attraction so if you live in georgia or anywhere and you have a few hundred tons of granite lying about why not build your own functioning astronomical clock one that doesn't reference eugenics put your own mysterious rules on it like i don't know the furry days are over when i'm governor that's a good one i promise you if you build it they will come i know at least one guy who will come three to five

          <attvalue for="7" value="taxes essentially the government's GoFundMe page now today is April 15th which means you have just 45 minutes to file your taxes except relax don't panic because thanks to the weekend and a holiday the deadline is actually April 17th this year except don't relax do panic that's still not enough time to do it right you're you're absolutely and you're going to jail Anthony many people are perplexed and mystified by our tax system perhaps best exemplified by this Instagram video from cardi B you know that government is taking 40 percent of my taxes and Uncle Sam I want to know what you're doing with my tax money but why does y'all doing with my money what is your with my money I want to know I want receipts I wants everything I wanna go to my cousin weenie [Applause] whoa whoa cardi if you really want to know where your money's going may I present to you the recently passed omnibus spending package [Applause] because it turns out cardi your money goes to your military your health care and your Social Security and veteran and unemployment benefits everything else is just on discretionary and of course interest now as you may recall late last year Republicans passed and Donald Trump signed a tax reform bill and in selling it Trump made some clear promises about who stood to benefit our focus is on helping the folks who work in the mail rooms and the machine shops of America the plumbers the carpenters the cops the teachers the truck drivers the pipe fitters the people that like me best well that that is clearly nonsense because if this bill were really helping the people that like Donald Trump best it would exclusively benefit Eric Trump Roseanne Barr and anyone who's ever looked both ways before whispering it was the choose and the truth is for all chumps talk of pipe fitters the biggest tax rate cuts by far actually goes to businesses with the top federal corporate tax rate the tax on a company's profits going from thirty five percent to just twenty one percent and to be fair many policymakers on both sides had argued at the 35 percent federal rate among the highest in the world should actually come down but to be even fairer most companies didn't pay thirty five percent in fact before the bill was signed to the effective rate the amount companies actually paid was closer to twenty four percent and some large companies have historically paid far less than that you may remember a few years ago people were furious about this ge had profits of fourteen point two billion dollars in 2010 five billion dollars of that made in the United States but the company's expected US tax bill a grand total of zero dollars okay so when the total is zero you can't call it a grand total there is literally no total less grand except maybe total cereal and that's just because it tastes like your spoon somehow missed the cereal and now you're just eating the box that it came in and GE may well say we'll hold on that's just one year but a recent study found that between 2008 and 2015 18 large profitable companies including General Electric paid no federal income tax at all over the entire period not at all and that is a staggering total which is incidentally what they used to call total with raisins until they got more honest who changed it to total with raises but who gives a so tonight in honor of upcoming tax day we thought we'd give you just a glimpse of the lengths that companies will go to to legally avoid taxes both here and abroad now corporate tax avoidance has a long and infuriatingly proud history in the 1980s for instance a lawyer named John Carroll jr. came up with a tactic to move US companies offshore to avoid taxes and his firm celebrated him with and this is true a 13-minute operator staged in his New York apartment and I'll give you just a very small taste [Music] Wow we may have just found the only musical resistant to race blind casting you can't go Hamilton on this one because those people really have to be white now now that the tax dodge being celebrated they're involved taking an American company and headquarter in it in Panama where taxes were lower something its creator called the Panama scoot which sounds like the name of a tiny elf in a cowboy hat my name's Panama scoot and I sleep in your boots and offshore scooting is actually something of a common theme in corporate tax avoidance for decades companies have hunted for ways to get their money to friendlier tax havens like the Cayman Islands you may remember that during the 2012 election it emerged that Mitt Romney had money in the in companies in the Caymans which led to this magnificent clip of John Stossel saying the one thing he probably shouldn't be saying to the person he's speaking to but Romney pays taxes and all the money earned from the cayman entities i would think it would be like pirate heaven some pirates can't say the word pirates to a guy with an eyepatch it can't it's not fair it's like me sitting down across from you and calling you bootleg Geraldo yes yes it's obvious but it's also lazy and hurtful that's an indoor thought and tax havens have become magnets to corporations who try and shift as much of their profits there as possible it's a major reason why in 2016 nearly two-thirds of the profits made by American multinationals outside the US were booked in just six low or zero tax countries and it's a lot easier to move profits offshore than you might think an increasingly popular way particularly pharmaceutical and high-tech companies like Google avoid paying the 35% is to shift their patents computer code pill formulas even logos from their US bases to their outposts in low tax countries today a company can move automatically all of its assets just on paper you can push a button and move your algorithms you know could take the recipe out of the vault yeah put it in a Swiss Fault and then and then it's Swiss yep coke could put that recipe in a Swiss vault and their profits would move offshore that is very roughly how it works although for the record just being in a Swiss vault doesn't automatically make something Swiss that's why we don't call this Swiss gold we call it Nazi gold those are Hitler bucks your Swiss and this this happens all the time and the best innovators in weasely accounting have arguably been tech companies look at Apple for years they've been deferring paying US taxes on foreign profits by stashing the money overseas and not bringing it back so much so that at the end of last year they had 269 billion dollars parked overseas and when their CEO Tim Cook appeared in front of Congress a few years back he was very defensive about that we pay all the taxes we owe every single dollar we don't move intellectual property offshore and use it to sell our products back to the United States to avoid taxes we don't stash money on some Caribbean island now he was technically correct there because Apple didn't stash their money on a Caribbean island they did however have it stashed on this island Ireland which is it is true not in the Caribbean so one word made a lot of difference there it's like if somebody said the one thing I can promise you is that this refrigerator is absolutely not full of severed Caribbean heads maybe that is technically true but I'm still going to pass on a sparkling water and when Ireland indicated that it planned to change its tax laws Apple found a new shelter for profits on this island the Isle of Jersey a tax haven in the English Channel which is again not technically in the Caribbean although when you really look at it you could almost mistake it for the Caribbean if you squint a little drink 9 points of beer and hold a picture of the Caribbean in front of us meanwhile Google used a slightly different tax workaround sending its money on something of a world tour Google license some of the intellectual property it created here in the US to a subsidiary in Ireland but it turns out Google's overseas profits don't even get taxed there because Google then reportedly funnels those profits through the Netherlands and then to of all places Bermuda where the corporate tax rate is zero now that tax trick actually has a name it's called the double Irish with a dutch sandwich it sounds like a disgusting sex act or an even more disgusting Waffle House menu item it's it's when someone opens up a baked potato farce in it and closes it again really quick that's one of it that that's that is exactly what it is and when Google CFO was asked about their tax policies at a conference his answer nearly got him laughed off the stage we pay our taxes in every jurisdiction to the full extent that the law allows us and that's what we do we pay every penny of tax we owe to everybody everywhere ok the reaction to the sentence I pay all my taxes should never be incredulous laughter unless you are a very wealthy dog who's just spoken for the first time and here is where I have some good news and some bad news the good news is that Trump's tax bill actually forces companies to pay taxes on all the money they've stashed overseas the hope is that they'll then bring it home in something called repatriation the bad news is the tax they're being forced to pay which may have once been 35% remember has been slashed to as little as eight to 15% which seems less like a punishment and a lot more like actively rewarding companies for tax avoidance but Steve minuchin Treasury secretary an objectively good-looking man argues that this would be a huge benefit to America's workers we will have a one-time tax on overseas profits which will bring back trillions of dollars that are offshore to be invested here in the United States to purchase capital and to create jobs now I know it was hard to pay attention to what he was saying because you were just automatically undressing to go with your eyes and you do it whenever he opens his mouth I'm all right I'm definitely right the guy's a California ten he's a smoke show but but what he's saying there is giving these companies a break on the taxes they owe is worth it because it will lead to job creation and that is hard to completely disprove because anything theoretically could lead to jobs you can say I'm dipping this badger in fudge to create jobs and I can't prove that you won't create any jobs by doing that but I would argue that if creating jobs is your main goal there are probably better ways to do it now luckily we actually have the benefit of a test case here because in 2004 we basically did the exact same thing under the American Jobs Creation Act it offered a one-year tax holiday where companies could bring back overseas profits and just a five percent tax rates the idea was that they would then create jobs but when the Senate looked at the employment numbers of the 15 companies that brought back the most money this is what they found these are the average numbers of US jobs at those companies over a five year span here is where the big supposedly job-creating tax holiday kicked in and that is pretty underwhelming I would argue that's the most useless ineffective holiday since Arbor Day and I'm sorry Arbor Day but your secretaries day for trees and we all need to accept that in fact instead of hiring workers across the board companies mostly rewarded their shareholders using 94 cents out of every dollar they brought home on stock buybacks and dividends something you can read about in the best-selling book yeah no they did that by acclaimed author everyone who knows anything about corporations and look for many of those companies that may have been the best use of their money there is no point in hiring people that you don't need but the Trump administration is fiercely insisting that this time their tax holiday is already creating jobs and some companies have seemed happy to pay along play-along Apple put out a press release not long after the tax bill was signed titled Apple accelerates US investment and job creation bragging they were about to create over 20,000 new jobs and Trump was quick to take credit President Trump tweeting in response quote I promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring mass of amounts of money back to the United States great to see Apple follow through as a result of tax cuts all caps okay first that is a solid read from Jake Tapper there in fact I think all anchors should be forced to shout whenever Trump uses all caps in tweets I'll show you this morning the president announced that he was quote heading to see the border wall prototypes in California or today today the president wished all Americans are happy Easter but but for all the Trump's excitement those 20,000 Apple jobs were probably going to happen anyway given that the hole was entirely consistent with what Apple was doing in the United States before the tax cut bill passed and Tim Cook knows this this is how he responded when asked just how much of his hiring spree was down to Trump's new tax plan there are large parts of this that a result of the tax reform and there's large parts of this that we would have done in in any situation and so I haven't spent a lot of time in categorizing those two because to me this is about America it's not about which bucket you put things in yeah but actually it does matter which bucket you put things in because I would rather put things in a bucket labeled smart economic policy than one labeled put money in here I like money thanks dummies Tim Cook and look look there are legitimate debates over how and how much we should tax corporate profits but we just had a huge chance to reform our tax code and we absolutely blew it because effective tax reform is not just about lowering rates it's about closing loopholes for instance one reasonable idea raised last year was forcing companies to pay a minimum tax in every single country they operate in it's a bit complicated but that may well have reduced their abuse of tax havens but that proposal never even got out of committee so the result here is that our tax code is still full of loopholes and however much Trump talked about how tax reform would benefit cops and pipefitters it's worth knowing that once he got behind closed doors his message seemed to change we're told the president is still celebrating passage of the Republican tax cut bill sources with firsthand which tells CBS News that he told a group of wealthy people at his exclusive mar-a-lago estate quote you all just got a lot richer that's right so on Tuesday as you scrape together your taxes and like cardi B wonder what Uncle Sam is doing with your money rest assured that Donald Trump's tax reform continues to let companies engage in sophisticated tax avoidance schemes and to those companies I say this on behalf of America please enjoy this double Irish with a Dutch sandwich I made it bu myself eat it while it's hot [Applause] you" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="in the final campaign stretch Trump's focused relentlessly on immigration and it has gotten ugly they're coming from 181 countries as of yesterday right in we're a Dumping Ground we're like a we're like a garbage can for the world these are Stone Cold Killers they'll walk into your kitchen they'll cut your throat I don't know if you call them people in some cases they're not people in my opinion but I'm not allowed to say that because the radical left says that's a terrible thing to say they're destroying the blood of our country that's what they're doing they're destroying our country they don't like it when I said that and I never read mine comp they said oh Hitler said that in a much different way okay for a St immigrants aren't destroying the blood of our country if anything Mountain Dew Baja Blast is doing that then let me be the first to say I for one welcome the poison but it is wild the Trump's response to being told he's quoting Hitler is no he said it differently especially because not that differently Hitler wrote all great cultures of the past perished only because the original creative race died out from blood poisoning so same general idea just a bit more coherent I guess what I'm saying is when it comes to rhetorics Trump is no Hitler but let him cook but but it is more than just talk about immigrants Trump's also made a very specific promise as soon as I take the oath of office we will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country even larger than that of President Dwight D Eisenhower many years ago he was a big deportation person first it is a hell of a thing to be signing Eisenhower giving his program which deported hundreds of thousands of Mexican immigrants is widely seen as both a fiasco and a stain on US History while also having a name I'm literally unwilling to say on TV it is one of many facts you may not have known about Eisenhower along with he was the first president to ride in a helicopter and the first tost for an official photo like he's on the cover of Women's Health Magazine under the headline how to feel fabulous at any age Mass deportation is a Cornerstone pledge for the Trump campaign it was promoted on signs at the Republican convention and is referenced in the party's platform and it seems to have widespread backing given one survey found it has at least some support from 54% of Americans and 86% of Republicans and Trump supporters will tell you they love the idea of mass deportation even if they haven't thought much about the details those people that are breaking the laws of this country that came across here illegal are going to be Mass deported Mass deportations that's what Trump's calling for yes that's millions of people well the people that are here illegally I don't have any problem with people coming here my grandparents came here but they did it the right way about millions of people don't I don't care I think it has to happen and I think citizens have to be behind it how do you think it's possible to do that humanely I don't know that but I am confident Trump can do it are you look there are things I'm confident Trump can and will do paraphrase Hitler emotionally abuse his children eventually die on the toilet but unlike a bazzle hat here I don't think figuring out how to humanely Deport millions of people is one of them the fact is a lot of people seem to be supporting something right now whose implications they may not fully understand so given that tonight let's talk about Trump's Mass deportation plan and before we go any further we'll be talking a lot about the logistics of mass deportation but for the record the morality of it is Despicable immigrants are human beings no matter what McDonald's worst employee says with that said let's start with the sheer size of what Trump is proposing because the campaign claims there are 20 to 25 million illegal aliens in the country despite experts saying it's roughly half that with one group placing the number around 13 million people so they're already off by the population of Ohio but that still leaves the task of removing 13 million people many of whom incidentally have spread throughout the country and have lived here for decades also deporting someone isn't as simple as finding them not liking their paperwork and putting them on a plane it usually requires an arrest detention legal processing and only then removal and to carry out over 13 million arrests in a short period of time it's been estimated the government will need to HDE between 220 and 409,000 new government employees and Law Enforcement Officers as for the detention part think for a second what it would entail to detain 13 million people bear in mind the most recent data has the entire us prison and jail population at around 1.9 million and we have a lot of prisons and jails in this country they are kind of our thing if if we had a slogan it should probably be America home of jails and the KFC doubl down and the Trump Campaign Will sometimes pretend they've taken this into consideration here's JD Vance gaming out a possible approach now you've got 20 million 25 million people you have to figure out what to do with them and I guess the way that I think about it bill is you know it's kind of like being asked well you have a sandwich and it's 10 times the size of your mouth how do you actually eat the whole thing and you take it one bite at a time right and I think you start with the million most violent most criminal illegal alien elements there's probably of the 20 million there's probably a million who have committed some violent crime that's an estimate but I think it's pretty close to the truth you Deport them first and you focus on them first okay first I know this isn't the point but I didn't know Bill O'Reilly still had a show I had I had the vague uninterrogated sense that he died when Roger alses did either because I thought they were the same person or because that seemed like a plausible murder suicide I don't know the the subconscious is hard to pin down but second one bite at a time is an incredibly callous way to refer to mass deportation even before you get to his casual 1 million of them are probably violent criminals a statistic sour to that's an estimate but I think it's pretty close to the truth and for the record to deport just a million people a year would still cost an estimated 88 billion annually with the majority of that going toward building detention camps over a decade that had cost nearly a trillion dollars and to be clear here my biggest problem with we'd spend nearly a trillion on detention camps for immigrants is not the trillion dollar part I don't want to see a headline tomorrow that says John Oliver blast detention camps is too expensive but I do think it's worth recognizing the extent to which Trump and Vance are full of from a practical standpoint as well as a moral one but just for the sake of arguments let's say Mass deportation were a realistic policy it still wouldn't solve the problems the Trump campaign's claiming it would in fact it would make them worse because they're constantly claiming deportations are the solution to unemployment housing prices and crime so let's take each of those in turn starting with jobs historically deportation has actually increased unemployment in this country studying the Obama years found that when 500,000 undocumented immigrant workers were forced out of the country 44,000 fewer jobs were held by us born workers which may seem counterintuitive but what's often happened is companies that rely on immigrants for their customer base or their Workforce end up shutting down and as immigrants themselves will tell you they might be the only ones willing to do certain work the thing is if he wins he kicks out all the immigrants those who work here and construction and everything they're immigrants you're not going to see a Greeno filling his feet with cement or carrying bricks or carrying this or cleaning you're not going to see it that's blunt but it's true there are certain jobs and whole Industries reliant on immigrant labor you know our piece on Farm Workers we showed you a viral video of a farmer explaining he couldn't hire enough people to harvest his Fields so the produce was rotting now in that particular case it was asparagus so it was a minor tragedy at best but the broader Point here stands and removing 13 million people who spend money in their communities would badly hurt the economy in fact experts have said Mass deportation would lead to a loss of somewhere between 4 and 7% of annual GDP which would be a crash on par with the Great Recession and look I'm not an economist despite looking like I was left on the doorstep of an auditor's office as a baby but my understanding is that the Great Recession was bad so that's unemployment what about housing because the Trump campaign is promis Mass deportation will also fix our housing crisis this is simple supply and demand my friends we got to do two things to lower the price of housing two things to lower the price of housing for nevadans is we've got to build more houses and we've got to deport the illegal aliens so that American homes go to American citizens okay even if that wasn't total JD Vance's very existence is proof that supply and demand doesn't always work there was no demand for a business pill killed bearded sycophant that gets routinely ignored by Trump we already have two of those and we barely even use them and yet here we are with an unnecessary third the fact is many economists think large scale deportations could actually backfire and make the housing crisis worse since as you just saw pointed out undocumented migrants are a key part of the construction industry and nationally Mass deportation would remove one and a half million workers from the construction Workforce including more than one in three roofers ceiling tiers stucko Masons plasterers and drywall installers in fact one Professor who studies immigration says in the long run immigrants are the solution to the housing crisis without immigrants you can't increase the supply of Housing and for what it's worth JD Vance that is actually supply and demand in action not just some you dreamed up while between drafts your own next Memoir dinga Sonata where I'm guessing you'll solve poverty by comparing it to a turkey Ruben and finally there was the claim Mass deportation will reduce violent crime as we've discussed before for all the coverage isolated incidents get research shows immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than us born people and FBI data shows violent crime has actually gone down since 2020 it's one of the genuinely good decreases since then along with the amount of Zoom family dinners and the number of alive Henry kiss singers one was still one too many but but despite that Trump's continued making lurid accusations there were his claims of pet eating in Springfield Ohio but he's also falsely claimed Aurora Colorado is the victim of a Venezuelan gang takeover it's an accusation that originated with this viral video of men with guns knocking on an apartment door that clip frightened a lot of people but to be clear the Republican mayor of Aurora has flat out said a Venezuelan gang is not in control of those apartment complexes and the city has not been taken over or invaded or occupied by migrant gangs but none of that stopped Trump from going to Aurora to push for Mass deportation with the help of Steven Miller who even brought along some visual aids look at all these photos around me are these the kids you grew up with are these the neighbors you were raised with are these the neighbors that you want in your city no these are the criminal migrants that Kay Harris brought into your community and as swiftly as they came Donald Trump will send them back okay for the record if we're talking about someone you don't want as your neighbor Steven Miller would be top of my list imagine getting up in the morning looking across your yard and seeing that guy standing there looking like a Minion's penis also quick side side note if you're wondering what this thing is it's a fair question and that's a trumpy bear a stuffed bear with Trump's hair a tie and disturbingly human eyes it looks like Paddon bear if he had multiple hemorrhoids it looks like a Care Bear that won't stop calling the other Care Bears gay but don't let don't let that bear distract you from the fact you just saw a crowd baited into booing pictures of Hispanic people who don't look like your neighbors at that event Trump announced plans for something he calls operation Aurora and his campaign has since described the city as a war zone and that specific language points to what his real end game here might look like because while again Trump can't Deport 13 million or even 1 million people overnight and mass deportation won't fix any of the problems he says it will he could still use Aurora style panics to give himself a ton of power here he is at that rally gaming out a key piece of it I will invoke the alien enemies Act of 1798 think of that 1798 this was put there 17 1990 that's a long time ago right to Target and dismantle every migrant criminal Network operating on American soil okay 1798 is a long time ago I reluctantly concede that point but the ACT he's describing there is terrifying it's a law that allows for summary deportation of people from countries with which the United States is at war that have invaded the us or that have engaged in predatory incursions it was last used during World War II as the legal Authority for interning immigrants of Japanese German and Italian descent and experts are concerned that a president like Trump could recognize a cartel as the deao government of Mexican territory then proclaim a migrant Invasion perpetrated by the cartel government and in doing so give himself a turbocharge deportation Authority that way he could quickly remove non-citizens even green card holders without any due process and what they'd be legal challenges the courts are now much more Trump friendly than they were 8 years ago and even if Trump doesn't choose to go that far or does get stopped by the courts it's worth remembering what he was able to do in his first term anyway because in addition to the endless circus of outrageous nonsense back then like hosting a fast food banquet or staring directly into the Sun or doing loud Hong Kong in a big vom vom he also aggressively ramped up immigration enforcement using large scale work site raids which involved immigration agents storming workplaces that's what happened in 2019 when ice carried out massive raids on chicken processing plants across central Mississippi arresting 680 workers in what may have been the largest ever workplace operation in any single state and these weren't sweeps for violent criminals they were attacks on working people whose only offense was being undocumented more than 350 were deported and many others are still awaiting Court decisions many of the families broken up that day remained separated half a decade later and the trauma of those raids on families and children was truly awful and I will warn you this is hard to watch cry CU I'm mom myad no the Hispanic people not doing nothing B they're not steing nothing my D everything for me to live over here the and I don't know what I'm going to eat and I'm so right now I need my dad me my dad didn't did nothing he's not a criminal yeah we did that and we're apparently a coin flip away from going even further and a lot of trump supporters seem to be in denial about exactly what a plan of mass deportation would entail and that's a frustrating pattern here in Trump's first term this local business owner in Indiana was deported to the apparent shock of the people in his community it just feels wrong the community is better for having someone like him I mean he showed up here with just the shirt on his back and he's a restaurant owner 20 years later I mean that's and he worked his butt off to get there I've seen it they're all strong supporters of Roberto barain though four out of six of them voted for President Trump I voted for him because he said he was going to get rid of the bad the bad ombres rerto is a good ombre well a couple of things about that first if showing up with a shirt on your back and working hard for 20 years makes someone a good good ombre I've got some news for you about a whole lot of immigrants but also how do those people even begin to apologize for a situation like that I don't think Hallmark sells cards that say sorry we inadvertently got you deported because we assumed Trump would only be racist against Hispanics we didn't know personally and I really want to Hope people are waving around signs without understanding what Mass deportation actually means in practice but make no mistake the people campaigning on it absolutely do and it's horrendous so what can we do here well there's the obvious and that is vote but it's also worth talking to people in your life who are concerned about immigration about what they really want to happen here because our system definitely does need fixing but there are much more Humane ways to do that and even some Republicans seem open to that idea because well as I mentioned earlier the slogan Mass deportation pulls depressingly well a recent study showed that when people were actually given a specific choice between mass deportation and Pathways to citizenship as an immigration policy specifically outlining how each might work majorities in every swing state preferred the path to citizenship in fact even among Republicans in five of six swing States it was preferred which suggests that when people genuinely understand what these policies look like they tend to choose the less punitive one and I do believe the vast majority want to do what is right for the immigrants they know the task is to extend that same Humanity to the immigrants they don't and that is a task both parties would do well to adopt because Democrats have not been Stellar on this issue either Obama holds the record for most deportations in a single year and Biden's immigration policies as we've discussed multiple times before have been haphazard at best so I would hope a potential Harris Administration would do much better than the one she's been part of for the last four years and begin a much needed overhaul of a system badly in need of repair but to be very clear here IM s are not the ones that broke this system on the contrary they're making the most of the splined shards we've given them and continuing to build lives communities and this country into something better richer and stronger and the very least we can do for them is to go out on November the 5th and not pick a President Who demonizes their existence advocates for their suffering and has proven multiple times that he is to put it mildly a bad ombre" />

TRUMP BUDGET BILL, BUT ELON MUSK IS USING HIS LOUD SOCIAL MEDIA. VOICE TO URGE REPUBLICANS TO KILL THE BILL IN A STEADY STREAM OF ANGRY AND BITTER TWEETS, ELON MUSK BEGAN HIS WAR AGAINST DONALD TRUMP AT 1:34. &gt;&gt; P.M. YESTERDAY. SAYING IN. &gt;&gt; HIS MOST ANGUISHED. &gt;&gt; TWITTER VOICE, I JUST CAN'T. STAND IT ANYMORE. AND HE CALLED THE TRUMP BUDGET BILL. &gt;&gt; A DISGUSTING ABOMINATION. &gt;&gt; AND AS. &gt;&gt; OF TONIGHT, DONALD TRUMP REMAINS COWERING IN ABJECT, SILENT. FEAR OF ELON MUSK. THE PROOF THAT DONALD TRUMP IS TERRIFIED TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; AFTER THE RICHEST. &gt;&gt; PERSON IN THE WORLD TURNED AGAINST HIM, IS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS REMAINED ABSOLUTELY. SILENT ABOUT ELON MUSK'S ATTACKS ON THE TRUMP BUDGET BILL AND DONALD TRUMP. NOW, WHEN IS THE LAST TIME SOMEONE WITH A LOUD PUBLIC MICROPHONE CALLED DONALD TRUMP OR SOMETHING? DONALD TRUMP WAS DOING A DISGUSTING. ABOMINATION WITHOUT BEING IMMEDIATELY. ATTACKED BY DONALD TRUMP? REMEMBER, DONALD TRUMP HAS ATTACKED TAYLOR SWIFT FOR NOTHING. DONALD TRUMP ATTACKED BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN FOR SOMETHING BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN SAID AT A CONCERT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. AND DONALD TRUMP ATTACKED BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN IMMEDIATELY. DONALD TRUMP'S RULE OF LIFE, AS HE ANNOUNCED IN THE FIRST BOOK PUBLISHED IN HIS NAME, WHICH, OF COURSE WAS GHOSTWRITTEN FOR HIM, THAT WHENEVER. &gt;&gt; HE IS CRITICIZED OR. &gt;&gt; SOMETHING HE'S DOING IS CRITICIZED, HE. &gt;&gt; ALWAYS HAS TO. &gt;&gt; HIT BACK HARDER. THAT'S DONALD TRUMP'S RULE. BUT DONALD TRUMP. DARE NOT STRIKE BACK AGAINST. &gt;&gt; THE RICHEST. &gt;&gt; PERSON IN THE WORLD. MAYBE ELON. MUSK CAN PUSH DONALD TRUMP TO THAT BREAKING POINT THAT ELON MUSK HIMSELF. REACHED YESTERDAY AT 1:34 P.M. WHEN HE SCREAMED ON TWITTER. &gt;&gt; I JUST. &gt;&gt; CAN'T STAND. &gt;&gt; IT ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP MIGHT GET THERE, BUT DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; HAS NEVER, EVER TAKEN LONGER TO GET THERE AS HE MAINTAINS HIS. &gt;&gt; FEARFUL SILENCE ABOUT ELON MUSK. ELON MUSK. CONTINUED HIS ATTACKS ON DONALD TRUMP AND DONALD TRUMP'S BUDGET. BILL BEGINNING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AT 2:07 A.M, WHEN ELON MUSK SAID IT MORE THAN DEFEATS ALL THE COST SAVINGS. &gt;&gt; ACHIEVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF. &gt;&gt; GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY. &gt;&gt; TEAM AT GREAT. &gt;&gt; PERSONAL COST AND RISK. NOW THERE'S ELON MUSK, REMINDING US OF HIS COMPLETE FAILURE. TO CUT TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FEDERAL SPENDING THAT HE CLAIMED HE WAS GOING TO CUT, AND THEN ASKING FOR OUR SYMPATHY AND HOW MUCH IT PERSONALLY COST HIM IN LOST. TESLA CUSTOMERS AND DROPPING TESLA STOCK PRICES. &gt;&gt; WHEN AMERICA. &gt;&gt; AND THE WORLD TURNED AGAINST ELON. MUSK AS HE PLAYED THE. ROLE OF DONALD TRUMP'S. &gt;&gt; EXECUTIONER. &gt;&gt; THE WORLD TURNED AGAINST ELON MUSK. WITH TESLA SALES DROPPING. AROUND THE WORLD WHILE ELON MUSK WAS DECIDING TO TAKE FOOD. AWAY FROM STARVING BABIES, FROM STARVING CHILDREN, FROM STARVING. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE OF ALL. &gt;&gt; AGES WHO DEPEND ON FAMINE RELIEF FROM THE. &gt;&gt; UNITED STATES. &gt;&gt; AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH ELON MUSK PERSONALLY. DECIDED TO. &gt;&gt; DESTROY. &gt;&gt; AND ELON MUSK NOW WANTS US TO FEEL SORRY FOR HIM. ABOUT THE COST. &gt;&gt; AND THE. RISK THAT. &gt;&gt; HE SUFFERED WHILE. &gt;&gt; BEING. &gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP'S EXECUTIONER. &gt;&gt; SEVEN MINUTES. AFTER THAT TWEET. &gt;&gt; AT 2:14 A.M, ELON MUSK. TWEETED. THIS IMMENSE LEVEL OF OVERSPENDING WILL DRIVE. &gt;&gt; AMERICA INTO DEBT SLAVERY. NO. &gt;&gt; IT WON'T, BUT IT IS MORE DEBT THAN THE. COUNTRY HAS EVER HAD. AND 14. &gt;&gt; MINUTES. &gt;&gt; AFTER THAT, AT 2:28 A.M, ELON MUSK ATTACKED DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; AND HIS BUDGET BILL AGAIN, SAYING INTEREST PAYMENTS. &gt;&gt; ALREADY CONSUME. &gt;&gt; 25% OF ALL. &gt;&gt; GOVERNMENT REVENUE. &gt;&gt; THIS IS. &gt;&gt; ELON MUSK SPEAKING. &gt;&gt; SO OF COURSE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT TRUE. &gt;&gt; INTEREST ON THE DEBT IS NOT THAT HIGH. IT'S HIGH. &gt;&gt; BUT NOT THAT HIGH. ELON MUSK. &gt;&gt; THEN PUT. &gt;&gt; DOWN HIS TWITTER MACHINE FOR. &gt;&gt; ALMOST EIGHT HOURS. &gt;&gt; AND THEN. &gt;&gt; BEGAN ATTACKING. DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; AND HIS BUDGET BILL. &gt;&gt; AGAIN JUST AFTER NOONTIME TODAY. &gt;&gt; AND THEN DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; FINALLY AROSE FROM HIS TWITTER. SILENCE ABOUT. ELON MUSK ATTACKING HIM. AND AT 1:59 P.M, JUST OVER 24 HOURS AFTER ELON. MUSK LAUNCHED HIS DIRECT ATTACK. &gt;&gt; ON DONALD. &gt;&gt; TRUMP, CALLING DONALD TRUMP'S BUDGET BILL A DISGUSTING ABOMINATION AND SAYING ANYONE WHO SUPPORTED. &gt;&gt; IT SHOULD BE. &gt;&gt; TURNED OUT OF OFFICE. DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; BRAVELY. &gt;&gt; TWEETED ABOUT ELON MUSK WITHOUT COMMENT SIMPLY BY RETWEETING. THE OLD ELLEN. ELLEN FROM MAY 28TH, SEVEN DAYS AGO, WHEN ELON MUSK TWEETED AS MY SCHEDULED TIME AS A SPECIAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE COMES TO AN END, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE WASTEFUL SPENDING. AND THEN IN THAT SAME TWEET, ELON MUSK TOLD THIS LIE THE DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY MISSION WILL ONLY STRENGTHEN. &gt;&gt; OVER. &gt;&gt; TIME AS IT. BECOMES A WAY OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; THROUGHOUT THE GOVERNMENT. &gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS ONLY SEVEN DAYS AGO THAT HE WAS TELLING THAT LIE. AND NOW ELON MUSK IS TELLING YOU THAT HIS BUDGET CUTTING MISSION HAS NOT JUST COMPLETELY COLLAPSED, IT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY OVERRUN BY THE TRUMP. BUDGET BILL, WHICH THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE SAID TODAY WILL INCREASE THE NATIONAL DEBT BY $2.4 TRILLION. NOW IMAGINE HOW DEEP DONALD TRUMP'S FEAR IS THAT WHEN HE COULDN'T STAND IT ANYMORE TODAY AND HE HAD TO TWEET SOMETHING ABOUT ELON MUSK ATTACKING HIM FOR 24 HOURS, DONALD. TRUMP'S ATTACK THE ONLY THING DONALD TRUMP DARED TO TWEET WAS AN OLD ELON MUSK TWEET WITH NO COMMENT AT ALL. AND TWO MINUTES BEFORE DONALD TRUMP TWEETED THAT OLD ELON MUSK TWEET. &gt;&gt; ELON MUSK. &gt;&gt; TWEETED A NEW ONE, TELLING THE REPUBLICANS THEY NEEDED A NEW BILL. AND SIX MINUTES AFTER DONALD TRUMP'S TWEET, ELON MUSK TWEETED ANOTHER NEW ONE. NO ONE WHO ACTUALLY READS THE BILL SHOULD BE ABLE TO STOMACH IT. THAT MEANS YOU, DONALD TRUMP. AND THEN 44 MINUTES LATER, AT 2:50 P.M, ELON MUSK TWEETED, CALL YOUR SENATOR, CALL YOUR CONGRESSMAN. BANKRUPTING AMERICA IS NOT OKAY. KILL THE BILL. AND IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR THE CHILDISH MIND OF ELON MUSK SEEING THE WORDS KILL AND BILL SO CLOSE TOGETHER TO JUST TURN THAT INTO A MOVIE POSTER VERSION IN HIS NEXT TWEET EIGHT MINUTES LATER, USING THE TITLE OF THE MOVIE KILL BILL, THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE ESTIMATE OF THE IMPACTS OF THE BILL RELEASED TODAY, SHOWS THAT CLOSE TO 16 MILLION PEOPLE WOULD LOSE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE BECAUSE OF THE TRUMP REPUBLICAN BUDGET BILL. REPUBLICAN SENATOR JONI ERNST RESPONDS TO CONCERNS ABOUT LOSING HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AT A TOWN HALL IN IOWA WAS TO SAY, QUOTE, WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE, WHICH SHE SEEMED TO MEAN SORT OF MAYBE AS A JOKE. BUT THEN INSTEAD OF APOLOGIZING FOR WHAT SHE SAID OR ANY MISUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT SHE INTENDED WHEN SHE SAID IT, SHE DECIDED TO MOCK PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T LIKE HER RESPONSE AND INSULT THOSE PEOPLE BY PRETENDING THAT THOSE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE SOMEDAY. TODAY, THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC LEADER, CHUCK SCHUMER, SAID THIS. &gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP IS. &gt;&gt; JUST LYING. &gt;&gt; ABOUT THE BILL. LYING ABOUT THE BILL. &gt;&gt; WELL. &gt;&gt; HERE'S THE WE ARE ALL GOING TO. &gt;&gt; DIE ACT. &gt;&gt; IT SAYS. &gt;&gt; NEARLY 14 MILLION. &gt;&gt; IT'S 16. &gt;&gt; MILLION GETTING CLOSER TO 16 MILLION, ACCORDING TO CBO'S NUMBERS. WE'VE BEEN. &gt;&gt; TOLD 16 MILLION PEOPLE LOSING HEALTH INSURANCE THANKS TO REPUBLICANS VOTING FOR DONALD TRUMP'S DISGUSTING ABOMINATION. MIKE JOHNSON, THE PERPETUALLY IN-OVER-HIS-HEAD GUY WHO GOT THE JOB OF SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE WHEN KEVIN MCCARTHY WAS KICKED OUT AND NO ONE ELSE WANTED THE JOB, IS THE KIND OF IN OVER HIS HEAD GUY WHO'S WILLING TO TELL YOU PUBLICLY, WHO WON'T RETURN HIS CALLS. &gt;&gt; WELL, I'LL TELL YOU. I CALLED ELLEN LAST NIGHT AND HE DIDN'T ANSWER, BUT I HOPE TO TALK TO HIM TODAY. I MEAN, IT'S NOT YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY FRIENDLY AND WE CAN AND WE'VE LAUGHED ABOUT OUR DIFFERENCES ON POLICY BEFORE. I'M NOT UPSET ABOUT THIS. &gt;&gt; NO, HE'S NOT UPSET ABOUT IT. HE DOESN'T LOOK UPSET ABOUT IT. WHY SHOULD HE BE? HE WAS A JUNIOR MEMBER OF THE HOUSE WHO GOT CATAPULTED INTO THE SPEAKERSHIP FROM OBSCURITY AFTER A COUP. HE GETS THE BIGGEST OFFICE IN THE CAPITOL. HE GETS A BIGGER PAYCHECK THAN THE OTHER HOUSE MEMBERS. HE GETS SECRET SERVICE PROTECTION. HE'S SECOND IN LINE FOR THE PRESIDENCY IN THE IN THE LINE OF SUCCESSION. WHY WOULD HE BE UPSET THAT ELON MUSK IS TRYING TO DESTROY HIS DISGUSTING ABOMINATION AND WON'T RETURN HIS CALLS? MIKE JOHNSON'S LUCKY TO BE THERE, SO OF COURSE MIKE JOHNSON'S NOT UPSET ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; I'D LOVE TO TALK TO HIM THIS WEEK AND HOPE HE CALLS HIM BACK TODAY. I'VE TALKED TO I TALKED TO PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOU KNOW, ALL THE TIME, MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY. OBVIOUSLY WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS. HE'S YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT HE'S NOT DELIGHTED ELLEN DID A 180 ON THAT OKAY. &gt;&gt; SO WE GOT IT. SO TRUMP EASY TO GET ON THE PHONE TIMES A DAY. MUSK WON'T RETURN THE CALL. THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. SO THERE'S THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE WANDERING THE HALLS OF THE CAPITOL SOUNDING LIKE A HIGH SCHOOL KID ON A TOUR, SAYING HE REALLY HOPES THE RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD CALLS HIM BACK TODAY OR SOMEDAY. AND HERE'S WHAT THE RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD DID AFTER MIKE JOHNSON SAID THAT ELON MUSK TOOK THAT VIDEO OF MIKE JOHNSON SAYING, I HOPE HE CALLS ME BACK TODAY. AND HE PUT IT IN HIS TWEET AT 2:05 P.M. SAYING, NO ONE WHO ACTUALLY READS THE BILL SHOULD BE ABLE TO STOMACH IT, WHICH MEANS NO ONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO STOMACH WHAT THEY HEARD MIKE JOHNSON SAY IN THAT VIDEO WHEN HE'S HOPING ELON MUSK WILL CALL HIM BACK TODAY. CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP HAS NEVER LOOKED MORE PATHETIC, MORE CHAOTIC, MORE CHILDISH, OR MORE, TO USE ELON MUSK'S WORD, DISGUSTING. IF THE SENATE FAILS TO PASS THE BILL, THEN THE REPUBLICANS WILL HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN. AND TONIGHT, SENATOR RAND PAUL HAS SAID HE WILL VOTE AGAINST IT. AND HE SOUNDS LIKE HE MEANS IT. SENATOR RON JOHNSON HAS YELLED ABOUT THE BILL, SOUNDING AS IF HE WILL VOTE AGAINST IT. BUT THERE'S NO REASON TO BELIEVE ANY OF THE RANTINGS OF RON JOHNSON. REPUBLICAN SENATOR JOSH HAWLEY SAYS HE WON'T VOTE FOR THE BILL WITH WHAT HE CALLS MEDICAID BENEFIT CUTS, BUT HE HAS SAID HE WILL VOTE FOR WORK REQUIREMENTS BEING IMPOSED ON MEDICAID, WHICH WILL BE USED TO KICK PEOPLE OFF MEDICAID WHO ARE UNABLE TO FIND A JOB. THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOSE THEIR ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE. TRUCK DRIVERS AT THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES, FOR EXAMPLE, AND OTHER PORTS AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO ARE LOSING THEIR JOBS NOW BECAUSE OF THE TRUMP TARIFFS, WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TURN TO MEDICAID, AND JOSHUA HAWLEY WILL VOTE FOR THAT. SOUNDS LIKE HE'S GOING TO BE FINE WITH THAT. THE ONLY REPUBLICAN SENATOR WILLING TO SAY PUBLICLY THAT HE IS IGNORING ELON MUSK IS NORTH DAKOTA'S KEVIN CRAMER. &gt;&gt; IF ELON WAS GOING TO GIVE ME ADVICE ON HOW. &gt;&gt; TO. &gt;&gt; GET TO. &gt;&gt; THE. &gt;&gt; MOON. &gt;&gt; I'D LISTEN. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IF HE WAS. &gt;&gt; GIVING. &gt;&gt; ME ADVICE ON HOW. &gt;&gt; TO RAISE A. &gt;&gt; SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS. &gt;&gt; FROM OTHER BILLIONAIRES, I'D LISTEN. BUT HE'S. &gt;&gt; NOT HE DOESN'T. &gt;&gt; GOVERN, YOU KNOW, AND SO, TO. &gt;&gt; BE HONEST. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I JUST IT'S NOT THAT BIG A FACTOR. I KNOW HE'S A GLAMOROUS SORT OF CELEBRITY, BUT. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT. &gt;&gt; A BIG FACTOR IN. &gt;&gt; KEVIN CRAMER IS IN YEAR ONE OF A SIX YEAR SENATE TERM. AND THAT'S ALWAYS THE YEAR WHEN SENATORS ARE AT THEIR BRAVEST. SENATOR JOHN THUNE OF SOUTH DAKOTA, NOW THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE, SAID AFTER A MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH DONALD TRUMP TODAY. THE PLAN TO DEAL WITH ELON MUSK IS TO SIMPLY LIE ABOUT THE BILL. &gt;&gt; WHY DO. &gt;&gt; YOU THINK ELON MUSK IS TRYING. &gt;&gt; TO. &gt;&gt; KILL. &gt;&gt; THIS BILL? &gt;&gt; WELL, I CAN'T SPEAK. &gt;&gt; TO, YOU KNOW. HIS REASONS OTHER THAN WHAT. &gt;&gt; HE STATED. AND I. &gt;&gt; THINK THAT WHAT HE STATED WAS THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WOULD. &gt;&gt; ADD TO. &gt;&gt; THE DEFICIT. &gt;&gt; AND WE. &gt;&gt; WE BELIEVE THE OPPOSITE. &gt;&gt; AND THAT IS LIKE BELIEVING THAT THE EARTH IS FLAT. BUT REPUBLICANS ARE WILLING TO PUBLICLY BELIEVE ANYTHING TO DELIVER MASSIVE TAX CUTS TO DONALD TRUMP AND HIS BILLIONAIRE FRIENDS. JOHN THUNE IS SAYING THAT REPUBLICANS ARE SIMPLY GOING TO LIE AND SAY THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, IS WRONG WHEN THEY ARE TELLING US THAT LEGISLATION WILL INCREASE THE NATIONAL DEBT. THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE HAS NEVER BEEN WRONG ABOUT THE OVERALL BUDGET IMPACT OF LEGISLATION. THEY MIGHT NOT. THEY MIGHT NOT PROJECT EXACTLY THE RIGHT NUMBER. BUT WHEN THEY SAY THE LEGISLATION WILL REDUCE THE DEFICIT, IT ALWAYS DOES. AND WHEN THEY SAY THE LEGISLATION WILL INCREASE THE DEFICIT AND THE DEBT, IT ALWAYS DOES. AND ANY SLIGHTLY SHARP HIGH SCHOOL MATH STUDENT COULD TELL YOU THAT THE REPUBLICAN BUDGET BILL WILL DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE NATIONAL DEBT. BUT DONALD TRUMP HAS SPENT YEARS LEADING UP TO THIS MOMENT, YEARS TEACHING REPUBLICANS JUST HOW MUCH THEY CAN LIE. AND SO IT WILL BE LYING SEASON ABOUT THE NATIONAL DEBT FOR REPUBLICANS. WITH ELON MUSK CONTINUING HIS ATTACKS ON DONALD TRUMP AND WHAT ELON MUSK CALLS THE DISGUSTING ABOMINATION THAT IS THE TRUMP REPUBLICAN BUDGET BILL. AND THERE'S JOHN THUNE ADMITTING THAT IT IS SUCH AN INDEFENSIBLE ABOMINATION" />

nationalist rival in polls ahead of the vote The winner will shape the future of Poland's centrist government which has seen its policies regularly blocked by the outgoing conservative president Although not as powerful as the prime minister the Polish president has important executive and legislative authority such as the rights to veto laws passed by the parliament The president can also appoint top judges all of which can significantly influence the country's politics The current government led by Donald took the prime minister needs its own candidate urgently to win in order to push through key reforms that are currently being blocked by the incumbent president Anjay Duda At the same time this is a pivotal election for Poland and Europe as a whole um for Poland obviously um in order to um regain the state of law that has been um dismantled by the peace government and for Europe uh that needs a needs Poland as a strong player Polish society has long been divided on key issues such as immigration abortion LGBTQ plus rights judicial reform and the country's relationship with the EU The wide range of candidates running in the election reflects these societal divisions The campaign also mirrors a recent trend in other European countries namely that far-right candidates are polling well Who are the main contenders leading the polls with an estimated 32% is Rafal Cheskovski the Liberal mayor of Warsaw and candidate for the ruling civic coalition Cheskovski promises a more progressive Poland with greater LGBTQ plus rights abortion law reform and strengthening Poland's ties with the EU Karun Nodrosky a historian backed by the outgoing President Anjay Duda and the opposition Conservative Law and Justice Party is also in the running Polls indicates that he has about 22.7% support Navrosky emphasizes traditional Catholic values and national identity If the polls are right he will face Choskovski in the runoff on June 1st Slavomir Manson representing the farright Confederation Liberty and Independence is expected to come third with around 15% Known for his nationalist and anti-immigration views Manson is backed by many polls who are dissatisfied with the country's mainstream politics This year's campaign has also been dominated by allegations of Russian interference in the electoral process Will a wind of change blow a more liberal candidate into Warsaw's presidential palace or is Poland set for another 5 years of a conservative president whatever the result the outcome is certain to shape Poland's direction both at home and abroad for the next 5 years And joining me now is Wekk Shamanski from DW Europe and he will shed some light uh on the Polish presidential election for us Perhaps we should start by clarifying sort of the role of the president It's not like the US president Uh but it's not quite as only ceremonial as for example the German president Uh so so what exactly is a Polish president supposed to do well uh the president in Poland is the head of state So officially he is the most important person Um however uh it is not the president who runs uh the country It is the government and the prime minister uh who have the most executive uh power in Poland Uh but the president has uh some powers to make life hard for the government uh mainly he can uh veto so he can block almost every bill or every law introduced by the government and the president in Poland also has influence on the judiciary Um so indeed president is not uh insignificant in Poland and yes the president is not as powerful as a American president or a president in France but he does have more powers than for example a federal president in Germany So let's uh perhaps uh stick to sort of domestic politics You say that the president of Poland can make life hard for uh the actual government by blocking bills for example uh the current uh uh government of uh Premier Donald Tusk uh obviously experienced that already um uh from the outgoing president uh Duda So um is it in his interest uh to have uh basically Duda's favorite not replaced or or I mean how what would it mean for toss government well if the uh rightwing candidate Mr Navroski wins this election um he will uh surely uh do the same thing that the outgoing president Mr Duda has been doing so far which means blocking almost everything that the government wants to introduce um and this will um lead to a situation that the government uh will not be able to introduce any major changes to the country Uh Poland will remain in a kind of political clinch in an impass for uh for for for the next years and this may be a uh a big problem for the government of of Mr tusk for this liberal so-called civic coalition and I guess this may even lead to the fall of the government of um of Mr Mr Tusk So there's a lot at stake uh not only for Poland but also for Europe Uh it is people in Poland are actually choosing if they uh want to have this um it's not a a parliamentary election in Poland today It's the presidential election However somehow people are choosing if they want to have the uh liberal um country or if they want to shift towards more maybe kind of a illiberal democracy or a uh more conservative national conservative democracy the one we see maybe in Hungary or in the US And what do they want what's the mood right now in Poland well one of the most important topics of the election is the state security Uh well Poland is on the eastern flank of NATO and like most of the countries in central and eastern Europe Poland is concerned about aggressive Russia invading its neighbors Poland has a border with uh with Russia Poland has a border with Bellarus a close ally of Russia Poland has a border with with the Ukraine which has been uh fighting against Russian invasion for more than three years now uh and uh facing the concerns about the future of NATO with uh the role of uh United States not being clear right now Uh the state security is is a big is a big topic So will we know tonight uh who which candidate made it i don't think so Um none of the candidates will uh become more than 50% of the votes Most probably no none of them will become will have more than 50% of the votes and that means that uh uh probably there will be a run of the second round in two weeks All right Well thank you so very much uh W Chammanski from DW Europe Thank you" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="Russia's unilateral three-day ceasefire in Ukraine began at midnight Thursday, but within hours, Kyiv reported violations with bombs allegedly dropped by Moscow's forces. After more than 20 failed ceasefires, questions emerge about whether any temporary pause can bring an end to the devastating conflict. Ukraine and the United States have consistently pushed for a 30-day ceasefire and negotiations, but Russia appears unwilling to engage on those terms, prompting criticism from the Trump administration. As Russia honours the anniversary of its victory in WWII with world leaders in attendance, including the presidents of China and Brazil, the diplomatic landscape continues to shift. Meanwhile, Ukrainian drone strikes have led to airport shutdowns across Russia, potentially bringing the war closer to everyday Russians who have largely remained insulated from the conflict.&#10;Today's Newsmaker is the Ceasefire in Ukraine.&#10; &#10;Guests: &#10;Andrij Dobriansky &#10;Director of Communications for the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America&#10; &#10;Viacheslav Matuzov &#10;Former Russian Diplomat&#10; &#10;Maximilian Hess &#10;Central Asia Fellow in the Eurasia Program at the Foreign Policy Research Institute&#10; &#10;#Russia #Ukraine #theNewsmakers&#10;&#10;Subscribe:&#10;http://trt.world/subscribe&#10;Livestream: http://trt.world/ytlive&#10;Facebook: http://trt.world/facebook&#10;Twitter: http://trt.world/twitter&#10;Instagram: http://trt.world/instagram&#10;Visit our website: http://trt.world" />

into effect after more than 20 ceasefires have failed Will any pause in fighting bring us closer to ending the war i'm Andrea Seni and today's newsmaker is the ceasefire in [Music] Ukraine As Russia honors the anniversary of its victory in World War II Moscow said it would also honor a 3-day ceasefire in Ukraine It went into effect at midnight on Thursday but within hours Kiev says it was violated Ukraine actually never agreed to it and has consistently argued along with the United States for a 30-day ceasefire and negotiations But Russia wasn't interested prompting the Trump administration to say Russia is asking too much Here's a look For Russia May the 9th is more than a holiday It's a reminder of past glory To mark the 80th anniversary of victory in Europe President Vladimir Putin has declared a 3-day ceasefire in Ukraine Yet just hours before the truce was to begin Russian air strikes ripped through northern Ukraine The promise of peace felt hollow from the first blast Ukraine's proposal to cease strikes and establish at least a 30-day ceasefire remains in force But from Russia the world sees no response except for news strikes This clearly demonstrates to everyone who the source of the war is In Moscow Putin hosted Xiinping in lavish victory day ceremonies underscoring their so-called no limits partnership At present in the face of the international countercurrent of unilateralism and hegmonic bullying behavior China will work with Russia to shoulder the special responsibilities of being major world powers and jointly promote the correct view of World War II history Meanwhile the US is losing patience in mediation efforts On Wednesday Vice President JD Vance said that Russia is asking too much in the negotiations adding that direct talks between the two sides are necessary to end the war And there's a big gulf predictably between where the Russians and the Ukrainians are And we think the next step in the negotiation is to try to close that gulf We think it's probably impossible for us to mediate this entirely without at least some direct negotiation between the two As Russia leans into its history to justify its actions the war continues to stretch its reach But Xiinping's visit highlights the deepening ties between Russia and its allies showing the world that this isn't just about Ukraine anymore It's about a much bigger global struggle I think that the participation by North Korea and China is important because it it shows that um that uh Russia is is um escalating this conflict by bringing in out of region countries May the 10th is approaching and as the end of the ceasefire nears Ukraine is still waiting Will the guns fall silent at last or will this ceasefire be just another fleeting promise now very few if any believe this three-day ceasefire will mark the beginning of serious negotiations So where does the peace process really stand Joining me now to debate that and more are from New York director of communications for the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America Andre Droanski From Moscow former Russian diplomat Vajlav Matusov And from London Central Asia fellow in the Eurasia program at the Foreign Policy Research Institute Maxmillian Hess Thanks all so much for being with me Andre I'll start with you because first I think we need to clarify what this 3-day ceasefire really amounts to if Ukraine says Russia unilaterally declared it only to break it a few hours later I think you nailed the nailed it We've been down this road most recently during Easter uh when unfortunately numerous civilians were killed all over Ukraine uh during a proposed ceasefire by Russia which isn't an actual ceasefire At that time Ukraine responded in the same way that it did to this proposed ceasefire that it is ready to put in an unconditional 30-day ceasefire whenever Russia is ready Uh this is something that President Trump uh proposed back in back on March 11th and we are still we are uh that that is several thousand ballistic missiles and Shahed drones uh ago that have been launched at Ukraine when a potential ceasefire could have happened So uh the ball is really in the court of Russia if it's wants to demonstrate to the rest of the world that it is into peace or uh we can see uh how Ukraine has been uh acting not only willing to work willing to do a 30-day ceasefire like the Americans have asked for but also working in concert with numerous other countries working towards a peace Okay So Vietas do give us the view then from Moscow I mean did Russia actually break the very ceasefire that it unilaterally declared uh the ceasefire this time was suggested by Russia So it is not Russia who is responsible for for for for this ceasefire because uh Russia proclaimed that from 000 7 of May it be begins and that till 11 the end of the day I don't see any problems with Russian position Russia agre suggested this ceasefire but this ceasefire for three days was rejected by Zilinski president of Ukraine And so if he rejected uh ceasefire for 3 days and demanding ceasefire for 30 days not less that means that uh the problem of ceasefire not on the ball on the Russian side but on the Ukrainian side Where is his approval approval of this ceasefire i don't see it in the in the theoretical isism Logically speaking I can say that it is for Russia to today 4 a.m that begins the ceasefire on the village the name Okay where well where Russia was making some ceasefire some fire shots because it was a concentration of Ukrainian forces and efforts by their groups to enter village village on the side of Russia's hide of village in the side of Ukrainian it is Russian territory okay let me just uh I'm going to move on Maximillion quickly because apparently you don't have to enforce a ceasefire even if you un unilaterally declare it if the other side doesn't agree So the 3-day ceasefire we've been talking about in Russia's mind apparently never really existed So let's talk about the 30-day unconditional ceasefire that Ukraine has been pushing for along with the United States to be fair Moscow hasn't wanted that What do you think i guess I can say Moscow is afraid of why wouldn't Moscow accept if they're willing to accept three days why not 30 well firstly thank you so much for having me and I look forward to this conversation You know the real tragedy is is the reason why Moscow wants this ceasefire is um simply because tomorrow is victory day as it is celebrated in Russia Today is victory in Europe day as it is celebrated in Europe uh and the United States marking the end of the Second World War and Vladimir Putin as he typically does in a tradition that he revived when he first returned to the presidency or when he first became president 25 years ago of holding these large military parades in Moscow Uh Putin wants to avoid the embarrassment of Ukrainian drone strikes uh during that time We saw just yesterday at least two drones likely launched from Ukraine targeted Russian military uh installations outside Moscow and in Tula Oblast Uh but really that this comes on this uh most symbolic and most important of anniversaries the 80th anniversary of the war really speaks to what a tragedy this is and that Vladimir Putin is spitting on the graves of both those Russians and Ukrainians who died fighting against fascism uh in some of these very same territories that Russia is attacking right now So Putin wants to be able to claim that image and portray strength at home on this victory day at the same time that he is undermining the very simple thing that it stood for which was peace in Europe and the ending of the threat of fascism that Russia's forces now present on Ukrainian territory today where Nazi forces presented it over 80 years ago Okay Uh let me come back to Andre then I mean it's interesting to hear again a parallel between World War II and and the conditions today because as we know I mean it was a headline so I'll bring this up uh former President Joe Biden did you know an interview that was widely broadcast saying specifically most probably most disturbing to how uh the United States is currently handling this conflict is that Trump he says is appeasing Putin How do you see that is is this the case is it the same as as we knew appeasing to be during during World War II well appeasing with rhetoric for sure We have seen that from the very first day uh uh even before his inauguration uh much language directed towards agreeing with the Russian position However I think we've seen from the Trump administration very rapidly since uh the beginning of these so-called peace proposals from Donald Trump is that uh the Russian side does not want to play ball with the American proposal Uh we we saw an enormous amount of sticks uh against Ukraine uh it would it would not uh it would not be the way Ukraine proposed to do a ceasefire It had to be the way that President Trump wanted a ceasefire Ukraine uh acceeded to this after President Trump uh stopped military shipments to Ukraine after President Trump uh stopped sharing satellite imagery with Ukraine Uh but Ukraine agreed to this Uh on the other side uh we have not seen sticks uh against the Russian Federation Uh we have seen an enormous amount of appeals and uh most embarrassingly for President Trump uh was the fact that he had a well publicized and advanced phone call in March with President Putin uh after which he had scheduled a press conference to announce to the world that he was on the path to peace And not a single time since the beginning of that phone call onward has there been any hope uh that that President Trump would have the ability to have a press conference that he has discovered peace and he has discovered that since talking to Putin um that the Russian side isn't willing to do what he would like them to do as opposed to the Ukrainian side So if you take this back to World War II in your original question u sometimes there were nations that needed to be prodded along to understood uh to understand uh the what the fight is for real And one of those nations was America Uh because uh as we all know World War II started in 1939 and the invasion of Poland and Ukrainian territories Uh a joint invasion by the Soviet army that Putin glorifies so well Um and it is that memory that needs to be reminded that it took several years for the United States to finally shed itself of its isolationism and really support the cause going forward Okay Viet I I would like your opinion on uh on really the same question though Would you accept that currently President Trump is doing the equivalent of appeasement as we saw in in the past and arguably why Russia ended up having to fight so much longer uh from the Russian perspective in World War II because another leader in this case your president is being appeased Well first of all we are not against our agreement with Donald Trump as a president of the United States It's a very clear position of Russian Federation from all levels from people level to the leadership So but the problem of Donald Trump is internal problem of the United States and the pro internal problem on western coalition because we knew that quite a lot of the well rejection of his points from European countries from European Union from net organization from Great Britain and inside the uh the United States Democratic Party Joe Biden take some position contradicting the the decision of Donald Trump We are not we understand uh very clearly the situation surrounding uh Donald Trump and his opportunity and possibility to uh to intervene in Russian Ukrainian situation So I think that we have bad experience good memory and bad experience Minsk's agreement when we with Americans agreed 24% in Finland Finland in Boyto the the island of Boto in Finland where met in 215 commands from uh the United States Green the chief of Kissinger Foundation Andrew Weiss as a vice president of uh of of also rent corporation and from Russian side the different people and they agreed on 24 and with eight eight years I'm watching how European leadership were solving Ukrainian and fulfilling Ukra Ukrainian issue how they You you feel Russia wasn't respected Merkel said very clearly Okay I I I'll tell you what though Let's let's move on to if you don't mind We're limited for time So we we do have to move on Uh give everyone equal time to speak if if possible Maxmillian I'll ask you this because you brought up you know the the the specifics really of celebrating Victory Day at this current time And in attendance we have to point out in the celebrations in Moscow are major world leaders uh including the presidents of China and Brazil India was also going to attend by the way but because of the tensions with Pakistan declined in the end Now we're seeing the a lot of pro- Ukrainians will call this a relegitimization of President Putin and that it is now showing that it's just a matter of time before he is fully accepted into the wider global community again Do you see that here because of of the the the photo ops we're witnessing now out of Moscow at present certainly Uh President Putin is a very thin skinned individual uh and those presidents and uh leaders of other states who are in attendance are there because they recognize that he has a lot of sensitivities and uh lashes out in quite egregious manners when he uh gets angry Russian hackers uh Russian economic warfare are things that the Kremlin has used far beyond uh just Ukrainian borders For leaders like Cinping in particular the costs of attending are relatively low And of course Xi has his own issues with the West and wants to be seen to be strong uh and standing up against him at the time But in reality if you look at what Putin actually wants from Xi he hasn't had it delivered to him And that's three key things right putin has sought to have Chinese direct military aid has only had very limited amounts He sought to have a deal with China on the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline to replace the gas uh routes to Europe that he himself destroyed Uh and thirdly he's sought to have China intermediate Russian financial dealings uh with the rest of the world More than 3 years into this conflict he hasn't seen that same thing Now with Trump and his own rhetoric towards Putin however we see something very similar Uh which is that Trump and might see somebody in Putin who he really wants to govern like He's also a very thin-kinned individual Uh but Trump and Putin if you look at their interests in the Ukrainian conflict they're directly opposed to one another So let's say Trump wants to control the Arctic routes of the future That's why he cares about Greenland Trump wants to sell more LNG And tragically Trump with his minerals deal wants to loot Ukraine for its natural resources Vladimir Putin wants to sell more LNG He wants to control the Arctic routes of the future And he wants to loot rape and pillage Ukraine for all of its resources So whether one likes these individuals or not they're essentially the captains of two rival football teams They might like each other's style and way of doing things but they're not going to come around and agrees some deal Okay Andre I have to ask you I mean specifically about what uh Maxmillian just alluded to in this is that the fact that Ukraine's parliament just ratified uh this mineral deal with the US whether it's looting or not this deal is is is going through now And meanwhile JD Vance also said that you know Russia is asking too much which is a real change in tone from the way we saw JD Vance in particular treat Ukraine when President Zalinski was at the white white house So how much has really changed then with with Trump and Zalinski after that specifically that Vatican meeting in which Trump actually started threatening Russia with secondary sanctions alongside again JD Vance finally saying no Russia you're you're you're asking too much Well JD Vance we know that he is not an ideologue He jumps around from positions to position So it's not really not really a shock that he would go 180 degrees from one position with Russia to another but he represents the Trump administration He does but uh again he doesn't set the policy And what you see on the screen is that historic meeting without Vance without the cadre of uh uh uh the the gentleman in the white office in the White House who who tend to uh egg on President Trump with his uh campaign style rhetoric when it's just him alone with another leader We know that he's very good at getting along with other world leaders Uh and it was truly a historic moment at Pope Francis's uh funeral where they got to express to each other uh in real terms without any distractions It was exactly what President Zalinsky wanted to do in the Oval Office He had an entire folder of pictures of the injured civilians women children That's what he wanted focus on But you saw you see Vance on the screen jump into the conversation and it destroyed the entire flow So uh I think if we have more of those kind of conversations it's better for the world uh in terms of strengthening alliances not yelling at each other not making everything into a big scene And I uh and you did mention the minerals deal It is a historic deal that was just in the last hour ratified by parliament on a unanimous vote in Ukraine Uh and the important part there is Ukraine has had good ties with the United States on the mil military to military track on its diplomatic to diplomatic track and even on uh in as far as its head uh head prosecutor and attorney general Looting though would I call it looting uh nothing has happened yet Uh the important thing is there is an agreement on paper to further uh exercise both sides in terms of strengthening their partnership In the end we can see if you want to call it looting but at this point we just have a theoretical framework for how to eventually develop the natural resources of Ukraine Okay Vietra let me come back to you because just before this latest ceasefire for whatever it's worth you know Ukrainian drones actually led to the shutdown of four Moscow airports nine others elsewhere You know Russians have been kind of able to witness most of this war from a rather comfortable position inside Russia where they're where they don't have to feel threatened Do they fear that's changing now well I don't see I don't consider that it will be any changes in relations with Russia and Ukraine because their differences are too big I don't consider that these differences can be solved by the decision of president of the United States Donald Trump I don't consider it as possible for today Reasons is because Russia demands not too much Russia demands justice and equality in international relations Equality what we don't have They consider that all our all our uh decisions should be dictated from the United States or from the western partners of the NEA from European countries No it was not impossible And main issue for this crisis that we are watching is the NATO plans for spreading on on the behalf of Russian national interest Russian national security That was the reason why military actions began in in Ukraine It was split of interests of European countries and the United States and the net organization with Russian national interests I think that it main conflict between Trump and Putin today is how to find a decision a solution to to find this solution between American position Western position and Russian national interest Yeah Did you find I didn't find it I mean any questions about cease five for 30 days we're still at this this stalemate then It is impossible We've only got two minutes left So Maximillian I'll I'll let you wrap it up I mean will Russia and Ukraine then having heard especially Vietas's last comments will they ever sit down at the table together one day uh I still believe in the Russian people's ability to drive historic change Uh and one day Vladimir Putin will no longer be the president of that country Uh and these fundamental selling out of Russia's interests for his own personal interest will change When that day comes I believe that Russians will have a real reckoning with their history of not only the last three years but the period since the annexation of Crimea in 2014 Uh I truly believe that one day uh Russians just like many Germans today will see the historic errors of their government's ways and will themselves come to the Ukrainians and ask for forgiveness Whether the Ukrainians give that is entirely up to the Ukrainians and not to the rest of the world But when that happens yes there will be peace and I have full confidence that will happen one day Uh I just hope it's not as far in the future as it seems to be today But with you saying that you fully admit that Trump's promise to end this conflict not just on day one but at least somewhere during his term You don't see that coming i see that as extremely unlikely Okay Maxmillian that will have to be the final word for this edition of the newsmakers I'd like to thank all three of you three of my panelists Really so much for being with us Greatly appreciated Our viewers of course for joining us as well

DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; SAID THIS WAS NOT. &gt;&gt; A GREAT DAY FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; THAT'S BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HAS NO IDEA WHAT HITLER. &gt;&gt; HITLER WAS DOING. &gt;&gt; TO EVERY. &gt;&gt; GERMAN SOLDIER. &gt;&gt; TO EVERY. &gt;&gt; CITIZEN OF GERMANY. THE GENERALS WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO THOUGHT THAT HITLER WAS INSANE BY THAT TIME. AND SO THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR HAD TO EXPLAIN TO THE IGNORANT PRESIDENT THAT IT WAS NO FUN LIVING UNDER THE MADMAN DICTATORSHIP OF ADOLF HITLER, AND THAT D-DAY WAS THE BEGINNING. &gt;&gt; OF THE. &gt;&gt; LIBERATION OF GERMANY FROM. NAZI DICTATORSHIP. THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUFFERING THE WORST. &gt;&gt; ON D-DAY. &gt;&gt; WERE NOT IN BATTLE. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE IN HITLER'S DEATH CAMPS. &gt;&gt; AND D-DAY. &gt;&gt; MEANT THAT SOME. &gt;&gt; OF THEM WERE GOING TO SURVIVE. SOME OF THEM WOULD NOT STARVE TO DEATH. BY THE TIME GENERAL. EISENHOWER'S TROOPS LIBERATED THE DEATH CAMPS, SOME. OF THEM WOULD NOT HAVE ALREADY BEEN PUT TO DEATH. SOME OF THEM WOULD HANG ON. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN. SPEND A. LIFETIME HEARING. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE MAKE REFERENCES TO D-DAY, PEOPLE WHO WERE ALIVE AT THE TIME, PEOPLE WHO REMEMBER IT, AND PEOPLE BORN LONG. &gt;&gt; AFTER D-DAY AND. &gt;&gt; NEVER SEE SOMEONE SMILE. &gt;&gt; OR LAUGH. &gt;&gt; ABOUT IT, SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT THAT MAKES THEM LAUGH. THAT'S THE KIND OF DISRESPECTFUL. &gt;&gt; IGNORANT BEHAVIOR THAT. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN ONLY GET. FROM A HITLER READER LIKE DONALD TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP SUFFERED IN SILENCE. FOR THREE DAYS AFTER ELON MUSK ATTACKED HIM, CALLING DONALD TRUMP'S REPUBLICAN BUDGET BILL. A DISGUSTING ABOMINATION. BUT TODAY, ALMOST. EXACTLY THREE DAYS LATER TO THE HOUR ON, ELON. &gt;&gt; MUSK ATTACKED HIM AND. &gt;&gt; SAID AND. &gt;&gt; ISSUED HIS. &gt;&gt; FIRST TWEET AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. THAT BEGAN WITH THE WORDS I JUST. &gt;&gt; CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; TODAY, PROMPTED BY A REPORTER, DONALD TRUMP, FINALLY BROKE HIS COWARDLY SILENCE. AND THEN THE INSANITY. REALLY STARTED. &gt;&gt; LOOK, YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS LIKED ELON, AND IT'S ALWAYS VERY SURPRISED YOU SAW THE WORDS HE HAD FOR ME, THE WORDS. AND HE HASN'T SAID ANYTHING ABOUT ME. THAT'S BAD. I'D RATHER HAVE HIM CRITICIZE ME THAN THE BILL BECAUSE THE BILL IS INCREDIBLE. &gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP GOT. &gt;&gt; HIS WISH. ELON MUSK DECIDED TO CRITICIZE HIM DIRECTLY. &gt;&gt; ELON KNEW THE INNER WORKINGS OF THIS BILL BETTER THAN ALMOST ANYBODY SITTING HERE. BETTER THAN YOU PEOPLE. HE KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. HE HAD NO PROBLEM WITH IT. ALL OF A SUDDEN HE HAD A PROBLEM, AND HE ONLY DEVELOPED THE PROBLEM WHEN HE FOUND OUT THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CUT THE EV MANDATE, BECAUSE THAT'S BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND IT REALLY IS UNFAIR. HE KNEW IT BETTER THAN ALMOST ANYBODY, AND HE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM UNTIL RIGHT AFTER HE LEFT. AND IF YOU SAW THE STATEMENTS HE MADE ABOUT ME, WHICH I'M SURE YOU CAN GET VERY EASILY, IT'S VERY FRESH ON TAPE. HE SAID THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THINGS ABOUT ME, AND HE HASN'T SAID BAD ABOUT ME PERSONALLY, BUT I'M SURE THAT'LL BE NEXT. &gt;&gt; WELL, HE GOT. &gt;&gt; THAT RIGHT. ELON MUSK. &gt;&gt; THEN LIVE TWEETED WHATEVER. &gt;&gt; KEEP THE EV SOLAR. &gt;&gt; INCENTIVE CUTS IN THE BILL. &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH NO OIL AND GAS SUBSIDIES. ARE TOUCHED. VERY UNFAIR. BUT DITCH THE MOUNTAIN OF DISGUSTING PORK IN THE BILL. ELON MUSK DID NOT ACTUALLY IDENTIFY THE SO-CALLED PORK IN THE BILL. HE ALSO. DENIED THAT HE KNEW WHAT WAS IN THE BILL, SAYING THIS BILL. &gt;&gt; WAS. &gt;&gt; NEVER SHOWN. &gt;&gt; TO ME. &gt;&gt; EVEN ONCE, AND. &gt;&gt; WAS PASSED IN. &gt;&gt; THE DEAD OF NIGHT. &gt;&gt; SO. &gt;&gt; FAST THAT ALMOST NO ONE IN CONGRESS COULD EVEN READ IT. ELON MUSK TWEETED THAT OVER A VIDEO OF DONALD TRUMP SPEAKING IN THE OVAL OFFICE. MINUTES BEFORE ELON MUSK TWEETED IT. AND THEN ELON MUSK TOLD DONALD TRUMP WHAT ELON MUSK BELIEVES DONALD TRUMP OWES HIM. WITHOUT ME, TRUMP WOULD HAVE LOST THE ELECTION, DEMS WOULD CONTROL THE HOUSE, AND REPUBLICANS WOULD BE 5149 IN THE SENATE. SUCH INGRATITUDE. AND THAT. &gt;&gt; IS A. &gt;&gt; PERFECTLY REASONABLE POLITICAL ARGUMENT. PERFECTLY REASONABLE POLITICAL CASE TO MAKE ABOUT HOW THAT ELECTION WAS WON AND LOST. WE'VE ALL SPENT OUR LIVES HEARING HOW MUCH MONEY MATTERS IN POLITICS. &gt;&gt; MONEY IS EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; IN POLITICS AND IN CAMPAIGNS, AND THAT MAKES IT ENTIRELY LIKELY THAT WHEN THE RICHEST. PERSON IN THE WORLD DECIDES TO. &gt;&gt; MAKE THE BIGGEST. &gt;&gt; POLITICAL CONTRIBUTION IN. &gt;&gt; HISTORY, IT WOULD MAKE A. &gt;&gt; DIFFERENCE, A DECISIVE DIFFERENCE. DONALD TRUMP IN THE OVAL OFFICE, WITH THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR BESIDE HIM, HUMILIATED HIMSELF BY DESPERATELY INSISTING TO THE WORLD THAT HE WOULD HAVE WON WITHOUT ELON MUSK. &gt;&gt; I WOULD HAVE WON PENNSYLVANIA EASILY ANYWAY. &gt;&gt; WE'LL NEVER KNOW. WE'LL NEVER KNOW IF DONALD TRUMP COULD HAVE WON THAT ELECTION WITHOUT ALL OF ELON MUSK'S MONEY. THE BIGGEST POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR IN HISTORY. &gt;&gt; IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE. &gt;&gt; HAPPENED IF ELON MUSK SENT THAT MONEY IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. WE DON'T KNOW. AND THEN ELON MUSK THREATENED TO CREATE A NEW POLITICAL PARTY, A POLITICAL PARTY THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY PULL VOTES AWAY FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. IS IT TIME TO CREATE A NEW POLITICAL PARTY IN AMERICA THAT ACTUALLY REPRESENTS THE 80% IN THE MIDDLE? THERE AREN'T 80% IN THE MIDDLE, OF COURSE, BUT THERE ARE ENOUGH ELON MUSK FOLLOWERS WHO COULD TURN AGAINST REPUBLICANS AND GIVE THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO THE DEMOCRATS NEXT YEAR, ALONG WITH THE SENATE AND THE PRESIDENCY IN THE ELECTION AFTER THAT. THAT'S SOME OF. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS. &gt;&gt; AT STAKE IN THE MOST INSANE PUBLIC OUTBURST THAT HAS. EVER OCCURRED BETWEEN A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND. &gt;&gt; HIS BIGGEST. &gt;&gt; MONEY CONTRIBUTOR. DONALD TRUMP THEN TOOK TO HIS SOCIAL MEDIA SITE AND POSTED, ELON. WAS WEARING THIN. &gt;&gt; I ASKED HIM. &gt;&gt; TO LEAVE. I TOOK AWAY. HIS EV MANDATE THAT FORCED EVERYONE TO BUY ELECTRIC CARS THAT NOBODY ELSE WANTED, THAT HE KNEW FOR MONTHS I WAS GOING TO DO, AND HE JUST WENT CRAZY. EXCLAMATION POINT. SO THERE'S DONALD TRUMP SAYING I ASKED HIM TO LEAVE. THAT'S DONALD TRUMP SAYING HE FIRED ELON MUSK. THAT'S WHAT WE WERE REPORTING ON THIS PROGRAM LAST NIGHT. WHITE HOUSE SOURCES INDICATING, BY THE WAY, NONE OF THEM BELIEVABLE, JUST AS DONALD TRUMP WAS NOT BELIEVABLE THAT ELON MUSK WAS FIRED. WE WILL NEVER KNOW. DID DONALD TRUMP FIRE ELON MUSK BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR? ELON MUSK IS A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR. BUT DOES ELON MUSK FEEL THAT HE WAS FIRED? MAYBE DONALD TRUMP WAS ALSO CLAIMING IN THAT IDIOTIC TWEET THAT YOU WE WERE ALL FORCED TO BUY ELECTRIC CARS. WE WHO HAVE I AM AMONG THEM WHO HAVE NEVER PURCHASED AN ELECTRIC CAR. AND THEN DONALD TRUMP SAYS THE OTHER GUY IS CRAZY, PUTS IT ALL IN CAPITAL LETTERS. THE OTHER GUY IS CRAZY. CRAZIEST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. SAYS THE OTHER GUY IS CRAZY. TO WHICH ELON MUSK SAYS. &gt;&gt; WHAT I'VE. &gt;&gt; BEEN SAYING ABOUT ALMOST EVERYTHING DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID. &gt;&gt; SINCE HE. &gt;&gt; FIRST OPENED. HIS MOUTH IN 2011 ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE. ELON MUSK SAID SUCH AN OBVIOUS LIE. SO SAD. AND SO. &gt;&gt; THERE. &gt;&gt; WE ARE, DAY 136 OF THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. ELON MUSK CALLING DONALD TRUMP WHAT I HAVE BEEN CALLING DONALD TRUMP SINCE 2011 ON THIS PROGRAM A LIAR. DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN A LIAR EVERY SINGLE DAY OF HIS POLITICAL CAREER, AND ELON MUSK HAS PROBABLY KNOWN THAT, AND ELON MUSK HAS DONE ALMOST AS MUCH LYING ABOUT POLITICAL ISSUES IN AMERICA AS DONALD TRUMP. AND SO IT'S WAR BETWEEN MUSK AND TRUMP. STEVE BANNON, A TRUMP LOYALIST WHO WAS FIRED FROM THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE BUT SERVED A LONGER RUN IN THAT WHITE HOUSE THAN ELON MUSK DID, SAID PEOPLE, INCLUDING MYSELF, ARE RECOMMENDING TO THE PRESIDENT THAT HE PULL EVERY CONTRACT ASSOCIATED WITH ELON MUSK AND THAT MAJOR INVESTIGATIONS START IMMEDIATELY ONE INTO HIS IMMIGRATION STATUS, HIS SECURITY CLEARANCE AND HIS HISTORY OF DRUG ABUSE, TWO INTO HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO TRYING TO FORCE A BRIEFING OF HIGHLY TOP SECRET WAR PLANS WITH CHINA AT THE PENTAGON THREE AND INTO HIS INVOLVEMENT WITH ATTEMPTING TO GET PRESIDENT XI TO THE INAUGURATION. SO NOW TRUMP WORLD WANTS TO INVESTIGATE ELON MUSK. DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCED A COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS INVESTIGATION, APPARENTLY TO FIND OUT HOW OLD JOE BIDEN WAS WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. BUT THE BIDEN INVESTIGATION NEWS DID NOT TURN OUT TO BE THE INVESTIGATION NEWS OF THE DAY, BECAUSE TRUMP CHEERLEADERS NOW WANT TO INVESTIGATE ELON MUSK. DONALD TRUMP THEN POSTED THE EASIEST WAY TO SAVE MONEY IN OUR BUDGET BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IS TO TERMINATE ELON'S GOVERNMENTAL SUBSIDIES AND CONTRACTS. THAT WAS DONALD TRUMP'S WAY OF TRYING TO SHUT UP ELON MUSK. THAT WAS DONALD TRUMP'S BIG SHOT AT ELON MUSK. THAT WAS HIS BIGGEST SHOT, SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND DONALD TRUMP'S BIGGEST SHOT OF THE DAY AGAINST ELON MUSK AND HIS WAR AGAINST ELON MUSK DID NOT WORK BECAUSE AFTER DONALD TRUMP THREATENED TO CUT OFF ALL OF MUSK'S GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, ELON MUSK THEN WENT TWITTER NUCLEAR PRIME TIME TO DROP THE REALLY BIG BOMB. REAL DONALD TRUMP IS IN THE EPSTEIN FILES. THAT IS THE REAL REASON THEY HAVE NOT BEEN MADE PUBLIC. HAVE A NICE DAY. &gt;&gt; D.O.J. EXCLAMATION. &gt;&gt; POINT. &gt;&gt; AND JUST TO TOP THAT. &gt;&gt; OFF, ELON MUSK SAID YES TO A FOLLOWER OF HIS WHO SAID PRESIDENT VERSUS ELON, WHO WINS? MY MONEY'S ON ELON, TRUMP SHOULD BE IMPEACHED AND JD VANCE SHOULD REPLACE HIM. YES, SAID ELON MUSK TO THAT IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP. AND SO THEY. &gt;&gt; HAVE. &gt;&gt; BOTH FIRED THEIR BIGGEST SHOTS AT EACH OTHER. THE QUESTION FOR DONALD TRUMP, WHO SPENT THE LAST THREE DAYS IN FEARFUL SILENCE ABOUT ELON MUSK, IS CAN HE CRUSH THE RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD? &gt;&gt; OR SHOULD. &gt;&gt; HE BEG FOR A TRUCE WITH ELON MUSK? THE EPSTEIN FILES ARE, OF COURSE, THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE FILES ON DONALD TRUMP'S OLD FRIEND, THE PEDOPHILE JEFFREY EPSTEIN, WHO KILLED HIMSELF IN PRISON. TWITTER IS NOW FILLED WITH THE VIDEO OF THAT DANCING FRIENDSHIP WITH THAT PEDOPHILE. THANKS TO ELON MUSK PUSHING THE VIDEO OF THE TRUMP EPSTEIN FRIENDSHIP ON TWITTER, YOU CAN EXPECT TO SEE MORE AND MORE OF THAT ON TWITTER. AND SO WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S COMING NEXT. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL BE HUMILIATED. AND WE DO KNOW THAT ELON MUSK WILL CONTINUE TO SUFFER HUGE FINANCIAL LOSSES, AS HE DID TODAY. WITH THE TESLA STOCK PRICE CRASHING, LOSING 152 BILLION IN MARKET VALUE THANKS TO ELON MUSK'S MADNESS TODAY, WHICH WILL WIN HIM NO. FANS AMONG GOOD AND DECENT PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE DONALD TRUMP AND WHO WILL NEVER BUY A TESLA AGAIN BECAUSE THEY WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT ELON MUSK DID WITH THE MONEY THAT THEY PAID HIM FOR THEIR TESLAS. THEY WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT ELON MUSK DID DURING HIS WORSHIP DONALD TRUMP PERIOD. GOOD AND DECENT PEOPLE WILL NEVER FORGET BILL GATES DESCRIPTION OF ELON MUSK AS THE WORLD'S RICHEST MAN, KILLING THE WORLD'S POOREST CHILDREN. BECAUSE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT ELON MUSK DID AND WHAT HE'S CONTINUING TO DO TONIGHT. AND THOSE CHILDREN ARE DYING TONIGHT BECAUSE OF ELON MUSK. AND SO TWO MAD MEN ARE AT WAR, AND WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. BUT WE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT IT HELPS DERAIL THE MISSION OF NONSTOP CRUELTY THAT THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="♪ (&quot;LAST WEEK TONIGHT&quot; THEME PLAYS) ♪ We're going to dive straight in with our main story this week, which concerns the ongoing chaos of Trump's tariffs. It's been an emotional roller coaster since Trump rolled them out last week with the help of the single dumbest chart in human history. That prompted the Dow to drop by nearly 4,000 points in two days. So, by Monday, everyone was understandably freaking out, only for Trump to dismiss anyone concerned as &quot;panicans,&quot; which he said was a, quote, &quot;new party based on weak and stupid people.&quot; Though I'd argue the weak and stupid demo is, if anything, way overrepresented in government right now. Then on Tuesday, Trump gave a speech to Republican donors where he floated major new tariffs on pharmaceuticals, told the audience, &quot;I know what the hell I'm doing,&quot; and claimed this. I'm telling you, these countries are calling us up, kissing my ass. They are-- They are dying to make a deal. &quot;Please, please, sir, make a deal. I'll do anything.&quot; Yeah, I'm sure some have been pretty nice to him, the same way that you'd try to be nice if you suddenly found yourself in the same room -as a monkey with a gun. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) &quot;Hi, monkey. Good monkey. Strong monkey. Please, I'll do anything.&quot; By Wednesday morning, though, Trump's reassurances were getting more desperate as he, at one point, posted, &quot;Be cool! Everything is going to work out well.&quot; A sentence that's never been true in human history. That is the phrase you hear before someone skateboards off a roof, shows you their homemade water slide, or asks you to hold the camera while they climb into the alligator exhibit to &quot;do something hilarious.&quot; Just a few hours later, Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his biggest tariffs, and he did it so abruptly, it caught some key members of his own administration by surprise. ED O'KEEFE: A sudden change in policy came as Democrats grilled his top trade representative on Capitol Hill. STEVEN HORSFORD: It looks like your boss just pulled the rug out from under you and paused the tariffs, the taxes on the American people. There's no strategy. You just found out three seconds ago, sitting here. We saw you. That's true. That's true. That congressman later tweeted out this photo showing what it looked like to watch that guy get the news. And how do you think he found out? A push notification? A work email? Or 32 concurrent messages on the office group text where one guy goes, &quot;What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck,&quot; and another goes, &quot;Hoooollyyy shit.&quot; Another's like, &quot;LOL, J fucking K, I guess.&quot; And the guy who's always asked dumb questions is like, &quot;Wait, what's happening?&quot; And then the first guy sends the link to the Times article, and the dumb one's like, &quot;Oh my God, what the hell! Did this just happen?&quot; And then everyone at the same time texts, &quot;Yes, Cody.&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) This week was total chaos. At one point, the daily trading range of the S&amp;P 500 was more than five percent for six straight days. The previous times that happened were in March 2020, during COVID, late 2008, during the housing crisis, and October 1987, which, if you are too young to remember, was a stock market crash so massive, Nightline felt like it needed to do this to explain it to people. Here once again to help us, my good friend, Kermit. Thank you, Ted. Can you tell us what is a bear market? Yes, Ted. Well, thank you. Being a bear myself, that is one of the first things we bears are taught in the caves. If I recall, a bear market is where prices are going down for a long period of time. So one would wish, I suppose, for a bull market to drive the bears out. No, no, we don't want that. We never want that. (COMMOTION) (MOOS) Yeah, they explained a complicated financial crash with Muppets, a sentence so &quot;this show&quot; coded, I'm genuinely surprised that we didn't think of it. Honestly, if Ted Koppel had a British accent, glasses, way less gravitas, and occasionally referred to Kermit as &quot;a bona fide swamp snack,&quot; I couldn't tell the difference there. And the thing is, the turmoil isn't over, because what Trump's left in place, including a baseline ten percent tariff on all imports and a 145 percent tariff on China, is still a monumental shift in US trade policy. And despite what some in the White House claim, that the 90-day pause was part of the strategy all along, Trump himself seemed to admit that he did it in reaction to the market's panicking. I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippy, you know? They were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid. Hold on. &quot;A little bit afraid&quot; is a massive understatement. People were freaking out about their 401(k)s. There were grandmas looking at their retirement plan and getting ready to open an OnlyFans to get through the next five years. And it wasn't just ordinary investors. One financial analyst wrote, after talking to fund managers, &quot;A few have quietly wondered if the president might be insane.&quot; Which is fair, everyone knows the right time to ask if someone might be insane is five months after you elect them president. Look, this week was incredibly stupid, but it's important to understand exactly how stupid it was because we're not out of the woods yet. And the damage the president's already done to confidence in our economic system could have lasting repercussions. So tonight, let's talk about Trump and his tariffs. Let's start with the fact that none of this should have been a surprise. Not only did Trump bring up the idea of ten percent universal tariffs repeatedly on the campaign trail, he's been obsessed with the idea of punishing other countries with tariffs for years now. In fact, when he touched off a trade war with China in his first term, we spent 21 minutes unpacking it, and the arguments hold up pretty well, although I clearly do not, as evidenced by a YouTube comment from this week, which said, &quot;I thought this was a new episode until I noticed John's hair was darker and face looked younger,&quot; which is both hurtful and fair. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But that piece featured this clip of Trump back in 2011, laying out his whole fantasy of how tariffs could work. Somebody said, &quot;Well, what would you do? What can you do?&quot; So easy. I drop a 25 percent tax on China. And, you know, I said to somebody that it's really the messenger. The messenger is important. I could have one man say, &quot;We're going to tax you 25 percent.&quot; And I could say another, &quot;Listen, you motherfuckers, we're going to tax you 25 percent.&quot; Okay, putting aside how striking it is to hear the word &quot;motherfucker&quot; on C-SPAN... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...I kind of wish he'd just kept doing the voices there. You can have one guy say, &quot;Listen, motherfuckers, we're going to tax you 25 percent.&quot; And you can have an Australian guy say, &quot;Oi, you bloody dingo, we're going to tax you 25 percent, mate.&quot; Or you can have Björk say, &quot;I will tax you 25 butterfly rainbow sneezes in happiness soup.&quot; There's all sorts of ways that you can do it, but the tariff is the important part. The point is, Trump has long believed that tariffs can fix our trade problems, and that's coupled with his insistence that trade is zero-sum, that if we buy more from another country than we are selling to them, we're somehow getting ripped off. But that is just not how it works, because we are getting things in return. As one Nobel-winning economist jokingly said, &quot;I run a chronic trade deficit with my barber. He never buys a damn thing from me.&quot; Which is just a classic economist zinger. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Nevertheless, Trump applied both those beliefs to his initial tariff plan, imposing massive penalties on countries, indexed to the size of our trade imbalance, which led to some of the incredibly stupid calculations on Trump's chart, perhaps the dumbest of which was actually explained pretty well by Jim Cramer. Let's go to the Southern African nation of Lesotho, which had the misfortune of being one of the two most highly tariffed nations on Trump's list. They're being hit with a 50 percent duty on their exports to America. That happened because Lesotho only imported 2.8 million dollars’ worth of US goods last year, whereas we imported roughly 240 million worth of stuff from them. Now, the thing is, Lesotho's a really tiny country. Virtually everything we buy from them is either apparel or diamonds. But because it's a very poor country, they can't afford to buy much from us. So, what happens now? To start, we're going to have to pay a lot more for any apparel or diamonds from Lesotho. Maybe we can replace the apparel, but diamonds? I mean, that's a lot harder. And the only way for Lesotho to get out of this jam is by importing more stuff from America, which it can't do because it doesn't have any money. So the president has likely just made things more expensive for Americans and not really changed the behavior of our trading partners. He's right. Shit. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Jim Cramer was right. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) I think I'm going insane. And quick side note there, if you're thinking, &quot;Hold on, did he say Lesotho's sitting on top of a load of diamonds, but they still don't have any money?&quot; I know, but we don't have time. That's a different story that I'm sure we'll do one day. I'll put a Post-it note on my computer and everything. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And while Trump's temporarily paused those huge tariffs on Lesotho and others, it is worth asking, what exactly is his endgame here? And it depends on who you ask. When the tariffs first came down, some in the White House insisted they'd be permanent trade barriers intended to raise revenue and bring jobs back home, while others claimed they were a scare tactic designed to help us negotiate more favorable deals. But those are two very different goals, with different consequences for businesses and workers who badly need to know which to plan for. So, let's take each scenario in turn, and let's start with the idea that these tariffs are designed to shut out foreign competition and ensure stuff gets made here. There are a few issues with that, starting with the fact that lots of things aren't produced in the US, sometimes because they simply can't be at any kind of commercial scale. Even Trump's Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, pictured here rocking a cunty little bob... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...seemed to understand that last month when he said this. Certain products... If I put a tariff on a mango... Right? We can't grow mangoes in America. We just can't grow a mango. If you put a tariff on a mango, the mango would be more expensive. So then that's just like another version of income tax. How do you think about-- Okay, so the idea is to not do that. Right. The problem is, when the tariffs were announced, mangoes weren't exempted, so we did do that. And sometimes it feels like the best way to ensure Trump does something is to tell him not to do it. He's like a toddler, both because his brain is unable to grasp negations and also because he has a short torso, huge head, always looks like he's about to fall over, and won't let anyone brush his hair. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) That same logic applies to other crops like coffee and bananas, but that is not all, because it's also not easy to make electronics here. Take the Nintendo Switch 2. The company paused pre-orders for it this week, because they didn't know how it'd be affected, as this analyst explained. They gotta figure out what they're gonna get charged. Do they charge 50 percent more? Do they charge double? Do they even ship 'em? How much of this is made in the US? -None of it? -None of it. That is a good point, but an even better delivery of it. I want that guy on hand to respond to all other situations. How much birthday cake is left in the break room? -&quot;None of it.&quot; -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) How much of the Severance goat plot did you actually understand? -&quot;None of it.&quot; -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) How much of Trump's trade briefing did he genuinely read? -&quot;None of it.&quot; -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And if you're thinking, &quot;Well, hold on, why don't we just build a Switch factory here?&quot; When it comes to high-tech goods, key components have to be sourced from complex global supply chains. So, it's not a matter of simply building a factory. There is a lot more to it. How much would it cost them to start manufacturing Switches here in the US? Tens of billions of dollars. Billions? That's because of a supply chain that's been built over decades. It would take four to five years to even build and get done a factory here in the US. And the reality is the assembly, the supply chain is in Asia. If you just build a factory here in the US, where are you getting all the parts from? Still in Asia. Exactly. And some of those components are presumably about to be subjected to heavy tariffs. And quick side note, among the many things that I'm mad about right now is the fact that I have to spend time talking about how tariffs will impact the Switch instead of what I really want to talk about, which is that I only just learned the president of Nintendo in America is named Bowser. -That man... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...I don't shit you even a tiny bit, is called Doug Bowser. Now, if you don't know, Bowser is quite famously the primary antagonist of Mario, the face of Nintendo. Now, in the comedy world, the president of Nintendo being named Doug Bowser is like someone gently setting a ball on a tee, handing you a bat, and saying, &quot;Please, have fun and swing away.&quot; But unfortunately, because this guy doesn't understand economics, I have to look at real Nintendo President Doug Bowser and say, &quot;Sorry, everyone, no time for that. -We've got math to do.&quot; -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) It's a truly sad state of affairs, or to put it another way... (MARIO BROS SOUND EFFECT) MARIO: Oh, no! -Exactly. -(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) The point is, if these tariffs stand, they could have the opposite of the intended purpose, as some business owners might realize it's now cheaper to have a factory outside the US and not have to deal with tariffs. But let's say that despite all of that, we still want all those manufacturing jobs that we lost to come back home. First, as we've discussed before, a lot of them simply don't exist anymore because they've been automated. And second, even if we wanted to build brand-new factories, it's worth knowing these new tariffs mean higher material and equipment costs for manufacturers wanting to do that. And in fact, tariff-swollen building costs have already helped to kill a 300-million-dollar plastics recycling plant in Erie, Pennsylvania, which is a real shame for multiple reasons, including that it would've helped make Erie, Pennsylvania known for something other than the town that boiled a Revolutionary War general's corpse in order to separate his flesh from his bones so they could ship him back to his hometown. The idea-- The idea there being they'd reassemble the skeleton once he was in his final gravesite, but you guessed it, some bones wound up falling out of the wagon on the trek, as bones are wont to do. It's an incredible story, and thanks to the foiled recycling plant, remains the only thing I will ever know about Erie, Pennsylvania. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And even if we do end up bringing some manufacturing jobs home, you also have to factor in that other countries will put tariffs on our goods in return, which will hurt other industries. The current massive tariffs on China are incredibly worrisome for people like this soybean farmer in Tennessee. That trade relationship with China was built over decades and decades. REPORTER: Will Hutchinson, a fourth-generation Tennessee farmer, says he is very concerned. This is going to have an immediate and drastic impact to our ability to compete on the global marketplace for our goods that we produce here in this country. Yeah, that literal soy boy is right. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) This is pointless. If I wanted to watch long-standing relationships destroyed in an instant, I'd just go to a basketball game to see which couples act weird when they end up on the Jumbotron. You can enjoy relationships falling apart without jeopardizing the global economy. And at this point, I'm sure some Trump supporters are saying, &quot;Well, these were never intended to be permanent. It's that second possibility that you mentioned earlier that the tariffs were always just a way to give Trump leverage to renegotiate bad trade deals. And after he announced that 90-day pause, that was definitely the message getting sold. This is the art of the deal. This shows how strong our president is. A huge win for the president, a huge win for the country, his biggest accomplishment of the second term. Trump won. He's doing exactly what he said he would do. He's a genius in negotiating. He is very calculating in how he negotiates. He understands the art of the deal better than anyone, and he's gotten results in a very short period of time. I don't know what's more desperate there, the shameless sucking up or the need to put the words “We Told You Not to Freak” at the bottom of the screen, which is funny coming from Fox News of all places, considering most of their broadcasts feature messages like, “Why You Should Absolutely Freak About the Green M&amp;M!” (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But let's at least consider the possibility this was all about gaining leverage for negotiating new deals. That was definitely the White House's spin after the pause was announced, with Trump's Treasury Secretary claiming it had happened because the tariffs brought more than 75 countries forward to negotiate. But a couple of things about that. First, the White House said it will not be releasing a list of the countries that had allegedly done that. So, you know. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And remember, Trump's openly admitted the key reason for his climbdown was &quot;people got the yippies.&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And remember, even with the pause, we still have ten percent tariffs on nearly every country in the world, which is still massively disruptive, both to them and to us. And that includes countries like Singapore, where we're going to struggle to get a much better deal, given that we face no tariffs there and actually have a trade surplus. And I'm not saying there aren't countries where we have legitimate trade disputes. Because there are, most notably China, where there are major issues, from their heavy subsidies for homegrown industries to their theft of US companies' intellectual property. Resolving those issues is difficult. It requires diplomacy and a coordinated strategy with our allies. But instead, we've alienated those allies and are going into any future negotiation having provoked China into putting massive tariffs on our goods, too. But don't worry because Trump's charismatic Treasury secretary doesn't seem to think they're gonna be able to hurt us at all. It was a big mistake, this Chinese escalation, because, you know, they're playing with a pair of twos. We are the deficit country. So, what do we lose by the Chinese raising tariffs on us? They-- We-- We export one-fifth to them of what they export to us. So, that-- that is a losing hand for them. Okay, setting aside that &quot;playing with a pair of twos&quot; sounds like how you describe a threesome with Don Jr. and Eric... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...that is incredibly simplistic because it ignores that China's leverage in a negotiation isn't confined to just tariffs. It can hurt us in other ways too, including by cutting off access to rare earth elements we may badly need. And before you think &quot;rare earth elements&quot; are just some fancy powder Gwyneth Paltrow adds to a morning smoothie to enhance vaginal wellness, you should know they're actually essential for everything from wind turbines to computer chips to F-35 stealth fighter jets. And incredibly, that Whoville tax accountant wasn't even the most reckless player in the Trump administration's messaging to China this week, because J.D. Vance, true to form, was even more of a dick. What has the globalist economy gotten the United States of America? And the answer is, fundamentally, it's based on two principles. Incurring a huge amount of debt to buy things that other countries make for us. And to make it a little bit more crystal clear, we borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things those Chinese peasants manufacture. Wow. I know it is hard to take from someone with this accent, but you are really not supposed to use the word &quot;peasants&quot; anymore. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) That is incredibly insulting, especially coming from the man who, remember, is next in line to run the country, if anything were to happen to Elon Musk. -So... -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...it is no wonder those comments went down pretty badly in China. WILL RIPLEY: The government's response? Swift and scathing. (SPEAKING IN MANDARIN) TRANSLATOR: It's both astonishing and lamentable to hear this vice president make such ignorant and disrespectful remarks. WILL: On China's tightly controlled internet, government censors are allowing Vance's interview to go viral, amplifying the outrage, igniting anger and sarcasm. &quot;Have you said thank you for the money we lent you?&quot; A reference to China being the second largest foreign holder of US government debt and that infamous Oval Office exchange with Ukraine's president. Yeah, that's a pretty solid burn. And I guess, in a way, it's reassuring to know that despite our differences, the American and Chinese people can come together to agree that it is fun to dunk on this cursed Cabbage Patch bitch. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -And look, you can say, &quot;Well, that's all well and good, but I still trust Trump to make a deal.&quot; But here's the thing. We actually know what happens when he starts a trade war, because remember, he did a version of this in his first term, and it didn't go great. If you look back at his tariffs back then protecting specific products and industries, like washing machines and steel, they might have worked in a narrow sense by creating modest job gains. They're credited with creating or saving several thousand jobs in the steel industry and creating around 1,800 jobs manufacturing washing machines. But in the broader sense, those jobs cost us a lot. Trump's tariffs wound up raising prices to the point where it's estimated American consumers and businesses had to pay more than 900,000 dollars a year for every steel job created and over 800,000 dollars a year for each job making washing machines, putting the total cost of those jobs in the billions of dollars. And that's before you get to the fact that because his tariffs on metals drove up costs for other industries, one study estimated they actually resulted in as many as 75,000 fewer manufacturing jobs. And when it comes to China in particular, his first-term tariffs did bring in billions by raising the costs of their goods here. But the broader damage to American farmers after China retaliated was so severe that 92 percent of what we collected went right back out the door in the form of bailouts to them. And the kicker is, we didn't get much out of all of that. Because after a trade agreement was reached, Trump excitedly bragged he'd got China to commit to purchase an additional 200 billion dollars in US products. But later analysis showed it effectively bought none of those goods. None of them. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But please, don't worry. I'm sure Trump definitely learned his lesson, and this time, he's gonna get an empty promise for 500 billion. Fool him once, shame on him. Fool him twice, that's basically what everyone does. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And remember, Trump's first-term tariffs are absolutely dwarfed by what he's done over the last two weeks. And it's not like he's negotiating from a particularly strong position right now because everyone knows he just blinked. The bond markets got the yippies and he blinked. And again, it's good that that happened. I'm glad he blinked. But it's weird to claim it's a brilliant negotiating tactic when you've already backed down before a single deal is reached. And the thing is, this could all cost us an awful lot because maybe the most striking thing over the past two weeks has been the degree to which it's become clear the world's trust in America has been shattered. This isn't just the ordinary give and take of negotiations. Countries are openly saying things are different now. Canada's prime minister actually summed it up pretty well the day after Trump's initial round of tariffs were announced. The global economy is fundamentally different today than it was yesterday. The system of global trade anchored on the United States that Canada has relied on since the end of the Second World War, a system that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for our country for decades, is over. While this is a tragedy, it is also the new reality. Wow. That is a bleak thing to hear. &quot;Tragedy is the new reality&quot; is a grim summation of the state of world affairs, but also, I'm just gonna say it, kind of a fucking bar. Honestly, you slap that title on a new Fall Out Boy album, the girls are going feral. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And it's not just world leaders. Investors are making it clear they no longer have the trust they once did in the stability of the American economy. Usually, when the stock market drops, the market for US government bonds improves because they're seen as a safe investment. This week, though, they both went down, which is a terrible sign. As one economist put it, &quot;Investors and central banks are selling treasuries and dollars due to a loss of confidence and credibility in American assets. Financial chaos has its cost.&quot; That is bad. And by the way, that is from Friday, after the pause was announced. And that is the thing, while everyone may want to pretend that this crisis is past us, it's just not. Even Chuck Schumer seemed to miss that point when he tweeted out, &quot;History will remember April 9th, 2025 as America's actual liberation day. The day that President Trump backed down from his ridiculous tariff fiasco.&quot; But it's not over, Chuck. We dodged a bullet, but the monkey still has a gun. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And incidentally, if anyone watching this is close to Chuck Schumer right now, please take his phone, take it out of his hand, and throw it into the fucking ocean! So, what do we do? Well, ideally, Congress would realize just how close we came to financial Armageddon and take away the president's power to unilaterally impose tariffs. There's actually a bill in Congress right now, co-sponsored by Chuck Grassley, that would require the White House to justify tariffs and then give lawmakers the opportunity to reject them within 60 days of enactment, which seems more than reasonable. The problem is, you're going to need 67 votes to beat a presidential veto, and Republicans like Senator John Kennedy are refusing to sign on, using this logic. I have not joined the Grassley bill. I'm not likely to join the Grassley bill. The Grassley bill will not pass, and I just think it's a distraction. The most immediate question for me is, the president is a pit bull. He's won. He's caught the car. The question is, what's he gonna do with the car? Look. That is a shitty answer in so many different ways. But the main one is, the whole idiom, &quot;the dog that caught the car,&quot; is based on the fact dogs have no plan for what to do after they catch it. That is damning enough alone. No one says, &quot;He's like the dog that caught the car&quot; as phase one of the dog's long-term strategy to reshore manufacturing. Also, you're a co-equal branch of government. It is your job to stop that dog, not stand back and say, &quot;I don't know, guys, let him cook.&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) &quot;There's always the chance of an Air Bud situation here.&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Look, I don't know where things are going to go next. We're taping this on Saturday. Who knows what's happened between now and when you are seeing this. Maybe Trump will have rolled the tariffs back even further. Maybe he'll have put even bigger new ones on mangoes. What is clear is that he's destabilizing our economy with no real plan of action. And all I'll say is, if our next episode opens up with me sitting next to a chart of the Nasdaq and Miss Piggy, -it means we are fucked. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="foreign [Music] story tonight concerns crime Batman's adversary and also his Kink come on you think someone dresses in a rubber suit just to avenge their parents he's a furry with a gadget belt grow up now with the midterm elections fast approaching tough on crime rhetoric has been a key feature of Republican attack ads often highlighting one policy in particular bail reform do you feel safe Mandela Barnes would eliminate cash bail setting accused criminals free into the community before trial landsman wants to end cash bail putting dangerous criminals back on the Street Beasley supports ending cash bail letting criminals out of jail using cashless bail and his own Lawless policies Bragg has put violent criminals back on our streets and has turned neighborhoods into danger zones okay of course everything seems scarier if you end it with a shot of a body bag for instance Doc McStuffins not a scary show but if they didn't episode said in the McStuffins morgue it's going to have nightmares for a while now these attack ads come at a crucial juncture for the movement to reduce the use of cash bail because since 2011 at least 19 States and dozens of local jurisdictions have adopted bail reform policies but many places have recently begun rolling back those reforms because amid the recent spike in certain categories of crime critics are pointing at bail reform as the major cause of it liberal lawmakers ended the bail for most offenses they created a revolving door of criminality it's almost impossible to get arrested and then put in jail unless you kill somebody it is baffling to me that we have politicians that aren't supporting policies that are going to make things better in fact they're doing the opposite we're still supporting bail reform and defunding the police there's a correlation between the bail reform and what's happening in our city it seems so clear that it is and to destroy the country's finest Police Department is is a crime I think on its own it's clear to a man with resting concussion face he honestly looks like he's studying a full body mirror desperately trying to find his penis it's now to the point where any crime mentioned on Fox News gets linked to battle reform whether it is relevant or not even after Nancy Pelosi's husband was attacked with a hammer on Friday morning by someone who was not out on bail they had a republican Congressman on to say this when you let dangerous criminals out out on the streets you know with bail and not put him in prison you're just asking for this this sort of incident to happen no he's wrong about a few things there again the suspect was not out on bail also no one gets bailed out of prison that is where convicted people go and finally choosing a narrow tie knot when your head is that big makes it look like a birthday balloon sailing over the capital Dome that is three big mistakes from that very grumpy balloon but given that you are hearing that misleading attacks like that absolutely everywhere right now there is a real chance of all the progress we've made being undone so tonight let's look at bail reform and this is actually our Second Story on bail we first covered it back in 2015 but maybe see that particular episode because you were too busy watching the 69th annual Tony Awards airing the same night where and this is true Kristen Chenoweth and Alan opened the show by highlighting one particular celebrity in the audience and the producer of Finding Neverland Harvey Weinstein [Applause] [Music] a week box office receipts for the last three months [Applause] yeah my point is it's been a minute since then so if you missed our first story here's a brief recap if you are arrested in order to be released a waiting trial you're often required to leave a certain amount of money or bail with the court as collateral with the idea that it'll help ensure that you return and there are plenty of issues with this system starting with the fact the bail hearings can be arbitrary at best because one you might assume that a judge would carefully weigh someone's charges and circumstances to decide whether there is any reason that they should not be released the reality can look very different take this hearing in Dallas we're going to bleep the person's last name here but I'm going to show you her hearing in its entirety penny you're here on a state jail felony theft with previous conviction spawned at five thousand dollars that's it that was the whole thing and I don't know exactly how long it should take to put a price on someone's freedom but it probably shouldn't fit neatly into an Instagram story and the thing is that's not an outlier overall it is common for bail hearings to last only a few minutes with no defense counsel present and they can be conducted with Incredible pettiness just watch this hearing from 2016 in Harris County Texas where a woman had been charged with a misdemeanor of possessing less than two ounces of marijuana there's probable cause bond is a thousand dollars are you requesting a court appointed lawyer sure give me a yes or no yeah give me a yes or no yeah I asked a question that calls for a yes or a no I don't expect anything but a yes or no not a maybe so or a yell or anything yeah or something I heard what you said your bond just went up to two thousand dollars okay first all the way off second yeah means yes it's not only she gave you a thumbs up and wait you knew what she meant you just wanted to be a dick and if you cannot afford a bail that a sassy judge felt like dishing out to you you might be forced to turn to a bail bondsman the way their business model works is that they will post your bail for you in exchange for a fee that's normally around 10 percent of it money by the way you don't get back no matter what the outcome of your case it is a lucrative business which writes in about two billion dollars per year almost none of which goes into their spending on ads like these they say I broke the law police are on my tail looks like I'm going to the county jail I gotta go Bail Bonds who I called and the courtesy and services [Music] you know it's not the direction that I would have taken for the Barbie movie but I trust Greta go Wing's Vision on this although credit to all three songwriters there you can find all those tracks on now that's what I call songs written by the nephew of the guy who owns a bail bond agency volume 25. but if you can't afford to pay a bail bondsman to get you out you are stuck and many many people are in that situation which has led to a truly staggering statistic this graph shows local jail inmates in the United States in the past 20 years that population has shot way up and there's something surprising about that rise you can see it only if you look at inmates with convictions around 1999 that population leveled off meaning most of the rise came from this group non-convicted prisoners every day in the U.S nearly half a million people sitting in local jails haven't been convicted of anything it's true in fact right now roughly two-thirds of our jail population on any given day are people who haven't been convicted of a crime and most of them are there because they simply couldn't afford to bail themselves out which is terrible we shouldn't hold people captive in shitty conditions simply because they can't bow their way out that is what Spirit Airlines is for what all this means is that a simple arrest even for a crime that you did not commit can destroy your life because even a short amount of time in jail can completely turn it upside down and it's often not a short amount of time take Marvin Mayfield he was arrested for a burglary that he insists he didn't commit and he got stuck in Rikers for nearly a year before you went in you you had started a job you had secured in a place had a car right what happened to Oliver all of those things my job my car and my place were all gone after 11 months I couldn't hold on to it it's true he was in there for 11 months and obviously no job is cool with you just not showing up for 11 months unless of course you're this lazy and and all of this is before you get to the fact that holding someone pre-trial can give a prosecutor a huge amount of Leverage in obtaining a guilty plea again Marvin Mayfield maintains he was innocent but he pled guilty anyway and when you hear him explain why it makes sense after 11 months they said that if you plead guilty today you get time served and go home so your option was to stay in and fight this cave or you can go home today but another guilty plea another guilty plea to a felony on my record the worst and hardest blow of everything let's complete guilty to something I didn't do just to stop that suffering and I get that if I've been held in Rikers for 11 months with no trial and no end in sight I confess to anything if it meant going home Lindberg baby snatched it JFK Captain Zodiac Killer it me just please let me go home and yes I can see it too there is a resemblance except I'm kidding I look nothing like the Zodiac Killer and you will agree with that if you know what's good for you so cash bail is arbitrary destructive and basically criminalizes poverty and that is without getting into the massive racial disparities involved here and when you take all of this together you can understand why so many jurisdictions passed some form of bail reform over the last few years and notably in some places it was done with bipartisan support in 2014 New Jersey passed a bill that has since cut the number of people in its jails by half and it was championed by a surprising figure no longer must you stay in jail for minor offenses longer than you would have if you would actually be convicted of the crime which you're accused of committing just because your family doesn't have 500 to post bail yeah to his real credit Chris Christie supported by reform and remember this is the same Chris Christie who thought it was a good idea to be Pro traffic jam got photographed enjoying a beach that have been close to the public by a government shutdown and was the first major Republican candidate to endorse this historic whoopsy the right side of History has to be pretty obvious if even Chris Christie can find it and yet in many places the backlash to these reforms has been Swift and ugly and it always takes the same form you saw earlier fear-mongering about how reforming cash bail means that violent criminals are going to be wantingly set loose on the streets to reoffend but every part of that is much more complicated than it sounds for starters a huge amount of people in jail are stuck there on simple misdemeanors or non-violent charges and even when it comes to violent felony charges those happen on a very broad spectrum from murder to Simply Be involved in a fight and importantly being charged with something does not necessarily mean that you are guilty of it that is for a trial to decide yet too many people are only too happy to blur the line between charge and conviction early this year Chicago mayor Laurie Lightfoot did exactly that when criticizing pre-trial release programs in Cook County which implemented its battle reforms back in 2017. the mayor saying judges should not allow people charged with violent crimes to walk free on bail or electronic monitoring because if they're charged they're guilty when those case charges are brought these people are guilty and of course they're entitled to a presumption of innocence of course they're entitled to their day in court but residents in our community are also entitled to safety hold on you can't say someone's guilty and then say they're entitled to a presumption of innocence those two ideas just cannot coexist you can't be guilty and innocent at the same time just like you can't be hungry and full or tall and short or British and happy it's one or it's the other believe me and Illinois's bail conversation has only gotten more heated now that a Statewide law eliminating the use of cash bail is set to take effect in January Republicans have called it The Purge law and have attacked it in some pretty gross ways including these unusual mail list of Voters papers they've been delivered under different names this one the Chicago City Wire they all claim to have real data and real news but it's also a campaign message not a real newspaper there are two pages of photos of men mostly black and Latino who according to the paper will be released on bond into Page County the controversial newspaper like mailings are from Republican strategist Dan Prof who runs the people who play by the rules pack Wow first that is strikingly racist and second those mailers were complete horseshits they say to the new law mandates murder suspects awaiting trial be released from jail which it does not they also feature a list of charges that they claimed were non-detainable but the truth is that in Illinois as in most places that have passed bail reform for serious and violent crimes suspects can still be jailed pre-trial if they are considered a public safety risk or likely to flee so those claims were basically the more most misleading thing to appear in newsprint since the idea that Dagwood could pull Blondie come on look at him and then look at her there's just no way or ten and Dagwood's to buy Funny Pages standards she married down a long way down and to see just how successfully Bale reform opponents can demagogue this issue just look here in New York the Big cuckoo City that go honk honk this state's male reform law took effect on New Year's Day of 2020 and just eight days later long before there was any data on its impacts state legislators were out there trying to get it repealed I think people are getting scared I think people are feeling unsafe and more unsafe as each day goes by we're going to hammer this I want to be clear we're going to hammer this every single day we're going to make the point that this is what the public cares about that was just eight days in so unless a ton of people chose the New Year's resolution be scared of bail reform and actually stuck with it past January 3rd to equally unrealistic scenarios I'm pretty sure that Suffolk County Carl McLaughlin here is hammering away at thin air and the thing is violent crime did rise in New York in 2020 just like it did everywhere else in America both in places that passed by reform and in places that didn't and yet the NYPD relentlessly labeled bail reform the cause it's then commissioned a Dermot Shay repeatedly took to the press to label it a major reason for increases in crime and gun violence but when the New York Post checked those claims using the nypd's own data they found that in the first six months of 2020 out of 528 shooting incidents exactly one had been committed by someone released under bail reform and that wasn't the only time that Shea was misleading he also went on a local Morning Show here to suggest that the suspect in a purse snatching was out on bail he has 11 open court cases right now think about that how is this allowed to how is this allowed to continue to to to to Foster like this well one side will say as long as he shows up at Court then everything is working well and I would I would say that everything is not working well the lemon open court cases is something that you don't want to deal with someone that we wouldn't want to encounter on the streets now that may well sound scary to you but I've got some good news they found that guy with 11 open cases it was actually pretty easy to do because it turns out he was already locked up in Rikers at the time the crime took place so she accused the wrong guy entirely but I'm sure New York slept much safer knowing that that guy was safely behind the same bars he was already behind before just two days after that interview Shea had to appear before the state legislator and interestingly all the fear-mongering and Bluster that he'd spread on newspapers and TV completely collapsed in a forum where he was actually expected to answer honestly were there people out uh who who with no bail for example or Bill being said and they made bail I don't know um and then committed another shooting and were arrested again for basically the same crime when you look at who we arrest for crimes it's going to be small numbers when you look at the the entirety of how many shooting arrests we make and the percentage it's not dramatic I'm sorry the percentage is not dramatic you are constantly claiming battle reform was driving up shootings there are Hermits on mountaintops you know exactly two things all of reality is but the brief dance of light across the water surface and Dermot Shea says bio reform is responsible for the rising crime in New York and you would think he'd be embarrassed by being forced to admit that the percentage is not dramatic but just two months later he was back on TV saying this is bail reform what is leading to more shootings 100 more gun possessions happening 100 100 there is no doubt well which is it damn it are the numbers not dramatic always better reform 100 leading two more shootings because those things are mutually exclusive the only place where not dramatic and a hundred percent can exist at the same time is in Kristen Stewart's whole General Vibe she's giving it her all but she's also giving us absolutely nothing it's totally amazing and the problem is all of this the exaggerated claims and The Sensational headlines have made a real impression on people public approval of bail reform in this state has plummeted and the state legislature has now rolled back portions of the law twice and that is the thing it's hard to overcome the emotional impact of the claim that bail reform harms Public Safety and I'm not saying that you can't find isolated instances of individuals who have been rearrested for new crimes while out awaiting trial you can do that and anytime someone is a victim of a crime that is terrible but if Public Safety is genuinely your priority cash bail has never fundamentally been about that for all the ads currently claiming that people charged with violent crimes and now walking the streets they always were as long as they had enough money to make bail under too many places current systems a person facing a marijuana misdemeader who doesn't have two thousand dollars is going to get stuck inside a jail but a Serial sex offender who makes I don't know hypothetically a million dollars a week in finding Netherland receipts gets to stay at home and when you pull back and look at the overall figures of where the bail reform has any statistically significant link to crimes the answer so far has been pretty conclusively no one analysis looked at studies in seven different jurisdictions and none of them found that bail reforms lead to a meaningful increase in crime and research has even shown that if you can avoid unnecessarily jailing people you can actually reduce the likelihood of future arrests which does make sense does it because if you don't upend people's lives by needlessly locking them up for pre-trial they're in a much better position to stay out of trouble in Harris County Texas the place where you saw that dick is Judge earlier researchers found that after cash bail was drastically reduced in their misdemeanor courts there was actually a six percent decrease in new prosecutions of people over the three years following their arrest so it works out better for absolutely everybody but I do get that those stats don't sound nearly as flashy over footage of a crime scene you can't make a crime ad that looks like this do you feel safe you should study after study shows bail reform has not been linked to an increase in crime and arrest rates pre and post-reform have either remained identical or slightly dropped and this dead body it's just 70 pounds of ham in the shape of a man it's honest but it doesn't pack quite the same punch does it and for all the fears of letting someone who is a danger onto the streets again Bell reform doesn't take away judge's ability to detain someone that they genuinely believe to be a threat in 49 states all except New York judges are allowed to consider both risk of failure to appear and Public Safety in pre-trial decisions and even in New York it was generally accepted judges did it anyway as potential dangerousness has been the de facto use of bail here for decades and reasonable people could disagree on how exactly to make those determinations but one place that some experts point to as a model is New Jersey whose system now looks like this judge Sybil Elias is weighing whether to free or detain a man who appears from the county jail by closed circuit notice there is no mention of money for bail because the new system eliminates that instead it uses information such as convictions not arrest not socioeconomic factors punched into a computer the trial court administrator will give each defendant a score of one to six for risk of reoffending and risk of skipping core even if a defendant has a high score prosecutors must ask for a detention hearing within three to five days and must present clear and convincing evidence to detain someone yeah and that seems pretty good right although I will say it is by no means perfect for one assigning people a crime score sounds like something RoboCop does right before he punches you out of a window and it's worth noting computer algorithms are not immune to buyers themselves one such system in Broward County Florida was particularly likely to falsely flag black defendants as future criminals wrongly labeling them at almost twice the rate as white defendants it was basically a racist computer which I realize is probably Elon musk's next billion dollar idea and New Jersey's approach isn't the only one that can work bow reform has looked different in Harris County and in New York but in each of those places it's resulted in fewer people behind bars and no negative impact on Public Safety the point here is if we wanted to there are multiple ways to design a system that truly prioritizes Public Safety but if you count the accused as part of the public which you really should we should be considering their safety too because terrible things happen when you are locked up pre-trial and it's not just that you can lose your job and your home you can lose your life an investigation of over 500 U.S jails founded between 2008 and 2019 they saw over 7 500 inmate deaths and of those people nearly 5 000 were never convicted of the charges on which they were being held here in New York at Rikers where most people are held pre-trial 17 people have died this year so far and I know this conference station gets heated but it's important to remember why bail reform was so important to begin with and in thinking about this story I'd like to share something that has really stuck with me because when we did our bail segment seven years ago right until the last minute we were going to include a clip of Khalif Browder now if you're not familiar with his story at 16 he was wrongly arrested for stealing a backpack now this was the clip that we were going to use of him the guy comes out of nowhere says I robbed him and the next thing you know they put in the customer I don't even know this dude router's family couldn't make the ten thousand dollars bail on the robbery charges months turned into years he tried to commit suicide several times in June he was suddenly freed with no explanation no apology no nothing they just said oh case dismissed don't worry about nothing like don't what do you mean don't worry about nothing I just took over three years of my life I didn't get to go to prom graduation nothing it was in the many years I'm never gonna get those years back never never now we pulled that clip out of the show just before typing when we found out that he killed himself the night before and his death isn't even included in any of the tallies of people who were killed by Rikers despite the fact it sure feels like it should be the collateral damage of locking so many people up pre-trial is enormous to defend this system is to defend a people wrecking machine so where do we go from here well if we're not careful we're going to go backwards which will be a huge mistake and I would argue that any future system should be built on a few basic principles first for someone charged with a low level offense we should prioritize letting them remain free pre-trial instead of defaulting to keeping them in jail second whenever any bail hearings do happen they should be longer than 10 seconds I cannot believe that has to be said out loud also people should have counsel with them at bail hearings I honestly can't believe that has to be said either and finally if someone is detained we should be Expediting their trial so that they are not waiting years for a court date I'm not saying the reform is easy or that it's simple there are going to be disagreements even among Advocates about best practices here but right now we can't even have those important conversations because all the air in the room is being taken up by fear-mongering ads fake newspapers and and confidently delivered lies from men in uniform and look even after convictions we're clearly locking far too many people up in this country but to do it before they've even been convicted of anything is proof that civil liberties only apply tangibly to the privileged and for everyone else they are entirely theoretical and anyone even trying to defend a system like this is basically morally bankrupt isn't that right Dermot 100 100 there is no doubt yeah for once I cannot argue with you there" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="our main story tonight concerns sex you know the thing that the cute little bird outside your window is constantly screaming about it's true it's yelling sex sex i'm horny who wants sex just try and remember that as your grandmother is gazing peacefully at it sex is a topic that historically we've not been very good at talking about hey you know something no what i had a wet dream last night what dream what's that oh you know this burn comes out of your penis sperm didn't your brother ever tell you about that no wait hold on you're not his brother what the then why are you talking about sperm with some random kid it feels like the main takeaway from that video should be to stay away from creepy teenagers who like to chat up neighborhood twins about their wet penis specifically tonight we're going to talk about sex work and the concept is pretty simple let's say you have sex any kind uh missionary doggy cowgirl cowboy the eagle the wheelbarrow the wild chinka teak pony the jerry seinfeld the pick-me-up that put me down mouth butt butt mouth mouth mouth butt butt butt butt mouth butt you know whatever but then that's it you go home it's fine right it's fine but let's say you have sex but afterwards you get money or a chocolate bar or one of those participation trophies way better right well too bad it's illegal very basically sex work is the exchange of sex for money or goods and in the united states a complicated patchwork of local state and federal laws makes that act illegal everywhere except for a few counties in nevada and if you think it were hold on john didn't donald sutherland and julie christie have sex for real in don't look now and also get paid at least scale wouldn't that be illegal the answer is one yes i also believe that rumor great reference and two that is actually legal because of the presence of the camera making it an art film otherwise known as porn and thus legally covered as part of free speech so basically consensual sex for money on camera is legal porn and consensual sex for money off camera is illegal sex work makes sense right wrong well exactly everything about the way we regulate sex work in this country is confusing and counterproductive and when we talk about it it's often either demonizing patronizing or just plain wrong and in some cases all three at once it was once called the world's oldest profession you know the names prostitute call girl hooker even if that didn't get your attention this right here will most are really victims people being sex trafficked okay first of all they're actually not for reasons that we'll get into later but setting that aside if you're gonna talk about someone maybe don't start the sentence by insulting them it's like saying you know him as a a weasel a stingy unlikable and today at his funeral we remember uncle todd because as long as sex work has existed so have efforts to stop it and it comes in many forms from people who object to it on moral grounds to those who associate it with crime to those who want the practice permanently ended as they believe all sex work is exploitation and absolutely cannot be done consensually but a human history's worth of shitty laws hasn't changed the fact that one sex work has always been part of society appealing to every interest in every kind of clientele and two sex workers are not a monolith people from a variety of backgrounds do it for a variety of reasons and the fact is our current system of criminalizing the trade and driving everyone underground is actually only making life harder for the most vulnerable involved and given that sex workers are and this is true people with thoughts about their own situation we thought tonight we'd actually listen to them and let's start with the fact that this is not going to be a piece about morality you you might well think that people should only have sex during a full moon wearing a three-piece suit and exclusively with their common law horse that is your business this story is going to be about the fact that sex work is inarguably labor it is a job and people do it for the same reasons that people do any job as this advocate explains sex work is inherently work it's how people feed their families is how people put clothes on their backs it's you know how people survive i mean i've been a sex worker i've been a lawyer i've served sandwiches at somewhat at subway i folded clothes at abercrombie all those are work right it's all work the main difference between sex work and working at subway is that at least in sex work you actually know what the customer's eating and yet some people feel highly uncomfortable with the very idea that sex work is labor and should therefore be treated as such just watch a new york state assemblyman struggle to even get his head around that we've got hookers roaming the capitals now now lobbying to be legalized i can't even imagine what that looks like when they're lobbying and we're talking health insurance fair wages all the things that come with it so this has really really gotten out of hand yeah can you imagine an organized group of citizens lobbying their state government for access to basic human rights this has gotten well out of hand now if you'll excuse me i have to go continue styling my hair like a famously racist cartoon now part of his reluctance there is probably his general dick vibe but it also points to something much bigger and that is the argument that as that anchor just said most sex workers are victims and what they need is someone to step in and save them and one of the biggest groups that loves to do that is the police who often position themselves as saviors for sex workers even as they are arresting and jailing them i've talked to numerous survivors that say it's it saved their life being arrested being arrested we open the door for help and if we don't do that who's gonna do it if i don't offer them help who's gonna no one there's no one gonna help them well hold on because first if that is true that no one else is going to help them then you're actually pointing at a gigantic problem that needs to be fixed because arresting someone isn't usually considered the best way of providing assistance that is why there isn't a thank you section in hallmark called for your arresting officer because i think we can all agree if there are people doing sex work who don't want to be doing it we should absolutely be aiding their transition out of that situation but the question here is are we doing that right now because let's look at some of the methods that police use in dealing with sex workers which could be traumatizing invasive and occasionally unbelievably cruel like this undercover sting from an episode of cops so uh how about a little clown action huh kaboom surveillance unit she's getting in the van right now in the front passenger seat you're not police are you uh as a matter of fact [Laughter] yeah only one of those people ended up in handcuffs and it somehow wasn't the guy who said how about some clown action before silly string and listen this is not the most important point in fact it's arguably the least but that's not a clown hat it's a cat in the hat hat and i'll admit i'm not an expert on clown attire for prostitution stings but i know a hat mistake when i see one and that ladies and gentlemen is a hat mistake exactly so it is no wonder many sex workers have trouble regarding the police as their saviors especially as cops have a reputation for acting violently or inappropriately during stings a couple years ago in arizona federal agents allegedly engaged in 17 sexual encounters with women working in massage parlors as part of an investigation disgustingly code named operation asian touch and the thing is that's not uncommon because in many states it is not specifically illegal for police officers to have sex with workers during the course of a sting operation and in some states police have protested efforts to ban the practice which is both grotesque and also a bit ironic because what they're fundamentally arguing there is that they should be able to have sex for their jobs legally in order to stop people having sex for their jobs and even without that provision the laws police can use to arrest or intimidate sex workers are shockingly brought if you work in the sex trade the threat of arrest looms large over your entire existence and this is yet another area that disproportionately affects people of color one recent investigation found that from 2016 to 2020 almost everyone arrested by the nypd for buying or selling sex was non-white one particularly problematic law is the prohibition against loitering for the purpose of prostitution it's basically a stop and frisk policy for sex workers and in new york it's written so vaguely the nypd has used it to interpret completely legal activities like talking to pedestrians or dressing provocatively as a basis for an arrest cops have used the law to arrest people because they wore black cowboy boots and black shorts and a multi-color short dress and sandals and in one case a woman was arrested because her clothes exposed her buttocks and cervix area which isn't so much a crime as it is an urgent medical emergency meanwhile in some states cops have seized condoms and used them as evidence of prostitution or even charged people with a misdemeanor called possessing an instrument of crime for carrying them and criminalizing condoms has led some sex workers to hide them or even go without as this worker in queens explains you ask where we hide our condoms we hide condoms in our private parts where they won't touch us we should be able to carry condoms to protect ourselves and to protect the people we are with you the authorities show a real lack of intelligence when they say it's a crime to carry condoms in the transgender community not carrying condoms is a death wish that is just ridiculous putting aside the fact it's a crime to carry condoms sounds like the name of a christian boy band self-released album which it absolutely does by the way what you're doing there is genuinely making sex workers jobs less safe but that is not the only way our current policies harm those that they claim to help a criminal record can limit a sex workers future opportunities should they want to leave the field because while most sex related crimes are classified as misdemeanors in some states including all these repeated arrests can result in a felony conviction and prison time and for a while in louisiana some of those arrested for doing sex work wound up having to register as sex offenders which is particularly gawling because if anyone you've seen so far tonight should be labeled a sex offender it's all the cops who've ever had sex drawing a sting and again that clown and look look i don't want to paint i don't want to paint too rosy a picture here sex work can be dangerous and we need to be talking constructively about how to make it safer in every possible way but a reason it's hard to have that conversation is that sex work so often gets conflated with something else and that is human trafficking and let me first say that of course human trafficking is real when it happens it's absolutely horrific you immediately think of jeffrey epstein and am i legally allowed to say prince andrew i'm not are you sure about that you're totally sure okay forget i said it then but but the concept of human trafficking looms large in the conversation around sex work you've probably seen massive numbers get thrown around online despite the fact experts will tell you getting an accurate count on those subjected to forced sex or labor has eluded researchers for years and look any number north of zero is clearly terrible but far too often attempts to crack down on sex trafficking will conflate it with consensual adult sex work the implicit assumption is that no sex worker has ever entered the trade by choice even when that is by their own testimony not the case and some states have even written that assumption into law in 2012 lawmakers in alaska amended their laws on promoting prostitution to replace that phrase with sex trafficking resulting in one case where a woman was charged with trafficking herself which is obviously absurd unless that is they were making a larger point about our collective lack of free will under capitalism and if it is the latter i'd say bro bro not the time not the time bro and the thing is badly written laws can have massive consequences take foster it's a federal law that was positioned as a way to crack down on sex trafficking by banning online ads that sold people into sex slavery which sounds good right what kind of monster would be against that but what it did was ban ads for all paid sex whether or not trafficking was involved it was part of a much larger push to shut down sites where sex was sold along with the shattering of backpage and craigslist personals section and while undeniably some very bad things were advertised on those sites they also enabled sex workers to find clients and communicate with them which was a much safer way for them to do that than operating on the street and if you think well okay it's bad that sex workers lost a way to stay safer but at least moves like those helped law enforcement crack down on on sex trafficking the thing is not really in the three years after foster was passed prosecutors said they'd only used it once and as for shutting down backpage that actually made it even harder to catch sex traffickers the site was us-based and was often willing to work with law enforcement to root out the bad actors and with it gone law enforcement suddenly found tracking them down to be much more difficult so now we're just trying to figure out where everybody's going so these new websites have popped up bed page which is almost an exact replica of back page then we've got one back page basically it's all of these different websites now that we don't have any agreements or search tools with and they've kind of spread out so we don't have a certain location to go look for them anymore and it's kind of a crap shoot yeah that's not ideal is it and of all the questions that that raises i would also like to ask what the is going on with her cubicle decor it involves not just this prominently displayed pimpin ave street sign which would have been weird enough on its own but also a glass goblet featuring rhinestones that spread out the phrase hold for show which is a pretty weird tone to strike for a workplace that rescues sex trafficking victims those look more like the decorations you'd find at a bachelorette party where the guests wind up vomit crying out the window of a speeding party bus and obviously law enforcement should be pursuing sex trafficking wherever it takes place but unfortunately the police will often reframe traditional prostitution stings as human trafficking ones you might remember a large sting operation a few years back of multiple massage parlors in florida in which robert kraft the owner of the patriots was charged with soliciting prostitution and the initial comments from law enforcement strongly suggested that the workers at the day spa craft went to were part of a sex trafficking ring the prosecutor was even happy to brag about their humanitarian mission in his press conference after the raid i'd like to thank the men and women of the jupiter police department for their professionalism and diligence in investigating these cases you can tell a lot about our community by the way it treats its most vulnerable individuals and that includes victims of human trafficking he's actually right you can tell a lot about a community by how it treats its most vulnerable individuals you should know months later prosecutor admitted no human trafficking arose from the investigation and kraft's misdemeanor charges were later dropped and yet the state attorney's office continued to pursue cases against the women you know the ones they were supposedly trying to rescue eventually four women who worked at that spa were arrested and jailed with three fine thousands of dollars and one ending up in ice detention and all of that is bad enough until you learn that some of the help offered to workers caught up in the largest sting consisted of this care package that included band-aids mouthwash razors and a booklet written by mega church pastor rick warren titled what on earth am i here for which is literally only helpful if inside it says to be scapegoated in a generations long morality war that has nothing to do with you and everything to do with how we as a society view sex money and power and that is hardly an exception here just listen to andrew lewis the former coordinator for the greater new orleans human trafficking task force tell the louisiana house of representatives about one sting operation that he personally witnessed what i saw was a standard operation and it was deeply troubling agents pretending to be clients set up dates with sex workers when a sex worker arrived to the hotel room they would be arrested and forced into another cold room often with very little clothing and interviewed the same agent that handcuffed them would then ask them if they had been trafficked and no matter their response they were arrested and booked at the end of the night those arrests were reported back to me as prospective victims of human trafficking even when there was no evidence of forced fraud or coercion let me be clear human trafficking does occur and likely more than we know but because we are spending a majority of our time and money on criminalizing consensual adult sex work we're not able to help those being actually forced to work in the construction agriculture and yes sex work industries in louisiana exactly he's absolutely right we clearly should not be wasting valuable resources on arresting consensual sex workers and we certainly should not be interviewing them in cold rooms while they're wearing very little clothing it turns out police aren't so much rescuing people as lightly refrigerating them and then sending them to jail and when you take all of this together it is no surprise that many workers who've been robbed or abused by clients report that they feel they can't turn to the police for help and in some cases those who have turned to the police say they deeply regret it years ago i reported a rape from a client i was supposed to be working with and i just wound up getting arrested i spent a long time in jail for for trying to report a rave and you just learn better like no way i'll deal with the cops i'll get raped a hundred times before i do them yeah she went to report a rape and ended up in jail i'd call it dystopian if it were not so american so at every turn we are making life harder both for people who want to remain in the sex trade and for those who want to leave it so how do we fix this well there are actually a few different options open to us here and let's start with the most restrictive some advocate for something called the nordic model which i know sounds like the answer leonardo dicaprio would give to the question who would you like to but the nordic model is the one that intuitively might make sense to you because it criminalizes the buying of sex but not the selling of it so we would arrest the clients but not the workers the ones that you are presumably concerned for it's been adopted in many countries including sweden finland norway and france and while it might sound good on the surface one problem with it is that sex buyers don't want to be arrested any more than sex workers do meaning that workers still have to meet clients in the shadows so for instance it is still difficult to vet them online and if you're on the street it can be even worse as this swedish sex worker explains especially for the women in the street this has been very very bad because before they had you know this classic thing hanging into the car window having the discussion this is what i'm willing to sell this is what i'm willing to do they don't have the time anymore because the clients are so jumpy so they have to get into the car drive off and then negotiate and then they're already in the car right you can't tell in a split second of looking at a car if it's safe to get in it's not like there's a bumper sticker that says my child is an honorable student and i'm a sociopath to tip you off so the truth is many sex workers don't love the nordic model another option we could go with is legalization that is where workers and clients can legally operate within certain regulations it's the model employed by amsterdam and some counties in nevada there sex workers are limited to working as independent contractors and must do so in regulated brothels typically earning 40 to 50 percent of what they bring in by servicing customers with the remainer going to the brothel if you're wondering why those brothels get to take so much it is simply because they can nevada essentially gives them a monopoly that is just one reason why sex workers tend not to be that keen on the heavily regulated legalization option either instead what many of them advocate for is something called decriminalization which very simply removes all criminal penalties for the buying and selling of consensual sex it's a model currently employed by new zealand a country that does seem to make a lot of smart choices with the glaring exception of course of choosing a national bird because what the is up with the kiwi by the way it's an incorrect duck it's what you get if a first grader was assigned to draw a bird and then just forgot my point here is in new zealand's system any sex worker can legally work for themselves or in a brothel and brothel owners have to have special certificates and verify their workers are over 18 and use safe sex practices but crucially this system means that sex workers have fundamental rights from being able to access unemployment benefits to health care to being covered by workplace protections sex workers there have successfully sued over sexual harassment they experienced in a brothel and have been able to go to the police in fact last year a man was convicted for rape in a stealthing case after he removed a condom without a sex workers consent it is a human rights centred approach that does seem to be working and a sex worker in new zealand gives credit for this to the fact that the people writing the laws did one key thing new zealand seems to be the only country that has got it right and that's because they consulted sex workers whereas any other country doesn't talk to sex workers they just make plans and laws for them without discussing it with them or caring about what they say exactly and it is sad that that is so surprising because unfortunately it seems most countries laws treat sex workers the exact same way that we treat cats on halloween that is squeezing them into bad situations without their input or consent and refusing to take their feelings into consideration when they're clearly not that happy and look i'm not saying the new zealand model is perfect that woman herself acknowledges that and there are good faith disagreements to be had over the finer points of a decriminalization policy but if we basically agree as i hope we do that making sex work safer for the people who do it is a priority it is the direction to strive toward and we're actually taking some slow steps in the right direction here new york recently repealed its loitering law california seems poised to do the same meanwhile prosecutors around the country have announced that they won't pursue certain prostitution cases and will dismiss thousands of pending ones which is great and look to those who are still uncomfortable here out of a concern that there are people who feel economically forced into sex work i totally agree with you that is a huge problem but the fact is our current laws are not addressing that if you want to do that that's a much bigger conversation to have because fundamentally the only way to make sure that people have a choice in the way they earn money is to make housing affordable health care accessible and to not burden marginalized people with criminal records that lead to a cycle of joblessness homelessness and desperation but until such time as we have that conversation and it does not seem like something enough people are itching to have right now we need to stop pursuing policies that harass in danger and occasionally refrigerate sex workers and instead start listening to what they actually want because unfortunately if we don't do that we're just going to carry on looking like a bunch of clowns you" />

it his quote weapon of mass distraction NYU Professor entrepreneur and podcast host Scott Galloway joins har sasen to break down what Trump's heads spinning constantly shifting economic policies mean for the state of American finances Christian thanks Scott Galloway thanks for being back with us last time you and I spoke we were talking about your book a drift and at that time you said America as a country isn't lost but rather a drift and unmowed and I wonder since that time has your assessment changed well you could argue that it's found Direction unfortunately I think the direction is more a direction around uh change towards a quarter of each party Dem rats are just as guilty of this as Republicans are in favor of an autocrat as long as that autocrat shares their views and I think that's sort of come to fruition here I think the the superseding of our checks and balances of different um branches of government such that one political party that is in control can sort of bypass the traditional constitutional U measures or safeguards reflects that America has become if you will more open or accepting to the notion of an autocracy I think we are pretty much in a full kind of call it maybe most generously autocracy light and uh much of America voted for this do you think that say for example what's happening in the stock market is a reflection of people's dissatisfaction with this direction that you're talking about I mean I think the snps had one of its worst weeks ever all the gains that we had since the election have practically been wiped out I wouldn't say it's dissatisfaction because that implies that they're upset about it the market is pretty unemotional and is focused on increasing earnings and uh people will buy stocks regardless sentiment sort of takes a backseat to financial considerations I think what's happening in the market is first off you have to acknowledge that even with these draw Downs the market is still substantially up uh from where it was just 6 months ago it has come back from pre-election the Trump bump has been wiped out I think what you're seeing quite frankly is a couple things the market just may have gotten quite frankly overvalued but I think the thing that kind of triggered the selloff if you will is what appears to be irrational non-economic decisions around tariffs where we're basically ripping up these 80y yearlong alliances with trusted economic partners that engage in mutually beneficial trade and that these are not only uh a bad idea in the specific agreements were're tra we're repping up but America's losing a very important brand Association for economic relationships or geopolitical negotiations and that is one of consistency there was an estimate by the uh Yale budget lab that these tariffs are going to cost average households somewhere between ,600 and $2,000 every year it's also estimated to reduce our GDP as much as $110 billion dollar a year you know and one of the uh lines of thinking that I hear from members of the administration is look if these short-term hits can get us better leverage to try to negotiate longer term prosperity for America this will have been worth it does that make sense well to be fair tariffs aren't all bad sometimes you need tariffs as a hammer to restore symmetry to an asymmetric trade relationship uh Biden maintained the initial Trump tariffs I think some of Trump's initial instincts around the asymmetry of the trading relationship between China and the US were accurate uh what this is though is just plain non-economic I was a graduate student instructor in macro microeconomics in graduate school we used to talk about tariffs I imagine the same way that uh professors in medical school talk about leeches like can you believe they were stupid enough to actually think this would this would work and the notion that we're putting on ourselves in a position to negotiate some big beautiful deal I don't think it's going to work because uh Trump Trump tore up the Iran deal and now appears to want it again the tariffs are off and on I just don't think we're being we're seen now as a reliable partner that can be counted on with the economic livelihood of your country think about Canada we're not even able to give Canada a good reason for why he's doing this the kind of the stated reason from the administration for what is tariffs that will hurt our economy and dramatically hurt Canad the Canadian economy is that the unchecked the unchecked transfer a fenel across the Canadian border you could take the amount of fentanyl that's come across the US Canadian border and put it in a backpack estimates are that it's less than 1% and to alienate your closest allies think about Canada Ari it's it's the largest undefended border in the world what does that tell you about our relationship to this point with Canada they joined us in World War I they were in World War II before us training Allied Pilots they were side by side with us in Kosovo in our fights against the Taliban amazing economic Prosperity we have NBA and NHL teams in America and in Canada respectively and I love that question Hari that was presented by a holocaust Survivor around evaluating who are your real friends and that is it comes down to one question for her would they hide me and that's a really puncturing kind of rattling question to evaluate your friends by but by that standard Canada is one of our best friends in the Iran hostage crisis they hid American diplomats and under great personal risk made uh uh ensured their safe escape from Iran and they stayed behind and had they been caught there was a good chance they would have been hanged from from crane so Canada has hid us they are real friends and for us to recklessly irrationally and inexplicably try to hurt them in exchange for what might be some big beautiful deal it's it it is the the damage here to unwind and repair will take the better part of the 80 years it took to make these amazing prosperous relationships that quite frankly the administration in my view is irrationally taken for granted so how does the world deal with this kind of uncertainty so the vix which measures volatility as evidenced by trading in options has spiked and the Atlanta fed has a a metric for trying to project what GD GDP growth might look like in the coming year in the last 45 days it's gone from a projected growth of GDP of 4% which is really robust growth to negative -2.8 the economy is Contracting faster than it has since the co lockdowns obviously the markets uh the markets are chilled I think this Silver Lining here I always like to ask myself what could go right because over the medium and the long term the majority of the metrics in the world do get better and it's easy for someone like me to try and sound smarter than they are by always being negative so I think it's an important question to say what could go right and I think the Silver Lining here is that Europe is in fact becoming a union because they realize they can no longer count on the military economic umbrella or the geopolitical consistency of America America spends about $800 billion NATO and all EU Nations spent about 430 on the military and quite frankly they have gotten I would call lazy and expectant around the military umbrella being provided by the US they now are convinced they can no longer count on the US to be pro-democracy and make what are rational decisions and honor this kind of post World War II order they realize they can no longer count on or expect the military umbrella of the US they will dramatically increase their spending on Military which I think will have stimulative and spillover effects I think the Silver Lining here is that Europe is going to begin to command the space it occupies keep in mind the total GDP of European nations is 19 trillion the GDP of Russia is 2 trillion so there's no reason why Europe if it gets its act together shouldn't be able to push back and be a credible opposing threat to an economy that is again smaller than the size of Canada Russia you've been pointedly critical of Elon Musk in the past several months and really even a couple of years but in light of the Department of government efficiency I think there is a consensus that people on both sides of the aisle are interested in making government function better making it it more responsive and efficient um but what have you seen over the past couple of months that give you pause on whether this is going to have longer term effects and perhaps unintended consequences well every Administration from uh Clinton Gore has had some sort of task force to try and root out uh uh inefficiency fraud and waste so far if doge is an audit of the US government then the US government has been issued a clean bill of health because this wall of receipts is surprisingly scanned the first one said they were claimed they were saving $8 billion it ended up to be 8 million of spending that had already been spent and then numbers two three and four on the list of DOA receipts that have since been taken down were just blatantly false the Wall Street Journal reports that so far Doge has found 2.6 billion in cost savings you could Sixx the savings from Doge to date by cutting off all subsidies to Tesla which has cost taxpayers $15 billion but I think it's more mendacious than that are I mean yeah we all like the idea of cutting waste but I believe it's a misdirect and that is while we're all kind of have our hair on fire and looking over here at DOA 2.6 billion the the indignance the emotional upset of firing good people doing good work or the just the general incompetence of laying off air traffic controllers we firing people over seeing our nuclear stockpile and then trying to hire them back I believe for the most most part it's a strategic weapon of mass distraction to get you to look over here as the Trump Administration is planning to increase our deficit by $800 billion doll a year with tax cuts to the wealthy all of this is a misdirect it's it's sad it's unfortunate it's incompetent it's an these savings are elcer right but at the end of the day I think it's a purposeful distraction from the tax cuts they are trying to put forward at the expense of future Generations do you think that Elon is getting a net positive benefit from this because on the one hand he has gained incredible proximity to power and in fact power for his $250 million contribution to the campaign on the other hand the value from Tesla shares have been evaporating because he seems to have alienated a huge chunk of the people that used to buy his cars I think the political calculus here was miscalculated ated on his part we were talking about Nike off Mike when Nike embraced Colin Kaepernick which was a political position they had done the math and that is 23ds of their revenue comes from people outside of the US or people under the age of 30 none of whom thought the US had it right on race relations so they purposely tickled the sensors or cemented their kind of progressive ideology among a customer base that they knew would appreciate that musk has made exactly the wrong calculation and that is three4 of Republicans would never consider buying an EV anyway his his largest market is California and sales are down 11% in Europe sales are off 75% in Germany in between 20 and 30 and other big EU markets so essentially Tesla has shed a third of its value in the last month it's given back all of its gain since since the Trump election what is really going to hurt his pocketbook is that it has now jumped the lab and is now starting to infect uh SpaceX specifically starlink who is seeing contracts being cancelled by people ranging from Canada to Poland is saying we can't count on you for something as important as Communications and Battlefield Communications technology so they're reconsidering their starlink uh contract so I would argue the political calculus here from Mr musk was wildly inaccurate and he is seeing a lot of his wealth evaporate uh because the negative associations of musk have are starting to infect not only the Tesla brand but also the SpaceX brand so I think it was an irrational decision from a purely economic standpoint here we were at the inauguration and we saw lined up next to the president literally The Who's Who of technology and billionaires standing next to him and I wonder is this just business as usual or was it you know is this different than what the the carnegies or the Rockefellers might have done a hundred years ago is it just the the Optics that are different now or is there something more structurally uh more destructive it's a fair question because I think a lot of people on the right would maybe fairly say look we may be more transparent and Brazen about it but it's nothing that lobbyists and lawyers the media haven't been doing for the left they've just done it more quietly and elegantly when the most powerful or wealthy Tech Executives in the world are all willing to be intimidated into donating to inaugural Campaign which they didn't do in 2020 despite publicly stating their politics more in line with Biden than Trump when they're willing to be parad around for the benefit of the Trump Administration you have what I'd call a domino of cowardice and that is they text my Pivot co-hosts that they hate themselves and and you know that they hate showing up in the inauguration and then they show up uh and then that leads gives Linda Yaro the CEO of X the confidence to demand that an ad agency advertise on their platform or they risk having their merger blocked by her buddy who has proximity to the president what we don't want to acknowledge in America is that rights and democracy are now a function of how much money you have full stop uh the wealthy technocrats and the 0.1% feel as if and quite frankly it may be true that they are protected by the law but not bound by it whereas the rest of the 99% are bound by the law but not protected by I wonder getting back to those CEOs for a second I wonder if they now or will always have a shield that says Hey listen I'm I'm just doing what's right for my shareholders this is my fiduciary responsibility so I give a million dollars to the campaign or to the inauguration you know what it could help our stock down the line or if I don't give the million dollars it could certainly hurt my stock down the line and that's as CEO that's who I'm supposed to uh you know be loyal to I think that's a fair argument Hari uh but what I would ask is they don't ever use the term stakeholders again remember all this BS over the last 10 years where they started talking about stakeholders well all right the country democracy poor people people who aren't politically connected people who don't have stock options in apple the 99% that only own 10% of stocks are you supposed to be also be representing them are you supposed to have some Fidelity to the values the rule of law democracy checks and balances that help get you so rich in the first place because let me list all of the CEOs who have filled this leadership void and have said I am more concerned about the long-term health of America and what it means for private and public companies and I'm I'm not going to engage in this sort of klepto this kleptocracy I'm not going to be an agent so here are some of the CEOs who have filled this leadership void okay list over at some point at some point these people many of whom talk about running for president many of whom claim to be great Americans many many of them constantly voice their gratitude for what is the um the best experiment and the best platform in the world for establishing Economic Security and rights at some point you'd like to think they're going to show some Fidelity to the democracy and principles and rule of law and checks and balances that played a huge role in their wealth but instead they default to this quite frankly cold comfort of well I'm a fiduciary for shareholders let's be honest just kiss his ass give him a million bucks and stay out of the CR hairs yeah it's probably good in the short term the question is at what point does someone stand up and say okay I'm representing the bottom 99% I'm representing democracy and I'm representing what America is supposed to stand for and paying it forward based on the incredible rule of law democracy Fair competition that got me here in the first place so I think the the the Domino of cowardice here in the private sector is not only shocking it's just very disappointing author and professor and podcast host of both propy and pivot Scott Galloway thanks so much for your time thank you har always good to see you [Music] [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Chinese soldiers preparing for battle. This is what Beijing wants to show the world. With each military drill, China is drawing ever-closer circles around Taiwan. China has a clear goal: to gain control over the island. China will surely be reunified. Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that? Yes. That’s the commitment we made. The United States is building up its military presence in the region. And is practicing how to sink Chinese ships. We're not going to come to an agreement over Taiwan. Wait for the unification to be achieved. Peacefully, I hope. Not peacefully, I dread. But why are these two superpowers so fixated on Taiwan? What's in it for China and the U.S.? And how do people in Taiwan feel about it? It's Taiwan's location that makes it a geopolitical flashpoint. Taiwan has 23 million inhabitants – and its main island lies only 130 km away from China's mainland. These tiny islands right off the coast are also under Taiwanese control. And Chinese military drills around the whole of Taiwan are getting bigger and more frequent. In recent videos released by China's People's Liberation Army, Beijing has threatened to encircle the island. It sees Taiwan as part of its territory and says it's ready to use force, if necessary, to get it back. We'll talk more about the history and Taiwan's status later. For now, you need to know that in the late 1940s, there was a civil war in China between Communists and Nationalists. The Communists won and took control of mainland China. And the Nationalists fled to Taiwan. That laid the groundwork for today's tensions. The U.S. has an ambiguous policy towards Taiwan. Since the late 1970s, it has recognized Communist Beijing as the only legitimate government of China. But it has informal ties with Taiwan and is seen as the island's protector. Okay. Let's go back to the map to understand why the U.S. and China can't quit Taiwan. In some ways, Taiwan's strategic importance is about three chokepoints around the island. To the west, there's the Taiwan Strait. It's a key trade route for both Beijing and Taiwan – and also for everybody else. Almost all the world's biggest container ships pass through here. To the north, the Miyako Strait. It runs between Taiwan and these Japanese islands. And in the south, the Bashi Strait. It runs between Taiwan and the Philippines. For China, these two straits on either side of Taiwan are key strategic gateways to the Pacific Ocean. Taiwan is in the middle of the Chinese coastline, which is very important. This is Victor Gao. He is a former Chinese diplomat and vice-president of the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing think-tank some say is close to the Chinese Communist Party. Taiwan Island faces the Pacific directly, and if Taiwan is occupied by a foreign country, for example, it interrupts the continuity of the Chinese coastline and also prevents the Chinese access directly to the Pacific Ocean. The U.S. says it has no troops permanently stationed in Taiwan but the island plays an important role in U.S. strategy. To understand why, let's look at the military bases in the region. Here are some of China's main naval bases close to its coast. And the U.S. has some of its key bases in South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. If you connect the dots, you'll see the U.S. bases form a chain. Taiwan sits at the heart of what we call in the United States the 'first island chain'. David Sacks is an expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank in New York City. In the past, he worked at the American Institute in Taiwan, which serves as the de facto U.S. embassy on the island. If you look at the first island chain, these are all formal treaty allies of the United States, or close partners, in the case of Taiwan. And with that the way it is, the United States can project power close to China's shores, protect its allies and its interests. Conversely, it's very difficult for the Chinese military to project power outside of the first island chain and threaten the United States physically or our interests in the Indo-Pacific. To strengthen this 'island chain', the U.S. is expanding military cooperation with Japan and the Philippines, which are also wary of what they see as China's expansionist goals. For example, just last year the U.S. gained access to military bases in the north of the Philippines. Right next to the Bashi Strait, one of those Chinese gateways to the Pacific Ocean we mentioned. Here you can see American and Philippine troops conducting exercises in the waters nearby earlier this year. They even sank an old Chinese-built ship that the Philippine navy used in the past: a clear message to Beijing. And obviously, China is not happy about the U.S. 'island chain' strategy. Come on! We are not living in the 19th century. We are not living in the imperialist century. Using this outmoded way of thinking as if you can set up a chain to block, for example, China from accessing the Pacific Ocean, is ludicrous. Beijing is rapidly modernizing its navy, in part to be able to break through the chain of U.S. allies. For example, with the 'Fujian' aircraft carrier. Here it is on sea trials earlier this year. It's China's third aircraft carrier and the biggest ship in the Chinese navy. The number one objective here is to keep the United States out of the region during a conflict. So, what we call 'anti-access/area denial': Prevent the United States from being able to defend our treaty allies and partners. So to sum up: Taiwan's location makes it essential to both sides as they try to gain the upper hand in the region. But the rivalry is also about money. Big money. Economically, the small island also has an outsize importance for both China and the U.S. – even though neither officially recognizes Taiwan as a country. Both China and the U.S. have significant trade links with Taiwan. And much of that business comes from just one company: TSMC – Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. It produces microchips. Taiwan makes 90 % of the most advanced ones in the world. Both the U.S. and China are dependent on them. And so is everybody else. There's a good chance TSMC's semiconductors are in the device that you're using to watch this video right now. They are in new cars, fridges, and fighter jets. Everywhere. They're needed to develop new AI models. And U.S. leaders worry that losing Taiwan to China could permanently shift economic tides against them. We don't assume that a region under Chinese hegemony would be open to U.S. trade and investment. I think that China would reorder the region. They want the United States to basically supply them with raw materials that are turned into manufactured goods in China and then sold all over the world. And there isn't really a role for the United States or other industrialized countries in that. The Chinese economy is already larger than that of the United States if we use purchasing power parity. China produced more than 30 million cars in 2023. The Americans probably produced less than half of that. So why should anyone believe, they can have some benefit of picking a fight with China? No, there is no benefit. China does not look at Taiwan from an economic or commercial perspective. So why is Taiwan so important to Beijing then? To understand, let's dive back into history. China lost control over Taiwan during what it calls the 'Century of Humiliation' – these caricatures of China being carved up by various foreign powers might explain why. From the mid-19th until the mid-20th century, China was plagued by invasions and internal disputes. This is important, because that notion of humiliation still plays a big role in Chinese state ideology even today. In 1895, Japan took Taiwan from China and made it a colony. After World War II, the Allies forced Japan to give it back. But at the time, China was in the middle of a civil war: The government of the Republic of China, or ROC, was led by Nationalists under Chiang Kai-Shek. Mao Zedong led Communist forces against them. In 1949, the victorious Communists marched into Beijing and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland. The defeated government of the Republic of China fled to Taiwan. That's why there are two governments that call themselves 'China': one on the mainland, the People's Republic of China, or PRC. And on Taiwan, the Republic of China, or ROC. The PRC government in Beijing sees Taiwan as a breakaway province and says there is only one China. Even though they have never actually been in charge in Taiwan. Most of the world accepts this One China policy, including the U.S. They don't recognize Taiwan as an independent country. Wait. So why is the U.S. supporting Taiwan then? There is also a history to that. After the Civil War, the U.S. initially saw the Nationalist government in Taiwan as the only real China, rejecting the Communist government on the mainland. U.S. soldiers were even stationed in Taiwan under a common defense pact. The change came in the 1970s. The U.S. sought closer relations with Beijing. That meant closing the U.S. embassy in Taiwan and pulling out U.S. troops. Still, informal ties persisted, like that de facto embassy. And the U.S. still guarantees to sell Taiwan weapons. But they have a deliberately ambiguous policy on whether they would defend Taiwan. It's meant to prevent China from invading and Taiwan from declaring independence. But that strange limbo has been the status quo in Taiwan for decades. And it's created realities on the ground. Taiwan developed from a Nationalist authoritarian regime into one of the strongest democracies in the region. There are elections, a free press, and civil liberties. Taiwan was first in Asia to legalize same-sex-marriage. This year a progressive party was reelected for a third term, vowing to maintain that tense status quo. DW's Taiwan correspondent Yuchen Li can give us a sense of things on the ground. Here in Taiwan, the atmosphere is very different from what you might read in the headlines. The tension has become part of daily life. One key reason is that people in Taiwan have been living under the threat of the Chinese Communist Party for many decades. The majority of the Taiwanese prefer to maintain the status quo with China, but how to do so is a rather polarized debate. If China wants to bully us, at least we still have the U.S. and Japan. They are our friends. I've always been skeptical of America. But we have no choice, if we can't get stronger or have enough forces. It's tricky. We should have a friendly relationship with both of them. It's always been like this. Ever since the founding of the country, we've been caught up in this drama. But one thing is clear for many Taiwanese – Taiwan's voice is usually drowned out. Amid the U.S.-China rivalry, many feel that Taiwan is only 'a pawn' in the game, and no matter what comes next, the island should have the right and autonomy to decide its own fate. But there is one more factor that stands in the way of that. Taiwan represents something for both superpowers. Taiwan has embraced the U.S. worldview, which promotes democracy and capitalism. China is a one-party system and a socialist market economy. And a major Chinese Communist Party narrative centers on Taiwan. Remember the Century of Humiliation we mentioned, when China lost Taiwan? Well Chinese President Xi Jinping sees bringing Taiwan back into the fold as an important step in overcoming that humiliation. This is part of the so-called 'national rejuvenation', a revival of the Chinese nation as a great power. With Xi Jinping, I think, you did see some impatience. Xi Jinping has clearly put himself forward as a leader of, you know, world historic importance. He views himself in a very similar way, I think, to Vladimir Putin, that he's just not a run-of-the-mill leader. He's transformative. No one, no country, no single human being will be able to block the peaceful reunification of China or the non-peaceful reunification of China. So, we should all call on the United States: &quot;Don't play with fire!&quot; But for the U.S., supporting Taiwan also means keeping up key alliances in the region and promoting democracy. If China were to invade and annex Taiwan, we would see that democracy extinguished, and it could send chilling effects to democracies around the world. You would have deep questions being asked in South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines on whether they can rely on the United States for their security. Because of where Taiwan is and what it represents, neither China nor the U.S. isable back down. And the rest of us are stuck watching the superpower rivalry play out." />

standing up for the rights of Palestinian people joining center stage today is Jeremy Corbin one of the most polarizing figures in modern British politics throughout his political career from being on the political fringe to his tenure as leader of the UK's Labor Party and now as an independent MP Corbin has always campaigned for economic justice peace and a British foreign policy that tries to atone for its imperial legacy in this episode we discuss the price paid for being vocal in supporting and standing in solidarity with Palestine while Corbin also speaks about the future of Europe and how the continent may need to unite in the face of a US-led trade war jeremy Corbin welcome to Center Stage absolute pleasure to be here thank you for inviting me you've been an advocate for Palestinian statethood for decades what would you say the past 18 months have meant for that fight i think the past 18 months has been probably the worst time ever ever for Palestinian people and the loss of life in Gaza and increasingly in the West Bank and not forgetting the plight of people in the refugee camps has just been truly atrocious what it has done is awoken the rest of the world to the plight of Palestinian people so in a perverse kind of way it's probably meant that uh Palestinian recognition more universally is probably nearer now than it was but that's on the back of uh at least 60,000 deaths and the blockade of Gaza now gone on for over 50 days no water no food no power no medicines nothing for 50 days and so I find an element in my mind of disgust at the way in which the world's powers including Britain have continued supplying weapons to Israel knowing full well that they're in breach of international law and bombing civilian targets in Gaza you mention the position of the British government you've been demanding an inquiry into what you describe as complicity what would that inquiry achieve what would that investigation reveal would it bring justice the reason I put it forward is is this i was very involved in opposition to the Iraq war and we believed all along that the war was a illegal and based on utterly false information the allegations that Iraq for example held weapons of mass destruction and at the end of the conflict or we demanded a public inquiry and that inquiry took a long time and came out with a huge document which indicated deficiencies in the decision-making process false information and the inadequate legal advice and so what I've de demanded is now an inquiry into the British government's policy in relation to the supply of arms to Israel and diplomatic support they've given to Israel the reason I've done that is that um we've seen the case that South Africa took to the International Court of Justice and uh that court gave its opinion that acts of a genocidal nature are taking place the International Criminal Court followed that up with arrest warrants including three arrest arrest warrants but one particularly for Benjamin Netanyahu and yet throughout all this Britain continued supplying some arms to uh Israel um David Lami eventually said they were going to suspend some of the arms licenses 30 out of the 300 that Britain had at the time we still don't know what those licenses really are weapons were still being supplied and the Royal Air Force Base in Cyprus Acretier is also being used as a staging point and we also are aware that 15% of the total number of components of every F-35 jet are made in Britain they couldn't fly without the British parts they're still being supplied and um the government's response is that uh they abide by international humanitarian law but they can't upset the global supply chain of the F-35 because they don't know which parts go to which country i'm sorry that's just utter nonsense it's just nonsense they know exactly where every single one of those parts goes those industries are very well organized and very careful on their recordeping um and so since there's been no answer I've then um written to the prime minister publicly um and I've got the support of a lot of members of parliament of almost all parties in signing this letter demanding an inquiry um so far interestingly there's been no formal response which is interesting it hasn't been rejected now I'm not predicting that's all going to go through straight away it's not it's building up the campaign we need to know the truth and the people of Britain need to know that their country is complicit in this your position with regards to Palestinian rights has also meant quite a lot of political very aggressive political backlash for you um would you say your position was ever misunderstood or or or distorted distorted and grievously misunderstood um I've been to Palestine on nine occasions i've been in all parts of Palestine i've been in Israel as well i've been in Jordan i've been in the refugee camps it's not as if I don't come to this position without some knowledge on the ground of it all the most disgraceful accusations were thrown at me that um uh I held anti-semitic views i absolutely do not i work with many Jewish organizations that are also appalled to what's going on in Palestine the issue is human rights and justice and a humanitarian approach to issues around the world and uh last year uh the Labour Party decided that I wasn't apparently a fit person to be a member of parliament any longer was that hurtful yeah i joined the Labour Party when I was 16 i spent my whole life in the Labor Party i've held every position there is to hold in the Labor Party from a street collector through to leader of the party and for them the new leadership to then less than a year later after I'd stepped down as leader do that to me um did you think of giving up altogether no never never why would I give up it's not about me personally it's about the arguments it's about the issues and it's about the principles and I feel what we did in uh my constituency in Islington North last July was to show that there are people who are prepared to listen to a voice for justice and humanity and um we won that election i'm very proud of that result i want to go back to to the backlash because being critical of Israeli government policy these days can have very serious sometimes devastating consequences for everyone for people people have lost their jobs they've lost visas they've lost their freedom did you ever think that you would come to that no I didn't um not in the slightest uh I did not believe we'd ever get to the situation where people on the streets of European cities holding a Palestinian flag or anywhere else in the world America for that matter simply holding a Palestinian flag which is a UN recognized entity should we say could be arrested i didn't believe we'd ever reach this degree of paranoia about simply standing up for the rights of Palestinian people and so I think it's important that we all speak out on it and the demonstrations around the world have shown that uh despite what some of the world's media do despite what mainly Western European North American governments do the majority of the world's population are with the Palestinian people and through the progressive international we have set up the H group um of UN member states there's um nine joined initially led by um Brazil South Africa Malaysia um to adhere to the rulings of the ICJ and the ICC and form a group within the UN to push for that but what's happened now with South Africa the United States putting extraordinary tariffs on South Africa very very critical of the South African government on everything but really it's because of their attitude towards Palestine but isn't it staggering that you have to go and form a group of countries within the UN to actually follow the courts decisions it's like what does that tell us about global order and and international law what it shows is that the um powerful particularly the United States but they're not alone in this really do not want or like international law the US has never signed up to the international criminal court and I don't think it ever will but what it shows is something very dangerous about the idea of international law i mean I I was born late 40s i grew up in that post-war consensus period where international law meant something where the United Nations was seen as the great hope and uh we now see the United Nations underfunded inadequate and lacking authority and power to actually deal with things so the UN has not managed to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza or the West Bank has not managed to bring about a ceasefire in Ukraine has not managed to yet to bring about an effective peace settlement in Yemen Congo or Sudan and so is it losing its credibility it's it's lack of power lack of ability is a real problem so there's two factors I think we need to look at here one is what is influencing those governments think of how much money has been made out of Palestine Ukraine Sudan Yemen Congo by global arms companies all of which are based in Western Europe or North America don't think there isn't an arms industry pressure also in China and Russia but that's of a different order compared to that of the USA so that's part of it the other side of it which gives me some hope is the numbers of people that have been involved in publicly going out and demonstrating their support for Palestine in Britain I estimate more than a million people at various times in the past 18 months have taken part in public activities and support of Palestine that's a lot of people for a country that doesn't have a tradition of mass demonstrations and as you said in in um in a in a dark way this particular onslaught of Gaza has made more people aware of what the Palestinians have been going through for the past 70 plus years not only for the past 18 months exactly too much of it is put in the narrative it all started in October 23 no it didn't it's been going on for a very long time in various forms sometimes more vicious than others but it has been going on but I think where a lot of the global media have missed out is on what's happening in the West Bank at the same time gaza does get through the bravery of journalists such as in your channel do does get coverage whereas the West Bank basically until recently is not and so there is clearly an Israeli strategy of um destroying the Palestinian villages on the West Bank increasing the power of the occupation forces and of the settlement policy the ICJ rulings were not just about genocide they were also about the illegality of the occupation at all you mentioned the United States what do you think the return of Donald Trump will mean for this crisis but also for the future of Palestinians well I don't think the result of the US election would make much difference either way camela Harris had um very very pro-Israeli views also and she and the Biden administration of which she was part had supplied enormous numbers of weapons but she wasn't talking about developing a sea resort in Gaza right i guess Trump takes it a stage further and announces that he wants to expel the entire population from Gaza shift them somewhere else now that's got a complete kickback but the US economic power over all of the neighboring states is absolutely huge particularly the money they put in to Egypt and other countries is so enormous so Trump's election has been disastrous for the Palestinian people that's for sure what about more broadly the return of Donald Trump to the White House has meant that every day there are either new tariffs or antagonistic statements about several issues europe is in a very difficult position do you think there could be I don't know an opportunity here for Europe to stand on its own or will it have to align with US interests i think we're going to look back on this period of 2025 in years to come as been a period of sort of unbelievable levels of absurdity when the president of the US goes into the rose garden reels off a whole list of tariffs he's going to put on to places and um announced that this is going to make America great again in reality a tariff policy will do what uh damage supply chains damage US manufacturing capability lead to inflation and probably a depression in the United States but it will also actually realign the world's economies in a way that he doesn't want and probably couldn't have predicted and so the BRICS nations Brazil Russia India China South Africa and uh those that have more recently joined will become more important and will become a global source of trading and will build their own currency as well so do you think it will backfire yeah so the backfire is going to be that US influence in the world be much less now the question about Europe economically Trump is not really very interested in relations with anybody else is only interested in um in the US in to some well to a great extent and that means that Europe has then got to think a bit more about its role it's going to have to build a trading relationship with the southern countries and with those countries particularly Canada and Mexico as well as the BRICS nations rather than depending everything on trade with the United States the response so far by the European Union has been beyond disappointing it's been devastating where Ursan Leiden now proposes that Europe become a defense superpower spends more and more money on weapons and manufacturing weapons for what is it to continue a war the cold war with more with Russia rather than searching for a way to end the Ukrainian conflict or is it about interventions in Africa where you think strategically 20 30 50 100 years time the continent with the most mineral resources is Africa and that is why the interests are increasingly moving into military interventions in Africa so I think we need to look at this as a sort of global point you have been very critical throughout your career also of British foreign policy especially in the Middle East would you say the UK has had the opportunity to reckon with its colonial past or has it been playing imperial games by other means there's something in the European psyche in which the principle of empire has never gone away i give you an example whenever there's a crisis somewhere in Africa or anywhere else in the world and the European Union starts thinking well how will we we react to this crisis what do they do but reach for the former colonial power so if something happens in Nishair in Sagal Mali so on France France must deal with that mhm if it's Nigeria the British can do that it's like the colonial mentality has never gone away and in Britain uh I think there is still a huge imperial mentality in the thought processes within foreign policy in the processes within the military and increasingly um ever since Johnson changed the strategy which had been adopted for 50 years of ending the global role of Britain militarily britain now seems to think that by spending so much on defense we can have a global role and so this thinking has led to the government in the past month announcing5 billion pounds cut in disability benefits in order to increase defense expenditure so that means we are impoverishing people with disabilities retaining a benefit cap on the poorest children in our society in order to pay for more bombs and weapons europe is becoming more and more instead of the prosperous equalitydriven continent it was intended to be is becoming more and more socially and economically divided as we spend more and more on weapons of war and uh that cannot be good for the future going back to the situation in the Middle East right now the Israeli government has insisted that you will fight until victory seeing the pictures of Gaza today the levels of destruction are staggering unprecedented what will victory look like and I remember a joyous visit to a school in Jabilia refugee camp some years ago before the intensity of the fighting has got worse i remember meeting the children in the school and talking to them about their lives they showed me their artwork they read me their poetry and it was lovely visit i spent quite a lot of time there then we went onto the roof of the school and from the roof of the school you can see the fence you can see the machine gun imp placements you can see where they can't go and to the north you can see Ashcolon however these children were getting the best education that ENRA could give them and um they were full of hope and full of optimism that school is rubble what happened to children i had no idea and um I've been to the universities in Gassa City and so on all of that is now destroyed so even if there was a complete end to the whole conflict tomorrow you've got basically a 2 million people with no homes to live in no water no sanitation and uh a mental health crisis and so the trauma will never ever go away and uh it does require that uh Israel withdraws it does require that a huge amount of money is provided to the Palestinian people to rebuild Gaza in their image not Donald Trump and golf courses and resorts and all this nonsense gaza was traditionally a very productive place it was the home of fresh fruit home of vegetables delightful strawberries farming projects they were doing really well in Gaza and they were trying to make Gaza self-sufficient in fresh fruit and vegetables and so all that is now just destroyed and deliberately done by Israel deliberately financed and sanctioned by the USA and Western Europe we're coming to the end of this interview and I want to ask you about a look back at your career we're coming up to 50 years of of public service if I'm not mistaken you're going to give people my age next aren't you no no no i won't i I'll stop here but but I did speak to one of your constituents and and she volunteered in your campaign last year and she told me this he said the main impact of the Corbin era was that the thought of real change didn't seem far away mainly due to the fact that the man that was supposed to change everything for us was one of us and the whole movement was focused on the collective is that how you want people history to remember you i spent my life um obviously politically active and active in trade unions but also active in trying to ensure that people don't get forgotten and left behind but there are a huge number of people all over Western Europe that are looking for an alternative which is of peace which is of social justice which is of environmental sustainability which isn't the politics of condemning people all the time it's the politics of trying to include and inspire people and so um new political organizations are growing up all across Europe the future is in our hands it doesn't have to be run by the minority of global corporations it doesn't have to be run by the arms trade technology doesn't have to be our enemy it can be something that gives us opportunity and empowerment but above all why should we be destroying this planet condemning so many people to a life of the most desperate poverty and at the same time spending last year $2.4 trillion dollar on weapons of destruction all around the world come on guys we can do it differently and do it better that's my life's work and it's not stopped chair McCorbin

after Israel imposed a total blockade on food water and medicine the United Nations says no aid has been distributed in Gaza due to tight restrictions imposed by Israel which has allowed just a handful of aid trucks into the territory in the last days that's despite the UN's warning on Tuesday that 14,000 babies are at risk of dying without immediate aid gaza's health ministry says at least 326 deaths have been linked to malnutrition and lack of medicine since March while 300 pregnant Palestinians have suffered miscarriages caused by nutritional deficiencies this is a displaced

quantity of food into Gaza for its starving population o of over 2 million totally and utterly inadequate this is British Foreign Secretary David Lami the world is judging history will judge them blocking aid expanding the war dismissing the concerns of your friends and partners this is indefensible and it must stop on Tuesday the European Union's foreign policy chief said the 27 nation block will review its political and economic agreements with Israel over the catastrophic situation in Gaza separately Spain's parliament passed a non-binding resolution Tuesday calling on the government to impose an arms embargo on Israel this comes as the head of the opposition Israel Democratic Party Yayer Golan condemned the Netanyahu government's siege of Gaza during an interview with Israeli public radio israel is on its way to becoming a pariah state among nations like South Africa was if we don't return to acting like a sane country and a sane country does not wage war against civilians does

support a sweeping budget bill that gives massive tax breaks to the rich while slashing spending for Medicaid nutritional assistance subsidies for clean energy one estimate shows nearly$ 14 million

botched the definition of habius corpus this is Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire questioning Gnome about the constitutional right that safeguards people from being illegally detained so Secretary Gnome what is habius corpus well habius corpus is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country suspend their right let me let me stop the habius corpus excuse me that's that's incorrect corpus excuse me habius corpus is the legal principle that requires that the government provide a public reason for detaining and imprisoning people if not for that protection the government could simply arrest people including American citizens and hold them indefinitely for no reason habius corpus is the foundational right that separates free societies like America from police states like North Korea democrats on the Senate Finance Committee grilled President Trump's nominee to be the next commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service

          <attvalue for="7" value="i know that you primarily focus on open AI in this new book and you discuss how this is fascinating to me How what about China argument that is playing out in the west that is actually justifying all these AI related developments that are virtually unchecked and that is actually leading to potential compromise of democratic values of AI It's a it's a big idea but just walk us through it Absolutely I mean Silicon Valley has long used this idea of what about China when they need to go in front of Congress the US Congress and try and ward off regulation ward off scrutiny And the argument is always you shouldn't be regulating us because China is not going to regulate their companies and then we will not be able to compete in the global race for AI except for the small detail that China actually already has regulated many of these companies and is actually quite advanced in some AI regulations And so what I argue in the book is that this is really just rhetoric from the American companies It is a game that they play They have played it very very well But the US government needs to stop falling for that trap because otherwise these companies are going to develop this technology completely unfettered and start eroding away the rights of people around the world So what is the right approach to AI development in the US and in the western world what are some of the elements of perhaps a Chinese AI regulation that they can actually adopt as well one of the things that I'm quite concerned about with Silicon Valley's current approach is very much that they are taking this scale at all costs approach where they are pumping extraordinary amounts of data extraordinary amounts of compute into certain types of models with a nebulous idea of what these models will ultimately be for And before we entered this particular paradigm there was much more uh development on AI using small amounts of data small amounts of compute And ironically because the US government in the last few years has really tried to constrain China's access to cuttingedge AI chips the Chinese companies have now taken a lead in trying to do this more compute efficient data efficient development such as with the Chinese company DeepSeek And so I think that is a really key reminder when Deep Sea came out for US companies to stop just scaling at all costs and actually start innovating more on more sustainable more energy efficient methods And I believe that you also reference in your book China's construction of data centers and there is a bit of a mismatch problem at the moment in China in that area So I think in general there's a mismatch globally right now with data centers in that there is so much capital being pumped into the rapid global expansion of data centers all around the world the US and China and the global south and there isn't actually that much of a demonstration right now that we need that capacity but the problem is once these bricks are laid once the data centers are built it's really hard to unwind and they come with a lot of environmental costs energy costs water costs and so I really try to caution in my book whether or not we really want to put pedal to the metal and move forward in this way You say in the book that chat GPT um was a success beyond open AAI's wildest dreams Karen So I guess there's a lack of well there was an element of unpreparedness for just how absolutely seismic and and and worldch changing this particular technology has been The fact that there was that lack of preparedness how did that shape what was to ensue at open AAI and how the development of the technology itself has developed yeah the reason why it was such a surprise to OpenAI was because they had already had certain technical capabilities within the company that they had released to developers through methods that were much more difficult for the general public to access But companies the company representatives didn't actually realize um once they made it more publicly accessible more free that it would be such a dramatic difference And when the chatbot released and suddenly um started you know crashing company servers it created an enormous amount of pressure and frankly enormous amount of chaos at the company because they didn't have enough staff on hand They didn't have a robust infrastructure They hadn't even figured out what kinds of rules they wanted to implement for a user product Um what would they allow users to do or not do they were in the middle of writing it when Chad GBT was released Um and so in the time since the company has really scrambled to kind of shore up all of these gaps within its governance within its product development But because there are so many other companies now rushing into the space globally to try and recreate their own chat GBTs they're trying to do all this shoring up while also racing and accelerating and trying to maintain number one And so a lot of this development of this technology has become quite shaky in this aggressive race to be number one" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="this is democracyow democracynow.org the Warren Peace Report i'm Amy Goodman we spend the rest of the hour with award-winning journalist and author Naomi Klene she has a major new piece out co-authored with Astra Taylor for the Guardian newspaper it's headlined the rise of end times fascism it looks at the apocalyptic fervor of the far right in it they write quote the most powerful people in the world are preparing for the end of the world and and they themselves are frenetically accelerating that is not so far away from the more mass market vision of fortress nations that's gripped the far right globally from Italy to Israel Australia to the United States in a time of ceaseless peril openly supremacist movements in these countries are positioning their relatively wealthy states as armed bunkers naomi Klein writes she's also professor of climate justice at the University of British Columbia founding co-director of the UBC Center for Climate Justice her latest book Doppelganger a trip into the mirror world naomi welcome back to Democracy Now it's great to have you with us if you can start off by talking about um your piece and what exactly you mean um uh by talking about um the end times fascism well it's very good to be with you Amy um this isn't the most cheerful piece I've ever written um with Astra Taylor uh a a a very uh close collaborator uh founder of the Debt Collective and we were trying to kind of map what is similar and what is different about the type of far-right politics that we're seeing today uh and I should say the piece is not only grim uh it also looks at what this can mean for a response to this particular form of fascism because we can't fight it if we don't understand it so I think a lot of very good scholarship attempting to understand authoritarianism today whether it's Trump or figures like Duterte or Modi um have looked at similarities between these far-right figures and say Mussolini or Hitler um and and have taken a kind of a checklist approach of looking at what is similar to the past right and I think there's a lot of value in that but the risk of it is that it doesn't uh it doesn't look at what is new and what is particular to our time fascism always is an attempt by the right to resolve a crisis of its own era right so in the 1930s they were attempting to resolve you know in Germany the humiliations of the first world war the impacts of the great depression um and to propose a unity in the face of that you for the inroup but our moment is different and one of the things that makes it different I mean if you think about fascism in the 1930s this is before the atomic bomb it's before they understood climate change and we are in a moment where our elites whether they admit it or not do understand that our economic model and I've written books about this and talked about it with you in the past is at war with life on Earth right um we and they are barreling down this road of more and more extraction of fossil fuels of all kinds of you know basically anything they can extract from this earth and turn into energy and money uh particularly now with AI which is a energy and re resource hog water uh uh LNG um critical minerals all of it uh so so we're trying to understand how this is informing the kind of fascism that we're seeing and also we're trying to understand what unites this kind of strange Frankenstein coalition that Trump represents where he's bringing together these uh you know the richest people in the world who have ever existed with you know many workingclass people so what binds the vision right and what we come up with in this piece or what we propose in this piece is that they all have given up on this world like they all they all have bought into a kind of apocalyptic fever right whether it's Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and their investments in outer space and sort of writing off this planet whether AI which is willing to sacrifice this animate world in order to build an artificial world or whether it's the more populist MAGA vision of the fortress nation state right which is thinking okay um we know more and more people are going to be coming uh we know that disaster is on the horizon and I've listened to a lot of Steve Bannon for for Wright you know when I was writing Doppelganger and it's all very survivalist right it's you know all all the all of the the commercials pretty much are selling you know gold because the economy is going to collapse um you know ready to eat meals for 90 days because you never know what's going to happen so it it it sees the nation and the inroup as being inside the bunker and then it's exiling the outgroup to all of these um lawless territories that you've been covering on the show so it's not the same vision but what it shares is this apocalyptic fever and then of course all of it is following a similar structure like narrative structure to the biblical rapture and of course you have people who believe in that within the Trump uh uh coalition who are you know Christian Zionists like Mike Huckabe and Pete Hegsth who believe that the actual end times is coming and they think it's all going to go down in Israel and uh all of the horror that you that you report on so well and so committedly on the show you know these are all good signs if you believe in the rapture right because it means that the end is coming and the faithful are going to be lifted up to a golden city in the sky so you know what we're looking at is like the the the religious version of that story the the fundamentalist religious religious version of that story where you literally believe you're going to be saved and taken up to heaven or and but also the secular vision where your wealth protects you or your citizenship protects you and you get your own version of that golden bunkered city you mentioned Gaza and you just came from the Jewish Voice for Peace conference in Baltimore um where several thousand people gathered from around the country um our latest headline u the Israeli military calling up tens of thousands of reser as Israel's security cabinet unanimously approved plans this weekend to expand its assault on Gaza where Israel's already killed over 52,000 Palestinians and that's by far um an undercount for in the last 18 19 months israel's killed more than 2400 Palestinians just since it shattered the ceasefire in March um uh this comes as Israel's devastating blockade and food aid has entered its third months palestinian health officials say 57 Palestinians have already starved to death according to UNICEF more than 9,000 children have been admitted for treatment for acute malnutrition so far this year and aid groups like Norwegian Refugee Council blasting a new Israeli proposal to take control and distribution and put US security contractors in charge if you can talk as you so often do about what's happening in Gaza and the West Bank and what um the centrality of Israel in uh President Trump and the current US government although it was also the past president Biden's worldview and approach to foreign policy so I don't think there is a single answer to to understanding what what the driving forces are and this is what we're trying to get at is that there's a kind of an overlap of these different um apocalyptic worldviews some of them are religious and some of them are secular right so I think that people who subscribe to this like literalist version of of the rapture believe that all of this is good news in the sense that according to the story that they believe in that that the Israelites have to return to greater Israel those are the preconditions for the return of the Messiah they have to rebuild the third temple so you have this um convergence of interest between the religious extremists and the Netanyahu government who are absolutely committed to rebuilding the third temple they really want to do it they want to destroy Alexa this is why so much attention is focused on it um but then you know does Trump believe that i don't think Trump believes that i mean what he views for Gaza is he sees resources he sees money he sees a private you know reserve exactly um but you know this is what something I've been saying from from from the beginning i I think the the the interests have been fairly consistent in terms of what the end goal is which is a depopulation of of Gaza pushing Palestinians out whether through death or whether through forced exile whether through through through ethnic cleansing and under the Biden administration there was a denial that that was what was going on and under the Trump administration it's all out in the open so you know this is what is going on now what the what the reason for that is I think differs but this is what part of what we're getting at in the piece Astroni is that there's a confluence of interest in terms of what Israel represents some of the um the the supporters of the Trump administration in the tech industry are talking about wanting freedom cities for instance these these privatized corporate cities um and they talk about this as tech zionism um they they have a lot of admiration for the idea that Israel was created they say you know from a book um the Herzel's books um and they say well why can't we start our own country our own private countries why do we have to you know why do we have to abide by the rules of the nation state um so you know I I think part of the support for Israel isn't just our classic understandings either of Jewish Zionism or Christian Zionism Although that's absolutely going on it's also this idea of a very technologically advanced startup country right um uh you know Israel has marketed itself that way and a lot of these tech companies want to do that in San Francisco you know they want to push everybody out who doesn't agree with them who's poor have more needs um and create their kind of corporate privatized utopia uh so you know I'm not saying this is a coherent agenda um I'm saying that there's a lot of uh overlapping stories that that follow a similar structure and um and and share similar goals if that makes sense i mean yes i mean the overall issue obviously is hard to make sense of and most of Trump's supporters are neither wealthy nor are they Christian Zionists so why are they backing this whole approach well it's not clear the extent to which they actively back it but I think that they see a kinship in the ethnostate right because a lot of Trump supporters are becoming increasingly Christian nationalist about the United States and this has been you know carefully fostered by figures like Steve Bannon um and so when they look at Israel they see a country that is openly an ethnostate that is fortressing itself in a sea of its enemies um you know and they want to do something similar and they're sharing technologies they're sharing um you know legal precedents tools um so there's a you know there's a kinship and it you know and we we're seeing this now with India with its attacks on Kashmir following a you know using similar techniques um uh that you know Israel has used in Gaza so there is a kind of a solidarity of the ethnostates um and they are sharing you know they're even trading trinkets of you know golden pagers and swapping chainsaws you know this is something that we I I I think you know when you're inside um the crucible of it here in the United States under Trump it's hard to see the extent to which this is an international project on the right and they are influencing one another and what does unite them you know this whole fortress mentality is this hatred of immigrants uh you you have President Trump just saying uh he doesn't even know he's not a lawyer so he doesn't know if he has to uphold the Constitution he said right i mean this is what I'm trying to get at um about the awareness that we are in an age of consequences that when you don't act in the face of the climate crisis for decades after when when scientists have been warning you that more and more of the world becomes uninhabitable and lo and behold people move uh to try to find safety in the face of in the face of wars in the face of economic deprivation and in the face of ecological disasters and so that fortressing of the nation state and this is what I think um you know Israel's come to represent just as a very small nation that is extremely fortressed right whether it's with the high-tech walls the iron dome Trump says now I want a not an iron dome but a golden dome right um that that here um that all of this is is whether it's stated explicitly a military parade that'll cost tens of millions of dollars even as he uh slices es and dices the government on his birthday in June so the pattern is protecting the in-group and exiling and cleansing the out groupoups right and so that I think is is is you know if there is support among the MAGA base for Israel it's less out of a love for Israel than more out of an identification like they are doing what we want to do here you write um many things in your piece um and I just want to go to one of them uh you say in talking about um Musk's apocalyptic vision you talk about and also um detailing the end times fascism this whole issue of the rise of the city state the corporate city state I think this is a new concept for many they're not going to know what you're talking about in southern Texas star base just this group of people who are mainly workers at uh uh SpaceX have just voted to make a city right there yeah and we've had sort of I mean the idea of a of of a company town is not entirely new right um and Disney had Celebration Florida and you know that there are lineages to to this right um colonial line lineages to this you know I I I live in Canada which started as the Hudson's Bay Company right so it was it was a company before it was a country so there there is some precedent for this but I think what this is I've been following this out of the corner of my eye Amy because this is where the libertarians have been going for a while um there was an Peter Teal has been obsessed with this idea it's increasingly being called exit so exiting the nation and just starting your own country where you can set your own tax level you can set you can make your own regulations or not or not and countries and and and these little corporate countries will compete with one another to try to attract capital right so in a way it's an extension of the free trade zone right where it's and this is this is a a in a way like a denationalized country within a country but Trump started to float this in 2023 the idea that he would create 10 freedom cities uh on the campaign trail I don't think his base much knew what he was talking about but now you have all these lobbyists who fully intend to take him up on it and we're starting to see the beginning of this with the SpaceX city so you also write um about El Salvador's terrorism confinement center the notorious prison secut where so many hundreds of people um have been sent from the United States and at the same time in the last 24 hours President Trump saying he wants to reopen the notorious Alcatraz an island in San Francisco if you can talk about the prison as a model for what Trump wants to put forward and particularly in relation as we see motivating so much um to immigrants well this is an incredibly bleak vision so repression is always a huge part of any kind of fascist project right you need to contain the out group you need to disappear the out group so this part of it is not new but I think what is so worrying to me is that Trump was elected promising all kinds of things to his base right he was he promised to eliminate inflation he promised to bring these great jobs home he's not delivering on any of that so the sadistic part of his project is really all he has to offer right i think one of the most chilling things I've ever seen in the United States was Trump sharing that video at his 100 day rally of just pure sadism of just looking at prisoners as entertainment being shaved being shackled being paraded and he's not delivering on the price of eggs and he's not delivering on the jobs by the way because he's he's throwing all in he's going all in on AI so the jobs that are coming back are seem to be mainly for robots um it's not actually for his for his base and so this scales up the need for the sadism and and these spectacles right and and I think that that's what something like Alcatraz represents he he's he's a TV producer first and foremost right he's producing spectacles and the less he the less he has to offer economically tangibly materially the more he leans on the sadism uh you write the governing ideology of the far right has become a monstrous supremacist survivalism our task is to build a movement strong enough to stop them what would that movement look like or what do you see it's is being formed right now you know what we're doing in this piece by laying out the bleakness of the vision and when I say bleakness you know I think it's beyond something we've seen before because there's always an apocalyptic quality to fascism but fascism of the 1930s and 40s had a horizon like after the apocalypse people were being promised a future a pastoral peaceful little piece of land um where they could live out their lives you know even though Trump talks about a golden age there really isn't a future that that the base believes in you know and this is what I've learned by by consuming far too much MAGA media amy um they envision a future of endless war right this is why they're bunkering down this is why they're buying ready to eat meals to last this is why they're buying gold and crypto they think the whole thing is going down so and why Elon Musk is trying to have so many children at least 14 at this point but he's actually explicitly texted it saying &quot;We've got to do this much faster as he proposed to one of the women he has children with uh saying uh we got to start using surrogates.&quot; So they don't believe in the future is the bottom line um and that is you know I I think I've been in a lot of progressive spaces in recent months where we've talked about building these very broad coalitions including with people who we don't entirely disagree with i've never encountered uh a potential coalition more broad than the idea of how about if we believe in this world how about if we believe in the future because we're up against people who are actively betting against the future right not just actively betting against it but fueling the fires that are burning this world actively fueling it so I think that if we have the courage really to look at the bleakness of what they of what they believe in um which is an apocalyptic future then we have our work cut out for us of being the people who actually believe in this realm in this world in the beauty of creation and in of each other naomi Klein I want to thank you for being with us

          <attvalue for="7" value="hey everyone welcome to the Microsoft 365 co-pilot connection My name is Nick Harris and I'm a senior co-pilot cloud solution architect with Microsoft Today I want to navigate you through a use case a specific use case that I directly have been working with in relation to one of my customer engagements that I'm actively delivering right now And I want to show how I directly combined multiple co-pilot capabilities together to streamline my effort save me time and get all of the content and materials and demos ready to go in a quick simple and easy way Now general note the capabilities I show in this particular video will require a Microsoft 365 C-pilot license which is the $30 license that we directly make available to our enterprise customers And in this case I will be using multiple experiences As you see on my screen I will be starting off with the researcher agent and we will be navigating through a few different app experiences to make modifications and changes and finally get down to overall demo content and presentation material with Copilot in Word and PowerPoint Now before I submit my prompt to researcher I want to talk to all of the content that is in the prompt So here it is on the screen for all of you to reference General note I didn't type all of this This was a prompt aggregated by a wide variety of resources We've been actively meeting with our customer over the last few weeks They provided us notes They've provided user feedback on areas that the users are interested to know more about We've aligned agendas and information for the session overall logistics and all of that is now aggregated into a single form prompt that I will submit over to co-pilot And as you can see the purpose of this is to have three use cases that co-pilot generates for us So we can have working scenarios during one-hour sessions with our customer We will do initial 10 to 15 minutes of education content and then have our customer users go into breakout groups where they will work on prompting They'll actively work on creating prompts and modifying prompts against a particular use case scenario that we generate And the use case scenario is going to be generated by co-pilot So feeding it all of this rich contextual data will only make the demo materials and content that we're aligning to more rich in terms of what we can get back to the customer in our education sessions So I've aggregated all of this information and I'm going to feed it into the researcher to see what it gives me back So I've submitted my prompt to the researcher agent And within this researcher agent experience after your initial prompt you will receive some contextual discovery questions If you have any additional information you want to feed the researcher agent to help guide it along the way even further you can In this case I'm just going to click go ahead and we'll see what it gives us back Okay so we've received a response and I'm not going to go into very minute detail on exactly what happens with researcher agent If you want to see how the researcher agent works and functions please go check out our previous video on the researcher agent for all of those key details As we see though on the current screen all of the strategy and plan and the thoughts and information that the researcher agent has directly navigated through in order to generate the rich data and detail against our use cases and scenarios that we will leverage within this education session for our customers So as we've now reviewed all of these key particular areas scrolling down into the output right And of course this output is very rich There's a lot of data in detail here And I have noticed I've done a quick review of this Um it's a little bit too rich And that brings something to mind is I've noticed I've started to use the researcher agent more often as my starting point And I sort of have to pick and choose when do I use the researcher versus when do I just use the normal co-pilot general AI assistant And my mentality now is if I need really rich detail I'll start with the researcher If I just have some quick hits or I need to modify some language or I need to search for some data and content or summarize data and information I use the general AI assistant because the output of the general AI assistant will be much shorter So let's scroll down Let's go ahead and look at you know we have some additional sections we don't really need like key definitions and concepts I don't really need any of that included Maybe useful for like end users right that I'm presenting to but uh maybe it's like a reference resource What we're really after here are the use cases aligned to the customer feedback that we've directly provided in our initial prompt And we can see what Copilot has done It's given us or the researcher agent specifically uh our scenario overview gives us information on why it matters some sample broad prompts context to that as well maybe you know some step by steps in order to navigate through that and some key things that we can consider so we review all of these use cases right and I will say I noticed within these use cases it doesn't really have many prompt examples so let's go ahead and prompt a little bit more and get some prompt examples uh that we can then leverage in a presentation out of this So in this same conversation again I have now sent another prompt refine your previous output down to the just the three use cases within the use cases specifically expand each use case to provide five contextual prompts align to the use case that I can further use and provide to my customer to give them additional value and this is more refined This is more what I'm looking for so I can have this particular key detail and information included within my PowerPoint slide deck I want to start within these breakout room sessions and scenarios with very broad prompts to get people started but also educate them that based on their individual context they need to modify and add additional key details And having some examples that include additional contextual varants in this case can really help align them on how to modify their prompts in different forms based on their needs So we review all of this information We're good to go Now we can aggregate all of this into a co-pilot page So in my initial prompt I've scrolled up just a little bit I'm going to click on the co-pilot pages icon Edit in pages And now we have our initial output in a co-pilot page I'm also going to scroll down and I'm going to send the next output for our additional contextual prompts and add that to the page as well And so now that key output is added at the bottom And this is where I can either modify the materials in here to remove data I don't need out of this particular co-pilot page or directly send this co-pilot page over to a Word document to make my modifications One of the new options we've just rolled out as a part of Copilot Pages is the ability to directly send this output to a Word document And this is important especially if you have a use case scenario where you need a presentation that you want to align within your own customer demos and customer sessions So in the top right hand corner you now see the Word icon I can click on this Word icon It directly sends that information over to a word document that's all uploaded directly into my one drive experience and I can then use co-pilot in word to make my modifications from there So I've spent about two to three minutes modifying the overall output in a manual way within this particular word document I've removed all of the data in detail that I do not require This was about a 30-page document It's now uh six pages I've also taken the second output of five sample contextual prompts aligned to each use case and aligned them directly within each use case section as you see in this word file And so now we are going to move forward and we're going to leverage this word document to generate a brand new presentation and validate what particular information data and detail we could then leverage within our customer presentation session here in the future So I've opened up a brand new PowerPoint file This will also be uploaded directly within my one drive I could have created it directly in SharePoint as well if I chose But since we already have the word file aligned with the rich information that we require I'm going to create a presentation with the file So let's generate a presentation with the file And one of the new key updates that we've just included is the ability to now select a presentation template If I click on change design here this allows me to select from particular templates either from my organization or directly from Microsoft 365 Now in this key example I do not have any presentations for my organization though I know many organizations really want to focus on their brand So that is something that your organization can put into place if you so choose But in this case I'm just going to select from Microsoft 365 And as you can see we have direct brand templates available to start from And so let's select this citation design here Select design And now we're going to select our word file And then let's go ahead and enter additional prompting criteria to ensure that copilot and PowerPoint aligns the rich information in the way that we require All right So for the particular prompt that we will align as well as referencing the word file that we've generated we want to create a presentation with a section of slides for each particular use case And within each section include the following slides We want our scenario overview slide which describes the scenario We want a slide for why it matters which explains the importance and relevance of the scenario We want a slide for the broad and contextual prompts related to the use case scenario and finally a slide for a breakout session which will indicate to our user audience they'll navigate into their breakout rooms The narrative builder experience in PowerPoint then starts to generate the overall narrative for our presentation and as we now see directly aligned to our document content are particular key sections of information including the particular key slides that we require On first glance this does look accurate We will have future videos to talk to this particular narrative builder experience in PowerPoint but for now I trust what it's given me So let's generate our slides The narrative builder experience then starts to build the overall slide deck It's leveraging that rich information from the word document as its main content source Also leveraging its trained data in order to aggregate information and ensure that the slides are rich in information and align to what we require We then now see the initial first draft for our presentation So we can elect to just review really quickly on this highle view We can click keep it to then start navigating into our slides as well Maybe for example I don't really like the uh the black theme here So uh let's go ahead and use designer You can get design suggestions as well to start reviewing and modifying the overall design And again if you start from your own company branded presentation this would adhere to your slide layout that are company branded What I'm really focused on though is ensuring that the overall content is correct and accurate We can validate via the notes some of the information We have the full scenario overview We have some key points on the slide Again I can modify with designer Let's look at the why it matters slide Okay some quick notes on why it matters Again I could worry about formatting and such later on if I chose a broad and contextual prompts Now this is where I see we have some modifications that we'll need to make My purpose is to have the verbatim prompts directly on the slide Now the good thing is they're already in the slide notes That's one key thing that I could consider and leverage I can just copy and paste out the slide notes and put it directly in the slide and reformat a little bit if I want a little bit more of the the rich information from the word document as well I can leverage co-pilot in PowerPoint to reference that word document and summarize all the key details out of it or pull the key points that I require For example I can say summarize slash and we'll navigate to our file here creating copilot use cases And as you see now we have that direct document loaded in our copilot and PowerPoint chatbased experience because this also has access to your work data Now I don't see the direct prompts listed So let's prompt again and be a little bit more specific in terms of what we want There we go As you now see for use case one provide the verbatim prompts listed in the word file I want both the broad and the contextual prompts And you can now have the verbatim prompts directly aligned from that word file You could copy and paste from there as well There's multiple ways that you could go about this So that's all for me for today everyone I will be navigating through this particular use case today doing a presentation for my customers So hopefully this helps to show you some of the power that you can leverage Copilot for across a wide variety of app experiences I very much appreciate the support We just hit 200 subscribers as well I never really thought that this would happen but glad that all of you are enjoying the content Of course as always please like share subscribe and if you have any comments leave them below We'll see you in the next one" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Welcome to The Daily Show. We got one for you tonight. My name is Jon Stewart. What a program we have designed for you, a la carte. It's going to be fantastic. Our guest tonight, General Stanley McChrystal will be joining us. [CHEERING, APPLAUSE] Wrote a book. Chances are I will McRib him about the McRaq War. All right, first, President Donald Trump. God. [BOOING] No, no, no. Respect his authoritay. [LAUGHTER] Honestly, so much comes at us every day with him, I can't even sleep, organize thoughts, eat. I just-- and he knows. He knows he's toying with us. Here he is on Tuesday of last week. We're going to have a very, very big announcement to make, like as big as it gets. And I won't tell you on what. [GASPS] [LAUGHTER] Oh, good. So we won't know how to prepare. Should we wear our good pants or the ones we piss in? But fine. Don't tell us this big announcement. Just tell us when. And that announcement will be made either Thursday or Friday or Monday before we leave. [LAUGHTER] Why are you mentioning it? Is it Sweeps Week? Is that what this is? But fine. We will keep our eyes out for any announcement bombshells. And on Friday, I think we got one. The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in a time of invasion. So that's an option we're actively looking at. [GIBBERISH] The government, the United States government, is actively looking at suspending due process and the rule of law. That's a big announcement, big enough for Stephen Miller to risk bursting into flames because of the touch of God's sunlight. The only time a president has done it unilaterally without the authorization of Congress was Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. That was the last? Really? So back when slavery was legal and the treatment for diarrhea was amputation. [LAUGHTER] But that being said, this is a big announcement. As you know, you know, ability of somebody to challenge their rights in court is a pretty essential part of the rule of law. So certainly raising a lot of eyebrows with that comment. Just-- just eyebrows, just-- the Trump administration is thinking of tearing up the Constitution. So here in Washington, we're hearing a lot of, huh. One legal scholar even said, that's weird. So maybe that's the announcement, suspension of habeas corpus, unless there's something else. President Trump is appointing former New York prosecutor Jeanine Pirro as interim US attorney. [LAUGHTER] You may say to yourself, well, that can't be the announcement because that's just not that big a deal. Yet in this new world that we live in, this announcement registers the same as suspending habeas corpus on the eyebrow-o-meter. Jeanine Pirro, a lot of eyebrows are being raised at this pick so far. [LAUGHTER] Hey. Hey. Hey, Jeanine. You're going to be the new US attorney in DC. [SLIDING SOUND] Yeah, I know. We're surprised too. [SLIDING SOUND] That is, by the way, the sound. Oh, also, they're suspending habeas corpus. [SLIDING SOUND] Same. [SLIDING SOUND] [APPLAUSE] This is stupid. All right. So maybe that's the big announcement. But, hey, we've got until today for any other announcements. Was there anything else? The Trump administration is preparing to accept a super luxury Boeing jumbo jet from the royal family of Qatar. That luxury jumbo jet, which has a value estimated at $400 million, the aircraft would be used by President Trump as a new Air Force One and then transferred to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation shortly before he leaves office. What? Qatar is giving us a plane that Trump gets to keep. He's like the reverse Oprah. [LAUGHTER] I get a jet. And that's it. I get a jet for my library. Why does his library need a jet? Why would your presidential library-- hello. I'm calling from Europe, and I need a book about Trump by morning. And the book must travel in the comfort and style one can only get from Qatar. REPORTER: It's known as the most luxurious private jet in the world, described as a flying palace. It features the biggest master bedroom in the sky, as well as some very plush living quarters and several private offices. Some of the nine bathrooms on board have full showers and even a bidet. [LAUGHTER] Whoa. All right. I didn't even know water could go there. OK. [LAUGHTER] Holy crap. That is not a plane. That is a flying [BLEEP] palace. I'm not going to tell Trump how to run his business, but I would steam the shit out of those carpets. But, hey, it's a jet from Qatar. We can trust them. They're not suspect like Canada or working to undermine us like all of our other democratic allies in Europe. Qatar is considered an American ally, but it is also an ally of Iran and China and even Hamas. Oh. Trump's going to take a $400 million jet from people he would expel from Columbia University. I think-- you know what? This is shocking. [APPLAUSE] This is shocking. I think I know what this news might do to our eye pubes. It raises many, many eyebrows to have this sort of deal at all. [LAUGHTER] Actually, that's how the plane flies. It overcomes Earth's gravity through the power of the raised eyebrows. Look, obviously, the president would understand that a gift of this magnitude from a government with questionable ties to terror organizations, combined with Article 1, Section 9, constitutional prohibition against the president accepting a foreign flying [BLEEP] palace, he would understand that that's a legitimate-- I'm just kidding. He was appalled that you'd even ask. They're giving us a free jet. I could say no, no, no, don't give us. I want to pay you a billion or $400 million, or whatever it is, or I could say thank you very much. [LAUGHTER] It's not a free jet. That's the point. You know the expression there's no such thing as a free lunch? That's about being skeptical of the motives of somebody who gives you a sandwich, a sandwich, a BLT. Now imagine that that BLT has an engine, nine bathrooms, and funds proxy wars. So in the dizzying run-up to this big announcement of the possible suspension of habeas corpus or maybe the appointment of another Fox News star or the naked bribery of our highest elected officials, none of those were Trump's big announcement. President Trump just announced that prescription drug and pharmaceutical prices will be reduced by 30% to 80% almost immediately. This appears to be the major announcement that the president has been teasing for days. I am having wanted that for years. Pharma has exploited the American consumer while we have in turn subsidized their whole industry with tax incentives and direct funds. I like this. But without getting into the weeds, explain this thing that I've wanted for a very long time like I'm incredibly dumb. Drug prices will come down. We're getting them down 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, but actually, more than that, if you think about it in the way-- mathematically. [LAUGHTER] If you think about it mathematically. [LAUGHTER] I don't want to brag, but I often think about numbers mathematically. [LAUGHTER] How is this going to work? The rest of the world is going to have to pay a little bit more, and America is going to pay a lot less. Basically, what we're doing is equalizing. It's a new word that I came up with, which I think is probably the best word. We're going to equalize. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING, APPLAUSE] Europe, eureka, Euclid. Yeah, here it is-- equalize. I thought it sounded familiar. [LAUGHTER] Look. [APPLAUSE] He's trying to kill us all. Look, I would like to think that the tenacious pleadings of progressive leaders like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders helped make this possible. We are sick and tired of paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. I'm going to attack the prices on commonly used drugs. Put a cap on the cost of insulin, a cap on the cost of prescription drugs. And not one of those child caps that you can't-- I have diarrhea. What's happening? Unfortunately, it turns out credit for the biggest, most important announcement in the history of this presidency goes to someone else. I mean, I'll tell you a story. A friend of mine who's a businessman, very, very, very top guy-- most of you would have heard of him. A highly neurotic, brilliant businessman, seriously overweight. [LAUGHTER] That took a turn. [LAUGHTER] Tough guy, brilliant, you know him, famous, bit of a chubs. [LAUGHTER] Anyway, I'm sure a public press conference is a rough way for this guy to find out that he is saved in Trump's phone as Neurotic Fat Friend. [LAUGHTER] But what else can you tell us about this friend who's a very famous, successful businessman? Highly neurotic, brilliant businessman, seriously overweight, and he takes the fat shot drug. [LAUGHTER] Fat shot? The fat shot? Do you read any of your briefings? The fat-- he takes the fat shot. You know, the fat shot. I got another friend, brilliant real estate mogul. He takes the dick stiff pills. [LAUGHTER] This guy takes the fat shot. This guy takes the dick stiff pills. I'm sorry. Continue the story about this fat [BLEEP] of a friend of yours. And he called me up, and he said, President, could I ask you a question? What? I'm in London. And I just paid for this damn fat drug I take. I said, it's not working. [LAUGHTER] Yo, Rickles, that is ice cold. [LAUGHTER] Your friend is, like, opening up, like, oh, I took this fat drug. He's like, it's not working. He's like, I'm try-- this poor guy. He's just catching strays in the middle of a presidential press conference. Trump's talking about drug pricing reform. And he's like, hey, when this guy goes to the hospital, the nurse gives him 50 cc's of Crisco. He's fat. Hey, my friend, he's very successful. Went to London. And when they saw him, they changed the name of Big Ben to just Ben because this guy is fat. He's a fat piece of shit, this guy. Anyway, back to life-saving drug pricing. Again, President Trump, what does any of this have to do with pricing? He said, I just paid $88, and in New York I pay $1,300. What the hell is going on? He said, so I checked, and it's the same box made in the same plant by the same company. It's the identical pill. This is a great businessman, but he's not familiar with this crazy situation that we have. But he was stunned. He was as stunned as he is fat. I mean, oh. [LAUGHTER] Boy, what is-- by the way, I don't know if anybody realized, but the fat shot somehow turned into a fat pill in the middle of the story. It's how you know the story is true. [LAUGHTER] But you know, whether the story is true or not, Donald Trump's point is if you find yourself in the socialized health care systems of London and you want to run out and get some Ozempic and some fish and chips, don't bother because his fat [BLEEP] of a friend ate them all like a pod of orcas on a tuna bender. But the point is-- [APPLAUSE] Now his poor friend is at home going, don't look at me. It feels like a decade ago that they threatened to suspend habeas corpus. It was Friday, that long-ago yesteryear when the Knicks were still up 2-0. And since then, we've had the largest bribe ever given to an American president-- the seeming surrender of a trade war we started and the socializing of our pharmaceutical industry. What even is this country? What operating-- four months ago, we were a standard issue democratic constitutional republic. Now we're some kind of anarcho, klepto, socialist, communist, Silk Road reality show. The only foundational, unchanging edict that we can even hang our hats on anymore is that whatever we are now as a country, that country is closed to any refugees. As Stephen Miller said, America is now for Americans only. So hopefully, there will be no more surprise announcements that overturn that apple cart. After pausing virtually all refugee admissions for those fleeing war and famine, the Trump administration is now planning to welcome one group-- white South Africans. What the [BLEEP]? White South Africans? That's the only group we're opening? What? You already have one. Why? You know what, Mr. President? You don't need 30, 37 South Africans. Now you'll make do with just one or two. Wait. This wouldn't have anything to do with the white thing, would it? Their land is being confiscated in South Africa. I don't care about their race, their color. I don't care about their height, their weight. [LAUGHTER] Oh, you care about their weight." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Welcome to The Daily Show. I'm Michael Kosta. Wow, hot crowd. We've got so much to talk about tonight. The head of Social Security learns what Social Security is. Tulsi Gabbard tries to turn terror threats into must-see TV, and racism joins the Mile High club. So let's check in with the best cabinet ever in another installment of The Worst Wing. [GRAND MUSIC]  What a bunch of losers. [LAUGHTER]  One of the most heartwarming stories of the Trump administration so far has been the beautiful friendship between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, two men who had previously never had a friend. But today, that friendship got DOGEd. You're going to want to hear about this. Breaking moments ago, Elon Musk speaking out in a big way on the Big, Beautiful Bill. He took to X a short time ago, writing, quote, &quot;I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it. You know you did wrong. You know it.&quot; Chainsaw!  Oh, no, not my two favorite people fighting. Don't make me choose who I love more. [LAUGHTER] But yes, Elon is worried that Trump's bill will raise the deficit too high. And when Elon is worried about something getting too high, you know it's too high. [CHEERING]  And he may be right. But Elon has to be careful. You come out that hard against Trump's central legislative achievement and you're going to be the first white person to get deported. But while you're shaming supporters of this bill, be sure to save a little shame for yourself. Elon. You're the one who spent $288 million getting Trump elected. You even showed hole to support him. Now, granted-- granted, the hole was a belly button, but still, hole is hole. [AUDIENCE WHISTLES] But let's move on. Hole is hole. Let's move on to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA if you're nasty. FEMA is always ready to come to the rescue no matter what sort of disaster that MAGA bitch Mother Nature throws at us, like wildfires, tornadoes, sharknados, horny-dolphin-nados. Those are the worst. But it turns out, not everyone at FEMA is as prepared as they should be. FEMA staff were apparently caught off guard on Monday when the disaster agency's new acting leader told them that he was previously unaware that the US had a hurricane season. [LAUGHTER] The head of FEMA doesn't know what hurricane season is? I would expect Trump to hire someone who's not qualified to handle hurricanes, but to not even know when they come? I mean, it's almost like Trump picks his cabinet the way you select a jury. Do you have any opinions on hurricanes? Have you ever heard of hurricanes? No? Great. You're hired. [LAUGHTER] This guy is the head of the emergency management agency. He doesn't know about hurricane season? There's only, like, three emergencies in life you really need to know. There's hurricanes, wildfires, and when you're taking out the garbage, and it starts dripping from the bottom of the bag. Those are only life's emergencies. But if that comment freaks you out, you're not alone. The administration had to come out and say, ah, psych, I was joking. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security tells CNN that the comment was made in jest. Yeah, sure. It was a joke. It was a joke. You know, that reminds me of the time I, as a joke, shit my pants. And [FAKE LAUGHS] it was so funny to do on that airplane. Everyone was laughing and loving it.  Let's say he was actually joking about being a total dumbass. That doesn't make it better. The head of FEMA is a serious job. I don't want my EMTs to be like, OK, now, where do I push to make the heart beat again? Just kidding. I got it. Hey, wake up. So the head of FEMA is either an idiot who never heard of hurricane season or just an idiot. We may never know. But another new Trump appointee has been very clear about the fact that he has no idea what he's doing. REPORTER: In a new audio recording, Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano reveals that he had no idea what the job entailed when it was offered to him.   [SIGHS] [CROWD GROANS] First of all, can you Google how to clear your throat maybe? I mean, how do you not know what the commissioner of Social Security does? He's the one who hands out the championship trophy at the end of the Social Security season. [LAUGHTER] But don't-- yeah, you knew that. [APPLAUSE] But don't worry. Don't worry. Because he's one of the great Googlers-- now, not in the whole country, just the East Coast. But that's still a big population area. It's pretty cool that the guy who's in charge of a $1.2 trillion agency is using the same tool I use to look up the name of the one Black guy in Maroon 5. What up, Peej? Now, at this point, you might be asking yourself, does anyone in this cabinet even know what their job is? Well, based on what Education Secretary Linda McMahon has been up to, still no. Education Secretary Linda McMahon weighed in on Long Island's continuing mascot battle. She was in Massapequa yesterday. It's one of 13 districts fighting to keep Native American school nicknames and mascots. The state says if the mascots are not changed by June, funds will be withheld. But McMahon says the ban violates civil rights because names and mascots of other racial and ethnic groups are still allowed. We reserve the right to turn over this investigation to the Department of Justice because that's how serious we are about this. Great use of your time, Education Secretary. China's schools are producing a million engineers a minute. But it's OK because our students will know how to do the tomahawk chop. Look, we can't keep having endless disputes about Native American mascots, especially when every mascot in Philly is clearly addicted to cocaine. I mean-- [LAUGHTER] The-- the Phanatic-- [APPLAUSE, CHEERING]  The Phanatic is, like, perfectly designed. Anyway, seem look, either we don't allow mascots at all anymore, or every mascot is an offensive ethnic stereotype, including white people. How about that? You know, the drunken Irish, OK? The horny Italians, the emotionally unavailable British, that kind of thing. [LAUGHTER] The point is, when it comes to mascots, you can't make both liberals and conservatives happy unless all the Native American mascots are trans. And then everybody gets something. So-- Now let's move on to Tulsi Gabbard, Director of National Intelligence and woman who gives Snow White the poison apple and big-- [CROWD BOOS] The audience loves Tulsi Gabbard. She's in charge of the president's daily brief, which is where the intelligence agencies gather all the top secret information they need to go to the president into a war with Iran-- excuse me, to defend our national interests. Of course, the problem with giving Donald Trump a PDB to read is that reading is not really his thing. From inauguration until the end of May, he had had, according to his public schedule, 14 PDBs. 14 PDBs since inauguration? What the hell? It's the daily brief. &quot;Daily&quot; means you're supposed to get it every day. Like, we're The Daily Show, and we're on the air four days a week. That's a bad example. That's a bad example. That's a bad example, bad example. Even President Biden had read 90 of them at this point, although to be fair, it was really just 45. They had to read them to him twice. But--  Obviously, the president not having a grasp of national security is a huge problem. But luckily, Tulsi Gabbard has a solution. Tulsi Gabbard is considering bringing on a Fox News producer and a network personality to present the briefing, tailoring it to how the president actually prefers to consume information, by watching Fox News. Look-- [CROWD GROANS] --I love how Trump's people are like, we got to cut government spending, and also, we need $10 million for a fake TV show because the president can't read. Now, obviously, converting the brief into a Fox News broadcast won't be easy. To make it realistic, you have to cast someone who's had sexual harassment allegations. Then you're going to need to find time for the three dozen ads for catheters. But still, at least Tulsi Gabbard is thinking outside the box here. And finally, we can get some Fox News people in the White House, aside from the secretary of Transportation and the secretary of Defense and the border czar, the deputy director of the FBI, the deputy special envoy for Middle East peace, the senior counsel to the assistant attorney general for civil rights, the US attorney for the District of Colum-- [EASY LISTENING MUSIC]  --and the ambassador to Greece Oh, [BLEEP] I missed my kid's birthday. But look, I'm glad that Tulsi is trying something new, although knowing Donald Trump, there is one other format that might work better than imitating Fox News. Hello, Mrs. Stepmom. I have an extra large package for you. Oh, my. It's so big. MAN: Almost as big as the recent rocket deployment in the Kashmiri region. Oh, God, that's so dangerous. It could mean war. No, seriously, people could die. [CLEARS THROAT] We need to move assets out of the region and have a SEAL team on standby, ready to launch an incursion. Yeah, I'm about to launch an incursion so freaking deep. Let me get out of this hot robe.  I think this area needs a little special attention. It's a real hot zone, full of sectarian violence that threatens to explode without a meaningful peace process. God, that's not the only thing that's about to explode. [GASPS] Yeah. There's also reports of Shahab-2 short-range ballistic missiles like this held by guerrilla groups. Show me where. MAN: There. WOMAN: Yes. MAN: And right here. WOMAN: Yes, right there. MAN: Yeah, right there? Yes, yes. We have reports of an ISIS sleeper cell in Dallas. Wait, we're in Dallas. Oh, no. I have to warn my hot stepson. [SIGHS] " />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Welcome to The Daily Show. I'm Ronny Chieng We got so much to talk about tonight. Kristi Noem fails a pop quiz. The FBI wants you to shut up about Jeffrey Epstein already. And while you were stuck at the airport, Sean Duffy did some redecorating. So let's check in with the best cabinet ever in another installment of The Worst Wing. [INSPIRATIONAL MUSIC] # # What a bunch of losers. [LAUGHTER] Let's start with Kristi Noem, secretary of Homeland Security and one-woman kill shelter. She's in charge of the country's pathway to citizenship, which for hundreds of years has been a solemn, dignified process for achieving the American dream. But what if instead, it was tacky and gross? A surreal report that could turn immigration into a TV show. The Trump administration says it's in the very beginning stages of the vetting process for a reported immigrant reality TV show, where immigrants would compete to prove they are the most American with a chance to win US citizenship. A reality TV show for citizenship is somehow the most un-American and most American thing I've ever heard. Although, we already have a contest to prove who's the most American. And it's called the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest. What's more American than eating until your colon explodes and then going bankrupt from medical bills? But let me be clear, I hate this idea-- unless they're looking for a host, then I love this idea. And I'm available on Fridays. I-- [APPLAUSE] I will say, it might be a nicer way to get deported. Instead of ICE agents disappearing you up in unmarked vehicles, Ryan Seacrest walks into your living room with a TV crew and is like, Carlos. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] We're taking you out of the USA. [LAUGHTER] But meanwhile, Kristi Noem was testifying in Congress today about whether her administration is deporting people without habeas corpus, which is their right to due process. If you didn't know what habeas corpus was, don't worry, Kristi Noem didn't google it either. What is habeas corpus? Well, habeas corpus is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country, suspend their right-- Let me stop you, ma'am. Habeas corpus-- excuse me. That's incorrect. [LAUGHTER] OK, look. If Kristi Noem was just a random person on the street, I'd get it if she was like, habeas corpus? That's-- that's a Harry Potter spell, right, like, la, la, la, la? Makes you invisible? But the Secretary of Homeland Security should know that habeas corpus prevents the president from deporting you without due process, not that it lets the president deport you without due process. That's the opposite of what it means. And I didn't know you could have dyslexia for laws. [LAUGHTER] Either way, Noem whiffed hard on that question. But unfortunately for her, the quiz was just beginning. Do you know what section of the Constitution the suspension clause of habeas corpus-- KRISTI NOEM: I do not, nope. Do you know which article it is in? - No, I do not, sir. - OK. Well, it is in Article 1. [LAUGHTER]  It was in 1. It was the first-- you didn't even read the first one. So can you stop? We get it, OK? Stop asking her harder questions. Like, how would senators like it if Kristi Noem asked you questions that she was an expert in, huh? Hey, Senator Kim, do you know how to trick a puppy into walking into an open grave? [LAUGHTER] No? Not so smart, now, are you? Anyway, Kristi Noem, you still don't know the basics of American law. So I'm sorry to say-- [DRAMATIC MUSIC] We're going to have to take you out of USA. But luckily-- [CHEERING]  I know. [APPLAUSE] Won them back after the dog-killing jokes. But luckily for America, Kristi Noem isn't the only one in charge of keeping the country safe. We also got Kash Patel and Dan Bongino, two guys who look like they should be henchmen in a Ninja Turtles movie but are somehow running the FBI now. And before he took over, Dan Bongino wasn't afraid to tell us the truth about what the FBI was covering up. Nobody knows how much material people have on Jeffrey Epstein. It's unbelievable. The guy killed himself. And now nobody's going to know. Yeah, exactly. Epstein killed himself? Bleh. Bongino knows the truth. And now he and Kash Patel get to see all the files. So on Sunday, they sat down for an interview to tell us what really happened. Because we know Epstein didn't just kill himself. He killed himself. [LAUGHTER]  What? He-- he killed himself without air quotes? That is the craziest thing I've ever heard, all right? I was a single-issue voter on this. Why did you change your mind? As a public defender, as a prosecutor who's been in that prison system, who's been in the Metropolitan Detention Center, who's been in segregated housing, you know a suicide when you see one. And that's what that was. Again, you want me to-- I've seen the whole file. He killed himself. I've never seen someone so sad that the deep state didn't kill someone. And also, hey, you can't talk so much shit about how the deep state did this and make it your entire personality. And then now you're in it, and you're like, just shrugging it off, like, uh, yeah, I guess they were right the first time they investigated this. Hey. If you fail that hard, you got to let Hillary Clinton kill you, right? And finally-- [CHEERING] Yeah. I don't know what we're cheering for. [LAUGHTER] And finally, let's talk about the Department of Transportation. Recently, air travel in America has become what's known in the industry as totally [BLEEP]. And I'm sure Secretary Sean Duffy has been working on a great plan to fix it. We are moving Jesus out of the basement. [AUDIENCE MURMURING] What? [LAUGHTER] What, is that the new air traffic controller? Because that's what we need right now. To all the great midshipmen at the Merchant Marine Academy, you let me know how important this painting was to all of you. Now, we all know it was taken out of a place of prominence and put in down in the basement. I've worked with the academy. And because this is such a historic painting, I'm announcing that through that work with the academy, this painting is going to go from the basement back to its place of prominence. It'll be a moment to celebrate. [CLAPS] Oh, thank God. [CHEERING]  No, no. No. No, thank God. Because when my plane is going down, I can tell the person next to me, don't worry. There's a shitty Jesus painting. It's upstairs at the Merchant Marine Academy now. For more on the return of the Jesus painting, let's go live to the painting and hear from the king of kings himself, Jesus Christ. [CHEERING]  Hello, my child. Wait, hang on. Jesus, you're white? I mean, I thought the real Jesus was, like, Middle Eastern or something. Uh, well, I can take any form I wish. And this particular one gets me through airport security faster. Oh, right. Of course. But-- oh, hey, Your Majesty, Sean-- Sean Duffy is taking you out of the basement. I mean, you got to be happy about that. No. No, I'm not happy about it. There's plenty of other things to be worried about right now. Planes are falling out of the sky. Boats are crashing into the Brooklyn Bridge. Newark Airport killed itself. I mean-- [LAUGHTER] --not to brag, but when I was on Earth, we had zero plane crashes [LAUGHTER] Uh, yeah. I guess that's technically true. But, um-- hey, at least you can be seen by more people in this historic painting. This shitty painting? [LAUGHTER] The one that looks like it was made at a bachelorette party drink and draw? [LAUGHTER] I've seen better portraits of myself on toast, OK? [LAUGHTER] You think this is how I want to be seen, hovering over a boat full of sailors? Hey, everybody, look, it's that famous painting. Jesus drowns in seamen. No, no, no, no, no. I was fine in the basement. I've had my pictures in worse places-- Irish grandmothers' bedrooms, prison cells, Mexican restaurants with a C health rating. [SPEAKING SPANISH] No me gusta. The point is, worry about stuff that's actually going on. OK. Well, I mean, you're kind of Jesus. Like, can you help us with some of this airport stuff? No, no, I've got more important things on my plate than fixing all your unforced errors. There's war, famine, the Knicks. [LAUGHTER] You're welcome, by the way. Oh, whoa, holy crap. Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. So that was you. (SARCASTICALLY) Oh, no, the Knicks got this far by themselves. [LAUGHTER] Yeah. Of course it was me. OK. So are they going to go all the way? Oh my god, this really is a comedy show. All right. All right. Well, hey, can you get me courtside seats? - For you, anything. - All right, awesome. I'm going to bring my friend, Jordan Klepper. No [BLEEP] way, all right? I hate that guy-- not my best work, you know? You can't make the body long and the head long. I mean, what was I thinking? RONNY CHIENG: OK, amen to that. That's very accurate. Hey, Jesus Christ, everybody." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="moving on our main story tonight concerns utilities specifically electric utilities the company is responsible for delivering us power and also giving us the creepiest mascot ever created ready kilowatt a hell creature who for decades appeared in ads for over 200 electric companies like this one about him emancipating woman in the home and this one where he tells a housewife don't kill yourself it ain't worth it reddy even appeared on children shows where he undoubtedly gave a whole generation nightmares what's going on here ha ha you should know that you can expect anything to happen here mr toot boy i'll say hey what's happening now those peanuts they're floating in the air that's my new electrostatic generator get out of there mr toot that's the only time i've ever been scared for a clown we can't actually show you the rest of that video because and this is true if you watch it until the end ready shows up behind you and brutally murders you now you probably don't give too much thought to your local electric utility but if you do it might be because they're charging exorbitant rates for a basic human necessity as this north carolina pastor explains one of the founding members of this church sister linda jones she literally cut her pills in half skipped days in order to pay her life bill god bless her so she passed on and there are hundreds of people right around here who need that help that is terrible and in case it bumped you at all you're right that was a property brother that you just spotted there he made a documentary about utilities and it's actually pretty good to the point that you're even going to see a little more of it later on and if you're wondering which property brother that is i'll give you a clue it is the circumcised one and if you don't know which property brother is circumcised you're clearly not that big a fan of the property brothers and high bills are just the beginning of the problems here because utilities are also exceptionally prone to scandal in fact just google your utility company right now and the word scandal and chances are they've gotten into some major trouble it's basically like googling your local jimmy john's and e coli or the name of your favorite teacher from high school on january 6th you're not gonna like the results that you find and at their worst utilities can even be deadly take pacific gas and electric one of california's largest utilities we've talked before about the 2018 campfire the deadliest wildfire in california history and how it all started when this hook holding up a pg e transmission line broke causing the line to ignite the brush below eventually decimating several nearby communities and leaving 85 people dead pg e has since paid fines and settlements but it's still very much in operation despite the fact that wasn't close to the only scandal that they've been involved in as this reporter will tell you this is a company that was fined hundreds of times and faced more than two almost three billion dollars worth of fines you know if pg e was an individual and not a corporation i think by now they would be in prison there's just been repeat offenders they've been on probation they violated the probation the problem is you can't take a corporation and put into prison yeah he's right you can't even though many corporations clearly deserve to be imprisoned from enron to purdue to any company that insists on talking like a sassy on social media hellmann's once tweeted you're in their dms we're getting spread on their bread and why you don't need to do this hellmann's you can just be mayonnaise but pg e is not only not in prison it is still supplying power to millions of californians who have no choice in the matter and if you're thinking how the is that possible that is what this story is about it's about the incredible amount of power that we give to utilities how weakly they can be regulated and the damage this can do and let's start with the single most important thing to know about utility companies which is that for most of us they're actually the only game in town if you want to go buy an iphone or any other kind of consumer product you go out to a store and you have a number of choices with electricity in most of the country you really only have one choice and that company has a monopoly exactly in our modern economy you are supposed to have choice just look at all the streaming services out there if there's a blockbuster 2.0 superheroes and old racism anime probably crashing on you right now no idea no idea and until recently news quibby that is arguably too much choice but utilities operating as natural monopolies dates back to the fact that around the start of the 20th century we needed to build a nationwide power grid from scratch and that obviously required a huge investment companies were only incentivized to do that with a guarantee that they'd be able to operate in a non-competitive environment and at the time that made sense but those monopolies persist to this day and mostly as for-profit investor-owned companies now in exchange for giving utilities a deal that sweet we did put some restrictions in place the law says that they should spend the least they can while providing quality environmentally safe service which sounds great because it caps their ability to make too much money but and this is a huge but there is a carve out because when they build something a piece of physical infrastructure they are allowed to then pass along that cost to you through your bill plus an additional percentage they get to keep as profit usually around 10 percent and this creates a clear incentive the bigger the project like a power plant the more profit they make as this activist explains big monopoly utilities get a guaranteed range of a rate of return on their capital expenditure so like a waiter in a restaurant where there's a guaranteed tip the more that is spent if you buy dessert or you get a bottle of wine the more money they're going to make right if your profit is pecked to doing certain things you're going to make sure that you do those things more it's just like if hbo only paid me for every time i got weirdly horny for an animal except that's actually a bad example because the show would pretty much look exactly like it already does not now not now i'm trying to make a point go away before i change my mind goodness gracious and in the best case scenario this might mean that utilities are investing in infrastructure that is badly needed the problem is they can also be shameless in increasing spending even when it is not needed or on projects that are actively falling apart take south carolina when utilities there tried to add two nuclear reactors to an existing plant the project's cost spiraled and a massive federal investigation later revealed that executives at south carolina electric and gas and its parent company knew the project was facing major delays and cost overruns but withheld that information in order to keep it going meanwhile local customers paid more than two billion dollars in the form of higher bills for a project which by the way never generated any power and some working on the project at the time were troubled by what they were seeing just listen to this leaked voicemail from a vice president at the parent company who later became a whistleblower in which she tried to warn her colleagues about what was happening they are mismanaging that project and it's a jaw's expense they're doing it because they want to make money and they're propping up earnings to be able to make their um bonuses and it's going to be at your expense yeah that's pretty shocking isn't it not just what she's saying there but also that people still leave voicemails absolutely no one should be doing that anymore in fact every voicemail greeting should just be sorry i missed your call please don't leave a message after the tone just text me instead because it's not 1997. and overspending isn't the only way that utilities incentives can wind up screwing over customers because they can deliberately stifle innovation that might make power cheaper or be a net benefit to society as this solar power executive will tell you now solar is becoming real these utility monopolies are saying wait a minute we got to crush it before it gets too too big they want to build more plants so they can make more money and if we take a little bite out of that apple and we say hey guys we got solar panels everywhere on all these homes and you don't need to build that many more power plants then the utility goes well wait a minute how am i going to make more money next year yeah exactly people putting up solar panels and generating their own electricity threatens the anti-competitive structure of a utilities monopoly so they're obviously going to try and step in and block it who wants competition it just makes things harder you think i want to compete with euphoria or love island or this youtube video of ducks annihilating a bowl of peas [Applause] you could be watching that on a loop right now instead of watching this show you idiots why are you still here make better choices some activists have even used rooftop solar as a way of challenging the monopolies in their states remember that church from earlier where the pastor was talking about people cutting pills in half to make ends meet well in 2015 to help cut costs it partnered with this local non-profit and in an attempt to challenge the laws on the books the nonprofit installed a small solar panel system on the roof of the church at no upfront cost financing it by selling electricity to them at about half the rate to their utility duke energy charged now similar arrangements are permitted in other states but not in north carolina and duke energy pushed back hard asking the state's regulators to issue a cease and desist to the non-profit and invoke its power to find them up to a thousand dollars a day for every day it sold power to the church and in the end duke energy got what they wanted that church's solar arrangement was shut down and any hope of replicating it in the state was squashed and when circumcised property brother asked duke about this whole saga their response wasn't great faith community church wanted to test regulation in north carolina by doing something that was basically illegal they were trying to pick a fight you could say that they had a good setup to get publicity this was a african-american church and we're a big utility and we're a target and sometimes there are groups out there they're not trying to advance policy they're trying to get media attention and they they did a good job here are there situations where as a human being you have a conflict as a utility company where you're saying this is how it has to be versus maybe there's a bigger picture with something that's broken i think that's just the way it has been wait wait wait just the way it's been has historically never been a great justification for something still happening in fact there is only one time that that works as an argument when you're talking about the milwaukee brewers sausage race now why do a bunch of sausages race around the fields before the bottom of the sixth inning because that's just the way it's been it doesn't make sense and may it never change long live the racing sausages and there are examples all over the country of utilities getting in the way of people using solar energy the argument being if people start leaving the grid and generating their own power then over time the cost is going to go up for everyone left behind and look there is a longer conversation to be had about the proper way to build people who use solar panels but making it cost prohibitive is definitely not the answer and if you're thinking shouldn't there be someone who can rein these companies in well in theory there is most states have public utility commissions they are responsible for things like signing off on any big investments proposed and also overseeing the setting of rates unfortunately many of them are badly outmatched by the utilities that they're supposed to regulate and this can have major consequences a few years back mississippi power ran into massive cost overruns on a new plant that it was building which was initially expected to cost 1.8 billion dollars but ended up ballooning to seven and a half billion and in hindsight there were obvious red flags that you would hope the state commission would have been more wary of from the very start just listen to a company representative explain his side of the story can you tell us why the project is over budget and also behind schedule i would tell you that if we made any errors in judgment at all any missteps is that when we took that proposal to the commission we were only at between 10 or 15 percent of design and so i think it's the little engineering that we had done at that particular point in time that has sort of come back to haunt us a little bit in terms of cost and schedule wait let me get this straight the plant was only 10 to 50 designed and the commission let it go ahead anyway that is not how designing complex energy plants should work that's not even how designing lego sets work that's why you've never seen one called a little tree and you figure out the rest now in mississippi's case the problem seems to have been a commission rushing to approve a project without doing proper due diligence but in other cases like alabama's state commission the problem seems to be ideological it has been described as one of the most opaque politically motivated and environmentally hostile commissions in the country their commissioners are actually elected and i do want to show you one campaign ad for the woman who is currently running it twinkle's priority is our priority jobs we need more conservatives like twinkle who put jobs first twinkle is a proven conservative republican who has stood up and fought the liberal special interest in washington conservative republican twinkle andrus kavanagh our way of fighting back yeah that woman is named twinkle that is her actual given name as in when she was born her parents were asked what do you want to name your baby and they genuinely replied twinkle definitely twinkle she even confirmed this story yourself saying my daddy thought i needed a fancy name it may be cute for a three-year-old but it gets old and honestly i could see how being called twinkle could get older for a while but let me just say this twinkle for everyone who isn't you calling you twinkle will never get old it will never get old twinkle and look i'm not saying that twinkle is a bad commissioner because she's called twinkle i'm saying that twinkle's a bad commissioner because for one thing when there was a push for more open hearings on electricity rates in the state she outright said i want to exclude the environmentalists from taking part in the process and suggested that environmental extremists only wanted these open proceedings so they could trot out their fancy san francisco environmental lawyers and junk science hucksters and the thing is it's not just twinkle when one of alabama's other commissioners chip beaker again real name because it seems alabama's utility commissioners must by law sound like hannah barbera cartoon characters when chip beaker was running for his position he wrote in an op-ed the so-called climate change crisis is about as real as unicorns and little green men from mars which is obviously ridiculous because climate change is very real and unicorns sadly do not exist which i know is not ideal although if you're in the market for a majestic creature with a lot of horn this guy may be able to help you and look having a commission run by science denying ideologues is bad enough but in other states public officials can appear fully in utilities pockets take ohio a few years back a big utility there first energy was caught up in this massive scandal ohio house speaker larry householder and four others have been charged with racketeering accused by the feds of funneling millions from the energy company into a 501c4 dark money group called generation now okay first generation now sounds like a failed 90s boy band whose members are all now spokesman for different cryptocurrency companies but very basically what happened there is that first energy funneled 60 million dollars to the speaker of the ohio house to get him to pass a bill hb6 that has been called the worst energy bill of the 21st century now i have to tell you the house speaker in question denies wrongdoing and is still awaiting trial but what is very clear is that first energy was working extremely hard to influence the decision-making process they actually paid the chairman of the state's utility commission 22 million dollars in consulting fees in the years directly preceding him becoming their regulator and while he denies doing anything improper i will point out that on the very day the bill passed first energy ceo wrote to him saying and i quote hb6 anybody who ain't us which is very cool right and just so you know the man who wrote that is this guy who looks like he's left lengthy reviews for multiple gas grills on homedepot.com this man wrote the words anybody who ain't us this old white man take those precise words with his old white fingers so look to recap our utility system largely consists of for-profit companies with monopolies over an essential service building as much as they possibly can so they can pass the cost along to you on your electric bill and to see just how bad all this can get let's go back to pg e arguably california's most hated company in fact a quick skim through any pg e affiliates yelp page gives you just a taste of that because you'll find reviews like absolute show garbage company you pg e your day will come and my personal favorite the actual technicians lovely often hot to boot phone people hit on this either dismissive and stupid or thoughtful and kind corporation itself evil empire personified which is a lot more nuanced than you typically find in yelp reviews look i understand that the lowest ranking smoking hot employee that i interface with isn't to blame for the company's larger structural problems but for the record everyone in the c-suite with a cactus and you can see why californians hate pg e so much in just one three-year time span it was responsible for around 1500 fires that's an average of more than one fire a day and at that point pg e a lesser utility and more a fire company that occasionally also delivers power to people's homes and so many of pg e's problems stem from the way that they are incentivized to operate because remember their profits are paid to money that they spend on new infrastructure that they build not on what they spend maintaining it or the area around it and when you don't maintain equipment eventually it fails that old hook that broke and started the campfire was 97 years old and it's not even their only hook that was dangerously worn down this hook found a couple miles up the line from where the campfire started shows just how bad things got a groove more than halfway through the metal from decades of grinding against the hole it hung from holy decades of grinding isn't exactly a phrase that you want to associate with a vital piece of our power grid it's barely a phrase you want to hear at your grandparents 50th anniversary i mean you're happy for them right it's obviously what's kept them together for so long you just you don't want to hear it and it's not like pg e didn't have the money to perform basic maintenance because in the five years before the campfire it issued over five billion dollars in dividends to shareholders look clearly this isn't a system where you the customer are going to be prioritized if anything the model only makes sense if the company's shareholders are viewed as the customer and your bills are the product and what you would hope elected officials in california would crack down on pg e many take money from them and don't seem to see anything really wrong with that just watch as california's governor blows off a pretty pointed question pg e was convicted of a federal of six federal felonies in 2016. after that you took more than two hundred thousand dollars to help get elected how should people trust you to be running the show to come up with the solution i um i i wish you luck with whatever you're working on but uh that's a strange question wait is it though is it because that seemed pretty reasonable to me it's not that reporter asked mr governor why do you think the wiggles had princess diana killed that is a strange question there was no big red car anywhere near the scene but what he just asked you deserved a proper answer and yet frustratingly if you live in california and pg e is your provider there is nothing you can do every time you turn your lights on you are reminded that your utility has killed people and the only real recourse you have is giving them a shitty yelp review so how do we fix this well if we were able to start our power grid over from scratch what we would probably do is make utilities publicly owned and run by the government it wouldn't fix everything things might still go wrong but you would remove so many of the worst incentives here unfortunately transitioning now would be hugely expensive and in all likelihood isn't happening anytime soon but there are smaller steps that we should also be taking in the meantime for instance instead of having a system where utilities are incentivized just to build stuff we can incentivize them to work directly in the customer's best interest by investing in things like maintenance renewables and energy conservation this is something known as performance-based regulation and several states are already trying it now as for the regulators look commissions will unfortunately probably always vary in effectiveness depending on whether it's staffed by people who actually give a about this or let's say someone named twinkle but we have to make sure that under-resourced regulators get more support more access to technical expertise and more jurisdiction over the companies that they monitor and at this point i would usually bring out a mascot that we made for utilities that's representative of just how terrible and horrifying they are but amazingly i don't even need to do that do i because they already made a murderous hell demon almost a hundred years ago with ready kilowatt so all we really need to do is simply bring ready back so ladies and gentlemen i'm thrilled to present to you the glorious return of ready kilowatt ready ready ready where are you where are you ready yeah this is creepy i'm already regretting this where is the clown ready where's where's mr toot he's dead john yep i killed him of course you did i'd like to leave ready this is a bad idea who said you could do that why the world is my monopoly and i alone control it okay you want to use your refrigerator yes yes i do you want your lights to go on and off yes i do then your local utility is your gun right i am your god look i cannot believe i'm saying this ready but you are actually too good at representing how shitty utility companies are oh you have no idea why i could kill you right now and there's nothing anyone could do about it don't be nasty about it oh oh what happened to the lights blackouts happen john no no you turn the lights back on you freak you can do it yourself john just go ahead and pull that lever oh wait just this one here uh-huh oh okay here it goes i am gonna get such a fine for that that's our show thank you so much for watching see you next week for another episode of last week tonight with ready kilowatt [Laughter] bye-bye [Music] [Laughter] hahaha you" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="our main story tonight concerns food or as plants and animals might call it the afterlife we we love food in America as you would know if you've ever turned on a television set I have I you can eat pancakes are back introducing all you could eat wings only at Golden Corral everyone's favorite endless shrimp is back people wait for this promotion all year Longet all that you can eat now sadness sadness sadness let food replace your sadness stuff riblets in that hole in your heart that is that's a catchy way to sell hog scraps head in barbecue sauce in fact celebrating America often goes hand inhand with celebrating its food what's this actual commercial running right now what's more American than a cheeseburger this cheeseburger loaded with a hot dog and potato chips in the hands of All American model Samantha Hoops in a hot tub in a pickup truck driven by an American bull rider on an aircraft carrier under the Gaze of Lady Liberty as she admires the most American thick Burger New at Carl Jr and Hardy wow a cheeseburger with hot dog and potato chips ladies and gentlemen I give you the new Confederate flag she's Majestic but but this is not this is not a story about the food we eat it's a story about the food we don't eat because there is a surprising amount of it a report by the natural resources defense Council says that as much as 40% of all the food produced in the United States never gets eaten Americans throw away 165 billion worth of food every year that's about 20 lb per person every month Americans throw away enough food every year to fill 730 football stadiums food waste is like the band Rascal Flats it can fill a surprising number of stadiums even though many people consider it complete garbage but between producers Sellers and consumers Americans are throwing out a third or more of our food and the amount we throw out has increased by around 50% since the 1970s at this rate in 40 years when you order pizza from they'll just deliver it straight to the nearest dumpster as they should but that's not the point here and and if you think if you think that this sounds bad just wait until you see how it looks check out this waste dump in California's Selenas Valley we got a whole load pretty much of loose organic lettuce you know we we've got spinach towards the back uh looks like it's perfectly fine nothing wrong with it we got some uh some kale here we got broccoli in the back as well we have plenty of produce you make a salad here oh not just a salad you could make a significantly better salad than the salads they actually sell at McDonald's which look like the trimmings in Ronald McDonald's lawnmower mixed with Grimace ejaculate and and the thing is watching all that food go from Farm to not a table is awful for a bunch of reasons first and most obviously there are many people in this country who need that food in 2013 nearly 50 million Americans lived in food insecure households meaning that that's some point in the year they struggle to put enough food on the table and the fact that we throw away a third of our food gets pretty alarming when you hear from some of those people it's hard I I'll go without food before my kids will budg is down to the penny and it's just not enough still it brings you to tears yeah why it's just hard they're so young and it's hard it is crazy that that is happening in a country with 730 football stadiums for of uneaten food it's insane but there are also other less obvious consequences to discarding food for a start we're wasting all the labor and natural resources that went into making it and at a time when the landscape of California is shriveling up like a pumpkin in front of a house with a lazy dad it seems especially unwise the farmers are pumping water into food that ends up being used as a garnish for landfills because those landfills go on to cause problems of their own if you were to throw an an apple core just out into the woods it's not a big deal problem comes when all of that waste is aggregated and it decomposes without air in a landfill that Anor robic condition is what creates methane which is a greenhouse gas that's more than 20 times as potent as CO2 at trapping heat that's right when we dump food into a landfill we're essentially throwing a trash blanket over a flatulent food man and Dutch ovening the entire planet and and if you're thinking but but hold on John what if I'm an who couldn't give a about America's hungry families or the long-term viability of life on Earth well first let me say Mr Trump thank you so much for taking the time to watch this show tonight it's lovely to have you with us and secondly don't worry there is a selfish Financial reason for you to care about this story too in our households we're wasting somewhere between 15 and 25% of the food that we're buying you know that's expensive I mean imagine walking out of a grocery store with four bags of groceries dropping one in the parking lot and just not bothering to pick it up and that's essentially what we're doing in our homes today and that's not good when you're throwing away that much food you're not just being wasteful you're whining and dining raccoons oh this is absolutely lovely thanks for this we needed a break from the kids and look look it's a good thing so many of us have access to plenty of relatively inexpensive food I love the fact that we live in a country with cap and crunch uh peanut butter crunch chocolatey crunch sprinkle donut crunch cinnamon roll crunch Christmas Crunch and Halloween crunch I will even defend oops or berries crunch a cereal so unnecessary that its actual name includes an apology for its existence but it does seem it does seem like our food wastage is getting to a critical mass and so much of it stems from our own habits and misconceptions for instance stores big and small often routinely Overstock so that you can walk in and see tons of food there because if they don't do that as this small Farmstand operator describes it we might not buy anything if this was what I had and there was an hour left in the market that one bunch of chart would sit there and no one would buy it but if I had 30 Bunches of chart all like bursting out I'd probably sell like25 those punches a chart so what does that say like people are totally impulse JS and they think if there's one left that there's something wrong with it it's true I wouldn't buy that chard partly because it's chard but mainly because we naturally assume the last option is a bad option which in many contexts is absolutely the case for example uh you don't want the last magazine in the doctor's office because it's always Golf Digest always and no one has ever read Golf Digest that's not even a golf club in his hand but no one noticed because it's on Golf Digest but when it comes to produce the last option is probably completely fine especially because as another farmer explains even slightly subar fruits and vegetables don't make it to the produce oil every time that the people are picking they'll have a few they throw on the ground because there's always a few that aren't quite perfect this is a perfectly good Peach right on the ground like this y oh my God if you just look down this way it's like a bounty look at that and the reason that happens is that if a peach doesn't meet strict aesthetic standards it might not be worth a farmer even trying to sell it our produce oils have become a lot like Leonardo DiCaprio's penis exclusively accessible to the physically Flawless and it's not right that's not right in fact our produce body shaming is actually so ingrained it's reflected in the usda's grading standards just look at the visual grading standards for peaches this is a number one peach and of course it is that's an undeniably beautiful peach I I want to buy that peach dinner and it whereas whereas embrace yourself this is a number two Peach and that is an Abomination unto the Lord and as soon as it is labeled a number two it can lose 23ds of its market value to a farmer even though its contents are the same and many retailers have standards even more strict than the USDA all of which is why so many Peach end up being thrown on the ground to rot and that should not be how we treat our fruit it should only be how we treat our celebrities so help me God Channing Tatum you lose one muscle fiber on that six-pack and I will personally toss you into Hollywood's landfill you keep it tight tatm # keepit tight tatm do you do it and and the thing is we don't just reject food because of how it looks sometimes we do it out of pure fear according to one estimate 91% of us have thrown out food that's past it cell by dates because we're afraid it's not safe and I am absolutely part of that 91% we're weirdly reverent towards these dates even when they make no sense used by sell bu and nothing but just a date and this is all the same brand this is all the same brand this is not only the same brand but also the same 2% so what does this show us this shows there's complete confus Fusion out there the only labels on food more meaningless than those are the ones on smernoff bottles that say triple distills vodka oh really Smur off so you ran the potato sweats through the tube sock two extra times thanks for spending the effort we naturally assume sell by dates reflect a uniform standard of safety but that is not true well actually it has nothing to do with safety at all it's just a manufacturer's best guess of when that food is going to be the freshest and at the the best quality exactly those dates are decided on by manufacturers and if I were a food manufacturer I would make those dates as tight as possible to convince people to buy a new one of my products because unlike Apple I can't just create a new operating system that suddenly means your old cereal is incompatible with your mouth and the truth is with the exception of baby formula the federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date and state laws vary widely with 9 States not requiring any date labels at all which means most of the time sell by dates are one of those things that look official but you can probably ignore like a child in a cop uniform just just stop it Tyler I'm not under a West you're under a West but but because we think those dates are real many supermarkets throw expired food out even before it sell by date and they don't donate it for what they think is a pretty good reason do you have that's close dated or any calls no we can't do that you can't no it's a food health and safety it's a safety that you can do you guys donate it then or you don't donate it no so if it goes right in the garage it goes stra in the garbage yeah can't do it because get too many lawsuits there's too many lawsuits have you guys been sued before I don't know to tell you the truth but it's a health and safety issue that's a common misconception we all think that if you don't donate food and someone gets sick you could get sued I thought that until earlier this week but we looked into it and couldn't find a single case where a food donor has been sued it doesn't happen it's a false fear like believing if you go in the water after eating you'll get a cramp and drown yeah it turns out that isn't true either this week has blown my mind because the system is if you donate food to a charity you're covered by the Emerson act which says you cannot be sued if you make a Food donation in good faith you presumably get the same cover with donating clothes even though in some cases there you really should be sued donating a cow neck sweater hello the homeless Liv in shelters not 4 [Applause] 2008 but here's here's the problem even if more people understood that there would still be food that doesn't get to people who need it for a critical reason Harold Mardy of HMC Farms says he'd like to donate more of his peaches to the food banks but getting it into the hands of somebody to eat it isn't isn't free there's got to be an economic incentive to move more of this into an Avenue that food banks could take advantage of it's a lot easier and cheaper just to Bas it throw it away and that may be the biggest issue of all for businesses donating food is genuinely expensive you've got to box it store it uh coordinate deliveries for it there's a lot of overheads and you cannot fault companies for caring about their bottom line in the same way you can't fault a dog for caring about licking its balls it's what dogs do it's natural and dog balls are delicious companies in their defense are not Charities which is why they should be incentivized to donate food with tax breaks large corporations already get one but annoyingly that same break for small businesses is not a permanent part of the tax code meaning that Congress has to keep renewing it and that's a problem because Family Farms or local restaurants may not know if they're going to get that break at the end of the year and therefore whether donating food will be financially viable for them it's a ridiculous system which probably prevents a lot of food from being donated so here is the good news in February this year a congressman proposed HR 644 the fighting hunger incentive act uh to make that tax break permanent here actually is one of the bill sponsors it's time to get rid of these short-term f Embrace long-term Solutions this legislation simply makes the provisions permanent and when you think about it that's important because when something's not permanent it affects our Behavior that's why we all treat rental cars like we're in a fast and furious movie oh I'm sorry sharp turn ahead get ready to drift Kia sento woo now now you'll be happy to hear that bill passed the house however by the time it did it had been bundled together with other unpaid for tax breaks and retitled the America gives more act but still that original provision was in there which means this problem has been solved the show is over we can roll credits and all live happily ever after right no not right because when the bill got to the Senate they and I honestly did not know this was even possible they removed everything from inside the bill retitled it the trade facilitation and trade Enforcement Act of 2015 15 and refilled it with completely different language concerning border control and US Israeli relations which meant yes HR 644 past just with a completely different title and completely different contents it's like going to a restaurant ordering a veggie burger and having the way to say here you go uh we made it out of meatloaf and we call it a waffle and then you can't even say well I don't want this give it to someone who needs it because they can't cuz they don't know whether or not they'll get a fuing tax credit for it and look the the insane thing is everyone basically agrees small businesses should get tax incentives to donate food so we have to find a way to pass that but even if we do it will be one small part of what needs to be a much bigger solution from resolving to eat uglier fruit uh to taking expiration dates with a pinch of salt to no longer worrying about getting sued by high-powered lawyers rep representing the hungry and and we all have to address our relationship with food waste or at the very least our cheeseburger commercials are going to have to get a lot more honest what's more American than a cheeseburger this cheeseburger loaded with a hot dog and potato chips in the hands of a model in a hot tub in a pickup truck on an aircraft carrier in front of the Statue of Liberty I'll tell you what's more American if that cheese Burgers than thrown away along with 15 other cheeseburgers in front of a food insecure family of four who frankly cannot fuing believe their eyes as they stand on top of 14 tons of perfectly edible if aesthetically unappealing fruits and vegetables which in turn sits on top of 80 tons of dairy products all one day past their arbitrary sell by date all of which sits inside a tear rolling down Abraham Lincoln's face on Mount Rushmore which is now nearly chin deep and millions of discarded cheeseburgers all gradually decomposing and emitting flammable methane in red white and blue that ising American behind car junr in Hardies" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="&gt;&gt; RACHEL. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU RACHEL. THANK YOU. WELL, THE CRISIS FACING THIS COUNTRY AND THE WORLD. TONIGHT IS THE COMPLETE COLLAPSE OF MENTAL. ACUITY IN THE. &gt;&gt; PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. &gt;&gt; THE CURRENT PRESIDENT. THIS WEEKEND, THE PRESIDENT. &gt;&gt; OF THE UNITED STATES ENDORSED. &gt;&gt; A SOCIAL MEDIA POST THAT SAYS THERE IS NO JOE BIDEN EXECUTED IN 2020. BIDEN CLONES, DOUBLES AND ROBOTIC ENGINEERED. &gt;&gt; SOULLESS. &gt;&gt; MINDLESS ENTITIES ARE WHAT YOU SEE. NEEDLESS TO SAY, DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; IS THE ONLY. &gt;&gt; PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. WHO CAN PUBLICLY EMBRACE AND. ACCEPT AND BELIEVE SUCH INSANITY WITHOUT IMMEDIATELY PROVOKING A RUSH OF QUESTIONS BY THE. &gt;&gt; WHITE HOUSE. &gt;&gt; PRESS CORPS AND. NEWS ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE WORLD ABOUT THE SANITY OF THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, WHICH MEANS. THAT THE INSANITY OF THE CURRENT. &gt;&gt; AMERICAN PRESIDENT. &gt;&gt; IS NOW. &gt;&gt; OFFICIALLY TAKEN FOR GRANTED. IN THE NEWS MEDIA. NO HUGE BANNERS. &gt;&gt; OURELY. &gt;&gt; ENGINEER A ROBOTIC. &gt;&gt; SOULLESS, MINDLESS ENTITY TO BE SMARTER. &gt;&gt; THAN DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY. &gt;&gt; OF THE AMERICAN. &gt;&gt; NEWS MEDIA. HAS ABSOLUTELY. &gt;&gt; NO PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; NOW, WITH DONALD TRUMP SAYING. THERE IS. &gt;&gt; NO JOE. &gt;&gt; BIDEN EXECUTED. IN 2020. DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; DIDN'T ACTUALLY WRITE THOSE WORDS. &gt;&gt; HIMSELF, BUT HE FOUND THOSE WORDS IN HIS POISON SOCIAL MEDIA FEED, AND HE DECIDED TO FULLY. &gt;&gt; ENDORSE AND EMBRACE THOSE WORDS. &gt;&gt; THE NEW YORK TIMES REMAINS ONE OF THE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS THAT FINDS THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR IN A PRESIDENT STRANGE. &gt;&gt; THOUGH NOT WORTHY. &gt;&gt; OF BIG FRONT PAGE HEADLINES. AND SO THE NEW YORK. &gt;&gt; TIMES RAN A STORY TITLED. TRUMP AMPLIFIES ANOTHER OUTLANDISH. CONSPIRACY THEORY. BIDEN IS A ROBOTIC. &gt;&gt; CLONE. AND HERE IS THE MOST. &gt;&gt; IMPORTANT LINE IN THAT STORY. &gt;&gt; THE WHITE HOUSE DID NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT. ON THE. &gt;&gt; POST ABOUT MR. BIDEN. &gt;&gt; THAT, OF COURSE, WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR. &gt;&gt; ANY OTHER WHITE HOUSE IF THE PRESIDENT AMPLIFIED. &gt;&gt; QUOTE. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER OUTLANDISH. CONSPIRACY THEORY. IF ANY OTHER PRESIDENT SAID THAT A. &gt;&gt; PREVIOUS LIVING PRESIDENT. &gt;&gt; IS A ROBOTIC. &gt;&gt; CLONE. &gt;&gt; THAT WHITE HOUSE WOULD. &gt;&gt; NOT BE ABLE TO SIMPLY. &gt;&gt; REFUSE TO COMMENT. &gt;&gt; BUT THAT IS HOW FULLY DONALD TRUMP HAS CRUSHED POLITICAL REPORTING AND POLITICAL COVERAGE. &gt;&gt; IN THIS COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE HE HAS CRUSHED IT, HE CAN, IN PUBLICITY TERMS ANYWAY, GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING AND HEITE HOUSE DID NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT ON THE POST ABOUT MR. BIDEN. IF YOU WANT TO RUSH TO DONALD TRUMP'S DEFENSE, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GUESS AT A DEFENSE. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE UP A DEFENSE THAT DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF HAS NOT OFFERED. YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BELIEVE, AS A RESULT OF THAT SINGLE POST ALONE, THAT DONALD TRUMP IS COMPLETELY DERANGED AND HAS NO IDEA WHAT DAY IT IS OR WHAT COUNTRY HE LIVES IN, THAT IS AS DEFENSIBLE A REACTION TO DONALD TRUMP'S POST AS THE NOTION THAT IT'S A JOKE. NEITHER ONE OF THOSE REACTIONS CAN BE PROVED, BUT WHAT IS UNDENIABLE BY ANYONE, ANYWHERE, THE STILL BREATHTAKING STUPIDITY OF DONALD TRUMP TO FIND THAT POST, AND THE POISONOUS FLOW OF HIS SOCIAL MEDIA AND DECIDE THAT THAT'S THE ONE, THAT'S THE ONE HE WANTS TO PUSH THAT DAY. THAT IS A MAN WHOSE STUPIDITY KNOWS NO BOUNDS. THAT IS THE MAN WHOSE STUPIDITY NEVER BUMPS INTO DECENCY, WHICH WOULD THEN PREVENT HIM FROM DOING THE INDECENT, THE STUPID. IN FACT, DONALD TRUMPEN NEVER PARDONED ANYBODY WHO STOLE $200 MILLION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AND JOE BIDEN NEVER APPOINTED ANYONE TO ANYTHING AS INCOMPETENT AND RECKLESS AND CRUEL AS ELON MUSK, WHO BID HIS FAREWELL TO HIS FORMAL ENGAGEMENT OF SERVICE WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ON FRIDAY IN THE OVAL OFFICE, WHERE HIS PHYSICAL BEHAVIOR GAVE MANY INDICATIONS OF POSSIBLY CONFIRMING THE HEADLINE THAT EMERGED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT VERY DAY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, ELON MUSK JUGGLED DRUGS AND FAMILY DRAMA. WE AWAIT AN EXPLANATION OF ELON MUSK'S PHYSICALITY, INCLUDING HIS INEXPLICABLE GAZES AT THE CEILING AND HEAD TWISTING AT THE CEILING IN THE OVAL OFFICE. THE FOX WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, WHO APPEARED TO BE THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES OF THE PRESS CORPS IN THE OVAL OFFICE ON FRIDAY BECAUSE HE WAS ALLOWED TO ASK MANY MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANYONE ELSE, SEEMS TO BE ON HIS WAY TO ASK ABOUT THE NEW YORK TIMES. BREAKING NEWS ABOUT ELON MUSK'S DRUG USE. &gt;&gt; THERE IS A NEW YORK. &gt;&gt; TIMES REPORT TODAY. &gt;&gt; THAT ACCUSES YOU OF BLURRING. &gt;&gt; THE LINE. &gt;&gt; BETWEEN NEW YORK TIMES. IS THAT THE SAME PUBLICATION? &gt;&gt; NOTICE THAT THE FOX REPORTER IMMEDIATELY STOPPED WHEN ELON MUSK ORDERED HIM TO STOP AND WAIT. ELON MUSK THEN WENT INTO A LYING SOLILOQUY ABOUT THE NEW YORK TIMES, ENDING WITH A DIRECT ORDER TO THE FOX FOX REPORTER, TO QUOTE THESE WERE HIS WORDS MOVE ON, AND THE FOX REPORTER DID EXACTLY WHAT RUPERT MURDOCH IS PAYING HIM TO DO IN THAT SITUATION. HE MOVED ON WHEN ORDERED TO MOVE ON BY ANYONE IN TRUMP WORLD. THAT IS THE SAME FOX REPORTER WHO GLEEFULLY JOINED IN THE SCREAMING AT JOE BIDEN OR HIS PRESS SECRETARY IN THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE. EVERY REPORTER WORKING IN THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE KNEW THEY COULD SCREAM AT JOE BIDEN OR SCREAM AT THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY AND NOT BE KICKED OUT OF THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE PERMANENTLY OR EVER. AND LIKE CHILDREN WHO KNOW THEY WON'T GET IN TROUBLE IF THEY DO IT, THEY DID IT. THEY SCREAMED AT JOE BIDEN AND HIS PRESS SECRETARY. AND LIKE CHILDREN WHO KNOW THEY WILL GET IN TROUBLE IF THEY DO IT, THEY DON'T DARE DO IT NOW, BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HAS CRUSHED ALL OF THAT. AND SO DONALD TRUMP AND ELON MUSK GOT AWAY WITH ANOTHER LYING SESSION WITHOUT ANY SERIOUS CHALLENGE FROM A SINGLE WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, NOT ONE OF WHOM ASKED ELON MUSK HOW IT FELT TO KILL CHILDREN. NOT ONE OF THOSE WHITE HOUSE REPORTERS COVERING ELON MUSK'S FAREWELL FROM GOVERNMENT SERVICE ASKED HIM TO REPLY TO BILL GATES DESCRIPTION OF ELON MUSK AS THE WORLD'S RICHEST MAN, KILLING THE WORLD'S POOREST CHILDREN. THAT IS ELON MUSK'S SINGULAR ACHIEVEMENT IN GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE ELON MUSK DECIDED TO DESTROY THE UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, THE AGENCY THAT WAS FEEDING MORE STARVING CHILDREN IN THE WORLD THAN ANY OTHER AGENCY. MORE STARVING CHILDREN IN THE WORLD DEPENDED ON SURPLUS FOOD FROM THE UNITED STATES TO SURVIVE. FOOD WE DO NOT NEED AND CANNOT CONSUME, FOOD WE HAVE OVERPRODUCED IN THIS COUNTRY. AND ELON MUSK DECIDED TO TAKE THAT FOOD AWAY FROM THEM AND LET THEM DIE. AND THAT IS NOT NEWS TO THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS. NO ONE IS COUNTING BECAUSE ELON MUSK FIRED THE PEOPLE WHO WERE COUNTING, COLLECTING STATISTICS AND ADVANCED ECONOMIES IS RELATIVELY EASY, WITH ADVANCED METHODS RELATIVELY ACCURATE. BUT IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD, THE MOST IMPOVERISHED PARTS OF THE WORLD, STATISTICS CAN BE HARD TO COME BY. NOT EVERY BABY GETS A BIRTH CERTIFICATE. NOT EVERY BABY GETS A DEATH CERTIFICATE. THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE COUNTING HOW MANY PEOPLE ELON MUSK KILLED BY KILLING USAID WERE THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ELON MUSK FIRED FROM USAID. SO ELON MUSK COMMITS THE GREATEST CRIME OF THE 21ST CENTURY AGAINST THE POVERTY POPULATION OF THE WORLD, AND FIRES EVERYONE WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO QUANTIFY FOR US THE ENORMITY OF THE CRIME. THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTS, QUOTE, MR. MUSK, MUSK'S DRUG CONSUMPTION WENT WELL BEYOND OCCASIONAL USE. HE TOLD PEOPLE HE WAS TAKING SO MUCH KETAMINE, A POWERFUL ANESTHETIC, THAT IT WAS AFFECTING HIS BLADDER, A KNOWN EFFECT OF CHRONIC USE. HE TOOK ECSTASY AND PSYCHEDELIC MUSHROOMS, AND HE TRAVELED WITH A DAILY MEDICATION BOX THAT HELD ABOUT 20 PILLS, INCLUDING ONES WITH THE MARKINGS OF THE STIMULANT ADDERALL, ACCORDING TO A PHOTO OF THE BOX AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN IT, HE HAD A WHOLE BOX FULL OF DRUGS THAT HE COULD HAVE BEEN USING WHEN HE WAS TAKING LIFE SAVING DRUGS AWAY FROM CHILDREN. THE NEW YORK TIMES ACCOUNT IS ABOUT THE DRUGS ELON MUSK WAS TAKING DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. NBC NEWS HAS NOT INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED, CONFIRMED THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTING ELON MUSK HAS NOT ACTUALLY DENIED A SINGLE WORD OF THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTING. THE NEW YORK TIMES SAYS, QUOTE, WE PROVIDED MUSK WITH MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO REPLY OR REBUT THIS REPORTING BEFORE PUBLICATION, AND HE DECLINED. THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTING SUGGESTS THAT ELON MUSK TOOK FLIGHT ON A CAMPAIGN STAGE WITH DONALD TRUMP THE FIRST TIME HE WAS UP THERE, BECAUSE HE WAS POSSIBLY ON KETAMINE OR ECSTASY OR ADDERALL OR PSYCHEDELIC MUSHROOMS OR ALL OF THE ABOVE. AT THE SAME TIME. THE TIMES OBTAINED A TEXT MESSAGE BEFORE ELON MUSK JOINED THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, IN WHICH ELON MUSK COMPLAINED ABOUT THE INVESTIGATIONS OF HIS BUSINESSES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS DOING. AT THE TIME. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION VIEWS ME AS THE NUMBER TWO THREAT AFTER TRUMP. I CAN'T BE PRESIDENT, BUT I CAN HELP TRUMP DEFEAT BIDEN AND I WILL, HE ADDED. AND THE REST IS TRAGIC HISTORY. THE RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD POURED MONEY INTO A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, MORE MONEY THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS, AND HE DID IT TO END THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS AIMING AT HIS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. AND, OF COURSE, DONALD TRUMP ENDED THOSE INVESTIGATIONS BECAUSE YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR WITH DONALD TRUMP, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE THE RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD. THE WORLDWIDE CRUELTY CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED BY ELON MUSK AND DONALD TRUMP, NOW INCLUDES DEPORTING PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER COMMITTED A CRIME TO COUNTRIES WHERE THEY HAVE NEVER LIVED AND DO NOT SPEAK THE LANGUAGE. ELON MUSK SEEMS TO BELIEVE THAT CRUELTY IS THE ANTIDOTE TO EMPATHY, WHICH HE CONSIDERS A GREAT HUMAN WEAKNESS. ELON MUSK TOLD THE COMEDIAN JOE ROGAN, QUOTE, THE FUNDAMENTAL WEAKNESS OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION IS EMPATHY. ABRAHAM LINCOLN DID NOT KNOW THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN BELIEVED HE SHOULD GOVERN WITH EMPATHY. SO DID FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT. SO DID MOST PRESIDENTS, SOME BETTER THAN OTHERS. IT WAS EMPATHY, COUPLED WITH GEOPOLITICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH WISDOM, THAT LED PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH TO CREATE THE PRESIDENT'S EMERGENCY PLAN FOR AIDS RELIEF, WHICH SAVED 26 MILLION LIVES IN AFRICA ALONE. BEFORE ELON MUSK DECIDED THOSE LIVES WERE NOT WORTH SAVING. &gt;&gt; HAS ANYONE IN THE WORLD DIED BECAUSE OF WHAT ELON MUSK DID? THE YES OR NO? RECLAIMING MY TIME. IF YOU WON'T ANSWER, THAT'S A LOUD ANSWER. &gt;&gt; NO ONE HAS. &gt;&gt; DIED BECAUSE. &gt;&gt; OF USAID. THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; WHO HAVE DIED. &gt;&gt; AS A RESULT. &gt;&gt; OF CUTTING OFF THE OXYGEN OF A WOMAN IN BURMA AND DENYING HIV. &gt;&gt; AIDS TREATMENT &gt;&gt; ASKING ME QUESTIONS? &gt;&gt; MY JOB IS TO ASK YOU QUESTIONS. &gt;&gt; ONE THAT'S CLAIMING THAT. &gt;&gt; SECRETARY. &gt;&gt; I'M RECLAIMING MY TIME. SECRETARY, I'M RECLAIMING MY CLIENT. THIS IS WHY I'M INTRODUCING THE RUBIO ACT. SO YOU FOCUS ON THE ONE JOB. &gt;&gt; THAT THE. &gt;&gt; SENATE GAVE YOU TO. SERVE AS OUR SECRETARY OF STATE, BECAUSE YOU. ARE CLEARLY DISTRACTED. OKAY. AFTER LAST FEW MONTHS, I UNDERSTAND WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SUCH COLORFUL NICKNAMES FOR YOU. YOU'RE OBEDIENT. YOU'RE FOLLOWING THE RULES. YOU WILL DO ANYTHING THE PRESIDENT TELLS YOU TO DO WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE LAW, THE CONSTITUTION, AMERICA'S SECURITY, OR STANDING AS A LEADER IN THE WORLD. UNLIKE YOU, I DO NOT FEAR CROSSING DONALD TRUMP. I REFUSE TO GIVE UP ON THESE CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; MARCO RUBIO DID NOT TELL THE TRUTH TO THE COMMITTEE, AND THE PROOF THAT HE WAS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH IS THAT HE HAS CHANGED HIS STORY. AFTER THAT TESTIMONY, THE WASHINGTON POST FACT CHECKED MARCO RUBIO'S TESTIMONY, SAYING THERE IS NO DISPUTE THAT PEOPLE HAVE DIED BECAUSE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ABRUPTLY SUSPENDED FOREIGN AID. ONE MIGHT QUIBBLE OVER WHETHER TENS OF THOUSANDS OR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS HAVE DIED. IN HIS TESTIMONY, SECRETARY OF STATE RUBIO TRIED TO CONTRADICT REPORTING FROM AFRICA, FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES, NICHOLAS KRISTOF NICHOLAS KRISTOF RESPONDED TO RUBIO'S TESTIMONY, WRITING IN THE NEW YORK TIMES, LET ME HELP RUBIO WITH THE TRUTH. MEET EVAN ONZA, A FIVE YEAR OLD BOY WHO WAS BORN WITH HIV IN SOUTH SUDAN. I MENTIONED EVAN IN A COLUMN IN MARCH FROM SOUTH SUDAN. THIS WAS A CHILD AS PRECIOUS AS YOURS OR MINE. EVAN'S LIFE WAS IN OUR HANDS, AND FOR FIVE YEARS, AMERICA KEPT HIM ALIVE WITH ANTIRETROVIRAL MEDICINES COSTING LESS THAN $0.12 A DAY THROUGH THE PRESIDENT'S EMERGENCY PLAN FOR AIDS RELIEF, OR PEPFAR. THIS WAS A PROGRAM STARTED BY PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH AND HAS SAVED MORE THAN 26 MILLION LIVES SO FAR, AND IT TURNED THE TIDE OF AIDS AROUND THE WORLD AND BUILT ENORMOUS GOODWILL TOWARD THE UNITED STATES. THEN ALONG CAME PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS FREEZE ON MOST HUMANITARIAN AID IN JANUARY. HOW COULD A FIVE YEAR OLD ORPHAN POSSIBLY OBTAIN MEDICINE ON HIS OWN? EVAN WEAKENED AND SOON DIED OF AN OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTION, MARCO RUBIO TOLD THE HOUSE COMMITTEE. NO CHILDREN ARE DYING ON MY WATCH. EVAN DIED ON HIS WATCH. EVAN'S, OF ALL AGES ARE DYING ON MARCO RUBIO'S WATCH, AND NO ONE IS COUNTING. AND SO WE DON'T KNOW AS OF TONIGHT WHETHER IT'S TENS OF THOUSANDS OR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF EVAN'S, BUT WE KNOW IT WILL BE. IN A NEW YORK TIMES COLUMN TITLED, QUOTE, ELON MUSK'S LEGACY IS DISEASE, STARVATION AND DEATH. MICHELLE GOLDBERG REPORTS. BROOKE NICHOLS, AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF GLOBAL HEALTH AT BOSTON UNIVERSITY, HAS ESTIMATED THAT THESE CUTS HAVE ALREADY RESULTED IN ABOUT 300,000 DEATHS, MOST OF THEM OF CHILDREN, AND WILL MOST LIKELY LEAD TO SIGNIFICANTLY MORE BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THIS IS WHAT MUSK'S FORAY INTO POLITICS ACCOMPLISHED. IF THERE WERE JUSTICE IN THE WORLD, MUSK WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO REPAIR HIS REPUTATION, AT LEAST NOT WITHOUT DEVOTING THE BULK OF HIS FORTUNE TO EASING THE MISERY HE'S ENGENDERED. MUSK'S SOJOURN IN GOVERNMENT HAS REVEALED SEVERE FLAWS IN HIS CHARACTER A BLITHE, DEHUMANIZING CRUELTY AND A DEADLY INCURIOSITY. BILL GATES HAS SEEN STARVING CHILDREN IN AFRICA MANY, MANY TIMES AND HAS DEVOTED HIS LIFE AND HIS BILLIONS TO TRYING TO SAVE THEM, WHICH MAKES BILL GATES VERDICT ON THE CURRENT RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD SO IMPORTANT AND POWERFUL. BILL GATES, THE FORMER RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD, SAID THE PICTURE OF THE WORLD'S RICHEST MAN KILLING THE WORLD'S POOREST CHILDREN IS NOT A PRETTY ONE, AND THE PICTURE OF THE RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD CARRYING AROUND HIS DRUG BOX OF ECSTASY, ADDERALL, PSYCHEDELIC MUSHROOMS AND THEN TAKING LIFE SAVING DRUGS AWAY FROM THE POOREST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD IS A PICTURE ONLY DONALD TRUMP COULD HAVE CREATED. AND WITH ELON MUSK AND DONALD TRUMP, SOULLESS, MINDLESS ENTITIES" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="The man behind Trump’s trade war is Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and his backstory is extraordinary. He’s been a hero, he’s been a villain, he’s been a sympathetic figure and also one of the most hated men in America - and all of that is even before he attached himself to Donald Trump. Over the last few months, gambling with tariffs has caused economic chaos and sent global markets into a tailspin… but  Howard Lutnick is clearly all in. So why is the Commerce Secretary so reckless when it comes to the future of America’s economy?  &#10;Subscribe: https://ab.co/3yqPOZ5   &#10;Watch all episodes of If You're Listening - in our playlist here: &#10;   • If You're Listening | ABC News In-depth  &#10;&#10;Welcome to ABC News In-depth, where you'll find our long-form journalism and other videos to help you understand what's going on in the world around you.&#10;&#10;Watch more ABC News content ad-free on ABC iview: https://ab.co/2OB7Mk1&#10;&#10;For more from ABC News, click here: https://ab.co/2kxYCZY&#10;&#10;Get breaking news and livestreams from our ABC News channel:    / newsonabc  &#10;Like ABC News on Facebook:   / abcnews.au  &#10;Follow ABC News on Instagram:   / abcnews_au  &#10;Follow ABC News on Twitter:   / abcnews  &#10;&#10;Note: In most cases, our captions are auto-generated.&#10;&#10;#ABCNewsIndepth #ABCNewsAustralia" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="can you imagine what it would be like to have basically every economist in the world calling you an idiot this could not be more stupid we're living in crazy town right now how stupid is that someone puts a gun to their own head now I don't think that this bothers Donald Trump too much he's the one they're calling stupid by the way all because one scenile billionaire won't give up on the one stupid idea in his head he is extremely sure that his idea of fixing the world with tariffs is a good one tariffs are very powerful both economically and in getting everything else you want donald Trump argues that tariffs are the solution to everything tariffs are a properly used are a very powerful tool not only economically but also for getting other things outside of economics almost everyone else including people that have worked with him for years disagrees but he doesn't care what all those other people think because he's got someone in his corner agreeing with everything he says today I'm honored to swear in our next Secretary of Commerce Mr howard Lutnik i've known him a long time he's great guy howard Lutnik a billionaire with a permanent smile on his face is Trump's pointman on tariffs and he is all in so I think it's just a different way of thinking donald Trump understands it he's going to be the driver of that policy and I'm excited that he's at the desk this is the guy that I want to talk about today his story is tragic and surprising he has been both a hero and a villain two decades ago he was briefly one of the most hated men in America he's about as Wall Street as anyone can get but he's not stupid he's not confused he clearly understands the system that he is helping Trump upend so why is he doing this what a what a fun day to be on your show today i think the answer lies in his past and while Trump may have eased off on the stratospheric tariffs on China for now I get the impression that he and Lutnik will not be dropping tariffs entirely anytime soon global tariffs are a gamble and Howard Lutnik is all in i'm Matt Beavenon and this is if you're listening there is this photograph of Howard Lutnik that I have been thinking about ever since I first saw it it was taken outside his son's kindergarten on 90th Street in Uptown Manhattan and then I took my next son my oldest son was five to his first day of kindergarten howard Lutnik was almost never late for work because he had a very important job but on this particular day he took the morning off so I have a picture of me he's got he's got a little wet hair he's wearing a little backpack on any other morning Howard Lutnik would have been downtown he was the chairman of Caner Fitzgerald a financial services firm that occupied floors 101 to 105 of the North Tower of the World Trade Center he was a proper Wall Street rich guy he loved fast cars fancy suits and expensive art the office was filled with sculptures by August Redan among those statues was a very nepotistic workforce we chose to only work with people that we like so we would tell everybody &quot;Look you you've got winning friends let's hire those winning friends.&quot; So we all hired our friends i had my brother Gary had my best friend Doug there were 29 sets of siblings on the Caner Fitzgerald floors on the day that Howard took his son to his first day of kindergarten so I have a picture of me with my son in front of the school at 8:46 8:46 a.m on September 11th 2001 had Howard and Kyle looked up as that photo of the two of them was taken they would have seen the hijacked American Airlines Flight 11 fly almost directly overhead holy [ __ ] he he called my sister uh just after the just after the plane hit and he told her that um he said that the smoke was pouring in and he just wanted to say that he loved her when he wanted to say goodbye and uh tell everyone that that he loved them howard Lutnik went to the base of the tower and frantically searched among the evacuees for any of his staff members then he was hit by a wall of debris as the south tower collapsed his driver Jimmy dragged him uptown and the north tower collapsed behind them of the thousand caner employees at the uh trade center only 300 are accounted for at this time and none was at the building at that time by September 14th it was clear that none of the 658 people who were in the Caner Fitzgerald offices that morning had survived my 700 families 700 families i have 700 families howard did interviews with three TV stations and cried in all of them he became nationally famous as the face of the Wall Street victims every single individual with his firm gone gone his entire office everybody everybody i mean I I watched this guy tell his story and it just it just ripped me off i I couldn't handle it on the 14th of September Lutnik created a relief fund for the families and yet the following day he sent out final paychecks to all of them he would no longer be paying their lost loved ones salaries lutnik was all over national television saying that he would do whatever he could for the families of the missing employees well it was about a week later that those families learned that all their paychecks were going to stop immediately why would he cry so on television are you suggesting that he just turned on the tears oh yeah he went on CNN to talk to Larry King about it and cried again they call me and they say &quot;How come you can't pay my salary why can't you pay my husband's salary are the other companies pay their salary why can't you?&quot; But you see I I lost I lost everybody in the company so I can't pay their salaries so they they think we're doing something wrong can't pay their salaries they don't have any money to pay their salaries within weeks Lutnik was a national pariah wall Street watchers say that's the cutthroat Howard Lutnik they know so what was he doing well he had a strategy of sorts having looked at his books he thought that if he kept paying the salaries of his lost workers the company would rapidly go bankrupt but what if he restarted the company on September 12th I hosted a call with my surviving employees and I laid out two choices for them we could either attend our friends funerals but that's 20 funerals a day for 33 straight days or we could try to rebuild the company to take care of the 658 families that we lost that day he planned to pay the families of the victims using Caner Fitzgerald's profits my partners and I we we talked about it and we've decided that what we're going to do is we're going to give 25% of the profits of the company to the families of the victims it was a massive gamble he had lost 2/3 of his workforce he was locked out of all the company's accounts the people who knew the passwords were dead in the rubble all of their paper records were in New York Harbor did they have a backup yes in what they thought was a safe place the basement of the other Twin Tower the company was a shambles what if he never made a profit again 25% of nothing is nothing it's going to be a different kind of drive than I've ever had before it's not about my It's not about my family i get to kiss my kids i get to kiss my kids tonight but other people don't get to kiss their kids but he had a reason to think that his gamble might pay off see Caner Fitzgerald was an unusual firm they were basically the eBay of US Treasury bonds what that means is they trade US government debt i'll let this 1960s film star explain hi I'm Donna Reed i'd like to talk to you about a unique Christmas gift a gift that will fit any situation is always in the best of taste and will never never go out of style one guess you're right it's money but not the ordinary kind of money no this is growing money would you like to see some US savings bonds now watch how they grow this is the 1960s version of Marggo Robbie in a bubble bath explaining credit default swaps so this Christmas give growing money give United States savings bonds thank you and merry Christmas i guess that didn't really explain it did it i guess I'll have to be the one getting in the bubble bath the US government is always in debt so it almost always needs to borrow money you can lend your money to them in exchange for a bond a promise that they will pay you back with interest in the future us savings bonds are one of America's most important institutions they are not new it's not sexy but it's considered very safe after all the US government is hardly going to collapse generally US stocks and US Treasury bonds go in opposite directions because people switch one for the other and that's how it's supposed to work anyone can buy these bonds but you can't just call up the US Federal Reserve and buy them directly you need a broker and that's where Cander Fitzgerald comes in excuse me anyway in 2001 Cander Fitzgerald were by far the biggest broker of US bonds they had reached that status by trading bonds over the phone but they were also in the process of transitioning to online trading via a platform they owned called Espeed espeed the global leader in real time electronic market solutions howard Lutnik knew that the markets would soon be reopening when the greatest financial market on Earth does resume trading the whole world will be watching and he thought that the horrific terrorist attack would lead people to look for safe investments switching their stocks for government bonds people have basically moved to try and get into what they think of secure assets so that they've gone into gold they've gone into government bonds and if people want to buy government bonds they're going to do it through Espeed and that means revenue for Caner Fitzgerald we have to make our company be able to take care of my 700 families using their London staff a temporary office space in New Jersey and an army of technicians they managed to get Espeed up and running in 2 days the strategy paid off so together we raised $180 million over the next five years for those families and my employees they stitched my soul back together that's about 275,000 per family he also paid for their health care for 10 years after 15 years Kender Fitzgerald had hired 57 children of staff members who had died in 9/11 along with his sister Lutnik now runs a massive charity which provides support to victims of terrorist attacks and natural disasters and it's called the the Caner Fitzgerald Foundation and um you know anyone who can uh can make a donation to it is going to help a lot of people who really really need it lutnik knew what funding and community could do for people who had lost everything and dedicated a great deal of time to helping people in need in fact it was through charitable giving that he met Donald Trump he appeared on Trump's TV show Celebrity Apprentice in 2008 as a bidder in a charity auction how aboutund all right that's the game we're playing i'll take a bit for $100,000 in the front row $100,000 all right now obviously this is kind of how it rolls on Wall Street massive gamles that if they work make people think you're a genius it was pretty wild though i think if it was me I would have liquidated the firm taken the insurance and just split the proceeds among the victim's families and that is probably why Howard Lutnik is now a billionaire cabinet secretary and I am a thousandair basement podcaster i think Howard Lutnik's business and his history has made him a very unusual Wall Street trader i'm feeling great Richard this is the best I've felt in a long time for one thing his business is based on how much people trade not on whether the market is going up or down we don't make money when the markets go up we don't lose any when it goes down uh but when we win is when it's busy the company loves volatility and with volatility back you know the numbers of the company are just are just beautiful bull or bear it doesn't matter as long as the market is busy secondly this is a man who has gone through one of the worst traumas imaginable twothirds of his workforce including his brother and best friend were killed in an event that he survived only by chance he seems more than most people to be almost entirely unafraid of negative consequences how could anything be worse than what he has experienced and anyway he's a billionaire now who makes money from volatility he is basically immune from repercussions in 2023 he got a call from his old TV friend Donald Trump so 2023 calls me says &quot;Will you help me?&quot; I actually thought about it like and that was the first time I really thought politics and then I said &quot;Yes.&quot; He told the All-In podcast that he spent a lot of time in Trump's orbit throughout 2024 before deciding in October what he wanted to do to help a potential second Trump administration and I said I want to balance the budget United States of America and I this is the way we're going to do it he said if Elon Musk can cut $1 trillion in spending and he can raise $1 trillion through tariffs he thought that he would be able to get to a balanced budget if we can balance the budget for you will you agree to wave all income tax for every person who makes less than $150,000 a year for the United States of America which by the way is about 85% of America right right and the reason you want to work for Donald Trump is he looks at me goes &quot;Sure.&quot; Okay I want to pause on that point because it is wild remember a few episodes ago when we were looking into Doge and I was illustrating Elon Musk's cost cutting goals with two very big jars of water yeah I'm not going to do that this time because in order to illustrate what Lapnik is suggesting that would basically involve me smashing the jars with a hammer and then trying to glue the pieces back together he says he's wanting to use tariffs on imports to basically fund the entire US government this is the equivalent of Howard Lutnik looking at a pile of twisted steel and concrete a massacred workforce a cloud of paper floating through the air and thinking &quot;I can still make a profit this quarter i have to to support the 700 families the American people are his 700 families now and he's taking another spectacular gamble.&quot; Donald Trump is a rare politician he does what he says he's going to do the stuff Howard Lutnik and Donald Trump are saying in interviews only makes sense if you understand that they are genuinely trying to upend the entire US economy like this quote for example promising to bring the production of high-tech products back to the US you're going to see robotic production of iPhones and the jobs that are going to be created people who build those factories the mechanics who work on those robots these jobs are going to be millions and millions of those jobs these are great high-paying jobs and you don't need a college education to do it millions of non-oled educated robot mechanics who presumably pay no income tax what What about this quote from Donald Trump i don't think a beautiful baby girl needs that's 11 years old needs to have 30 dolls i think they can have three dolls or four dolls donald Trump genuinely wants Americans to cut back on consumption of products that are currently made overseas i'm just saying they don't need to have $30 they can have three they don't need to have 250 pencils they can have five they're not saying all these things by accident these aren't gaffs they are redesigning the American economy you won't need a degree to get a good job you won't buy so many toys or clothes trade with other countries will be vastly different thanks to the trade deals they're currently negotiating but you're going to see over the next month or so we're going to roll out dozens of deals okay because we'll find categories of countries that it'll work out just fine but the other thing here is he's not making any specific promises there's no particular benchmarks or goals much like with his promise to give 25% of his profits to the families that could have been 25% of 1 million or 180 million this means that any concessions they get from other countries can be called a win we had a a trade conversation with a country that sells a lot of cars into America and we don't sell hardly any cars into their market and we were getting nowhere we were just getting nowhere and the meeting was coming to an end and the trade minister at the end of the meeting drops his head and goes &quot;Fine we'll give your car manufacturers the same subsidy that we give our car manufacturers.&quot; Bang bang we don't know what country that was or what the subsidy was or if that's what Lutnik was even trying to get out of them but in Lutnik's eyes that's a win bang i don't know what's going to happen here but it's clearly not going to calm down howard Lutnik is in the middle of the biggest gamble of his life and in his mind it's impossible for him to lose the only thing that's convinced him and Trump to ease off a little bit was a sudden drop in the price of stocks and bonds at the same time after their liberation day tariffs instead of people swapping US stocks for US bonds people swapped both for foreign investments because they thought that America had gone mad short of this kind of thing happening Latutnik is not going to stop until he is forced to stop or until the US economy is unrecognizable if you can find a way to benefit from volatility like Howard Lutnik did then the next few years look pretty good i don't know what's going to happen to everybody else [Music] it's done [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] okay these are three hadith or four hadith from Im Albkari's book of Muf First hadith is hadith number 80 He said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said to shall I tell you the greatest or one of the greatest forms of sodak He replied yes indeed oh messenger of Allah He went on to say to provide for your daughters when she is returned to you and you are her soul her her sole source of provision So here the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam he is saying that one of the biggest or one of the best forms of the greatest forms of sodak is that you have a daughter who is either widowled or divorced and she comes back to your house to provide for her and for her needs and possibly she might even have children especially if she is uh a widow to give and feed her and close her and provide for her This is one of the greatest forms of sodak that you can give And this tells us that we should not look too far to give sodak Sodaka is right in front of us that Allah subhana t has given every single one of us the opportunity to uh to to do This hadith is weak but it doesn't mean that we don't act upon it This hadith is weak because of the because of the chain there is in or this hadith is for those who is uh who is taking the Saturday class just for their purpose and all and for for our uh more information this hadith is because between and because he's saying narrates from actually there's someone else in between did not narrate ate from he never saw so there is a gap so who did take from by the way what is the name actually it's the name is Ali but this is this is uh a this is a form in which like for example you would say uh or you would say uh abi You will say you would say for example you will say or so this is you just cut one of the leg as they say in Arabic you cut one of the leg and it will become uh it will become uh they say and this is for many reasons either it is to defame that person or it is to actually say out of love So 180 degree difference And the reason his name is because he lived in the time of the Umaya dynasty They did not like Ali They did not like the name Ali So people they still wanted to name their kids Ali So they would say meaning a small form of Ali So if you want to show me love you can call me And the prophet wasallam used to show love to by saying okay So this is uh who is someone who was a bounty hunter and huh Yeah He was a bounty hunter and he went to uh hunt the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam as he is making the hijra And so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam he told him he gave him the glad tidings of conquering Persia He said oh saka how will you be when you wear the bracelets of kisra And he's thinking I'm chasing this person He's being he's running away How is he telling me that they're going to conquer the Persian Empire He can't even he won't even he is not even allowed to stay in Mecca let alone conquering Mecca uh the Persian Empire And that was one of the superpowers of at the time But Malik he became a Muslim and during the time of when they did conquer Kisra to realize the prophecy of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam made him made him to wear the bracelets of that came as spoils of war And obviously he had to take it off because it was made out of gold But just to realize that prophecy of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and it didn't belong to because he said no this belongs to me Omar said no only the prophet said how would you be when you wear it doesn't mean that you will have it or it belongs to you So is more understanding of the religion He say it belongs to the to the national treasury for the Muslims for the rest of them Uh hadith number eight is the same as hadith number 80 except with a different chain Hadith number 82 is aldab he said that the messenger of Allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam said what you feed yourself is for you what you feed your child is for you what you feed your wife is for you what you feed your servant is for you like I've said we have so many different forms of sodak that we we can do right in our household Even the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam he said in another hadith what you feed into the mouth of your of your wife is for you And the last hadith is the hadith of hadith number 83man He said that a man who had daughters wi was with when because of poverty and hardship he wished his daughters were dead and sobb became angry and he said do you provide for them and this hadith is weak because Abu Ra he is unknown and that's why this hadith is weak because they don't know who this person is in the chain It is two two people by the name of Abu Ra and they don't know which one is uh in mentioned in this particular hadith but nonetheless the mutton the text is correct and it is uh it is my brothers and sisters Allah he mentions two verses in the Quran in which in one of them he says And I want you to pay attention to this very subtle but very profound difference in meaning Allah he says do not kill your children because of poverty We provide for you and for them We provide for you and for them In another place Allah he says and do not kill your children for fear of poverty We provide for them and you So the first one was what For you and them The second verse is we provide for them and you The first verse the reason Allah he said that we provide for you meaning oh person who is about to kill your children we provide for you and for them This means that the person he is already poor he is already poor and now he is being driven because of his poverty to kill his his children Allah he's saying no we will provide for you don't kill them we will provide for you you're poor but we will provide for you and we will provide for them the second verse in which Allah he mentions them first we will provide for them and for you this implies that the person he is not poor yet he's financially well off but he fears having children because he will become poor So Allah is saying no don't fear having children because we will provide for them and we will also provide for you And subhan Allah you look at nowadays we always talk about the past how the Arabs they were in such ignorance and they used to kill children and this and that Actually we are in ignorance right now And by the way there is a study or research that was done and actually they said that there's only a few about a dozen that were killed But uh the majority of times they did not kill their uh they did not kill their uh girls their children But nowadays you have in the millions being killed through abortion And one of the reasons or I I should say I dare say the main reason for the top reason I should say for abortion is poverty They're well off They say if I have children I can't work I will lose my career I can't go to work I can't do this So they say I need to go ahead and pursue my career I.e I need to maintain the status quo of my financial status And so therefore I'm not ready to have children And here this second verse is so pertinent in our times that Allah is saying we will provide for them and we will provide for you So do not go So do not kill your children preemptively Don't do that We ask Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala to make us from amongst those who are always doing excellence and doing good towards others May Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala forgive us for all of the times that we have neglected our family members and we have neglected uh the Muslim ummah May Allah subhana wa ta'ala help the Muslim um throughout the world in Gaza in Falstine in Kashmir in Pakistan in India in Sudan in Yemen in Syria in Afghanistan and throughout the world In Bangladesh in Burma May Allah subhana wa ta'ala raise their status May Allah forgive their dead and their shuada May Allah give them patience May Allah subhana wa tala give the world consciousness a conscious mind to be aware of what they are doing and what they are inflicting upon our brothers and sisters May Allah subhana wa ta'ala strengthen us and strengthen our community Just to reiterate what the brother was saying this is a form of that you will be giving especially to the poor Whether you do it here uh it is preferred that you do it here uh because it's more rewarding But if you feel that you know many people in your household are doing it here and you want to send it overseas then there's no there's no uh blame or or there's no problem with that Inshallah Okay Any questions" />

दिलों को उससे इत्मीनान हासिल हो वरना मदद तो अल्लाह ही की तरफ से होती है जो गालिब है हिकमत वाला है और बादल ना होना और ना कम करना अगर तुम सच्चे मन हो तो तुम ही गालिब रहोगे यह तुम्हारे मददगार नहीं है बल्कि अल्लाह तुम्हारा मददगार है और वो सबसे बेहतर मददगार है वो वक्त भी याद करने के लायक है जब तुम लोग दूर भेज जाते थे और किसी को पीछे फिर कर नहीं देखते थे और रसूलुल्लाह सल्लल्लाहु अलेही वल्लम तुमको तुम्हारे पीछे खड़े बुला रहे थे तो अल्लाह ने तुमको कम पर कम पहुंचा ताकि जो चीज तुम्हारे हाथ से जाति रही या जो मुसीबत तुम पर वाकई हुई है उससे तुम गमगीन ना हो और अल्लाह तुम्हारे सब अमाल से खबरदार है फिर अल्लाह ने उसे परेशानी के बाद तुम पर तसल्ली नाजिल फरमाई यानी नींद की तुम में से एक जमाई पर तारी हो गई और कुछ लोग जिनको जान के नल पद रहे थे अल्लाह के बड़े में नहाइया में कुफ्र किस गुमान करते थे और कहते थे भला हमारे इख्तियार की कुछ बात है तुम का दो की बेशक सब बातें अल्लाह ही के इख्तियार में है यह लोग बहुत सी बातें दिलों में मक्खी रखते हैं जो तुम पर जाहिर नहीं करते थे कहते थे की हमारे बस की बात होती तो हम यहां कैट रही ना किया जाते का दो की अगर तुम अपने घरों में भी होते तो जिनकी तब्दीर में मारा जाना लिखा था वो अपनी अपनी कत्ल गांव की तरफ जरूर निकाल आते इससे गरज ये थी की अल्लाह तुम्हारे सनों की बटन को आसमान और जो कुछ तुम्हारे दिलों में है उसको साफ कर दी और अल्लाह दिलों की बटन से खूब वाकिफ है और अगर तुम अल्लाह के रास्ते में मारे जो या मा जो तो जो मालूम होता लोग जमा करते हैं उससे अल्लाह के बक्शीश और रहमत नहीं देता है और अगर तुम मा जो या मारे जो तो अल्लाह के हुजूर में जरूर कठे किया जाओगे फिर ए नबी अल्लाह की मेहरबानी से तुम उन लोगों के लिए नम मिजाज वाक्य हुए हो और अगर तुम बद्दू सख़्तील होते तो ये तुम्हारे पास सिर्फ भाग खड़े होते स्वयं को माफ कर दो और इनके लिए अल्लाह से बख्तिरत मैंगो और अपने केमोन में इसे मशवरात लिया करो और जब किसी कम का पुख्ता इरादा कर लो तो अल्लाह पर भरोसा रखो बेशक अल्लाह भरोसा रखना वालों को दोस्त रखना है अगर अल्लाह तुम्हारा मददगार है तो तुम पर कोई गालिब नहीं ए सकता और अगर वो तुम्हें छोड़ दे तो फिर कौन है उसके बाद तुम्हारी मदद करें और मोमिनो को तो चाहिए की अल्लाह ही पर भरोसा रखें और अल्लाह के इनामात और फजल से खुश हो रही हैं और इससे के अल्लाह मोमिनो का हाजिर जय नहीं करता जिन्होंने बावजूद जख्म खाने के अल्लाह और रसूल के हम को कुबूल किया जो लोग उनमें नई पुकार और परहेज़गार हैं उनके लिए बड़ा सवाल है जब उनसे लोगों ने आकर बयान किया की कफर ने तुम्हारे मुकाबला के लिए लश्कर एक आसिफ जमा किया है तो उनसे डरो तो उनका इनाम और ज्यादा हो गया और खाने लगे हमको अल्लाह काफी है और वह बहुत अच्छा कर साज है फिर वह अल्लाह की नेमत हो और उसके फजल के साथ खुश अवराम वापस आए उनको किसी तरह का जरार ना पहुंच और वह अल्लाह की खुशबू दी किताबें रहे और अल्लाह बड़े फाजिल का मलिक है हर शख्स को मौत का मजा चखना है और तुमको कयामत के दिन तुम्हारे अमाल का पूरा पूरा बदला दिया जाएगा तो जो शख्स दोजक से दूर रखा गया और बहिष्ट में दाखिल किया गया वो मुराद को पहुंच गया और दुनिया की जिंदगी तो धोखे का समाज है हाले इनाम तुम्हारे माल और जान में तुम्हारी आजमाइश जरूर की जाएगी और तुम पहले किताब से और उन लोगों से जो मशरिक हैं बहुत सी जीजा की बातें सनोज तो अगर सब्र और परहेज गाड़ी करते रहोगे तो यह बड़ी हिम्मत के कम है बेशक आसमानों और जमीन की पैदाइश और रात और दिन के बदन बादल कर आने जान में अकल वालों के लिए निशानियां है जो खड़े और बैठे और लेते हर हाल में अल्लाह को याद करते और आसमान और जमीन की पैदाइश में गौर करते और कहते हैं की यह परवरदिगार तूने इस कायनात को बी फायदा नहीं पैदा किया तू पाक है तो कयामत के दिन हमें दोजक के अजब से बचाएं जो परवरदिगार जिसको तूने दोजक में डाला उसे रुसवा किया और जालिमों का कोई मददगार नहीं होगा ए परवरदिगार हमने एक पुकारने वाले को सुना के इनाम के लिए पुकार रहा था की अपने परवरदिगार परिमाण लो तो हम इनाम ले आए स्वयं परवरदिगार हमारे गुना माफ फार्मा और हमारी बुराइयों को हमसे दूर कर दे और हमको दुनिया से निक बंदों के साथ उठाइयाे ए परवरदिगार तूने जिन-जिन चीजों के हमसे अपने पैगंबरों के वेस्ट से वादे किया हैं वो हमें आता फार्मा और कयामत के दिन हमें रुसवा ना कीजिए वादा नहीं करेगा तो उनके परवरदिगार ने उनकी दुआ कुबूल कर ली और फरमाया के मैं किसी अमल करने वाले की अमल को मर्द हो या औरत जय नहीं करता तुम एक दूसरे के हम जींस हो तो जो लोग मेरे लिए वतन छोड़ गए और अपने घरों से निकले गए और सताए गए और लड़े और कत्ल किया गए मैं उनके गुना दूर कर दूंगा और उनको बहिष्टों में दाखिल करूंगा जिनके नीचे नहरी बा रही है यह अल्लाह के हाथ से बदला है और अल्लाह के हां अच्छा बदला है ए पैगंबर काफिरों का शेरों में ठाठ से घूमने तुम्हें धोखा ना दे और तुम जी हाल में होते हो या कुरान में से कुछ पढ़ने हो या तुम लोग कोई और कम करते हो जब उसमें मसरूफ होते हो तो हम तुम्हारे पास होते और तुम्हारे परवरदिगार से कोई ज़रा भर भी चीज पोशीदा नहीं रहती ना जमीन में और ना आसमान में और ना कोई चीज है उससे छोटी और ना बड़ी मगर किताबें रोशन में लिखी हुई है सुन रखो की जो अल्लाह के दोस्त हैं उनको ना कुछ खौफ होगा और नावन गमनटूंगी यानी वो जो इनाम ले और परहेज़गार रहे उनके लिए दुनिया की जिंदगी में भी बिशरत है और आखिर में भी अल्लाह की बातें बदलती नहीं यही तो बड़ी कामयाबी है और ए पैगंबर इन लोगों की बटन से आजारता ना होना क्योंकि इज्जत सब अल्लाह ही की है वो सब कुछ सुनता है जानता है अल्लाह ही तो है जिसने आसमान और जमीन को पैदा किया और आसमान से बेववर सैया फिर उससे तुम्हारे खाने के लिए फल पैदा किया और कश्तियों और जहाज को तुम्हारे ज़ेहरे फरमान किया ताकि वो समंदर में उसके हम से चले और नेहरे को भी तुम्हारे फरमान किया और सूरज और चंद को तुम्हारे लिए कम में लगा दिया की दोनों दिन रात एक डागर पर चल रहे हैं और रात और दिन को भी तुम्हारी खातिर कम में लगा दिया और जो कुछ तुमने मांगा रूप में से तुमको इनायत किया और अगर अल्लाह के एहसान गिने लगो तो सुमार ना कर सको मगर लोग नियमितों का सुख नहीं करते कुछ शक नहीं के इंसान बड़ा बेमसाफ है ना शुक्र है जो शख्स ये गुमान करता हो की अल्लाह उसको दुनिया और आखिरत में मदद नहीं देगा तो उसको चाहिए की ऊपर की तरफ यानी अपने घर की छठ में एक रस्सी बंद है फिर उससे अपना गला गोट ले फिर देखें की आया ये तकदीर उसके गुस्से को दूर कर देती है और इसी तरह हमने इस कुरान को उतारा जिसकी तमाम बातें खली हुई हैं और ये याद रखो की अल्लाह जिसको चाहता है हिदायत देता है क्या तुम यह ख्याल करते हो की हमने तुमको बी मकसद पैदा किया है और यह की तुम हमारी तरफ लोट कर नहीं आओगे तो अल्लाह जो सच्चा बादशाह है उसकी शान इससे ऊंची है उसके शिवा कोई महबूब नहीं वही आर्स करीम का मलिक है क्या लोग यह ख्याल किया हुए हैं की सिर्फ खाने से की हम इनाम ले आए छोड़ दिए जाएंगे और इनकी आजमाइश नहीं की जाएगी और जो लोग इसे पहले हो चुके हैं हमने उनको भी आजमाया था और इनको भी आजमाएंगे सो अल्लाह उनको जरूर मालूम करेगा जो अपने इनाम में सच्चे हैं और उनको भी जो झूठ क्या वो लोग जो बुरे कम करते हैं ये समझे हुए हैं की ये हमारे काबू से निकाल जाएंगे जो फैसला ये करते हैं बड़ा है हमारी आयतन पर तो वही लोग इनाम लेट हैं की जब उनको इनके जरिए नसीहत की जाति है तो सजदे में गिर पढ़ते और अपने परवरदिगार की तारीफ के साथ तस्बीह करते हैं और हुजूर नहीं करते उनके पहलू बिचिनो से अलग रहते हैं इस हाल में की वो अपने परवरदिगार को खौफ और उम्मीद से पुकारते और जो कुछ हमने उनको दिया है उसमें से खर्च करती हैं तो कोई शख्स नहीं जानता की उनके लिए कैसी आंखों की ठंडक छुपा कर राखी गई है यह उन अमाल का शीला है जो वो करते थे अल्लाह ने अच्छी बातें नाजिल फरमाई है यानी किताब जिसकी आयतें वहां मिलती जलती हैं और दोहरे जाति है जो लोग अपने परवरदिगार से डरते हैं उनके बदन के रोंगटे उसे सुनकर खड़े हो जाते हैं फिर उनकी खेल नम हो जाति हैं और दिल भी नम होकर अल्लाह की याद की तरफ वो तवज्जे हो जाति है यही अल्लाह की हिदायत है वो इससे जिसको चाहता है हिदायत देता है और जिसको अल्लाह गुमराह रहने दे उसको कोई हिदायत देने वाला नहीं और तुम्हारे परवरदिगार ने फरमाया है की तुम मुझे दुआ करो मैं तुम्हारी दुआ कुबूल करूंगा जो लोग मेरी इबादत से टकराती हैं हम करीब जहन्नम में जलील हो कर दाखिल होंगे अल्लाह ही तो है जिसने तुम्हारे लिए रात बनाई की उसमें आराम करो और दिन को रोशन बनाया की उसमें कम करो [संगीत] यही अल्लाह तुम्हारा परवरदिगार है हैं जो हर चीज का पैदा करने वाला है उसके शिवा कोई माबूद नहीं फिर तुम कहां से भटकाए जाति हो इसी तरह वो लोग भटकाए जाते थे जो अल्लाह की आयतन से इनकार करते थे अल्लाह ही तो है जिसने जमीन को तुम्हारे लिए ठहरने की जगह और आसमान को छठ बनाया और तुम्हारी सूरते बनाई और सूरते भी अच्छी बनाई और तुम्हें पाकीजा चीजें खाने को दी यही अल्लाह तुम्हारा परवरदिगार है सो अल्लाह रबल आलमीन बहुत ही बाबरकत है वही जिंदा है जावेद है उसके शिवा कोई इबादत के लायक नहीं तो उसकी इबादत को खालिस करके इस को पुकारो हर तरह की तारीफ अल्लाह ही के लिए है जो तमाम जहानों का परवरदिगार है और अगर ये ख्याल ना होता की सब लोग एक ही जमा हो जाएंगे तो जो लोग अल्लाह से इनकार करते हैं हम उनके घरों की चाटे चांदी की बना देते और सीढ़ियां भी जिन पर वो चढ़ते और उनके घरों के दरवाजे भी और तख्त जिन पर तकिया लगाते हैं और ये सब चीज सोनी की भी बना देते और ये सब दुनिया की जिंदगी का थोड़ा सा समाज है और आखिरत तुम्हारे परवरदिगार के हां परहेजगारों के लिए है तो क्या हम पहले बार पैदा करके तक गए नहीं बल्कि ये असर है नो पैदा करने के बड़े में शक में पड़े हुए हैं और हम ही ने इंसान को पैदा किया है और जो खयालात उसके दिल में गुजरते हैं हम उनको जानते हैं और हम तो लगे जान से भी ज्यादा उसके करीब हैं जान रखो की दुनिया की जिंदगी महज खेल और तमाशा और जीनत ए रहा है और तुम्हारे आपस में फक्र और 27 और माल औलाद की एक दूसरे से ज्यादा तालाबों ख्वाहिश है इसकी मिसल ऐसी है जैसे बारिश की उससे उगने वाली खेती किसने को भारी लगती है फिर वो खेती खूब जोर पर आई है फिर देखने वाले तू उसको देखा है की पककर दर्द पद जाति है फिर चूरा-चूरा हो जाति और आखिरत में काफिरों के लिए अज़ाब-ए-शदी और मोमिनो के लिए अल्लाह की तरफ से बख्शीश और खुशबू दी है और दुनिया की जिंदगी तो धोखे का समाज है और जो कोई अल्लाह से डरेगा वो उसके लिए रंजो गम से नजत की सूरत पैदा कर देगा और उसको ऐसी जगह से रिस्क देगा जहां से उसको वे में गुमान बिना हो और जो अल्लाह पर भरोसा रखेगा तो वो उसके लिए काफी होगा अल्लाह अपने कम को जो वो करना चाहता है पूरा कर देता है अल्लाह ने हर चीज का अंदाज़ मुकर्रर कर रखा है ये लोग दुनिया को दोस्त रखते हैं और कयामत के भारी दिन को पैसे छोड़ें देती हमने इनको पैदा किया और उनके जोर-जोर को मजबूत बनाया और अगर हम चाहे तो इनके बदले इन्हीं की तरह और लोग ले आएं यह कुरान तो नसीहत है जो चाहे अपने परवरदिगार की तरफ पहुंचने का रास्ता इख्तियार कर ले और तुम कुछ भी नहीं जा सकते मगर जो अल्लाह को मंजूर हो बेशक जन वाला है हिकमत वाला है और ये किसी शैतानी मर्दूत का कलाम नहीं है फिर तुम लोग किधर जा रहे हो ये कुरान तो तमाम जहानों के लिए नसीहत है यानी उसके लिए जो तुम में से सीधी र चलना चाहे और तुम लोग कुछ भी नहीं जा सकते मगर वही जो अल्लाह रबल आलमीन चाहे ए इत्मीनान वाली जान अपने परवरदिगार की तरफ लोट चल तू उससे राजी वो तुझे राजी सो तू मेरे खास बंदो में शामिल हो जा और मेरी बहिष्ट में दाखिल हो जा आफताब की रोशनी की कसम और रात की तरीके की कसम जब वो छ जाए ए नबी सल्लल्लाहु अलेही वाले वल्लम तुम्हारे परवरदिगार ने एन तो तुमको छोड़ दिया और ना तुमसे नाराज ही हुआ और आखिर तुम्हारे लिए दुनिया से कहानी बैठता है और तुम्हारा परवरदिगार तुम्हें हम करीब इतना कुछ आता फरमाएगा की तुम खुश हो जाओगे भला उसने तुम्हें यकीन प्रकार जगह नहीं दी बेशक दी और तुम्हें रास्ते से ना वाकिफ देखा तो सीधा रास्ता दिखाए और उसने तुम्हें टांग दस्त पाया तो गनी कर दिया तो तुम भी यकीन पर सितम एन करना और मांगने वाले को खिड़की ना देना और अपने परवरदिगार की नेमत यानी वही का बयान करते रहना ए नबी सल्लल्लाहु अलेही वल्लम क्या हमने तुम्हारी खातिर तुम्हारा सीन खोल नहीं दिया और तुम पर से तुम्हारा वो बोझ भी उतार दिया जिसने तुम्हारी कमर झुका दी थी और हमने तुम्हारी खातिर तुम्हारा जिक्र बुलंद किया सो यकीनन मुश्किल के साथ आसानी भी है बेशक मुश्किल के साथ आसानी भी है तो जब तुम फर्क हुआ करो तो इबादत में मेहनत किया करो और अपने परिवार की तरफ वो तबज्जे हो जय करो" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar - Al-Imam Ibn al-Jawzi Rahimahullah narrates in Sifat us-Safwa about a man that we already mentioned, Zayn al-Abidin, Ali ibn Husayn, may Allah be pleased with him, who was the great, great grandson of the Prophet SallAllahu 'Alaihi Wasallam that he was once making wudu, or rather, when he would be making wudu his face would start to change colors, so it would become very pale, would become very yellow, as if he was very nervous about something. And so, his family asked him, &quot;What's wrong? Why is it that the color of your face is changing when you're making wudu? And he responded and he said, &quot;Atadruna baiyna yadai man uridu an aqum?&quot; &quot;Do you not realize in front of whom I intend to stand? Do you not realize in front of whom who I intend to stand?&quot; Meaning his salah. Now, I want you to think about the idea of bringing your khushoo' to the point of your wudu, to actually start that anticipation of the meeting with Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'Aala from the time of your actual wudu, not just the time of your salah. And this is exactly what we find in the habits of the Righteous Ones, the habits of the Saliheen. So, as you wash yourself, you are preparing yourself for, effectively, what is your ihram. And the images of Hajj and Umrah are so vivid to us, and so they give us a visualization of what every single salah we go into actually looks like. Just like when you take your bath, before you wear your ihram and you prepare yourself for going to meet Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'Aala you are bathing yourself, washing yourself in that process of wudu, anticipating your meeting with Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'Aala. The same thing is true for death. When we prepare the body for death, we wash the body, and part of the of the ghusl of the dead is to basically perform what is its last wudu, but this time, it will not pray for itself, but instead, others will pray upon it. And so, if you think about what that represents, it's disconnect from this world, that you're entering into a deep connection with Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'Aala . So, whether you're going for Hajj and Umrah and having this new deep connection with Allah, or whether you are dying and entering into this entirely new connection with Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'Aala, it is a transformation of a state to a state, of a mindset to a mindset. And the physical washing of the body represents that transition. So, you start with Bismillah and you focus in your wudu on getting everything right, on making sure that you touch every single part of the body that is due with what Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'Aala has commanded you with. And that, again, is a mindset that I will not leave out the commands of Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'Aala, that everything that Allah 'Azawajal tells me to do, Sami'na Wa Ato'na, we hear and we obey, and I will not cut corners. And I want you to imagine as you enter into your wudu, if the Prophet SallAllahu 'Alaihi Wasallam entered next to you and started to do wudu next to you. You know, if you're doing wudu and a great scholar was to walk in and to start doing wudu next to you, someone very righteous was to sit next to you while you were doing wudu in the wudu station, imagine if it's the Prophet SallAllahu 'Alaihi Wasallam. And Abdullah ibn Amr RadiAllahu ta'ala Anhum says that, &quot;The Prophet SallAllahu 'Alaihi Wasallam, he passed by some people and as they were doing their wudu, they weren't getting their heels. And the Prophet SallAllahu 'Alaihi Wasallam said, &quot;wailul lil a'qab. 'Woe to the heels.' wailul lil a'qabi minan naar 'Woe to the heels from the Fire!'&quot; As bighu, as bighu, as bighul wudu Which means to perform wudu in full. as bighul wudu, as bighul wudu Make sure that you're performing in full. Do not neglect your wudu. What would the Prophet SallAllahu 'Alaihi Wasallam tell you to be careful with? Would he say, you know, &quot;You didn't get your face fully. You didn't do your hair right. You didn't get your elbows. You didn't get your heels.&quot; What would the Prophet SallAllahu 'Alaihi Wasallam say to you in this regard? And that famous Hadith of Allah 'Azawajal speaking to the Prophet SallAllahu 'Alaihi Wasallam in a dream of his, when Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'Aala asked the Prophet SallAllahu 'Alaihi Wasallam, &quot;Hal tadri fi ma yakhtasimul mala'ul a'la&quot; &quot;Do you know what the highest company,&quot; meaning the angels, &quot;are arguing amongst themselves about?&quot; &quot;Qul tu, na'am.&quot; &quot;I said, yes.&quot; &quot;And it is fil kafarat.&quot; The things that expiate, the deeds, the things that serve as atonements. &quot;And I was told by my Lord to say what they are. So, Al- Kafaraat, Al Mukfu fil masajid ba'da salawat . To stay in the masjid after a prayer, remembering Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'Aala .&quot; And the second one that He mentioned, SallAllahu 'Alaihi Wasallam, wal mashi wa alal aqdami ilal jama a't &quot;To walk on your feet to the places of congregation.&quot; And the third thing the Prophet SallAllahu 'Alaihi Wasallam said, wa is baghul wudui fil makarih. That it is to perform wudu fully in times of difficulty. Now, you can imagine when it's very cold and all you have is hot water, or it's very hot and all you have is very cold water, or if it's very cold and all you have is very cold water and it will only make you colder, but you still do your wudu. The point is, is that you perform the wudu to its fullest, even in the most difficult of conditions. And the Prophet SallAllahu 'Alaihi Wasallam said, wa man tha'la thalika aa shir bikhair wa maa ta bikhair wa ka min khatiatihi ka yawmil walilla tu hum The Prophet SallAllahu 'Alaihi Wasallam said that, &quot;Whoever does these things will live in goodness, and will die upon goodness, and will be on, that day, forgiven for their sins like the day that their mother gave birth to them.&quot; As you're doing wudu, you are washing away your sins in the full physical and literal sense. Your limbs will shine on the Day of Judgment. And SubhanAllah, when Allah tells us about our limbs testifying against us on the Day of Judgment. As the arm comes forward, as the leg comes forward, as the ear comes forward, as all of these limbs start to proceed, imagine if those limbs are shining with your wudu as they come forward, and that is a sign of a deeper internal cleanse as well that you had with Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'Aala. So, the actual act of wudu, the khushoo' in wudu, is actually perfecting it. And that's why you'll notice, as Imam al-Nawawi Rahimahullah says, &quot;There's no narrated dhikr during the wudu itself. You start with bismillah, and then you focus on the motions.&quot; And that is actually the khushoo' of the wudu, to touch every part that Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'Aala has commanded you to touch with the water that Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'Aala has provided you with. And the intention is to wash the outward as well as the inward. And that's why Allah 'Azawajal says, innallaha yuhibu altawaabina wa yuhibul muta tahireen &quot;That verily Allah loves those who repent,&quot; meaning they internally wash themselves of sin, &quot;and Allah loves those who purify themselves.&quot; And of the narrated dua's from the Prophet SallAllahu 'Alaihi Wasallam is that he would say after his wudu, allahuma ajealni mina tuwabeena, wa'jealni minal muta tahireen allahuma ajealni mina tuwabeena, wa'jealni minal muta tahireen &quot;Oh, Allah, make me from those who purify themselves internally through repentance, and who purify themselves externally from filth. So, you're asking Allah to remove from you the visible and the invisible filth. And so, it's an expiation of sins, the internal and the external. Umar ibn al-Khattab radiAllahu ta'ala Anhu, he also narrated that the Prophet SallAllahu 'Alaihi Wasallam said that, &quot;There's no one of you who does wudu and does it well.&quot; You see, you'll notice by the way, it's like when you take people to Hajj, &quot;Hajj means Jannah and it's like the day that your mother gave birth to you.&quot; No, the Prophet SallAllahu 'Alaihi Wasallam said that Hajj e Mabroor, completed Hajj. You're doing it right. So, the Prophet SallAllahu 'Alaihi Wasallam said, &quot;There's no one who does wudu and does it well.&quot; And then says afterwards, ashhadu an lailaha illallah, wahdahu la sharika la, wa-ash-hadu anna Muhammadan abduhu wa rasoolu. Your Shahada, just like you'll say in your Tashahhud. ashhadu an lailaha illallah, wahdahu la sharika la, wa-ash-hadu anna Muhammadan abduhu wa rasoolu. &quot;Except that the eight gates of Jannah will be opened for him, and he will enter from whichever gate he wants.&quot; So, SubhanAllah, you purify yourself of the sins. And the scholar's mention of the depth of that, is that our sins are the barrier between us and Allah and His reward. And so, if you purify yourself from those sins, then you no longer have a barrier. And so the gates will not shut for you, bi-idhnillahi Ta'la but instead, you'll be called from all eight of them. Some of the scholars also mention that a person who is this careful with their wudu certainly is also careful with their salah and careful with their fasting and careful with their zakah, that there is a sign in your attentiveness to wudu of how you are attentive to everything else and a sign of a person's recklessness with wudu and how they're reckless with everything else, and that's why the majority of the punishment of the grave are people that were reckless with their taharah, people that were reckless with their purification, because that means that they certainly did not pay attention to anything that is beyond that. So, forgiven for your sins, like the day your mother gave birth to you. Purified internally and externally. Called from all eight gates of Jannah. We haven't even gotten to the salah yet. So, you are coming into a relationship with Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'Aala in which, just like everything else, Allah precedes you with His ihsan, with His excellence, before you even get to the moment. So, the forgiveness has already been given to you, the Jannah has already been written for you before you even entered into the salah to ask Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'Aala for those things. The Prophet SallAllahu 'Alaihi Wasallam mentioned, &quot;Innahu la u ghanu ala qalbi.&quot; &quot;That verily, sometimes, the heart becomes clouded with fog.&quot; And that is the fog of heedlessness. And so, you have the fog of heedlessness on the heart and you have the stain of sin on the limbs. You remove the stain of sin with your wudu, and then what wakes you out of that heedlessness, the adhan.

          <attvalue for="7" value="all right [Music] before I begin I think there's something that we should we should reflect on and be grateful to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala for and that is that in these blessed moments on this blessed day Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala willed for us and allowed for us to be in his house right you can be anywhere else you want maybe not anywhere right wherever your parents would allow you but for for the adults you can be you can be wherever you want and there are many people who at this time are not spending this blessed time and these blessed moments in the house of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala but Allah is allowing for us to be in his house and I think for that if we just take a moment just to be grateful to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala I think that's very important right having gratitude to Allah and just being grateful when he allows you to do something good is extremely important now that being said whenever I think about Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala giving us an opportunity and making the most of that opportunity there's There's one particular story that comes to mind and this story is of a sahhabi named Abdullahbin Masoud right everyone's heard the name Abdullahbas before right of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam before he accept he accepted Islam he was talk he mentions how once he was walking through Mecca before accepting Islam he was walking for a business errand He was walking for what business errand right to perform a business errand he says he's walking by the Kaa he sees the Kaa all of a sudden he sees a man walking towards the Kaa with the man is a woman and with the two of them is a young boy right so a man a woman and a young boy he sees them walking towards the Kaa they walk towards the Kaa they stop in front of the Kaa and they start to pray but their manner of prayer is stranged for Abdullahb Masoud right he's never seen anyone praying like this before so he stops and he starts watching them he's a bit he's a bit amazed he's kind of he finds it weird he finds it strange so he's just observes them for a while and he looks over to his side and he sees that there's another man there this other man is Albbas who knows who Alb is albbas is the uncle of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam right abbas is who the uncle of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam who accepted Islam but it didn't accept Islam right away he accepted Islam later so he sees Abbas abbas is also watching them so Abdullahbas thinks maybe this man Abbas knows who these people are and what they're doing right because this is all really strange i've never seen something like this before so he goes to Albbas and he asks him &quot;Who are these people what are they doing?&quot; So Albas says &quot;The man that you see standing there is my nephew Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam he's who he's my nephew Muhammad he claims he claims that he's a prophet right the woman that you see standing with him is his wife Khadijah his wife Khadijah and he says &quot;And the little boy that you see with them is who who's the little boy if if if that is the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and that is his wife who would the little boy be the little boy is is so Alb says to him that this man Muhammad my nephew Muhammad he claims to be a prophet and that is his wife who's with him and the little boy is also my nephew Ali and he says right now on the face of the earth there is no one who is following this religion except for these three people there's no one on the face of the earth who is following this religion except for these three people abdullahb Masoud later on when he's telling the story he says I wish at that time I had forgotten about my business errand i wish I had just gone to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam i wish I had accepted Islam and I had joined them in prayer if I had done that he says I would have become 1/4 of the um one quarter of the whole um would have been me right the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam say the Ali and me 1/4 of the whole um 25% of the um the whole um would have been me can you imagine what is 25% of the um right now what is the Muslim population onethird okay sure what rough estimate what's what's the Muslim population right now is it two billion let's say it's two billion sure we're overestimate two billion so 1/4 of two billion becomes what 500 million people right that is one quarter of the um today abdullahb Masoud said I had the opportunity of being one quarter of the whole um but I missed it i missed it i didn't go accept Islam now bear in mind Abdullahb Mas didn't accept Islam late he still from one of the f one of the first 10 people to accept Islam he still accepted it really early but he still had this regret that I could have become the fourth person to accept Islam i could have become 1/4 of the whole um but I missed that opportunity and once he missed that opportunity did it ever come back that opportunity never came back so whenever I think about opportunities when Allah subhanahu wa ta gives us an opportunity this story always comes to mind and without a doubt without a doubt my dear brothers and sisters being alive and observing the day of is an immense opportunity it is an immense opportunity it's often times that people don't give we don't give the same amount of importance to such days like we do in Ramadan right in Ramadan masid is full masid is packed everyone is you know everyone is there for whatever's there these days we don't give them the same amount of importance but the reality is that the best nights in the year the best 10 nights in the year are which nights what are the best 10 nights in the year the last 10 nights of Ramadan last 10 nights of Ramadan are the best nights in the year and in those last 10 nights you have the best night of the year which is the what is what's the best night of the year right i think that's what you you were trying to say right is the best night in the year right isn't that the case okay what are the best days in the year if those are the best nights what are the best days in the year the first 10 days of right these are the best days in the year and those are the best nights in the year now the best day in the year is also in these 10 days what is the best day in the year the day of there's some difference of opinion among scholars right but there's strong evidence to say it's the day of either it's the day of or it's the day of it's the day of Eid which is tomorrow right the scholars differ between these these two views so think of this is like the equivalent for the day right that's how immense this day is the best day in the year so what can you do what I would like to do I'm not going to speak for too long and the reason for that is because this is very important time right so this should be time that's spent in rather than listening to me and you're wasting your time listening to me right so it's better that you do something between you and Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala that actually matters and you're taking advantage of this time i will too inshallah and then maybe towards m time we'll do dua um but what are some things that you should do obviously fast right fasting the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said it's forgiveness for the previous year the sins of the previous year and the sins of the coming year okay but fasting if you didn't if you haven't fasted the day there's nothing you can do about it now right so if you have fasted may Allah accept if you haven't Allah give you to do it to do it next year but what can you do now right and I think that's what we should focus on we have around an hour until time what are things that you can do in this time very very important time before the day ends and it's after the time after is blessed anyways right the time after is blessed between and is blessed anyways so we we are in this very very special time where it's after the time of and it's the best day of the year so what should you be spending your time doing in this time a few things one is which is very important is very important why because the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam mentioned that this is the day that most this is the day that the most necks are freed from jannam right the most people who are freed from jannam are on this day in this next hour what should you be spending your time doing some time of it should go to repentance to Allah subhanahu wa tala ya Allah I've made mistakes I I have I have committed sins despite all of the good that you did to me you have done to me your blessings upon me I can't even count them I can't even count your blessings upon me despite that I still disobey you I'm sorry I seek seek your forgiveness right privately between you and Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala cry if you can cry you should cry we should all cry take that time just between you and Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and genuinely just ask for forgiveness right very important this is a this is the time where you can attain the forgiveness of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala that most people are freed from jam second thing that you can do is remembering Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala right there's The special the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam mentioned a special dua I guess you can call it or a form of that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam mentioned which is right specific that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam mentioned for the day of that's also very important that is also very important why is it important it's important because it's prophetic Right can you make up your own dua are you allowed to make up your own dua yes can you make up your own dua yes can you say &quot;Ya Allah I want an A on my exam.&quot; Is there any any dua like that in the Quran or in the in the Sunnah there's none can you make that dua up yes you can but what's the best dua the best dua are the dua of the prophets right the best dua are the dua of the prophetatam and we have a special dua or a special form of zikar from the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam for this day so then that's the best thing that you can do right so increasing in that increasing in that third thing that you can do is before I move on to the third thing other forms of recitation of the Quran right spending time reciting the Quran you want to recite you know however many times you can if you read it three times it's like reading the whole Quran you want to spend some time reciting you can do that but forms of that you are familiar with okay last thing that you can do is uh there's more things but the last thing that I want to mention that you can do is dua right this is also the day in which the chances of your dua being accepted are the highest right if you make dua this is the day in which dua are accepted now when you think that and you start thinking about well here's all the things that I want in the dunya right I want a big house and a nice car and I don't know what you guys what are you guys to what's the new video game that video game that's out you don't play video games alhamdulillah okay anyone else huh did you say something whatever it is I'm sure there's something that comes to your mind i'm sure you want something right so when you hear &quot;Oh my dua is going to be accepted.&quot; Before thinking about that thing think about your heart right this is a time you can ask Allah subhana wa tala ya Allah fix my heart cleanse my heart fill my heart with iman fill my heart with love for you fill my heart with love for the Quran fill my heart with love for the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam fix my heart my heart has illnesses diseases right i get jealous of people i get angry at my parents whatever it is ya Allah cleanse my heart remove these sins from my heart grant me tawa these are all very very important duas to be making we don't know last thing I'll mention in we don't know my dear brothers and sisters and I know sometimes if you're younger this is this is harder to comprehend but we none of us know doesn't matter what your age is whether we will be here next year or not whether we will have this opportunity to witness the day of in the house of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala after before these blessed moments whether we will have the the opportunity to witness this moment these moments again or not so if Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has given us these moments it's very important for us to take advantage of them right so I think it's very important take your time wherever you want sit in the masjid find your corner spend time just you and Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala spend time with you and you and Allah with a present heart with a present heart so if you left your heart out there when you took your shoes off please go grab it bring it with you right if your heart is not present when you're seeking forgiveness from Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala then there's a problem right then there is a problem with a present heart connect with Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala increase in doar make dua make the most of this time inshallah that's much more valuable than listening to me talk uh and then inshallah I'll if Allah gives us the I'll do the same we'll come back before what time is 8:48 8 okay we'll come back around 8:40ish and we'll do collective dua right before the of of 46 okay we'll come back 8:4 8:35 8:35 and we'll do a collective dua for around 10 minutes inshallah so please make the most of this time um this is being live streamed on YouTube if you're at home please make the most of this time these are very very very blessed moments so again dua and right thicker dua and and may Allah give us all to to worship in this in this less than an hour with sincerity and may he subhanahu wa tala accept from all of [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] [Applause] in mid August 10 people were arrested for suspected money laundering they are all foreign Nationals living in Singapore this is one of the biggest cases of money laundering in the world dirty money going through Singapore's Financial system is is not new in 2016 Singapore Authority seized more than $240 million Singapore dollars as part of the pro into the misappropriation of Malaysia's State investment fund 1mdb part of the stolen funds had been laundered through banks in Singapore more recently in June this year three Banks and an insurer were fined for breaches related to German payments firm wart they did not adequately establish the source of wealth from their high-risk customers then in September five others were found to be involved in laundering money from scam proceeds in this episode I delve into the Dark World of moneya laundry what exactly is it and how does it really affect you let's start with a quick explanation on what money laundering means it all starts with a serious crime such as illegal gambling drug trafficking or or scams through these illegal activities criminals amass large amounts of cash but because they don't have any legitimate source of such wealth on paper they can't use these large amounts of money without raising suspicion and they can't Bank it in either without being investigated so they have to clean the illicit money to make them look like legitimate gains such that traces of its criminal Origins are erased hence the term laundry Dr but how does the Dirty Money magically become clean if you want to clean your dirty laundry then you want to choose the best and the most famous brand lawyer Wilson Ang advises Banks insurance companies and property developers on anti-money laundering laws how is Dirty Money laundered there are three stages to the laundering of money the first stage would be uh placement placement is where the illicit proceeds of crime that arise from criminal activities are being firstly introduced into the financial system this can be done by way of small Parcels of cash deposited into Banks it can be by way of the blending of uh proceeds of crime together with the revenues of legitimate businesses and usually these businesses will be cash-based businesses in the form of laundromats of um Car Wash businesses and even Beauty parlors and nail parlors or restaurants and others would involve the issuing of false invoices in respect of products never delivered or Services never provided and then we move into layering and this is where it gets complicated whereby the criminals go through an extended process of transferring the monies from One bank account to another one jurisdiction to another and in doing so really seek to obfuscate or to confuse the trail of the money that is uh going through the system and in that process they could be enabled by people who are willing to sell their bank accounts for this uh use or by companies that are set up as shell companies with bank accounts again that really do not have any real legitimate uh commercial purpose and once all that is done the third aspect is integrating it back into the financial system and that is done through the purchase of luxury property for example uh expensive cars jewelry Handbags and such like so why choose a country like Singapore to launder their money Singapore is well known as a leading Financial Center there are volumes of transactions and funds flowing through Singapore every day and as a result of our reputation for non-c corruptibility and integrity ironically Singapore also becomes attractive not just to legitimate businesses but also illegal uh criminals and illegal activities if you want to clean your dirty laund then you want to choose the best and the most famous brand for that washing machine and unfortunately from a money laundering standpoint Singapore might well have that brand as of early October 2.8 billion Singapore dollars worth of monies and assets had been ceased in the recent money laundering case that's almost three times what it cost to build GED by the base I'm about to find out how all this elic money flowing into Singapore may affect our economy after reaching out to many economists I finally came across one who wrote a research paper on properties bought by individuals mentioned in the Panama papers he has asked me to meet him here so why are we meeting here I thought let's pick a place where some transactions may be happening that we document in our paper which is 9 district 10 was this paper that you did there was this you know Panama paper leak and what are the Panama papers there was a leak around 10 years ago by a law firm somebody inside decided to leak all the information of around 11 million plus individuals who had created shell companies through this law fir in Panama these shell companies act as a front for people to do money laundering or other illicit activities what we wanted to see is can we match these these individuals who are named in the Panama papers to real estate transactions in Singapore and that was around 2,300 transactions then we wanted to see are they paying extra money when they're buying these properties because that could be that since they are laundering some money through these shell companies they may be willing to pay extra we find they pay a premium of on average around 4% sometimes if they are buying in good locations like District 9 district 10 they are paying a premium of 7 to 8% if there is a property in a district like this that costs around say $10 million they're willing to pay around 700,000 extra inadvertently does that also affect property prices in the area oh clearly because the other buyers who have to buy now properties in that area and the seller says the last transaction happened at 10.7 million so now the average buyer ends up paying more because of this property is the best because property values keep up going up so they are not only la ing money they're actually making money out of it because it's a lucrative investment and how does money laundering also affect the economy as a whole when they are bringing illicit money they may be engaging other activities buying luxury items from the jewelry or handbags expensive cars and so on so forth and that can have broader impact on the economy generally it can be good or bad because clearly some of this money coming in you can say look it is helping the economy grow but Singapore has always maintained a clean image this is a country that does not tolerate such activities that's the way Singapore attracts capital and talent and any such activity actually hurts the image of the country even though it may be helping the economy marginally 294 luxury bags 164 branded watches 546 pieces of jewelry 62 Vehicles among them luxury Brands like Bentley and rollsroyce and more than 100 52 properties the question is how did the suspects manage to buy all these luxury items especially high-end property worth millions of dollars without their source of funds being checked every time we make a sale or a rental we have to K this for the client [Music] Singapore law states that property agents must check their client's identity and source of wealth before completing a sale but the seizure of high-end properties linked to the recent moneya laundering case has got me wondering are these strictly [Music] followed Eric limb sells luxury properties to high net worth Chinese Nationals we have a very strict anti-money laundering AML system where we will Su electronic customer du Legion on let me show you for convenience sake I have ke my own particulars they will have to present us with their physical documents then we will have to verify okay the name the ID number and their date of birth is the customer buying for himself or on behalf of somebody or is somebody paying on his behalf the next next one will be the AML search where we try to search the client's name and ID against the database of un sanction leas as well as PS as you can see here match it's no match you actually don't want to match yeah that's the green like that's the green like what happens if a match is found we will try to narrow down and if there is a match then we will have to F A Str Str we will have to flag this out to our leer and we will ask whether is it okay for us to proceed with the deal the chall also ask if the property transaction is a complex or unusually large we can check the P transaction in this area for this property and past transaction may be transacting at 5 million and this client came in and offer 10 million so that will flag very unusual in terms of complex for example you say look I'm buying the property today but someone is going to make the payment on my behalf and then there comes the question why or they set up a trust to buy a property and the beneficiary is somebody not related to them then that is quite fishy it's quite a thorough checklist but is there any way for you to tell whether they are telling you the truth or not well we have no ways to detect if the client is telling the truth especially if the client is coming from foreign country there's very little way for us to be able to verify some clients maybe they can provide documents we cannot tell whether the documents are genuine so is anyone checking on you guys property agents whether you've done this checklist nobody is checking on us but a lot is at stake our license can be suspend and we can be impose on financial penalty in the recent moneya laundering case some 60 agents were reportedly involved in selling properties to the suspects when criminals deliberately tried to disguise the origins and ownership of the funds money laundering can be extremely difficult to detect and that's why law enforces sometimes turned to external Tech providers all these accounts are money M that are helping money launderers to carry out smaller transactions this team of tech experts monitor new and existing digital crimes for International Banks and law enforcement agencies their work helped to crack moneya laundering operations involving over a th000 bank accounts they use a special tool that is able to analyze your activity on banking apps we look out for multi accounting Behavior essentially it's when one device is associated with too many users let me show you each row here represents one single user session meaning when I take out my phone I log to my banking app that is considered one session yes what does all this mean okay so we have some information about the user device for example the screen resolution the number of CPU cost and also uh the user IP address which tells you where you're connecting from which country you're connecting from or essentially Banks use the software to monitor how you can use their websites or phone apps the software Flags any suspicious activity and the team deep dives into the data if it is a fraudulent transaction banks are alerted the bank will know who I am by looking at this yes these are colored I'm guessing it it means something for our alerts we have three different colors uh green signifying it's safe good yeah yeah yellow something weird about it and we also have red which means something is definitely up let me show you a known money laundering case that we are currently investigating okay wow and these are all individual users right exactly in this case we have detected 1,400 accounts that are associated with one single device all these accounts are money mes that are helping uh money launderers to carry out smaller transactions the first thing is what we call smurfing it's where they use multiple accounts in order to break down their transactions into smaller amounts if you have $10 million that you are trying to move if you try and move them all at once you're going to raise every single alarm in the bank so what they do is that they will split this amount up into smaller transactions into different accounts so that it seems less suspicious the second technique they use is called layering the first layer what we have here is probably where the illegal money originates from the money uh will then be sent to the second layer of accounts where it is partly consolidated ated there and then it will be Consolidated into the final account probably where the Mastermind is when you look at the micro level it's very difficult to detect such fraudulent activities how foolproof is the system what are its limitations there are two main challenges that we Face the first one being uh cash transactions or offline transactions once it leaves the ATM machines we have no way of tracking it because uh we work by leveraging on the data that we collect the second um challenge that we are facing is when fraud cases happen on crossplatform so for example if they transact between a bank and a cryptocurrency wallet uh it would be very difficult to track because some cryptocurrency wallets specializes in uh anonymizing your transactions your activity your identity so it would be near impossible to find out who was behind uh that account during the course of producing this episode it was reported that $2.8 million us worth of crypto currency was withdrawn from one of the suspect's accounts after he was arrested the police were only made aware of these crypto assets after foreign authorities alerted them to it I now know how dirty money is laundered and how challenging it is for investigators to track the movement of these funds which leaves me with one last thing to uncover one happens to the seiz luxury goods when investigations conclude is there a specific auction just for ciz assets yes do I'll tell you if you can get a bargain from seize [Music] items when suspects are investigated for money laundering their assets are seized now we tried to find out where the assets might be stored but the police kept M what we do know is that if suspects are convicted the courts can order the assets to be forfeited to the state these could then be sold via [Applause] auctions $1,600 $1600 have $1600 against for a Flor this is Robert Khan he has been valuing and auctioning private and ceased assets for over two decades I want to know if I can potentially snare a bargain at these auctions is there a specific auction just for Seas assets yes there are do advertise it accordingly whether it's a custom seizure or police seizure we've done some sales before where the Ava has seized some sandal wood locks before and then we we sell them to an auction auction are able to get a better bargain a discount on the items often because there are many items for auction most likely you will get a better price uh from an auction sale and why is that the case because uh these are seized items if I can use the word they motivated Sellers as well of course they're Guided by valuation prices but they also have a a Time factor to consider to realize these items into Cash give me an example something sells at a commercial gallery for $20,000 at an auction how much of a deal can I get a range of maybe 10 20% lower 30% lower but of course popular items maybe a ladies handbag sought after item the buyers will come and they could bid up the price and how would I know if the sale is on WE repare EF Flyers to be sent out to our mailing list advertis in the media social media media to attract and generate as much interest as possible SE assets like luxury bags watches and jewelry are stored with authorities until investigations conclude and this could take years lawyers I spoke to say the assets should be stored properly so as not to spoil the evidence while investigations are still ongoing these could be returned to the suspects if they acquitted or sold off through auctions if no one claims them so just like a doctor caring for his patients these items need to be handled with exceptional care leather luxury items like these bags need to be handled with gloves so as to avoid contact with perspiration which might damage the leather they also need to be store in the room with temperatures set between 15 to 23° C to avoid the growth of mold thousands of bottles of heart liquor and wine were also seized in the recent case in this case we heard the money launderers had gone about and bought a lot of Fine Wine in fact I have a picture here I'm not sure if you can tell but are these good wines you're smiling these are really what I call U your super skill uh collectors or drinkers in that sense why why are they like super skill what what well for example like right behind here you can see is a DRC domain Roman con okay what does that mean it's a vard in in the aandi area but it's so highly sought after because they only produce like 2 to 3,000 bottles a year given year right and then even on the launch uh if you are not connected if you don't have the uh uh personality to buy it you won't even get it even the launch price we're talking about easily $5,000 a bottle right wow as a wine importer Richard Lee sells wines worth tens of thousands of Singapore dollars in this picture itself you can see they have quite a lot of bottles we talking about the hundreds and I imagine how it starts is very important as well it is very very important I mean looking at it they so well displayed I believe they spent quite a good amount of money to renovate place they insulate the walls very well you can tell that this is not your ordinary seller there's not just a room like this with air conditioning it's well insulated why is that so important because of the humidity and if it's not sto well the value of the wines drop tremendously if you sto it well the value just appreciate accordingly okay give us some idea how much this would appreciate in value so I buy it now for $5,000 if I keep it for 10 years roughly how much would it be we are talking about in the region of $20,000 per bottle per bottle wow that give you an example if you don't store the wi well it still looks like it should it looks okay from the outside but what's important is the inside if it's start well the should come out in one piece if you do not start well basically the has dried up and then it will be brittle it will break okay Moment of Truth oh this is what happened okay so now we have a bit of a problem it's falling apart so looking at these seized wines how can we be sure that they would appreciate and value in that condition generally they are start well the worrying part is will the wine be transported to another location from here on or is it still going to be at the same location so you can seee the wine but question is did you look after the wine that's the big question isn't it but no one can confirm exactly how authorities are storing the seized assets this is Singapore's biggest ever moneya laundering Scandal and while it may sound like a victimless crime it cannot be ignored because it allows the flourishing of activities like drug trafficking and scams essentially the source of the funds for now we'll just wait and see what happens to the 10 suspects" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="On this segment from the latest episode of Patriot Act, Hasan examines the 1MDB sovereign wealth fund scandal in Malaysia, in which former prime minister Najib Razak has been accused of funneling millions of dollars from the country into his personal bank accounts. Traditionally used as a means of economic diversification by countries reliant on a single industry, sovereign wealth funds have come under scrutiny as financial organizations like Goldman Sachs and corrupt politicians have taken advantage of these large, mostly unregulated pools of money for their own gain. While Goldman Sachs continues to profit off of sovereign wealth funds in other countries, the bank is currently being investigated for its role in the 1MDB scandal, which could have lasting implications on the world of finance.&#10;&#10;Watch Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj on Netflix: &#10;https://www.netflix.com/title/80239931 &#10;&#10;#Netflix #PatriotAct #HasanMinhaj&#10;Subscribe: https://bit.ly/2OHQXpO&#10;&#10;About Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj:&#10;New episodes, new topics, every Sunday - only on Netflix.

          <attvalue for="7" value="Now anytime someone says “Goldman Sachs,” you know something bad happened. What may be the biggest financial scam in history. Two former Goldman Sachs bankers and a fugitive Malaysian financier have been charged over the alleged plunder of billions of dollars from Malaysia's State Development Fund. Malaysia prosecutors filed criminal charges against the bank and two former employees, saying they committed, “Gross violations of the country's securities laws.” The Malaysian government has accused Goldman Sachs of helping a fund steal billions of dollars from the country. Now, Goldman has denied any wrongdoing, but in the U.S., the bank is under criminal investigation as we speak, and the Justice Department reportedly wants any settlement to include a guilty plea. That would be unprecedented. Just so you know, Goldman Sachs has never once plead guilty in 150 years. Which is shocking when you look at all the shady shit they've been accused of. Price manipulation, insider trading, gender discrimination, securities fraud, and those are just the names of their conference rooms. Goldman Sachs - they didn't even face charges in '08. Wall Street powerhouse, Goldman Sachs accused of fraud. Knowingly and willfully cheating clients. Top executives boasting about the profits they made during the housing crisis. Goldman Executives held their ground. Regret to me means something that you feel like you did wrong. And I don't have that. American Psycho with an overbite is talking about regret like it's something they sell at Barney's. He's just like, “Regret. I don't have that. Where do I buy it?” This scandal in Malaysia is way bigger than Goldman Sachs. It spanned four continents, involved billions of dollars, 14 tiaras, Marlon Brando's Oscar, a $27 million diamond necklace, a grand piano for Miranda Kerr, and Psy. “Gangnam Style” dude just comes up a lot in this story, it's very weird, okay? At the center of the entire Malaysian scandal was something called a sovereign wealth fund. That's what I want to talk about tonight. Sovereign wealth funds are giant pools of money owned and managed by a country or state. Now, you tend to find them in countries that depend on a single resource like oil. Okay, so if oil crashes, you don't want your economy to crash with it. So you take your oil money and you put it in a sovereign wealth fund and invest it in things that aren't oil. Basically, countries that start sovereign wealth funds for the same reason that Diddy and Mario Lopez started tequila companies. You don't know how long the hits are going to last, so you got to diversify. But the reason we need to talk about sovereign wealth funds is because they have tons of cash, are basically unregulated, and can be used to rob an entire country. The first time a lot of people heard about sovereign wealth funds is when they were actually helping the U.S. economy. As Wall Street was losing tens of billions of dollars due to the mortgage and credit crises, it wasn't the Fed or Congress that came to the rescue. It was something called “sovereign wealth funds.” Sovereign wealth funds bailed out our banks. Abu Dhabi's fund became the biggest stakeholder in Citi. China bought 10% of Morgan Stanley and 10% of the Blackstone Group. And all that foreign money made people worry. How much do you have to invest? About $200 billion. -$200 billion? -$200 billion. This is the fund's president-- Gao Xiqing. Yes, it rhymes with cha-ching. You know what's crazy? She did that in voiceover. Think about it, like, she went into a booth. It was written down. She read from a script. “Gao Xiqing rhymes with cha-ching. I'm Leslie Stahl, those ethnic puns and more tonight on 60 Minutes.” And then she just banged a gong. Now, since 2008, sovereign wealth funds have exploded with cash. There are 78 sovereign wealth funds in the world. Almost a third of them were created in the last decade. In 2007, they controlled around $3 trillion. Now, it's about $8 trillion. Now, I know that number seems meaningless. You know, it's like when you're a little kid and you're like, “I'll bet you nine gajillion dollars.” And you're like, “All right.” So just for context. $8 trillion is about 50% of Gaddafi's Ray-Bans budget. But seriously, it's equivalent to 10% of the global GDP, and that money is everywhere. Silicon Valley has taken a shitload of money from sovereign wealth funds and only half of it went to scooters. But Uber, Tesla, Lyft, WeWork, Wag, Slack, Magic Leap, DoorDash, and Fanatics have all taken money. Fanatics, you guys. Look, the next time you get a Draymond Green bobblehead, just know you made the King of Bahrain $28. It gets even more random. Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund has a 75-year lease on Chicago's parking meters. Yeah. That's right, Chicago. Your parking meters are Muslim. Think about it. A lot of them face east, they have arranged marriages, and they don't eat pork. They're Muslim. The biggest and best run sovereign wealth fund is in Norway, okay? It's worth $1 trillion, which is huge. Especially for a country that tiny. Norwegians own shares in more than 8,000 companies worldwide, including over 200 in Canada. The Pension Fund, as it's now called, makes every Norwegian a millionaire on paper. Norway used to have Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, and it got canceled because everybody won. The good news is Norway's fund is highly transparent. The problem is many sovereign wealth funds aren't in democracies. A lot of them are in petrostates: Russia, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Libya, Oman, Kuwait, Algeria, Angola. These countries have an average democracy index score of three out of ten, which ranks them somewhere between dictatorship and Indian household. In 2018, the son of Angola's dictator was accused of funneling $500 million from the fund into a foreign bank account. Many of these sovereign wealth funds are controlled by autocrats-- MBS, Erdoğan, Putin. Do you trust these guys? 'Cause they're nothing like Norway. Norway's like a boyfriend who doesn't have a passcode on his phone. He's just like, “Swipe up.” These guys are like a boyfriend who has a second phone. You're like, “Vlad, why do you have a Motorola RAZR?” And he's like, “It's for work.” No transparency, little oversight, lack of democratic institutions. All of this makes sovereign wealth funds ripe for abuse. No matter who's running them, they want to make their pools of money bigger, and that's why they need investment banks like Goldman Sachs. But banks like Goldman can take advantage of sovereign wealth funds, and they do it in two key ways. The first thing they do is they leverage their expertise. Take Libya, okay? In 2006, Libya set up a $60 billion sovereign wealth fund that was looking to grow, and then Goldman showed up. Libya's sovereign wealth fund lost almost $1.3 billion in trades with Goldman. When they realized they had lost all that money, they went to Goldman and were furious. Furious is the word. I mean, look at the way Gaddafi treats his own people. I can't imagine he reacted particularly well to losing 98% of his investment. No, I've been told you really can't lose money in Libya or Gaddafi's money or you get in a lot of trouble. A lot of trouble? This is a guy who blew up a commercial airliner. A lot of trouble is an understatement. Reportedly, Gaddafi's family friend who ran the fund went up to a Goldman rep and yelled, “Fuck your mother. Fuck you and get out of my country.” Which is also how Gaddafi signed his emails. Now, get this. Goldman took home $200 million in fees, and Libya says it lost $1.2 billion. Libya was looking for boring, safe Investments, but Goldman took their money and made a complex, risky trade. In court, Libyan officials claimed that they had no idea what was going on. Goldman won the suit, but there is no question their expertise helped them profit from Libya's ignorance. And those tactics seem to be part of Goldman's overall culture and strategy. Just listen to this former Goldman VP. Getting an unsophisticated client, it was the golden prize. The quickest way to make money on Wall Street is to take the most sophisticated product and try to sell it to the least sophisticated client. That's the same way they sell credit cards on college campuses. They're like, “Hey, dude, you want a tank top that says MasterCard on it?” And you're like, “Sure, here's all my information. Thanks for the triple XL tank top.” In order to really understand... how much damage Goldman and sovereign wealth funds can do, we have to get back to Malaysia. The case that could send Goldman Sachs bankers to jail. Just like in Libya, Goldman Sachs was brought in to help Malaysia grow its sovereign wealth fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad or 1MDB. Not IMDB, 1MDB. But 1MDB didn't even exist until this guy came into the picture. Jho Low. He was this 27-year-old Malaysian financier. This gulab jamun with glasses... got connected with Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak. Look at this. He somehow convinced the prime minister of a country to set up a sovereign wealth fund. Now, Najib is theoretically a democratic leader, but he is tight with a lot of autocrats, like Rodrigo Duterte, the President of the Philippines. You guys remember Duterte. In fact, Prime Minister Najib and President Duterte are so tight that during a 2016 state dinner, they started catching feelings. Thank you very much, Mr. President. They should totally fuck. But then Najib would have to imprison Duterte for sodomy. He'd be like, “That was great, you're under arrest.” Jho Low claimed 1MDB was supposed to help Malaysia build infrastructure and increase development, and investors bought his sales pitch. Let's all think big. Let's all be bold. And let's really think about our place in this world and work together to create the world we truly want to live in. Wow, that's so beautiful and selfless. So what world did he truly want to live in? Yes, that's Punjabi MC. Yes, that's Paris Hilton. And yes, he's wearing a fedora that was probably paid for by the people of Malaysia. More than $4.5 billion were stolen from 1MDB between 2009 and 2014. A number of corrupt 1MDB officials treated this public trust as a personal bank account. Najib and Jho Low are accused of stealing at least $4.5 billion, and they blew it on insane shit. For Jho Low's 31st birthday, he got Psy, Pharrell, Jamie Foxx, Redfoo, Busta Rhymes, Q-Tip, Swizz Beatz, Ludacris, and Chris Brown to perform. He got Britney Spears to jump out of a cake and 20 little people to walk around dressed as Oompa Loompas. Now it says a lot when Chris Brown isn't the most offensive thing at your party. Jho Low also spent millions on real estate, a private jet, a mega-yacht, a clear piano for Miranda Kerr, a Picasso, a Monet, and a Leonardo DiCaprio. -I'm serious. I'm dead serious. -No way! Even though 1MDB denies it, Jho Low helped set up a production company that financed The Wolf of Wall Street. Leo even gave them a shout-out at the Golden Globes. Joey, Riz and Jho, thank you for being not only collaborators, but taking a risk on on this movie. A movie about a hard partying financier who stole millions of dollars was made by a hard partying financier who stole millions of dollars. That would be like if Predator was directed by Bryan Singer. By the way, Jho Low didn't stop with Wolf of Wall Street. The movies Dumb and Dumber To and Daddy's Home were also financed illegally. The production company denies wrongdoing on that. No wrongdoing? There was definitely wrongdoing. Now, you're probably wondering how on earth did the prime minister of Malaysia and the kid from Up pull this off? Well, they hired Goldman Sachs, which gets us to Goldman's second tactic for exploiting sovereign wealth funds. Reputation. Whether you like them or not, Goldman Sachs is synonymous with money, success, and money again. Goldman helped 1MDB appear more legit than they actually were. It's like awards on movie posters. Like, you don't ever read that leafy circle. You just trust it once you see it. It could say anything in there, and in this case, that leafy circle was Goldman Sachs. Now, here's how it went down. Jho Low and Najib started the sovereign wealth fund, 1MDB. They worked primarily with two Goldman bankers, Roger Ng and Tim Leissner, who helped take 1MDB to the next level. How much of Jho Low's scheme do you think was actually, would have been possible without the help of bankers like those from Goldman Sachs? No, that's totally right. It would have been impossible without the help of the enablers in the global financial system. I mean, the money was raised by Goldman Sachs. It's true. In 2012, Ng and Leissner started helping 1MDB raise money from investors who were told that their money would help pay for power plants. The only problem was 1MDB had no credit rating, which made it harder to convince people to invest. So to make the power plant deals look better, Goldman Sachs used their credibility and paired 1MDB up with Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, IPIC, which had $70 billion in assets and solid credit. All of this was their verified blue check mark and investors saw that package, Goldman, IPIC, and 1MDB and they bought in. Over the next year, Goldman raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB, but instead of all of it going into power plants, Jho Low allegedly siphoned off $1.4 billion into a shell company. From there, the money allegedly went to pay off everyone who helped. It also paid for Daddy's Home, Oompa Loompas, and Miranda Kerr's piano, and Goldman walked away with $600 million in fees and revenue. Now, we reached out to Goldman Sachs to ask them about these fees, and they said the fees and revenue were fair given the risk assumed. But reporters say that $600 million is 200 times what they would normally make on a deal that size. Clearly, something shady is going on here. Goldman used their expertise to raise the money for 1MDB and used their reputation to make this scheme look legit. Prime Minister Najib did everything he could to cover this up. He cracked down on reporters. He fired officials investigating him. He even threw a concert with Psy to rally support for his political party BN. How is Psy always at the scene of the crime? He's the Forrest Gump of shady Asian business deals. In the end, the scandal brought down Najib's entire government, and he was arrested. He insists he's being framed. So he did what every wrongly accused man does to clear his name. He makes his own version of “We Are the World.” This is the saddest day of my life. Hopes as high as a mountain, can be crumbled into dust. Why did such a tragic event ever happen in my life? That song is so bad it created more world hunger. Najib is on trial in Malaysia as we speak, and Jho Low is still on the run. What they did with Goldman caused real pain. Thanks to two guys, ordinary Malaysians are stuck with $13 billion of debt. They have not only stolen the money through commissions, but they have helped to destroy the economy and the confidence in the system. Apology is not enough. Apology with $7.5 billion, that is what matters. Goldman Sachs should understand the agony and the trauma suffered by the Malaysian people. Roger Ng, one of the Goldman bankers, has plead not guilty, but U.S. prosecutors are pushing for a plea deal. Tim Leissner has already plead guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery and money laundering. Goldman Sachs says they were unaware of their activity and is trying to make it seem like 1MDB was the fault of rogue employees. But in his guilty plea, Leissner said, “Avoiding compliance was part of Goldman culture.” And experts agree. Now, it's significant that the bank itself has been targeted rather than just its employees. Because this indicates that the Malaysian authorities believe that Goldman knew that money was being misappropriated. This was not rogue traders. These are very senior people. And it went all the way up the food chain at the firm, and they should have known. Since 1MDB, Goldman Sachs has actually been doubling down on sovereign wealth funds. Just last year, they worked with Saudi Arabia. Now, they're working with China. These deals are gonna keep happening. They're not going away. And that's okay, because sovereign wealth funds aren't inherently bad. But in the wrong hands, they can do massive damage to countries. That's why a criminal case against Goldman Sachs could be so important. It could help set a precedent about how much we scrutinize these vast pools of money with little to no regulation. Until that changes, there are going to be more 1MDBs and even more Jho Lows. Jho Low, if you're watching, wherever you are, I can't get you another $4.5 billion. I can't get you acquitted, but if you turn yourself in, there's one thing I can get you. The biggest, wildest Psy concert the world has ever seen. Psy, if you're watching, wherever you are, I'm calling in that favor. Check your RAZR phone." />

people are turning away from big city life A sense of community a sense of belonging is something that big cities do not have anymore Those still exist in mid cities and small cities Um so young

disease is a top killer in Ivory Coast But with just 140 cardiologists nationwide care is stretched thin Now AI is stepping in A new bot from the Abijan Heart Institute and a local startup could revolutionize cardiac care Julia Gigan and Damian Kufi reports Like one in three adults in Ivory Coast Kristoff Bigb suffers from high blood pressure The disease requires regular monitoring and lifelong daily treatment He receives a rather unusual call Whe the Abby Health Institute is conducting a study on 300 patients with high blood pressure to test a conversational bot developed by a local startup top From now on Kristoff will receive a call every 3 weeks I do have regular follow-ups but it's periodic It's three times a year I think this system will enable the doctor and myself too to take care of my treatment and focus on the recommendations that it gives me The bot helps doctors diagnose during emergencies in a country with only 140 cardiologists This morning I received an alert for a patient with very high blood pressure So we got in touch with him to see if he had any symptoms that were considered high risk If so we would see him in person rapidly Cardiovascular disease has become the number one cause of death among adults in the Ivory Coast For example stroke mortality has risen by almost 20% in our country While we know that mortality linked to AIDS or malaria has fallen thanks to the efforts that have been made and the resources that have been deployed The institute hopes the conversational bot can also be used to monitor other chronic diseases and

are marking the Big Eid or Tabaski in West Africa one of Islam's most sacred festivals But this year in countries like Sudand and Morocco the joy of the holiday is shadowed by crisis and uncertainty Clemon Valer has the story [Music] To kick off the Aid Lata celebrations these Nigerians are gathering to pray at the Alhabiba Mosque in Abuja Despite the severe economic crisis affecting the country solidarity and charity are at the heart of the event with meals being distributed after the prayers We all know things are hard now and we should do things with the little God has given to us Happiness is not having plenty Happiness is being contented with whatever you have gotten Today is the mood of sharing caring and love Why Because our dear grandfather Ibraimisam pass the test of patience That is what we are trying to emulate today Traditionally during Eid a sheep or ram is sacrificed to commemorate the sacrifice of Abraham or Ibraim But this year many people are finding it hard to buy one due to a sharp price increase For the first time in almost 30 years Morocco has called on its citizens to not sacrifice a sheep because of the persistent drought which has led to a decline in the livestock population In recent years I've noticed a rise in prices and the resulting suffering of the public who can't afford Eid Some of them borrow money to bet the sheep I support this decision Another source of concern during this festive season the conflicts that are tearing certain countries apart In Sudan these celebrations are muted because of the war that has been raging for more than 2 years According to a report published last Thursday by the International Organization for Migration more than 10 million people have been internally displaced since the beginning of the conflict in April 2023 in Mubarak For those who celebrate thank you for watching Ion Africa [Music] Hello I'm Annette Young the host of the 51% And in this week's special edition we're in the

          <attvalue for="7" value="faith and Pope Leo the 14th. First month at the helm of the Catholic Church, we are joined by a leading Catholic voice in American journalism today. Ross Douthat is an opinion columnist for The New York Times, where he often reflects on the intersection of faith, culture and public life. A prolific writer, Douthat is also author of the new book Believe Why Everyone Should Be Religious, and he offers a blueprint for how someone can think their way from doubt to faith into belief. Ross, thank you so much for being here. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for having me. It's a pleasure. &gt;&gt; I want to start off now with a big picture look at our religious landscape right now. According to Pew Research Center, 62% of US adults identify as Christian. That's a 9% drop from 2014. And meanwhile, 29% of US adults are not affiliated with any religion today, a 6% increase from 2014. Though it does seem the decline of Christianity has somewhat plateaued in recent years. But tell us about why you think we're seeing these trends, and what do you hope your book addresses in this moment? &gt;&gt; I think what you already mentioned it right, that we are in this kind of interesting plateau in after a long period of institutional religious decline and secularization. So if you go back to the turn of the 21st century, the year 2000, and run the clock forward, you get like 15 or 20 years where year in, year out, the number of people identifying as Christian declines, the number of people going to church , going to mass declines. And then around the time of the pandemic or thereafter, it was like it hit a kind of limit. And for the last 4 or 5 years, you've had a certain kind of stabilization. And what I like to say to people is, it's not that America is having a religious revival, it's more that we're considering whether to have a religious revival. So you have a surge of interest in religion, and some of that shows up in traditional faiths. Some of it shows up in everything from UFOs to psychedelics. But it's a very unsettled but curious landscape. And the book I wrote is trying to be written. It's trying to work into that landscape, to basically say to a lot of people who were raised without religion, like, we're not dealing with lapsed Catholics anymore, right? I mean, we are, but we're not. But we're dealing with a generation, many of whom have come of age with no connection to institutional faith at all. They're interested, they're curious, but it's like, well, what is this religion thing anyway? Right. &gt;&gt; Well, and I want to hit on bring in some of that data that you hit on there. Is this yes. That trend in plateau of religiously unaffiliated. But many U.S. Dioceses this year saw an increase in the number of converts. If you look at the Diocese of Cleveland, about a 50% growth in converts from last year. Diocese of Winona, Rochester, Minnesota, up 67%. Diocese of San Angelo in Texas, up about 56%. That's just to name a few. So you don't think there's necessarily a revival going on per se. But what what do you think this speaks to? &gt;&gt; Well, and you have numbers like that actually in Western Europe as well. France has seen record numbers of adult baptisms. The United Kingdom, there's been data showing suggesting that generation Z, the youngest generation, is more likely to be churchgoing than generation X or the millennial generation at this point. But yeah, I think I think it speaks to that, that renewed interest. And in that sense, I think above all that, you know, certain promises were made about what a more secular world was supposed to look like. If you go back to the early 2000 and the heyday of the New Atheists figures like Richard Dawkins and so on, there was a sense that, well, of course, once we, you know, get rid of these hidebound Bronze Age superstitions, everyone will get along better. Politics will be less polarized, science will be held in higher esteem, and sociologically, people will be happier. Kids won't be afraid of going to hell, things like that. And obviously none of that has happened, right? The country is more divided, more polarized, and there's just more, frankly, existential angst that people have. Again, not surprisingly, in the absence of a supernatural horizon. So you have a lot of people, some of whom are coming into the church, others who are sort of exploring around the edges, who are reacting to that environment. &gt;&gt; Many people are hoping that Pope Leo, being a US born pope, will himself bring a bit of a revival of Catholicism in the US. What do you think about that? &gt;&gt; Well, you know, I'm from New Haven, Connecticut, where we have the body of blessed Michael McGivney, the founder of the Knights of Columbus. Right. So there's a hope fervently expressed by my parish priests after the new pope's election, that there would be a canonization of Michael McGivney and the pope would come to New Haven, Connecticut. So I have to say, if he comes to New Haven, if he comes to New Haven, an American revival is assured. &gt;&gt; Well, that's you. Maybe the Holy Father is listening. &gt;&gt; Maybe he. Maybe he is. &gt;&gt; Ross. The day after Pope Leo was elected, you wrote in the New York Times about the cultural state that we're in right now, the church that he has inherited. And you wrote in part, this is a much weirder landscape than the one in which liberal and conservative Catholics clash over contraception or gay marriage. And it's likely to get weirder still as we move deeper into a digital and virtual and artificial intelligence mediated existence. Can you expand on that? What is this weird landscape that Pope Leo now has to navigate? &gt;&gt; Well, he's already said, right? That one reason he took the name Leo was because Leo the 13th, the last pope with that name, was Pope at a time of huge industrial and technological transformation and sort of offered a distinctively Catholic witness for that age. And the Holy Father has said, you know, we're in a similar moment, potentially with artificial intelligence and digital life, and the church has to figure out what it wants to say about those set of issues. So it's not that the older culture war issues have gone away. It's not that abortion doesn't matter or anything like that, but there is this landscape that people live in online, disconnected or connected in new ways. Right? That is, I think, clearly perilous to the soul in various ways. It has deep effects on family and marriage and community, where you're trying to figure out how to raise kids in this environment. And there are fundamental questions of morality and spirituality that are bound up in how you relate to your phone. And I think it is really important for the church to figure out what to say about it. Like right now, you know, there's no bigger obstacle to people having kids and having families. Some people think, than digital life. Right? So it's not, you know, Humanae Vitae in the 60s is writing about contraception as an impediment to Christian marriage. You know, I'm not saying we're getting an encyclical about the iPhone as an impediment to Christian marriage, but like that, that is the kind of weird. That's one weird zone. The other weird zone is that there's just more interest in the supernatural. And again, this sort of is operating outside often of traditional religious paradigms, its people into UFOs, its people into all kinds of do it yourself spirituality. And there too, the church is kind of used to talking to a secular audience and saying, oh, you know, come on, you know, God really exists and so on. Now it's often talking to people who are like, oh, I believe in a spirit world. People who have sort of recognized in some ways without returning to Christianity. And that is itself a different challenge. &gt;&gt; Pope Leo is the first pope who personally had social media, so he probably has some insight into these conversations that are happening. It's been 12 years already since the release of your widely acclaimed book, Bad Religion How We Became a Nation of Heretics. You wrote in 2013 about how Christianity in the U.S. Had been taken over, not so much by atheism, but by heresy. Ross. Is that still the case today? What's changed here in the U.S. In the past 12 years? &gt;&gt; I think a lot of that landscape still exists. Right. So I was writing a lot about certain forms of prosperity gospel theology, sort of self-help spirituality that are kind of Christian ish, have sort of Christian elements, but end up being idolatrous in various ways, idolatrous towards money and materialism, idolatrous towards the imperial self. And look, I think you can look around American culture and say, all of that is still around. I do think, though, that there has been a shift where as Christianity institutionally has declined, and it has in since. Since then, you really do have a bit more, frankly, post-Christian spirituality. So if I was writing the book now, I wouldn't just be talking about heresy, right? I would be talking about forms of religion that just aren't Christian anymore and that are sort of or people. A different way to put it is that there are a lot of people seeking higher powers that are maybe different powers from the God of the Old and New Testament, and you see that in religion, you see it in artificial intelligence, where people are very self-consciously trying to build a kind of machine God. And all of that is what is new and novel, I think, in the landscape relative to ten years ago. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You were in Rome recently for the inaugural mass of Pope Leo the 14th, as we mark the first month of his pontificate, what have been your first impressions of Pope Leo so far? &gt;&gt; I mean, first of all, just to get elected pope without having anyone outside the world of intense Catholic media and even some people within that world have any kind of clear and definite impression of him, suggests a really interesting kind of dark horse sort of figure who's very good at making different groups of people feel heard and understood and very good, hopefully at promoting a certain kind of unity, which was the watchword of his, his, his words. And, you know, at the initial mass and elsewhere, you know, obviously there were a lot of conservative and traditionalist Catholics who were frustrated or anxious at various moments in the era of Pope Francis. And I think one of the lessons of the reaction to Pope Leo from people in those camps, when, you know, he hasn't really done all that much. Right. He's just it's been one month, but there's so far this sense of just sort of relief at a feeling of kind of stability and normalcy in the papal office, which tells you that, in fact, you know, the pope does not have to, you know, assume the chair of Saint Peter and immediately anathematize, you know, an entire flank of the Catholic Church in order for in order for conservative Catholics to feel just a little more relaxed. And I think that's the sense that I see a sense of greater relaxation among conservatives without, I should say, more liberal Catholics, having anything to be particularly freaked out about or anxious about. Now, all of that will change as actual dilemmas and controversies present themselves. But so far, I think he's been a tremendously unifying figure. And it helps that he's he's an American. I mean, one of the interesting, you know, behind the scenes claims about the conclave. And of course, we can't know any of this for sure. But one of the claims is that the American cardinals ended up sort of uniting behind the new pope. Now, the American cardinals, as you know, do not agree about very much. Right? It is a you know, we think of them as sort of a polarized group divided between more liberal and more conservative figures. So just that unity behind an American candidate is really striking. &gt;&gt; And I want to stay on this theme of unity. I mean, his episcopal motto, Pope Leo's is in the one Christ, we are one. So in your opinion, what should Pope Leo prioritize early on if he does, in fact want to bring about unity and healing in our divided church? &gt;&gt; I mean, I, I think that, you know, when Pope Francis before before his election. Right, gave gave a sort of gave remarks right that were that were often quoted and they were about the idea that the church can't just sort of be turned in on itself. Right. It has to go outward. And in many ways, Pope Francis was admirable and impressive in doing that, but often in the controversies that he wanted to open up, where it's like, we're going to have a synod on this and a synod on that and so on. It ended up sort of becoming almost like a circular firing squad within the Catholic Church, where it was like, we're going to now, we're going to have the argument about, you know, female deacons or something, and everybody turns on everybody else and fights. And I think avoiding that, avoiding sort of reopening arguments and reopening wounds and looking for places. And again, we were talking about changing landscape of digital life, artificial intelligence, things that people are anxious and concerned about, figuring out what the church says outward to the world that almost all Catholics can agree upon and bear witness to. I think that's the optimal goal for a kind of initial agenda for a new pontificate. &gt;&gt; It's been four years now since Pope Francis released his papal document Traditionis Custodes, which imposed severe restrictions on the celebration of the mass in Latin. Some might argue that these restrictions, which were intended for unity, in fact brought about greater division. What action do you think Pope Leo would? &gt;&gt; Some would argue that, yes. &gt;&gt; And you might argue that as well. What action does Pope Leo need to take, in your opinion, on Traditionis Custodes, and how much should he prioritize this early on? &gt;&gt; I think that there is an argument that because, in fact, that document was not received in the same way in every diocese, that there were lots and lots of bishops and archbishops who thought that it would lead to more division if they cracked down on the Latin Mass in various ways, that that that means that in a sense, the Pope could just sort of leave things alone a bit and basically say, all right, you know, we issued this document or my predecessor issued this document, but really it's up to the local church, and Rome is just not going to put pressure on people to enforce it, which seemed to be quite often what was happening. Now, of course, you then have cases like we've just seen in Charlotte, North Carolina, where you would still have specific bishops and specific local churchmen who decide that, no, they're they're going to use the document as a reason, a reason to crack down. And that is where I think a sort of hands off policy doesn't work. In the end, the Pope has to decide if he's going to place a few phone calls. I don't think I would not expect to see a formal rollback of the document. I think the more likely expectation is a kind of hands off approach, with some targeted moves to tell bishops that, in fact, the Vatican is not enthused about further crackdowns. Yeah, that would be my guess. But I'm I'm I'm just speculating. &gt;&gt; How do you anticipate Pope Leo and we've had on this already being the first U.S. Born pope. How do you anticipate that might affect U.S. Vatican relations? &gt;&gt; I mean, I think in part it just depends on what happens in US politics, right? I mean, we have two different political parties that each have areas of tension with the Vatican. I would expect, you know, under Donald Trump, there would continue to be tension between the Vatican's view and Washington's view on some issues related to migration. Obviously, if you get a Democratic president, the old issues of abortion and others become more important. I think the more important question is what it says, what the American model of Catholicism means for the world. Right? Because we've we've lived through a long era in the 19th and early 20th century where American Catholicism was seen by a lot of Catholics elsewhere, this kind of outlier, where the normal thing is for Catholicism to be kind of a semi-established, deeply culturally rooted church. And the American church, well, they're out there sort of making things up as they go along in a pluralist society. But in fact, in the 21st century, everyone is living in a pluralist society. Everywhere is basically American in that sense, even cultures that have these, you know, ancient roots in Catholicism. And I think to be optimistic, you would say that, look, we've elected an American pope for a time when if the church is going to flourish in France or Germany or South Korea or the Philippines or Africa or anywhere else, the way it's flourished in America is deeply relevant. There's not we're not going back to a world where, you know, you just have the Polish Catholic, you're Polish and you're Catholic, you're Croatian and you're Catholic. That world is gone. And the American model of sort of Catholic witness under pluralist conditions is here to stay. And now we have a pope forged by that reality. &gt;&gt; Well, related to that, the day after Pope Leo's inaugural mass, you sat down with U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance in Rome for your podcast, Interesting Times. And it was right after Vance met privately with Pope Leo. And the discussion hit on this tension that exists between Trump administration policy and what the Vatican thinks, especially relevant because Vance himself is a convert to Catholicism. And I want to play just part of your exchange with Vance for our viewers. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to pretend that I haven't struggled with some of this, that I haven't thought about whether, you know, we're doing the precisely right thing. So it's a fair point. And I know that you think you've you've got me trapped here. &gt;&gt; I don't think I. &gt;&gt; Have, you know I'm not. &gt;&gt; All right. Let me let me be perfectly honest. I'm not interested in in having you trapped. I we're having a conversation in Rome as a journalist and a vice president, but also as two Catholics. &gt;&gt; I'm. &gt;&gt; And I'm. I'm interested. &gt;&gt; Ross. Trust me, I think it's to be clear. I think it's a totally fair question. I'm interested in what. &gt;&gt; Politics does to people, to know. &gt;&gt; Okay. Your soul. &gt;&gt; It's always painful to watch your own, your own interviews slightly. &gt;&gt; But I feel that every week. But but Ross, based on your interview with Vice President Vance, what did you make of how Vance sees his role as a Catholic? You as vice president who has to be mindful of the Vatican's opinions? &gt;&gt; I mean, I think it's, you know, it's a tremendous challenge, right? Especially because he's vice president. He's not president. Right. So there's always a certain kind of tension between, again, being an elected politician in a pluralist, non-Catholic society and trying to be faithful to the teachings of the church. And that, again, has showed up most sharply for Democratic politicians and debates about abortion. But it has showed up for politicians of both parties in many cases over the years. When you're vice president, though, you aren't fully, you know, you aren't fully in control of your own agenda, right? So there's that there's that issue as well. And the vice president was trying to talk, I think about the idea that you're trying to basically find, especially on issues like immigration, where the church sort of has general principles but doesn't offer you a specific policy brief. You're trying to find a way to make sure that your views are influenced by what the Vatican is saying and by your obligations as a Catholic without again, assuming that there's like this five point Vatican plan that you have to put into operation. But look, I think I was pressing him because I think there is some real tensions here, especially in things the Trump administration has done in terms of sending people to the somewhat famous prison in El Salvador and so on, where I think a Vatican critique of the white House would carry some weight. And the vice president, you know, in this weird dual role, has to has to wrestle with that. &gt;&gt; Just two more questions for you, Ross. Ross, I think there are some Catholics who they look askance to converts to the faith, as if their opinions are not yet well formed enough to contribute to the greater Catholic conversation. Our vice president is a convert. You are a convert, which you detail more about in your book. Believe. How do you strike a balance as a convert between quietly contemplating an aspect of the faith and seeking formation, with then going out there and boldly speaking the truth? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, look, some some of the hostility to converts is just a matter of the fact that in this moment, a lot of vocal converts have tended to be more politically conservative. And so it ended up being this sort of part of the weird liberal conservative divide, right, where complaining about converts talking too soon, or speaking out of turn is a way to sort of complain about a conservative tendency or trend in the church without saying that exactly . At the same time, obviously you have cases where, you know, people become Catholic and six months later, you know, they're they they've discovered in, you know, a 13th century text that in fact, you know, the, the, the entire Western world owes total political obedience to the Pope. And good news, everyone, you're all you know, you're all in a state of heresy and mortal sin. I, the convert, have discovered it. So there's there has to be some kind of balance. Look. And I don't think anybody strikes it perfectly. I became a Catholic as a teenager because my family did. So I think of myself as being in the unusual position of being neither a cradle Catholic nor a true adult convert. But maybe, you know, maybe a bridge sometimes between between the two categories. But we have I think what's definitely true is that the, the pluralism of the world, the fact that the church exists in a highly competitive and fractured religious landscape, inevitably spills over into the internal life of the church. And you have arguments among Catholics at a pitch, including arguments that implicate the Holy Father himself. I've made some of these arguments myself in the past, maybe sometimes unwisely, right, that, you know, that are different from the kind of arguments that Catholics were having in the Catholic culture of 1957 or so. And there's a real temptation in that to sort of go too far and end up, you know, sort of failing at charity in profound ways. And just when I think about my own writing on the church, I sort of move back and forth between periods of intense engagement. And then I'm like, all right, this has gone a little bit too far. And maybe it's bad for my spiritual life. And I sort of pull back and but, but you're always you're always trying to find that balance because the church, a divided church is worth fighting over, right? You have to be willing to have fights and not just pretend to unity like we're all in the Communist Party and in 1937, and we're getting handed a handed a line that we all have to obey. It doesn't doesn't work quite like that. Catholicism is always somewhat contested, but I'm not giving you a full answer. I'm just saying you're always trying to find the right balance between sort of submitting your will and intellect and using your will and intellect in zones where things are uncertain and contested. &gt;&gt; It's a good reminder for us all. And finally, Ross, here we are, marking the first month of Pope Leo's pontificate. So if you had to look so far, what are the three words you would use to describe Pope Leo the 14th? &gt;&gt; I would describe him as so far unifying, charming, and I'm going to append a adjective so it'll be four words, but mildly inscrutable, which I think is also has been sort of part of the reason he was elected pope in the first place. There is still a hint of mystery to who the Pope definitively is and what he definitively thinks, and there may be a long period of time where that mystery gradually unfolds in the life of the church. &gt;&gt; Well, we're grateful for your voice along the way. Ross Douthat, author of Believe Why Everyone Should Be Religious. &gt;&gt; Everyone, everyone, everyone. Thank you, thank you." />

AND THE RESPONSE TODAY TAKEN FROM PSALM 103 SPEAKS ABOUT THE IMMENSITY OF GOD'S MERCY, AND THIS IS FURTHER REVEALED IN TODAY'S GOSPEL WHEN THE RISEN LORD REINSTATES PETER AFTER HE DENIED HIM THREE TIMES. ON HOLY THURSDAY NIGHT, PETER HAD BEEN CONFIDENT IN HIS OWN STRENGTH WHEN CHRIST SAID YOU WILL ALL FALL AWAY BECAUSE OF ME THIS NIGHT. PETER RESPONDED NO THEY ALL FALL AWAY BECAUSE OF YOU, I WILL NEVER FALL AWAY. AND EVEN WHEN OUR LORD FORETOLD THAT PETER WOULD DENY HIM THREE TIMES, PETER RESPONDED THAT IF I MUST DIE WITH YOU, I WILL NOT DENY YOU. AND AS THE LORD SAID THE SPIRIT IS WILLING, BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK. PETER EXPERIENCED THAT AND IS RECOGNIZED AS THE DISCIPLE OF CHRIST IN THE COURTYARD AFTER THE LORD HAD BEEN ARRESTED. AND ST. LUKE TELLS US AFTER PETER DENIED THE LORD, JESUS LOOKED AT HIM AND HIS GLANCE CUT PETER TO THE HEART. HE WENT OUT AND WEPT BITTERLY. AFTER THE RESURRECTION, THE APOSTLES WERE FILLED WITH GREAT JOY WHEN THEY BEHELD THE RISEN LORD. THE LORD EVEN TOLD AN ACCOUNT OF WHEN THEY RECOGNIZED THE LORD FROM THE SHORE, PETER JUMPED INTO THE SEA. HE WANTED TO BE THERE WITH THE LORD. AND PERHAPS PETER STILL STRUGGLED INTERIORLY BECAUSE HE WAS ACUTELY AWARE OF HIS SIN. ESPECIALLY AFTER HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NEVER DENY THE LORD. AND THE LORD IN HIS GREAT MERCY RESTORES PETER WITH CONFIDENCE. AS PETER HAD DENIED THE LORD THREE TIMES, NOW HE IS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPENT FROM HIS FAULT. IN EACH OF THESE THREE QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES, THE LORD DOES NOT REJECT PETER BUT RESTORES THAT FRIENDSHIP AND CONFIDENCE IN TWO WAYS: FIRST, HE ENTRUSTS A VERY IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY TO HIM. TO FEED HIS LAMBS, TO TEND TO HIS SHEEP, TO FEED HIS SHEEP. THIS IS HOW PETER SHOWED HIS LOVE FOR THE LORD BY DIRECTING AND TEACHING THE FAITHFUL THAT IS THE FLOCK OF CHRIST TO CARRY OUT THIS MISSION ENTRUSTED TO HIM. IT WOULD DEMAND AND REQUIRE A GREAT LOVE FOR CHRIST AND THE FAITHFUL. ST. ANTHONY OF PADULA COMMENTING ON THIS TASK, ENTRUSTED BY THE LORD WOULD SAY, FEED THEM WITH THE WORDS OF YOUR PREACHING. FEED THEM WITH THE HELP OF YOUR DEVOUT PRAYERS. FEED THEM WITH THE EXAMPLE OF A GOOD LIFE. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE LORD SAYS FEED MY LAMBS, TEND TO MY SHEEP, FEED MY SHEEP. THEY BELONG TO THE LORD ULTIMATELY. WE BELONG TO THE LORD, ST. AUGUSTINE WOULD SAY LET US THEREFORE NOT LOVE OURSELVES BUT HIM AND FEEDING HIS SHEEP LET US SEEK THE THINGS OF CHRIST, NOT OUR OWN. SECONDLY, OUR LORD FORETELLS PETER'S MARTYRDOM THAT PETER WILL LOVE CHRIST SACRIFICIALLY EVEN TO THE POINT OF LAYING DOWN HIS LIFE. HE SAID YOU WILL STRETCH OUT YOUR HANDS AND THEY WILL LEAD YOU WHERE YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO. ST. JOHN ADDS THIS NOTE IN HIS GOSPEL TO SHARE THAT PETER'S DEATH, HIS MARTYRDOM WOULD GLORIFY GOD. HE SAID THIS SIGNIFYING BY WHAT KIND OF DEATH HE WOULD GLORIFY GOD. AND THEN PETER TO BE STRENGTHENED ALONG WITH THE OTHER APOSTLES AT PENTECOST IN ORDER TO BE STRENGTHENED TO PERSEVERE TO THE END. AND HOW WOULD PETER'S DEATH GLORIFY GOD AS ST. JOHN WOULD STATE. FIRST OF ALL, HE DIED FOR THE TRUTH OF THE FAITH AND FOR THE GOSPEL. HIS MARTYRDOM PROVED THE TRUTH THAT HE PREACHED. NO ONE WOULD DIE FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY KNEW WAS FALSE. HE HAD BEEN WITH THE LORD AND SEEN THE LORD BEFORE AND AFTER HIS RESURRECTION. HE WAS WILLING TO DIE FOR THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL. AND PETER DIED FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST, FOR THE LOVE OF OUR GOD MADE INCARNATE. OUR GOD MADE INCARNATE. WHAT IS MORE GLORIOUS THAN TO DIE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. PETER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GLORIFY GOD BY DYING IN THE SAME MANNER BY CRUCIFIXION. PETER WAS CRUCIFIED UPSIDE DOWN AFTER HE PROTESTED HE WAS NOT WORTHY TO DIE AS CHRIST. AND WHAT CAN BE LEARNED FROM THIS GOSPEL ACCOUNT? ONE THING THAT WE LEARN FROM THIS IS THAT PETER WASN'T THE ONLY ONE WHO EVER DENIED OR OFFENDED THE LORD. WE CAN LEARN FROM SAINT PETER TO HUMBLY AND HONESTLY ADMIT OUR SINS AND WEAKNESSES TO THE LORD. WE SEE THAT PETER WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND DISTRESSED. HE WAS WELL-AWARE OF HIS WEAKNESS. LIKEWISE, IT CAN BE UNCOMFORTABLE FOR US TO REPENT, TO ADMIT OUR SINS, AND TO CONFESS THEM. BUT IN CONFESSION, THE LORD RECONCILES, HEALS, STRENGTHENS AND ENCOURAGES US. PETER'S ENCOUNTER WITH CHRIST ALSO PROBABLY HELPED HIM TO SYMPATHIZE WITH THE WEAKNESS OF OTHERS AND TO REMEMBER THE LORD'S MERCY WHEN HE HIMSELF HAD FALLEN. WE ARE CALLED TO BE MERCIFUL TO OTHERS. AND IF GOD HAS BEEN SO MERCIFUL TO ME OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, HOW CAN I FAIL TO FORGIVE SOMEONE ELSE WHO HAS OFFENDED ME? SAINT PETER WOULD ALSO BE MORE CAUTIOUS IN THE FUTURE REGARDING RESPONDING RATIONALLY AND TRUSTING TOO MUCH IN HIMSELF AND IN HIS OWN STRENGTH. WE SEE THIS IN HIS RESPONSE TO THE LORD'S QUESTION, DO YOU LOVE ME MORE THAN THESE? HE DIDN'T DARE SAY YES, LORD, I LOVE YOU MORE THAN ALL THESE. BECAUSE HE WAS JUST, AGAIN, WELL AWARE OF HIS OWN WEAKNESS. BUT HE RESPONDS YES, LORD, YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU. I DON'T KNOW THE HEARTS OF THESE OTHER PEOPLE. THEY MIGHT LOVE YOU MORE THAN I DO, BUT I DO LOVE YOU. THAT WAS A HUMBLE RESPONSE. HIS FAULTS AND HIS WEAKNESSES MADE HIM HUMBLE BUT NOT DISTRUSTFUL OF THE LORD AND HIS GOODNESS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REMINDED BY TODAY'S GOSPEL THAT IT WAS THE LORD WHO TOOK THE INITIATIVE IN RESTORING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PETER AND HIMSELF. IT WAS CHRIST WHO STARTED THE CONVERSATION ASKING PETER THREE TIMES IF HE LOVED HIM. SIMILARLY, IT'S CHRIST WHO TAKES THE INITIATIVE IN RESTORING OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM AFTER A FALL. IT MIGHT BE THAT PROMPTING IN OUR HEARTS TO REPENT AND MAKE A GOOD CONFESSION. LORD, THE GOOD SHEPHERD, SEEKS US OUT AND LOVINGLY INVITES US TO REPENT AND TO RETURN TO HIM. TO BE RECONCILED TO HIM. AND ANOTHER CONSIDERATION IS TO ASK OURSELVES HOW WE WOULD RESPOND IF OUR LORD ASKED US RIGHT NOW TODAY, DO YOU LOVE ME? HOW DO WE SHOW OUR LOVE FOR THE LORD? IS IT SEEN IN OUR LIFE OF DAILY PRAYER? IS IT SEEN IN OUR FULFILLING TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY OUR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES? IN THE WAY THAT WE INTERACT WITH OTHERS THE WAY THAT WE TREAT THEM? IS IT SEEN IN HOW WE RESPOND TO THE CROSSES THAT COME OUR WAY? DO WE EMBRACE THEM OR DO WE FLEE FROM THEM? IT WAS ABOUT A WEEK OR SO AGO, THAT WE CELEBRATED ST. PHILIP NERI. AND HE SAID IF WE RUN FROM THE CROSS, IF WE DON'T EMBRACE THE CROSS, WE ARE GOING TO GET A HEAVIER ONE. SO WE WANT TO EMBRACE THE CROSS-THAT'S A WAY OF SHOWING OUR LOVE FOR THE LORD. TO TAKE UP OUR CROSS EACH DAY. IN THE CONCLUSION OF TODAY'S GOSPEL, JESUS TOLD PETER VERY SIMPLY, FOLLOW ME. THAT IS A CALL THAT IS DIRECTED TO EACH OF US AS WELL! FOLLOW ME." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="now that drama was playing out just as President Trump welcomed the German Chancellor Friedush Mets to Washington the two leaders held a cordial chat in the Oval Office trading compliments in front of reporters but serious issues like the war in Ukraine and Trump's tariffs loomed large as Donald Trump prepared to welcome Friedick Matz to the White House many wondered how the German leader would navigate the US president's now notorious fireside chats but the pair seemed to strike a friendly tone from their first handshake president Trump your message to the people of Germany and their Oval Office meeting quickly proved cordial rather than combative with Mertz gifting Trump a copy of his German-born grandfather's birth certificate and Trump sharing mixed praise first of all I'm glad to meet because I've been dealing with the chancellor and he's very uh uh a very good man to deal with he's difficult I would say can I say that it's a positive go ahead you wouldn't want me to say you're easy right no no he's he's a very great representative of Germany i think I guess you could say the meeting played out in front of watching press with Trump dominating much of the conversation mets mostly watched from the sidelines but focused on Ukraine during the few times he spoke we both agree on on this war and how terrible this war is going on and we are both looking for uh ways to stop it very soon and uh I I told the president before we came in that he is the key person in the world who can really do that now by putting pressure on Russia trump was reluctant to single Russia out as the aggressor in the war offering this analogy this is a very good basis for but sometimes you see two young children fighting like crazy they hate each other and they're fighting in a park and you try and pull them apart they don't want to be pulled sometimes you're better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart and I gave that analogy to Putin yesterday it's not a view Mertz is likely to share but he refrained from any public disagreements the pair no doubt had plenty to chew over at a brief working lunch after their Oval Office discussion mertz later declared he was quote extremely satisfied with the meeting a German meetup could be on the cards next with Trump accepting Mertz's invite to visit a date has yet to be decided on well DW's chief political editor Michella Kufner traveled with the German Chancellor to Washington she's just gotten back and joins me here at the studio good to see you Michella what is your biggest takeaway from this trip look this was a success so much could have gone wrong um as the accompanying press on the way there we were all debating what could possibly go wrong he wasn't even challenged on the status of the far-right AFD party here in Germany which in parts is seen as extreme right um that's where JD Vance uh the US vice president who was also in the room uh in the past has attacked Germany and we saw comments like um drop the firewall that it's not really democratic that Germanyy's heading towards a tyranny so everybody was almost amazed that nothing went off the rails which in itself was a success and then he did manage to score a few points um on on Ukraine but also on trade so I did get to ask him what his takeaway was let's just take a listen yeah this is my takeaway from today he is really willing to have an agreement on trade and if we could achieve that within a foreseeable period of time we would have achieved much more than former governments on both sides of the Atlantic did so this is a real great opportunity michelle watching uh Friedrich Mets and Donald Trump in the Oval Office they seem to have a bit of a good rapport a bit of a chemistry i wondered if you if you notice that and if if that somehow translate into a new era of the relationship between Germany and the United States i think era is a very big word um we don't really have a concrete outcome are the tariffs going to get dropped no um was there some at least verbal commitment to try and seek an agreement and Donald Trump himself was on the record saying um he believes there would be an agreement otherwise there would be tariffs but there could be an agreement so that in itself in Trump world is progress uh that is a willingness to sit sit down and work things out also they debated at or spoke at length um about Ukraine um did manage to engage Donald Trump on the fact that it is Russia striking civilian targets as well and Ukraine being very limited to military targets so there's a distinction now in this conversation that was publicly held we also learned that it became a lot more detailed of course over lunch um also those historic references um was very grateful he said thank you many times and at the same time then had the mass message packed within that that once again it was down to the United States to be able to stop a war so clearly um they speak the same language because um Matt also comes from a business background are they on the same page no but at least they can talk about it and Fatz did walk out of there with a feeling that whenever Trump wants to call Europe that he will probably be the one who gets that call first yeah interesting um but I mean we've just spent the first part of this program um talking about this feud that's now broken out uh between the US president and Elon Musk um this was essentially that relationship was imploding as this meeting was happening you had Elon Musk tweeting furiously about did this somehow overshadow uh Mat's visit did it take away from that um as as as this was happening well there was no expectation on the German side within the German team that they would be the absolute center of attention in Washington um the United States is traditionally one can say um very much engaged with its own politics internal politics more so than many other countries so I don't I didn't get the sense that there was a feeling that there should have been more attention on that but it also illustrated so much to all of us that what is keeping European leaders up at night which is the trade issue and particularly Ukraine is not keeping Donald Trump up at night it's his dealings with his own Congress he's now starting to see um movements across the aisle who want to help out Ukraine he made very clear that it will always have to come down to his own decision and there's criticism of Donald Trump and there's this very very public fallout with Elon Musk and that's where he now has to do some um public disaster management of his own so it's a it's only part of what um he thinks about um all day and the German side the Europeans don't really have many illusions on that but now they have a better way of communicating and only Donald Trump's next actions really tell us how much of a success that meeting really was all right Michella as always thanks very much for that that's our chief political editor Michella Kua just back from Washington thanks for that Michella let's get more on this from our chief political correspondent Nina Hazer hi Nina what did Matt get out of his meeting with Trump well here in Germany the chancellor is getting a lot of applause for how he handled the meeting from all sides by the way even from the opposition Green Party and you do have to keep in mind that Mets had been bracing for a bus stop and uh it was obvious that his team had clearly watched all the videos from other oval office scenes especially the shouting match with Ukrainian President Vadimir Zilinski you'd had Vice President JD Vance's speech in Munich earlier this year attacking Berlin's democratic standards and Marco Rubio's recent comments that Germany was acting like a tyranny so there was none of that and Mets came out of the meeting unscathed and that in itself is considered a huge success here so Matts did not do a lot of the talking we did a rough calculation and Trump spoke for roughly 90% of the time matt's roughly 10% but when Matts did talk he managed to place a few of the messages that he thought were important trump talked about Ukraine and Russia like two kids fighting on the playground we just saw that again and Matt then said later that it's Russia that attacks civilian targets and that Ukraine doesn't do that and only attacks military targets so slight nuances that Mets try to get into the conversation here his goal is obviously to keep Trump interested and engaged in European security it was their first encounter and what's clear now is that from now on Trump may in fact call Frizz if ever he wants to speak to the Europeans and of course it's unsatisfying for Germany the world's third largest economy to see so clearly that this was not a meeting of two equals but Mer did accept that subservient role to build up a working relationship with the US president and Nina the German chancellor was there just as Trump's relationship with Elon Musk was imploding how did that impact the meeting many analysts are now in agreement they say it was a stroke of luck formed to achieve exactly that to not essentially um fall into any traps that would have been placed potentially um by the people in the Oval Office and the focus of DC journalists from US broadcasters was very much on domestic issues and you have to keep in mind that a major point of contention um between the US and Germany had been Trump admin the Trump administration's support for the German farright AFD party and that didn't come up in front of the media um this time around and also JD Vans remained silent and it just seemed to all the observers that they had other issues on their minds all right that's DW's Nita Hazer thank you" />

much CU I know I'm not bragging here but I had the honor to meet car she stayed at my house and when you started this song I said go how was she going to do this you made me forget about her version you made so much your own with so much feeling and the and and the the color of your voice is unique and you're a very very very special person my darling you are than you so much you sold us a complete dummy didn't you I mean yeah I'm all right yeah I might do okay I could see you were nervous and I was thinking this probably isn't going to be very good and and then you started singing and this is how people should sing this is proper proper singing has someone ever told you that you couldn't do this yes okay I could see you were nervous and I was thinking yeah I bet you somebody at some point has said to you you haven't got a great voice or nothing's going to ever happen and boy did you prove that person wrong and that's what that Golden Buzzer is is all about a Bruno brilliant and you are a little star thank you so much get the [Applause] goal so good yeah excellent really good superb absolutely superb that was great you're the best how did it feel I don't even know what to

mirror hang she can sing and dance yeah she can sing and you are I mean it's just ridiculous how how much talent you have the voice that came out of you I was stunned at Kelly what did you think I just thought you were incredible I just didn't expect that voice to come out such a tiny little thing you were absolutely beautiful and lovely we've seen lots of children on this show in three three series now I have never heard any of them sing as well as you that's a great compliment let's go to somebody who I know loves this kind of thing oh Holly Holly Holly let me tell you what I didn't like Holly I didn't like what you were wearing cuz you came over as just a typical little girl who wants to be a ballerina I wasn't crazy about the song then I heard you sing and I think Holly you've got a fantastic voice I do the fact that you don't know how good you are is what I really like about you but I think this might just be the tip of the iceberg with you cuz I think you're better than that but now's the important part Amanda yes or no utterly brilliant yes okay one yes Kelly definitely yes yes it's three from me which leaves Simon OE you are sailing through to the next round [Applause]

I'd play with him other parents would say can you come into my kids' room and play so I'd end up just going around the w was just playing for the kids that's so cool what an amazing thing to be able to bring a smile because of all those faces they made me think maybe I should give the whole music thing a go so this is why I'm here today and Beth are you going to sing a cover or an original song um I'm singing an original song good um it's it's a difficult job and part of processing a lot of the things that happen on the ward um I I write songs so the song I've written today um is about what I've learned from from my patients and their families I'm not a parent myself but I've got a snapshot of what it's like to love a child um so that's what inspired this song good for you take a deep

from from Brooklyn New York is that right yes so why Britain's Got Talent most of my favorite singers are from the UK so I thought I'd come pay a visit to you guys okay so Lauren tell me a bit about you uh I think some of you guys have actually heard my voice but you don't know my face um I sang the song Never Enough on the greatest showman oh my God oh my God blue mind oh my God so I was hired to do the reference vocals for the actresses so they could learn the songs and so they had me come in and sing Never Enough and it really was Rebecca Ferguson who plays Jenny Lind who said I think that Lauren should sing the song and I'll lip sying so you've sang one of the biggest songs of all time you've now revealed it wasn't the actress who sang the song in the movie it was you singing that song so why didn't you get that big deal after the song I was more comfortable singing behind the scenes but I feel kind of like the song was meant for me and I'm I'm kind of ready to put a face to the song so I'm here to do that are you going to sing that tonight yes s a great thing to watch Good Luck here we go breath [Music] go I'm trying to hold my breath let it stay this way can't let this moment end you set a dream in me getting loud now can you hear it [Music] echoing take my hand will you share this with me is Starling without [Music] you all the shine of a thousand spotlights all

          <attvalue for="7" value="Hi there. I'm Caitríona Perry, and this is The Global Story. At the height of the Covid 19 pandemic the working world went through a revolution. Workers, particularly white collar office workers, were ordered to work from home to stop the spread of the virus, and it seemed like a permanent change. Hybrid working has remained incredibly popular years after the Covid lockdowns were lifted. But now more and more companies are ordering employees back to work. And many employers have slammed working from home as inefficient and bad for the bottom line. So is the work from home revolution over now? Joining me from London is the BBC's employment correspondent, Zoe Conway. Hello. And also with me, Nick Bloom, an economist at Stanford University in the US, who has studied the effect that all of this is having on productivity. Hey there. Great to have you both with us today. Now, before we go any further, I just want to establish the status here. Are you working from home or in the office? Nick. You first. I'm actually at home. Although I have to say, for me, it's 8:00 in the morning, so I am going in later. But right now, yes, this is the spare bedroom. But ordinarily you're in the office full time? When I teach. So I teach obviously students because I'm at Stanford. That's definitely in person. Big meetings is in person, but I do spend a couple of days a week on zoom taking calls, working from home. And what about you, Zoe? I'm definitely at the BBC today. I like coming into the office. Actually, I work with a team of incredibly clever, interesting, and funny people, and I like the camaraderie of the office. But I travel around the UK for work quite a lot as well, so I don't really work from home. Okay, so we've established where you both stand on the working from home. I obviously am not working from home. Can't be a presenter and work from home unfortunately, although I did suggest it from time to time during the pandemic. But before the pandemic I was working here in the US and I mean, it was really very rare in this country that you would have encountered anyone really working from home. Nick, are there certain countries or certain industries that have always had this tradition of remote working or working from home? Yeah, so tech has always been pretty work from home friendly. So you can think of if you're on a keyboard using computers, you often don't need to be in the office. You know, it's also actually interesting that a lot of English speaking countries, it's not clear why, but you're right. Northern Europe, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand have been pretty high. We tend to see the lowest levels in Asia. So there are big international differences. So Asia you know typically back in the office pretty much full time, but northern Europe, US, we still see tech, some finance working from home two or three days a week. But of course, everything changed for everyone, didn't it? In the spring of 2020, with the arrival of this thing we'd never heard of before. Covid 19 and the pandemic and how that changed everything at that time. Governments rushing to announce stay at home orders, lockdowns to try and keep everyone away from each other and limit the number of infections. It was a crucial step, we were told at the time, to keep the hospitals from getting overloaded and to get everyone safe, and suddenly employers had to adapt to a situation where their employees could not come into work. So tell us a little bit about that transition. Who was working from home and who wasn't, and what did it all mean for people? It was the most incredible adjustment for so many of us. There were all these forms of technology we'd never used before, whether it's zoom calls or team chats that some of us are still fairly useless at using. certainly in my unit, Everyone still mutes themselves. Everyone seems to be on mute. So it was an incredible adjustment. And I think what we're seeing in many cases in the UK are people who have learnt that they can be very productive at home and that they can juggle it very successfully with, you know, perhaps raising a young family or looking after elderly relatives. And so there's a lot more flexibility that we're seeing. But I think there's still a huge amount of uncertainty here in the UK about whether we're going to see a big switch back. Because as well as having more time with your family and your children. I mean, there are other benefits for people from working from home as well. Financially commuting time. Tell us a bit about those. We went to Bank underground station. Now that is right in the heart of the city in London. It's the sort of place where you're going to see a lot of people very smartly dressed, walking incredibly fast to get to their law firm or their bank where they work. And we went on a Thursday morning and we went again on a Friday morning during rush hour. And there was a big drop in numbers. And the data shows that now on a Friday, if you go to Bank underground station, you'll see that the commuters are roughly at just just over half what they were before the pandemic. So a big drop. Nick, on that point, I mean, individuals might save because they can make their lunch at home. They're not spending on fuel for their cars, train tickets and so on. But what's been the economic impact on businesses from this situation where people are working from home? Well, there's two ways to look at it. Mostly for businesses hybrid, which is when you come in, say two or three days a week and work from home two or three days a week, it's actually pretty profitable, and it's why it's stuck. It's why if you look at the Fortune 500. So these are the largest 500 companies in the world. 80% of them are on hybrid because it makes them a lot of money. And why is that? Well, if you look at the research, if you work from home a couple of days a week, it doesn't really seem to damage productivity. So, yes you need to be in for mentoring, for connectivity, for building culture, for innovating. But by the time you're coming in three days a week, it looks like you kind of have your fill. And the other two days are good for quiet time and for recharging without a commute. So productivity is not affected. What businesses gain is turnovers a lot lower. So in one study we published actually last year in Nature, you see quit rates fall by about a third. And you know you can see why like folks are like 'I really like working from home a couple of days a week. I'm less likely to change jobs.' And for businesses, that saves them an enormous amount of money because every person that quits, you've got to go out. You've got to re-interview, rehire. And has that passion been replicated across the world? This moved from a full time working from home to that hybrid model you're talking about. If you look at Southern Europe and Asia, take Tokyo. There's very little working from home going on. So Tokyo is kind of unchanged. It's a weird world, you know, in 2019, these cities look similar. Suddenly, five years later, you know, six years later, we've now seen a surge of work from home in much of Europe and the US, and pretty much everyone's return to the office in Asia. And so what has that meant for how people might move between jobs if you can potentially be working from home for a company that is no longer based in your town or in a nearby city, as may have been the case in the past when you sought employment adjacent to where you live. I think there has been a shift in terms of the balance of power that when you apply for a job, it has become the norm to ask for flexible working, or certainly more normalized and to expect it. Zoe is exactly right. It's funny talking to recruiters. They said, look, pre-pandemic, if you're recruiting folks, you tell them about the salary and obviously the role, but they're always going to ask about the perks. And, you know, there's the big two, which is pension and is there any kind of health care plan. Now they said, look, it's the big three. Pension, health care plan and work from home. And so yes, it's become a critical part of recruitment. Then normal numbers that I hear from recruiters I see in research is 8%. So folks say look, if I can be hybrid, you know, I'll accept basically 8% less pay to be hybrid versus come in the office five days a week. So you can twist it around and say, if you're a boss and you want your folks in five days a week, you have to pay people basically 8% more. So what are the major negatives that have been reported to you from employers? We went and interviewed the CEO of a record label in East London, and he set up this company himself. It's his baby, and he has a lot of young staff. And it's interesting because he's been allowing his young workers to be at home coming in for two days a week, and he's now asked them to come back in for three days a week. I can't help but have this nagging feeling that sort of continual remote working has affected our bottom line. It's his business, and he feels that it's the kind of industry where people can and should be networking, should be part of this team. Not just in spirit, but but physically together sharing ideas. And I think he also wonders about what effect it's having on the mental health of his young workforce to be at home too much of the time. You know, I firmly believe that the music industry is all about relationships. And so the one single way to really, for any of us to be able to build those kind of meaningful relationships is to do it in person. Perhaps for him, it's a bit of a slight sense of loss of control that he just doesn't quite know what everybody's up to. Which I think he might feel is a bit of a disadvantage. And he found it difficult to just be communicating via, you know, video conferencing. So I think there are some disadvantages that he would say. Do those arguments extend out to the point where the whole economy would benefit from everyone being back at work, what did you find? For an in-depth bit of reporting for the BBC that I've been doing in recent weeks, we spoke to Lord Stuart Rose, and he used to run two of the biggest retailers in the UK, supermarkets called Marks and Spencers and Asda, and he came out very strongly in favour of people coming in for most of the time. People who drive trains have to go to work. People who work in operating theatres have to go to work. People who work in service industries like retail have to go to work and others don't. Well, you know, what's different? They have children, they have problems. They have issues. You deal with it. And what he said to us was that he just thinks it's really bad for productivity in the UK. It's really bad for economic growth in the UK if people are spending too much time working from home. Do you want to jump in there with your stats and research? There's a number of folks who can only work if they're allowed to work from home. So we see in the data that employment of folks with a disability, people looking after young kids, folks close to retirement, has been surging post-pandemic. And this is, you know, hundreds of thousands of millions of people literally, who can work. And if they're working, they're paying taxes, providing goods and services for the rest of us. And that's a win win. So actually, I think these are typically, you know, kind of older in their career CEOs, typically men, if you look in the data who are very against work from home, you know, they're judging on their experience. That might have been right 20 or 30 years ago, but in 2025, it's actually good for the economy. And that's interesting that there are certain jobs that can only be done in the workplace, but there are certain people who can only work if they're at home. And it's sort of setting up a bit of a divide between workers. I mean, just to to broaden it out a little bit. We heard Elon Musk, of course, aide to President Trump and billionaire businessman tell CNBC recently that not only did he think working from home made people less productive. He also thought it was a symbol of class division between white collar and blue collar workers to use those terms. Nick, what do you make of that argument? Well, you know, Musk's views are really problematic. So I'll give you an example. There's someone I was speaking to last week who a couple of years ago, broke their neck in an accident. And so he used to be, you know, pretty senior exec. Poor guy is now basically disabled from the neck down. And he said, look, if I've got to go into work, it takes me about three hours and I was like three hours? He said, yeah, my carer has to get me up, wash me, get me dressed, take me to the car. And then my dad would normally drive me into work. He said if I can work from home, it's about 20 minutes. Now, this is someone that's highly productive. If you force someone like that to come into work every day, he said, to be honest, I'd probably stop working. And so the Musk view of trying to turn it into a crusade to force everyone back to the office is going to lose folks like that. People with young kids, folks close to retirement and is a loss to all of us. You know, if there are more people working and paying taxes, it's less taxes for the rest of us to pay. Nick, why do you think this has become such a politically charged issue? I mean, it's almost a cultural issue here in the US. And obviously, as we've been talking about, it's a huge issue in the UK at the moment now as well. Politics comes into everything eventually. Unfortunately, and politics has come into work from home. It's pretty natural in a sense, because if you look at who can and who can't work from home. So think about who can work from home. They tend to be university educated folks. They tend to be professionals, managers. They're higher earners. You know, they tend to have a certain type of politics. And at the other end, who can't work from home tend to be they're more likely to be frontline service workers. Maybe they left school at 16 or 17. They're lower earning. Certainly in the US. that group tends to vote for Trump. And as a result, if you're Trump or Musk, your vote base is people that can't work from home. And it's appealing to then ban work from home because it appeals to the base. You know, if you can kind of poke in the eye the other half of the population, it's a win for your base. So you tend to see populist parties that tend to appeal to lower income, more kind of frontline service workers, frontline workers. They tend to be against work from home. And if you look at parties that tend to have more university educated people that have office jobs, they tend to be more supportive of work from home. And, you know, sadly, that's nothing about whether it's good or bad. It really just predicts who votes for these politicians and politicians know who their voters are and they appeal to them. And I suppose the other side of things, though really is that some countries are actually taking steps to make remote working part of workers' rights or workers' entitlements. Spain has guaranteed the right to flexible arrangements. Last year, Ireland made a legal right to request to work remotely, and the UK government is including the right to work from home in an upcoming bill. So there are places where working from home, the right, is being protected, aren't there? That's right. In the UK, the Employment Rights Bill is going through Parliament right now. It's due to become law in June. But the critical question is how this is going to be implemented, because there's something that's going to have to be worked out, a code of practice over the next year or so. And that means there's going to be yet more consultation. And there is concern by campaigners who want to see more flexibility, that business is going to lobby government hard and reduce the amount of working from home that's made possible by employers. So I think it's really still up for grabs and the government at the moment is desperate to prove to business that its number one priority is economic growth. So I think it's a bit unclear at the moment exactly how this legislation is going to be implemented, how it's going to work, and whether it is actually going to increase flexibility at work, whether it's really going to lead to an increase in the number of people working from home. Okay, so final question. After all that we have been discussing here, what do you both think the future of work will look like? Will hybrid work be as popular ten years, even five years from now as it is as we're talking today? Nick, what's your final thought on this? So working from home is going to follow a Nike swoosh. So you know it dropped from 2021 - 2022. It fell pretty clearly. It's now in the flat bit. We can see in the data. It's not really changed for the last year and a half. Long run, it's up. So you know 2030 work from home is going to be higher than it is now. Why is that? Three drivers. One is companies have office leases and they last typically 10, 15 years as they expire. Companies think, oh, now's a good time to downsize. And we've been seeing that. Two is younger CEOs, younger firms tend to be more remote. And as current CEOs kind of age out, retire and replaced by younger folks, they're more sympathetic. And finally, actually most importantly is technology. I'm in my 50s. I grew up in the UK in the early 70s, and both my parents worked for the British government, actually. And I remember as a kid, one of four kids, occasionally my mum or dad would have to work from home because there'd be something, I would be sick off school or something. And I was talking to them the other day and my mum was saying like, it was terrible. You'd have to be carrying in the 80s piles of paper home you could phone in to work, but it's really expensive. And technology's just got ever better. So in the 90s we had computers. We then got the internet, cloud, you know, video calls, all of this stuff. If you look 2030, it's probably going to look like the Star Wars Jedi Council with holograms and amazing headsets, and it's just going to be easier to work remotely. So what do you think? Where will working from home or hybrid working be in ten years, say, from now? I think there's a really interesting question about what do companies in this country really think about working from home? How many CEOs think like Lord Rose? But don't say so publicly. I say that because working in the business unit here at the BBC, you hear things and I've been talking to colleagues about this, and they think there are probably more chief executives out there that want their workers back in more, possibly back in full time than are actually letting on. We do hear that anecdotally in the business unit. So I think there's a bit of a question there about how the chief executives of our biggest companies think about this. But I also think there's another question in terms of what this is going to look like in, let's say, five years time. And that's just the state of the economy, the state of the labour market. It's a supply and demand thing at the moment. Workers seem to have more power to demand these things. But let's say there's an uptick in unemployment. Let's say it's harder to find work. Will that balance shift back towards employers? And so for those employers that don't want their staff working from home, will it be easier for them to say no because there's a bigger pool of people looking for work? I think those are two things we're just not really clear about at the moment. Fascinating discussion. Thanks to you both for being here. Thank you. Thanks very much for having me.

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] hi everyone welcome to the 700 Club israel has taken a historic step to protect itself from future terrorist attacks and prevent the creation of a Palestinian state right on its borders hamas has reportedly rejected the latest ceasefire offer from the United States that allows Israel to continue to expand its military offensive in Gaza chris Mitchell brings us the story from Jerusalem israeli troops push further into northern Gaza warning civilians to get out of harm's way us Envoy Steve Witkov's ceasefire and hostage deal would reportedly lead to Hamas freeing 10 of the remaining living hostages in the first week of the 60-day ceasefire in exchange Israel would free more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners a major sticking point hamas wants guarantees israel won't return to fighting after the ceasefire but Israel's prime minister says he wants the fighting to resume and continue until Hamas is eliminated in Gaza meanwhile the Israeli government has made an historic decision to approve 22 new communities in the biblical heartland of the Jewish nation Judea and Samaria also known as the West Bank this will help block Palestinians from forming a state in this area and according to Defense Minister Israel Katz it also provides a buffer for the nation security as he put it Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria serves as a vital security barrier for Israel's major population centers we must do everything in our power to expand and reinforce this protective shield it was the first volley in the government's effort to head off another unilateral move for a Palestinian state by some Western powers including France next month France's president at a summit in New York City will push for most of the world to altogether recognize a Palestinian state israeli foreign minister Gedon Sar warned that such a declaration would reward the Hamas terrorists who committed the October 7th atrocities he added &quot;Unilateral moves against Israel will be met with unilateral Israeli measures we will not get any dictates from outside with regard to our national security.&quot; This fits with the foreign minister's statements this week that if outside nations push to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state in Judea and Samaria Israel will respond by declaring sovereignty over more and more of the area all right Chris Mitchell joins us now from Jerusalem a lot to talk about chris how does Israel approving these new settlements help block the creation of a Palestinian state well one of the main things is this uh Andrew it actually creates facts on the ground it it strengthens Israel's claim to the land and what will happen is that more Israelis will be moving and living in Judea and Samaria uh and it would make the withdrawal that happened 20 years ago uh unlikely what happened 20 years ago Andrew is uh what's called the Gaza disengagement uh Israel unilaterally pulled out of Gaza and five communities in northern Samaria that was uh that was as we see right now we see the effects of what happened uh Gaza became one of the biggest terror bases in all of the world and so this is designed to help prevent a Palestinian uh state it's really a strategic shift really historic move uh Andrew away from a two-state solution and the next step as we mentioned in that report maybe declaring sovereignty over Judea and Samaria so what are Israel's biggest concerns about a potential Palestinian state well one of the main concerns Andrew is security and they looked at what happened after the disengagement in 2007 as I mentioned what Gaza became the biggest terror base in the world and then we had tens of thousands of rockets since then and then of obviously what happened on October 7th a Palestinian state would be in the heart of Israel and it would be close to Tel Aviv the Bengorian airport and Jerusalem and people are concerned it could be another terror base uh we also see a terror hub so to speak in places like Nabis and Janine and we also see that after October 7th many of the Palestinians in Judea and Samaria they actually supported October 7th and they believe that if you look at places like Palestinian Media Watch which monitors Palestinian media uh there's really anti-Semitic anti-Israel uh anti-Jewish propaganda almost every day so this marks uh no more uh going back to the Oslo style negotiations and a belief for many that this is really the land promised in the Bible to the Jewish people all right Chris let's talk about the war in Gaza there's a new way to distribute humanitarian aid to the Palestinians there what impact does that have on Hamas well it's a major impact Andrew and actually this is a dramatic uh development and what it does is it bypasses the ability for Hamas to steal the humanitarian aid uh and feed their own terrorists and then actually they often sell it back to the population and they've been doing this since the beginning of the war so what this new humanitarian effort which is called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation it really undermines Hamas's control over the population hamas is warning the people no don't go to these areas and get the humanitarian aid but many are ignoring Hamas uh and so Hamas wants to stop in any negotiations wants to stop this because it really represents a threat to their control uh and to their authority and weakens them dramatically all right Chris while I have you let's talk about another layer in all this there ongoing reports of worries in Israel about a possible Trump administration nuclear deal with Iran what are those concerns Israel has well here uh over here Andrea they don't trust Iran uh Iran violated the uh 2015 JCPOA that was an agreement that was designed to limit Iran's nuclear program and uh over here they believe that a bad deal by the US and Iran would allow Iran to continue to enrich uranium and they believe over here that Iran is committed ideologically and theologically to nuclear weapons part of their belief in the return of the Shiite Messiah the Mahi and they believe diplomacy really is not going to stop Iran uh and while this window continues there seem to be going towards a nuclear weapon an existential threat to Israel all right Chris always appreciate your great reporting thanks for being with us today thanks Andrew all right everyone in other news President Trump has won a victory in court on his top tariffs john Jessup has that story and more from our CBN News Bureau in Washington john that is right Andrew a roller coaster legal battle for the White House over the president's major tariffs over the course of just a day first on Wednesday a three judge panel at the US Court of International Trade block the president from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency powers law the panel ruled the president exceeded his authority with his liberation day tariffs the administration quickly appealed then on Thursday a federal appeals court temporarily halted the trade court's order and allowed the president to continue collecting the tariffs under the law for now the case is expected to go to the Supreme Court well turning now to the spiritual world in a time when churches are closing Christian leaders from across Europe met in Berlin at the European Congress on Evangelism this week not just for conference but for a wake-up call cbn's Brie Carter has that story [Music] you are [Music] Berlin is a city once divided by walls this week Christian leaders from across Europe gathered under one roof united by one mission the gospel has power we're going to reach Europe we need an army an army of evangelists unafraid unashamed unapologetic uncompromising at Berlin's JW Marriott national flags line the walls and at the center of it all a single cross illuminating what's being called Europe's most significant spiritual gathering since Amsterdam in 2000 and a return to the city where Billy Graham launched his global mission in 1966 the city of Berlin has influenced the world in every field what a place from which to shout to the world Christ is the Savior the mission comes as churches close across Europe franklin Graham told CBN News nearly 1,000 churches in Germany closed their doors last year alone he challenged pastors to stand firm and move forward and pastors are responding to that call we have a big job in front of us to reach this generation worship leaders speakers and believers came from 57 countries including Ukraine and Russia where war still rages yet here they stood side by side united in the gospel we want to ignite a fire uh in Europe to where there's an excitement for evangelism the churches are are willing to be bold and not ashamed of the gospel we've got Ukrainian churches coming we have churches coming from Russia you know he said these countries are at war yes they are but the gospel is more powerful than any of that stuff with a renewed mission and shared vision these church leaders now return home ready to share the good news throughout Europe brody Carter CBN News to see thank you Brody well you can get a full rundown of the goals of the European Congress on evangelism by going to our website at cbnnews.com andrew thanks John wasn't that special hearing Billy Graham preached back in ' 66 in that very city and now Franklin carries on the legacy but of course to the Graham family it's more than just about their family it's about empowering people around their world franklin said he says he wants to start a fire and you know that starts in us in second Timothy we read &quot;Fan into flame the gift of God which is in you god has not given you a spirit of fear but of power love and a sound mind.&quot; And we pray that for all those gathered in Berlin this" />

well as the Korea International Cooperation Agency KOA now before we get started with today's activities I would like to kindly invite our director general to give us the key takeaways from day one can we give him a big round of applause engineer Paul Omukunzi so good morning yes I hope you have had a very nice night after the work of yesterday which was so exciting and I hope everyone is happy this morning right wonderful so uh before we look back into what we have done yesterday there is a a small video summarizing what we went through yesterday especially for those ones who were not here I would like to request our technical team to play this video can you play it from the starting point please and It has to be here as well i can see it here but not on the bigger screen i trust this forum will be meaningful to you all and will spark bold ideas and lead to practical forward-looking recommendations it is a great honor to join you at these Rwanda Future Skills Forum 2025 a unique and timely gathering at the intersection of skills innovation and inclusive economic transformation let us move forward boldly practically and together on behalf of the government of Rwanda I thank you for your commitment your collaboration and your belief in a future where skills are a shared responsibility okay that's thank you very much yes uh now as you remember we have had several discussions yesterday so I request that the play presentation that I have prepared for you uh trying to uh remind you what we have discussed and what have been some key uh recommendations and takeaways from various sessions so and as you remember we started with a very nice panel discussion yesterday so because uh everyone was here for the panel you have he had various uh best practices from various countries so I think uh uh everyone has taken notes from that particular session and uh I believe that while we still have probably lot of things to share is uh the messages we got from various workshops they were like parallel sessions it was not pos not not possible for everyone to attend all of them at the same time because they were parallel so now we have u gathered some of the key recommendations from each workshop uh each of you has attended at least two workshops but we have had eight uh workshops and we have put together all the details all the recommendations all the information uh from these various workshops and we shall share some document to every one of you so that you can also take time to uh navigate through them and uh uh try to learn from all the content of these documents so can you please uh put up the presentation technical team so as as they do it uh we have had eight workshops well the first one was on quality uh with a focus to technical and vocational excellence that was workshop number one can I have a pointer or can you go to the next slide if you can i wish I could have a way to do it from here yes uh the second workshop was on relevance especially on private sector engagement in skills uh development and the third one was on inclusion where uh accessible skills ecosystems have been discussed and the next one was on innovation where technology in skills development has been discussed the fifth one was on skills outlook very exciting and the sixth one was on TV and emerging technologies where the seventh one was on future ready and inclusive workforce and the last one was on natural talents to accelerate the innovation ecosystems so these are the workshops we have had yesterday they were so exciting and everyone was like how can I attend all of them at the same time unfortunately it was not possible because uh uh the maximum we could attend was only two workshops so now uh from every workshop we have tried to uh pick like four crucial elements we feel like they can serve as recommendations so but uh all of them were so exciting in such a way that was not easy to uh even to choose what kind of recommendations uh you you could pick but uh for the sake of time uh we have chosen only four from each uh workshop so from the first one uh on quality or technical and vocational excellence so one of the recommendations was to strengthen collaboration among industry government academia and research to achieve excellence and to promote quality assurance diversifying funding and implement innovative models such as farm to fork entrepreneurship focus activate so it was recommended to invest in innovative practices emerging technologies upskilling of trainers and modernized infrastructure to enable hands-on future ready learning lastly uh it was recommended to promote competency based training inclusion and community engagement for relevant sustainable outcomes so these are four recommendations out of quite a good number of other recommendations insight and insights from this particular workshop so the second workshop on quality and technical and vocational uh sorry the second workshop was u on relevance so and uh the four key recommendations were like to foster a strategic trustbased partnerships with the private sector flu shared values co governance and policy alignment and to develop a unified context specific dual strategy that involves all stakeholders and supports gradual and scalable implementation and to ensure sustainable financing by blending public private and donor contributions including training fees and also to promote inclusive governance and equality assurance through code design curricular workplace assessments and institutional capacity uh bullying for the third workshop that one was on relevance so it was on inclusion sorry inclusion and accessible skills ecosystem here the key uh four recommendations will like to use workplace based approaches to link skills training with local enterprise growth especially for micro small and medium enterprises and informal uh sectors and to tailor training to market needs and to promote workbased learning adapted to small businesses environments and to support the integration of returning diaspora or migrant through mentorship ship soft skills training and recognition of foreign qualifications and to strengthen inclusive support systems via community engagement psychological services and national policy alignments the next workshop the fourth one was on innovation it's not working okay it is working now so on this particular one the recommendation was to strengthen industry TV collaboration through co-developed curriculara internships and exposure to emerging technologies such as drones AI and CNC machines and to integrate AI in Tivet as a learning cilot to personalize education to lift teacher burden and to enhance digital uh transformation is the present okay good thank you so and uh it was also recommended to expand training to cover future forecast skills including avionics predictive maintenance and smart wood technologies and to promote inclusion global qualifications and regional exchange while aligning training with national policies and industry standards the fifth uh workshop was on skills outlook and one some of the recommendations were like to develop sector specific skills road maps and align training with priority industries such as manufacturing a grow processing and mining to name a few and to enhance industry TV collaboration through internships apprenhip and workforce programs tied to industry policy to modernize curriculara using labor market data to address skills gaps in ICT logistics and green sectors and finally to promote lifelong learning foundational skills and digital education to futureproof the workforce for industrial uh transformation the next session uh was on TV and emerging technologies and this workshop has recommended to integrate industry 4.0 zero technologies and immersive tools like AI IoT virtual reality interchroof learners and enhance engagement and to strengthen digital infrastructure and address the digital divide to improve access to underserved populations and to promote localized innovation and expand access to smart labs simulations and hands-on techbased training and to nature industry partnerships micro credentials and blended learning for scalable inclusive and flexible skills development the last part one workshop was on TV and was on sorry was on nurturing talents to accelerate the innovation ecosystem so this one has recommended sorry yes this one has recommend to redesign TV to be demandd driven inclusive and competence based with strong industry input and flexible learning pathways and to promote lifelong learning blended delivery and recognition of informal skills to support vulnerable and rural populations and to align curricula with emerging sectors to ensure future workforce relevance and to strengthen governance financing and stake collaboration to drive innovation and responsive reforms the last one uh has also made quite a good number of recommendations one of them is to increase to increase research and development investment flow greater uh public funding and private sector incentives and to strengthen university industry collaboration and establish innovation hubs for commercialization and entrepreneurship and to develop adaptive policies supporting IP protection and inclusivity and sustainable innovation and to build national uh R&amp;D capacity via strategic partnership diaspora engagement and support to higher uh learning institutions so those were uh some of the takeaways and key recommendations from the workshops so there are quite many so we have just picked some of them but as I said we shall share uh like and full report with key highlights and recommendations so which we believe that they can inform being policy makers private sector and other stakeholders uh in skills developments i thank you very much thank you very much indeed to our director general now before we go um to the different activities I believe there's another video to play before we get to know exactly where we are headed for the next activities so I would like to kindly ask our technical team if there is a video to play now hi There you go heat heat heat hey Heat there you go thank you very much that is of course the uh the the exhibition that we'll get a chance to visit this afternoon now to find out where what the uh following activities are for today I would like to kindly call upon Borana to come and explain to us where to go and what to expect thank you very Can we give her a big round of applause please good morning everyone so we try to have a lot of opportunities for networking today and also to delve deeper into some specific topics of technical and vocational education and training and therefore uh there will be two main parallel sessions one is called marketplace which will provide an opportunity for the companies employers and entrepreneurs and our technical schools and colleges and polytenics to get a chance to know each other discuss some opportunities for collaboration services products that our poly techchnics are offering and this will happen in front of Kilimanjaro ballroom at the foyer and the terrace which we have set up for a marketplace unfortunately it started raining so probably uh the marketplace will move inside this morning and some of you yesterday received a sticker on your badges can you please have a look if you have a symbol M M for mother then it means that you are kindly invited to join the marketplace okay you are either a school or a college hosting an exhibition booth or you are a company or an entrepreneur or an employer who is invited to visit our schools and colleges then everyone else probably has another symbol which is from one to eight that's a number these numbers correspond to the roundts that will take place downstairs in the meeting rooms where we were yesterday now today we have eight roundts that are very interesting and we'll delve deeper into some extremely important topics for skills development i will read out the roundts and the moderators but before I do that just to explain that everyone will have a chance to visit each round table is following the world cafe format so please don't think that you would only be able to participate in one round table you will be able to visit them all so round table one would be on governance of TVET this will be moderated by Mr alist Bachin he will be hosting this round table and different groups will be taking turns to discuss specific questions in relation to governance roundt two is curricula this would be moderated by Mr jeanari Muhir he will be the host of the round table and you will have a chance to discuss about TVET content occupational standards curricular development round table three uh which is TVET teachers capacity building and training will be moderated by Miss Maria Ramos she will be the host round table four would be on assessment and this will be moderated by Mr oliver round table five on innovation will be hosted by Dr p Yongabu roundt six will be moderated by Dr anthony Gua some of you have probably been in the workshop yesterday round table seven on academia industry will be moderated by Dr marshall Gyanza and round table eight on dual technical and vocational education and training will be hosted by Miss Christina Vonharak so those of you again who have a number indicating 1 to eight are invited on the floor uh where we were yesterday for the workshops where the number of the room would be indicated on the doors so if you have one on your badge then please visit first the room that's indicating number one our we will have support staff in each room who will kindly invite you to move to the next one when the time comes so don't worry the the only task is to go downstairs and find the the number that's corresponding to the number that you have on your badge and 20 minutes later or half an hour later you will be invited to move to the next room i know there is people who have other symbols on their badges like u maybe VIP or is uh these people are invited to join whichever session they like they could visit the marketplace first and then go to the round table sessions or the other way around or they could be simply networking in any of the spaces that we have available at the hotel and there's one last category of badges which uh I'm sure are at the exhibition but if by any chance someone has a symbol with the letter E that means that you are probably hosting something at the exhibition so if um if if it's okay you can um join everyone else at the exhibition now or you can just stay with us and choose a round table session i hope this is clear i know it's too much information but the idea of today is to network so even though these are some indicative instructions and way we try to organize people in smaller groups so that we can have meaningful discussions and collaborations please feel free to spend more time somewhere where you find there's an interesting topic or if you want to skip a round table and visit the marketplace please don't worry to do so or have your own private conversation with someone who is very uh interesting to you and you are particularly interested to find out more about them it's about networking so that's all from me please uh take a coffee when you're going wherever you're going either at the marketplace or downstairs and we'll see each other again for lunch at 1:00 it would be the same as yesterday you would be given coupons and after lunch we'll go to the expo if it's raining we'll have transport so don't worry about that thank you thank you very much Borana and have a great day and a productive day thank you everyone i think we can proceed from here to where we are needed and we just want to remind everyone we just want to remind everyone that the closing ceremony is at 5 right over here so we'll see you again at 5 for the closing ceremony thank you good morning doesn't" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Musica] allora parliamo di questo libro che abbiamo pubblicato con paper first all'inizio di quest'anno quando improvvisamente si scoprì e l'italia aveva un grosso problema il tav torino lione e avete più sentito parlare naturalmente no come non se ne parlava prima e come probabilmente non se ne parlerà nei prossimi anni perché personalmente sono convinto e quest opera del tutto inutile non si farà mai però come voi ben sapete le grandi opere inutili si rivelano utili per i soldi che fanno girare e quindi anche se non si costruiscono servono ad abbeverare e a sfamare molte fauci del partito degli affari il ponte sullo stretto notoriamente non si farà mai però ci è già costato un miliardo e mezzo voi direte ma non c'è nemmeno la prima pietra o meglio c'è solo la prima pietra è la prima pietra più cara del mondo miliardo e mezzo studi contro studi consulenze uffici inaugurazioni di solito li queste opere vengono inaugurate 12 13 volte e la società ponte sullo stretto è ancora attiva anche se il ponte sullo stretto non si farà mai il tav sarà la stessa cosa non se n'è parlato per molti anni perché tutti davano ormai per scontato che il tav torino lione era archiviato che cos'è il tav torino lione tav è un acronimo il treno ad alta velocità il che la dice lunga sull'intelligenza di quelli che lo chiamano la tav come puoi mettere l'articolo femminile a un sostantivo maschile si è mai capito per quale motivo lo chiamino la tav dicono ma perché è una linea ferroviaria e allora chi ama lo lav se tav le treno e treno è maschile questi dementi si sono fatti l'idea che chiamarlo il tav sia o riduttivo sia mortificante per quel povero treno che ci tiene che non esiste naturalmente no e che però ci tiene a essere chiamato al femminile si sono fatte polemiche anche sul fatto che si deve chiamarlo al femminile il bello è che non c'è nulla di vero in quello che si racconta sul tav torino lione già l'acronimo è falso è già torino lione è falso perché perché non è un treno ad alta velocità è un treno ad alta capacità quindi chi vuole essere preciso lo dovrebbe chiamare tac cosa vuol dire alta capacità vuol dire che il treno ad alta velocità torino lione era nel progetto originario perché negli anni 80 quando è stato pensato 40 anni fa nella prima repubblica c'erano degli di che dicevano che negli anni 90 e negli anni 2000 sarebbe esploso il traffico passeggeri tra l'italia e la francia e che quindi la linea esistente e passa sotto il frejus e che è formata prevalentemente dalle gev e chiunque sia andato da milano da torino a lione o a parigi ha preso il tgv se c'è andato in treno altrimenti uno ceva in aereo bene avrei hanno detto il tgv non regge perché si moltiplicheranno i passeggeri su rotaia poi purtroppo si è scoperto che non solo non aumentavano ma diminuivano colavano a picco e allora dato che non volevano rinunciare alla mangiatoia hanno detto facciamolo per le merci perché ci risulta che negli anni novanta negli anni 2000 ci sarà un boom del traffico merci tra torino e lione tra milano e parigi poi purtroppo non solo non c'è stato il boom c'è stato un crollo del traffico merci oggi sulla linea già esistente il treno torino modane che passa anch'esso sotto il frejus bene su quella su quel treno i container viaggiano vuoti all 80 90 per cento il che vuol dire che non c'è domanda nemmeno per giustificare l'esistenza di quella linea ferroviaria figuratevi se c'è bisogno di una seconda linea ferroviaria per giunta ad alta velocità l'alta velocità e le merci sono un ossimoro nel senso che alle merci non gliene frega un cazzo di arrivare mezz'ora prima mezz'ora dopo a lione o a parigi avete mai visto una merce che vuole arrivare prima perché una volta che è arrivata prima che fa è un controsenso logico oltreché economico solo per evitare di per avere i soldi che si continuavano a distribuire a progettisti consulenti eccetera eccetera e a quelli che facevano le opere di carotaggio le opere geognostiche i tunnel geognostici che sono quella baracconata che voi vedete quando vi dicono che vi portano a visitare il cantiere del tav il cantiere del tav non esiste perché perché il tav non è stato mai nemmeno iniziato quella roba che voi quei buchi che voi vedete con salvini col casco giallo zingaretti col casco giallo chiamparino col casco giallo del rio col casco giallo e prima di loro lunardi e berlusconi col casco giallo non è il cantiere del tar non esiste il cantiere del tav sono carotaggi sono sondaggi sono piccoli buchi piccoli naturalmente rispetto all'opera che vengono fatti per sondare il terreno e che ci sono già costati tre miliardi e mezzo senza cominciare l'opera quindi non è un treno ad alta velocità ma ad alta capacità non è per i passeggeri ma è per le merci anche se non ci sono merci da trasportare poi dite ma le merci non stanno sul treno torino modane perché vanno tutti sui tir è vero perché vanno sui t e c'è un complotto contro il tav no semplicemente più comodo portare le merci sui tir perché comodo perché quando tu produci una merce la metti sul tir e il tir arriva fino a destinazione senza trasbordi se la devi mettere sul treno la devi caricare su un tir portarla nella stazione più vicina sperando che sia attrezzata per il treno merci caricarla sul treno merci e poi mandare un altro tir alla stazione di arrivo che preleva quelle merci e le porta nell'azienda a destinazione per questo le aziende preferiscono i tir ci sono molti tir no ce ne sono pochissimi tra torino e lione l'autostrada con meno tir è proprio quella che passa sotto il frejus che collega milano torino lione e parigi ci sono cento volte più tir su tutte le altre autostrade italiane persino sulla brebemi la bergamo brescia milano che è l'autostrada più deserta d'italia e più inutile d'italia non ci passa nessuno bene ci sono più tier ii che non sulla linea che si dice che bisogna assolutamente decongestionare dai tir facendo una seconda ferrovia accanto a quella già vuota tra torino e modan in ogni caso il tav esiste ancora perché ci hanno detto che è un treno ad alta capacità per le merci quindi tac ma è falso anche che sia torino lione perché perché non parte da torino e non riva lione il progetto attuale parte da bussoleno e arriva a saint jean de maurienne quindi bisognerebbe chiamarlo tac bussoleno saint jean de maurienne e tutto falso anche nella denominazione torino non c'entra niente la stazione di partenza è la valle di susa visioni di arrivo in sedicente moriero non lione qualcuno dice ci sarà poi un tratto di collegamento tra bussoleno e torino e tra saint jean de brienne e lione può darsi i francesi quella linea di collegamento l'hanno rinviata al 2038 quindi fino al 2038 cioè fra 19 anni noi non sapremo se ci sarà questo collegamento oppure no perché i francesi l'hanno rinviata al 2038 ma perché lo sanno anche loro che il tav non si farà mai e dato che quella parte dovrebbero pagarsela tutta loro a differenza della galleria che pagano un po i francesi un po gli italiani e un po l'unione europea non hanno nessuna intenzione di tirare fuori dei soldi per un'opera che sanno che non si farà mai e quindi l'hanno semplicemente rinviata al 2038 mentre per la galleria che è il vero cantiere che non si è ancora aperto tant'è che stanno facendo adesso i bandi di gara non hanno stanziato nemmeno un euro però hanno detto che la fanno gli unici [ __ ] che hanno stanziato quasi tutti i soldi siamo noi e l'unione europea e c'è il trattato italo francese sul tav che dice che il tab può partire con i bandi di gara solo nel caso in cui tutti e due i soggetti finanziatori abbiano stanziato la somma necessaria noi l'abbiamo stanziata l'unione europea la stanziata la francia no non esiste un capitolo nel bilancio dello stato francese che dica tav non c'è non c'è un euro da parte dei francesi l'opera vera e propria quindi che non esiste è una galleria di 57 e mezzo chilometri dentro le alpi che si affianca a quella già esistente da più di cent'anni e si chiama frejus ed è una galleria che insiste per i due terzi in territorio francese e per un terzo in territorio italiano sapete come hanno suddiviso i pagamenti italiani pagano i due terzi e francesi pagano un terzo voi direte che siamo i più stupidi del mondo esattamente si siamo i più [ __ ] del mondo è un regalino che possono rivendicare fifty fifty delrio e lunardi i ministri di berlusconi e di renzi che dato che i francesi non ne hanno mai voluto sapere di fare questa cagata perchè lo sanno che è inutile hanno detto volete che la facciamo bene del accollate quasi tutta voi anche se la galleria è quasi tutta nostra quindi non solo hanno rinviato le opere di collegamento tra saint jean e lione al 2038 ma non hanno stanziato un euro nonostante che gli abbiamo fatto uno sconto tale per cui per i loro due terzi di galleria pagano un terzo e noi per il nostro terzo di galleria paghiamo due terzi ora tutti questi calcoli sono noti da vent'anni lo sanno tutti lo sanno quelli che lo vogliono fare e quelli che non lo vogliono fare che il tav è inutile in più ci sono gli abitanti della valle di susa che giustamente si difendono da quel mostro perché perché per loro non è inutile per loro è dannoso nel senso che va a infestare e a deturpare a stuprare una valle che è già stuprata da autostrade da centrali e da altre opere inquinanti e allora da vent'anni i valsusini protestano protestano pacificamente e non se li fila nessuno poi ci si infila qualche black bloc e cominciano a fare delle violenze allora cominciano a menare la se voi andate in valle di susa è una valle sembra l'afghanistan è militarizzata da vent'anni è sotto assedio e quando sono cominciate le violenze dei black bloc che si infiltravano si è detto purtroppo non possiamo prendere in considerazione le proteste degli abitanti della valle di susa perché sono violenti però quando erano non violenti non li prendevano sul serio lo stesso adesso hanno smesso di essere violenti e si continua a non prenderli sul serio perché perché tutti sanno che quest'opera è inutile e dannosa per le popolazioni locali è il super dannosa per le casse del nostro stato però non bisogna dirlo bisogna raccontare panzane e di balla in ballo sono riusciti ad andare avanti per vent'anni ma per vent'anni c'è stato un certo dibattito sui media se andate a riprendervi una puntata di report del 2011 c'era ancora la gabanelli che lo presentava troverete esattamente tutte le cose che vi sto dicendo adesso si sapevano già a 7 8 anni fa ma si sapevano anche quindici anni fa sui giornali c'era chi sosteneva la bontà dell'opera e chi l'ha sostenere chi sosteneva la negatività dell'opera su repubblica adriano sofri che non è proprio una mia simpatia ma definì partito preso il partito del tub perché alle obiezioni economiche e ambientali rispondevano si deve fare perché si deve fare ma non è che argomentasse rowe perché non c'erano argomenti l'espresso faceva memorabili inchieste sull'assurdità del tav sul sole 24 ore si pubblicavano appelli non solo del professor marco ponti che è diventato un po il simbolo degli esperti no tav ma anche di carlo cottarelli che per il resto viene portato in palmo di mano come un cervellone della madonna bene anche cottarelli firmava gli appelli al governo monti per che interrompesse quella follia la lega nord era al fianco degli ambientalisti e di grillo contro il tav borghezio gridava tav uguale mafia e aveva perfettamente ragione perché la valle di susa è una delle zone a più alta concentrazione di ndrangheta del nord italia poi è successa una cosa è successo che a torino ha vinto la sindaca dei cinque stelle appendino no tav e al governo nazionale sono arrivati con la maggioranza l'anno scorso i cinque stelle no tav e hanno inserito nel contratto di governo la revisione integrale del progetto d'accordo con la francia nel contratto di maio salvini inizialmente c'era scritto cancellazione del progetto tav poi è intervenuto mattarella e ha detto non potete impegnarvi a cancellare un opera che è prevista da un trattato italo francese quindi dovete scrivere che vari negoziata con i francesi ma salvini aveva promesso a di maio che almeno una grande opera inutile l'avrebbero cassata insieme e quell'opera era il tab e si è scelta finalmente dopo decenni di follie in cui si buttavano i soldi nostri senza prima verificare se un'opera era inutile non era in auto non era uno era utile e se quell'opera rispondeva al principio secondo cui il gioco vale la candela bene hanno deciso di sottoporre tutte le opere pubbliche in appena iniziate o non ancora iniziati e alla prova dell'analisi costi benefici e hanno incaricato una commissione di economisti e trasportisti presieduta dal professor ponti e lavora a livello europeo su questi temi è uno dei più prestigiosi esperti di questi temi affinché valutassero le pedemontane terzo valico il tap e tutto il resto compreso il tav naturalmente il partito degli affari è entrato in fibrillazione perché perché anche quelli che vogliono farlo il tavolo sanno benissimo che se uno si affida a degli esperti fa dei calcoli viene fuori che il calcolo è completamente negativo e quindi terrorizzati dall analisi costi benefici che avrebbe posto fine alla grande mangiatoia la mangiatoia in base alla quale noi abbiamo già buttato 6 miliardi e mezzo per il mose e nessuno sa se funzionerà o meno cioè sappiamo che non è in funzione perché dopo 31 anni non è stato ancora completato ma non sappiamo quando entrerà in funzione se servirà allo scopo per il quale è stato costruito perché perché è un esperimento il primo esperimento del genere al mondo quindi lo scopriremo solo vivendo e spendendo se il mose funziona intanto ci abbiamo già smenato 6 miliardi e mezzo se avessero fatto l'analisi costi benefici mai sarebbe partito tant'è che cacciari che ha fatto il sindaco per tre volte a venezia si è sempre opposto ma è rimasto da solo mentre tutti gli altri dicevano di sì e rubavano quindi il terrore del partito degli affari era comprensibile perché se passa il principio che le opere pubbliche sono subordinate alla loro utilità è finita si scoprirà che di grandi opere pubbliche utili ce ne sono pochissime le vere opere utili sono quelle piccole e medie che tra l'altro costano molto meno e creano molta più occupazione a differenza delle grandi opere che creano poca occupazione dissi mi costi pensate che al tav se partisse mai lavoreranno 400 addetti voi avrete letto da qualche parte che la confindustria parla di 40 mila posti di lavoro ecco vanno semplicemente ridotti del 100 per cese all'uno per cento rispetto a quello che loro raccontano sono 400 gli addetti ma lo scrive l'osservatorio pro tav e non lo dico mica io sparano cifre a caso ma gli addetti saranno pochissimi perché perché l'opera è un buco dentro una montagna secondo voi chi lo scava gli operai con le unghie no lisca lo scava una talpa meccanica cosa ha fatto il partito degli affari quando si è prospettata l'ipotesi di annullare nel caso in cui l'analisi costi benefici avesse bloccato il tav beh se aggrappata a quello che poteva non aveva più i suoi santi padroni i suoi santi protettori al governo perché alle elezioni dell'anno scorso erano spariti sia forza italia sia il pd che erano i due garanti del partito del magna magna che fosse delrio fosse lunardi avevano sempre garantito soldi pubblici a opere inutili e si ritrovavano improvvisamente due partiti con i quali il partito degli affari a livello nazionale non aveva mai trattato da una parte i cinque stelle dall'altra parte la lega mi pare abbastanza evidente chi dei due fosse più permeabile alle sirene del partito degli affari hanno immediatamente investito su salvini l'hanno nominato nuovo santo patrono del partito degli affari e salvini è diventato il santo patrono del partito degli affari più e meglio di quanto non lo facessero berlusconi e il centrosinistra prima per cui improvvisamente noi abbiamo scoperto che a torino città che se n'è sempre struck ata [ __ ] del tav perché non è minimamente scocco in volta c'era un movimento di massa che non vedeva l'ora che partisse il tav il movimento delle madamine vi ricordate quelle sette per elite che poi venivano portate in processione in ostensione come la sindone in televisione a parlare di cose che non sapevano io ne ricordo una che dalla gruber mi spiegava che non vedeva l'ora che suo figlio salisse sul tav per andare a parigi e che l'italia fosse finalmente collegata con la francia io le dissi guardi io da quando ero bambino dato che una cugina lione tutte le volte che volevo andare a lione a parigi salivo sul tgv e ci arrivavo comodamente anche velocemente perché il tgv oltre che bello e pure veloce evidentemente queste pensavano che l'italia e la francia non fossero collegate che per arrivare in francia si dovessero prendere i muli e attraversare le alpi a dorso di mulo oppure come annibale con gli elefanti quando le madamine le madamine che cos'erano erano il paravento dei partiti che ovviamente non potevano organizzare manifestazioni di piazza perché per due motivi primo perché gli avrebbero detto ma avete governato per trent'anni non siete ancora riusciti nemmeno iniziare cantiere e venite a rompere i [ __ ] a un governo che appena nato ma spiegateci perché da 30 anni fate finta secondo motivo perché oggi come oggi se forza italia o il pd o tutti e due insieme organizzassero una manifestazione non ci andrebbero nemmeno quelli che l'hanno organizzata quindi avevano bisogno di tron player le madamine della buona borghesia torinese che volevano mettere i loro figli su un treno merci tra l'altro come se fossero pestiamo come se avessero partorito delle bestie perché sui treni merci e sui carri bestiame gli esseri umani non ci vanno esseri umani vanno sui treni passeggeri che esistono già le ballerine sono servite per due mesi è mica di più usa e getta per organizzare due manifestazioni a torino in piazza castello dove c'erano ventimila persone che i giornali spacciavano per 40mila perché volevano ricordare la marcia dei quarantamila che aveva stroncato le gambe ai sindacati organizzata sottobanco dalla fiat di romiti con i quadri della fiat medesima tra la prima e la seconda manifestazione delle madamine c'è stata la manifestazione dei no tav 80mila persone ma a differenza di quella delle madamine che erano ventimila gli 80mila notava non sono ormai finiti in prima pagina perché è perché erano troppi tutto questo per fare la guerra preventiva a quella analisi costi benefici che non era ancora arrivata ma che tutti sapevano che sarebbe stata negativa perchè lo sanno tutti che l'opera non serve a niente se non a quelli che la vogliono costruire coi soldi nostri e che probabilmente hanno già preso le tangenti vent'anni fa per cui adesso o chi ha preso le tangenti gliele restituisce oppure gli dà il resto dei soldi per completare l'opera o almeno per fare finta di completarla voi ricorderete e durante tutto il governo conte 1 il governo gialloverde la stampa di centro di sinistra ha dipinto quel governo come un governo fascista razzista nazista soprattutto perché salvini è fascista razzista nazista però nei giorni in cui la lega partecipava alle manifestazioni delle madamine e in cui salvini si schierava con il tav insieme al pd ea forza italia smetteva di essere fascista razzista e nazista e diventava utile tant'è che ogni tanto c'era questa scena imbarazzante penso per esempio a repubblica che nelle pagine pari gli dava del fascista e nelle pagine di spari no lo utilizzava come un valido alleato del tav ma con un fascista ti poi alle aree oltretutto per fare quella porcheria esattamente quello che succedeva io qua mi sono portato un po di titoli di giornale perché vi rendiate conto di quello che è successo nei giorni immediatamente precedenti al deposito dell'analisi costi benefici di ponti e degli altri quattro professori repubblica titolo la partita truccata della tav nella commissione toninelli cinque membri su sei erano per il no cioè dato che gli esperti avevano già detto prima di fare l'analisi costi benefici che il tav è inutile non erano imparziali a meno che non cambiassero idea e non dicessero che l'opera era diventata utile sarebbe come affidare una ricerca sul cancro a un oncologo che ha sempre sostenuto che il cancro fa male se per caso l'oncologo nel nuovo studio dovesse confermare che il cancro fa male non è imparziale perché è prevenuto perché già prima diceva che il cancro fa male un esperto di cancro per non essere prevenute per essere imparziale dovrebbe dire ogni volta che fa uno studio una volta che il cancro fa male è una volta che il cancro fa bene altrimenti fuori non è un esperto questo è il teorema che è stato istituito per sputtanare i cinque professori dell'analisi costi benefici prima ancora che depositassero la loro analisi e non sui giornali satirici o comici come quelli del centrodestra su repubblica sono prevenuti perché hanno sempre saputo dati alla mano che il tav è inutile e come se il professor burioni che da sempre per i vaccini fosse ritenuto prevenuto perché continua a dire che è favorevole ai vaccini la logica è scomparsa di fronte agli interessi quindi voi immaginate se un giornale così autorevole è disposto a sputtanarsi dicendo tali fesserie quali sono gli interessi in gioco e quanto sono ramificati sempre prima che uscisse l'analisi di ponti e degli altri repubblica titolava tav la controanalisi di salvini costa meno finirla che fermarla cioè salvini era diventato un professore un economista un esperto di trasporti pubblici più esperto di quelli che stavano facendo l'analisi costi benefici e questo lo scriveva repubblica ci prendevano sul serio un cazzaro che mangia sputa e rimangia la nutella nel giro di tre ore perché gli hanno spiegato che usano le noccioline turche affidavano a salvini la vera analisi costi benefici per contrapporla a quella dei professori di livello europeo repubblica ma anche la stampa controdossier di salvini la sospensione della tav ci costa 24 miliardi messaggero non completare la tav può costare 24 miliardi ecco il dossier della lega voi ve lo vedete salvini con gli altri del papeete che si riunisce fa i calcoli economico trasportistici sull'alta capacità e l'alta velocità torino lione non sa neanche dove lione forse non sa dove torino forse non sa cos'è il tav tant'è che lo chiama la tav è così che salvini è arrivato al 35 40 per cento a furia di prenderlo sul serio perché se lo trattassero come un cazzaro anche se dovesse depositare un dossier sul tav i giornali si scompiscia rebbero invece di dedicargli i titoli e badate che quel dossier il controdossier di cui parlavano a reti unificate i grandi giornali non è mai esistito noi io mi ricordo che quel giorno ho chiamato l'ufficio stampa della lega ha detto ce lo fate vedere il controdossier di salvini e l'ufficio stampa della lega ha detto ma noi non abbiamo nessun controdossier se le erano inventato i giornali semplicemente per dire che ci sarebbe uscita l'analisi dei professori ma per fortuna c'era anche la controanalisi di salvini e di altri tre mini ottoni del papeete immagino immagino che questi fossero i suoi professori [Applauso] negli stessi giorni c'era il festival di sanremo e dato che bisognava pompare salvini noto trasportista ma anche noto musicologo la stampa lo ha ingaggiato come critico musicale e ha pubblicato la stampa di torino famiglia agnelli elkann quelli che la menano tutti i giorni col fatto che salvini è la quinta colonna di putin in italia una pagina intera salvini intervistato sul festival di sanremo ma allora baglioni le piace pio e amedeo le sono piaciuti lei sa di avere vinto a suo modo il festival la sua vita è più spericolata oggi o quando ha preso la lega morente ed è partito in tour per l'italia i suoi cantanti preferiti rete questo giornalismo anglosassone no così aggressivo che inchioda il politico alle sue responsabilità c'è una canzone che ha segnato un momento importante della sua vita va ai concerti con suo figlio baglioni si è detto lusingato per avere una persona tanto illustre come spettatore e bisio ha detto che lei è simpatico non starà diventando troppo popolare manca solo la domanda ma come fai a essere così bravo salvini ma non glie l'hanno potuta fare perché era già annegato nella bava e nella saliva dell'intervistatrice poi il giorno dopo hanno ricominciato a dire che era un fascista poi hanno ricominciato a dire che era un esperto di tav poi era di nuovo una quinta colonna di putin pò era di nuovo un esperto di tav a seconda delle convenienze il 12 febbraio finalmente esce l'analisi costi benefici e naturalmente dimostra quello che tutti hanno sempre saputo si sono buttati un miliardo e mezzo prima vi ho detto treno un miliardo e mezzo che l'opera ne costerebbe almeno altri 13 a preventivo il che è in italia con la lievitazione automatica dei costi fino al 40 per cento minimo minimo sono 25 24 23 miliardi il mose è costato 17 volte tanto rispetto i preventivi e adesso che sarà inaugurato costerà mezzo miliardo all'anno solo di manutenzione sempre che funzioni bene succi del tav sarebbero quantificabili in 800 milioni non 20 miliardi come dicono i sostenitori le merci necessarie per giustificare una seconda linea ferroviaria dovrebbero essere 25 volte superiori a quelle attualmente circolanti su quella linea e anche in quel caso il tav risulterebbe in perdita perché come vi dicevo prima ogni giorno dal frejus passano 2 mila tir mentre sulla tangenziale torino milano ne passano 80.000 e sulla brebemi come vi ho detto sei mila cioè il triplo e della più vuota d'italia il guadagno di tempo da milano a lione sarebbe di un minuto e 20 secondi cioè noi dovremmo buttare 20 miliardi se va bene per guadagnare un minuto e venti secondi ma voi capite che ci vuole la perizia psichiatrica per chi vuole fare un'opera del genere bisogna farli visitare da uno bravo perdita secca per italia e francia se si finisce l'opera 8 miliardi questa è l'analisi costi benefici i giornali cosa dicono che non è valida perché su sei professori cinque hanno firmato la relazione uno no voi direte embè uno su sei chissenefrega varrà di più la parola di cinque la parola di uno i giornali cominciano a dire che vale di più la parola di uno perché gli altri cinque erano già contro il tav prima di fare l'analisi costi benefici mentre lui era favorevole quindi dato che lui era favorevole ed è rimasto favorevole lui non è prevenuto gli altri che erano contrarie sono rimasti i contrari sono prevenuti anche se sono in cinque contro uno quindi la regola secondo cui la maggioranza vince in questo caso non vale più la minoranza vince perché perché è l'unica che dà ragione al partito degli affari stampa titola traforo del frejus così cavour vince la battaglia per la tav dell'ottocento cioè ingaggiavano anche i morti poveracci il conte camillo benso conte di cavour che fu colui che concepì il frejus vi viene spacciato per il padre del tav in realtà proprio perché c'è già il frejus il tav è inutile perché c'è già la linea ferroviaria sia per le merci sia per i passeggeri tanto cavour non poteva smentire interviste a salvini sulle analisi costi benefici salvini dice non mi ha convinto nessuno gli chiede che cosa in particolare non lo ha convinto perché se voi la vedete se avete il libro ha trovate in appendice sono tutte formule matematiche sono tutte espressioni matematiche io penso che salvini si è rimasto un po interdetto da questa s o uguale sm per aperta tonda uno meno di chiusa tonda per aperta tonda uno meno ti chiusa tonda ecco secondo me quei meno lo hanno un po insospettito lui ci avrebbe messo dei più perché è un ottimista naturalmente sui giornali si comincia a leggere che la francia sta dando degli ultimatum all'italia la francia ci intima di decidere subito la francia chiara inviato le sue opere di collegamento al 2038 e non ha ancora cacciato un euro secondo i giornali intimava al nostro governo di fare presto roma decida tempo scaduto l'ultimatum di parigi come vi ho detto l'italia nella legge di stabilità 2013 governo monti ha stanziato due miliardi e 6 l'unione europea ha messo a disposizione 570 milioni il governo francese zero euro però secondo i nostri giornali il governo francese continua spronare l'italia a fare presto cioè dovremmo fare noi quello che abbiamo già fatto anziché loro quello che non hanno mai fatto pensate quanto e potente la banda del buco nella politica e nell'informazione per giustificare cazzate di questo genere naturalmente la cosa come va a finire va a finire in due ultimi step c'è una riunione del consiglio dei ministri dove salvini si porta i suoi esperti notate che l'analisi costi benefici era un'analisi fatta dal governo mica da toninelli fatta dagli esperti per conto del governo salvini improvvisamente fa finta che il governo non c'entra niente con lui e si porta dei suoi esperti e non si sa nemmeno chi siano perché perché conte dice bene se hai delle obiezioni da fare sulle analisi costi benefici del tuo governo questa è la sede per farle salvini i suoi esperti ci provano per due ore e non riescono a tirar fuori un solo calcolo sbagliato dell'analisi costi benefici di ponti per cui alla fine del consiglio dei ministri forse ve lo ricordate il premier conte fa una conferenza stampa dove dice abbiamo sottoposto a stress test l'analisi dei dai nostri esperti ma la lega non è riuscita nemmeno a scalfire un solo calcolo quindi la posizione del governo è che quest'opera è totalmente inutile dannosa per le casse dello stato e quindi negozierò con i francesi e con la commissione europea una profonda revisione dell'opera medesima poi purtroppo né la francia nell'unione europea vogliono concedere nulla al nostro governo e quindi non si riesce a ottenere il loro consenso per la revisione del trattato revisione del trattato che può essere cancellato modificato soltanto da un voto del parlamento e infatti ricorderete che alla vigilia della crisi di governo il giorno prima che salvini facesse saltare il governo salvini ha fatto saltare il governo l'otto agosto il 6 agosto due giorni prima si è votato in parlamento sulle mozioni per rivedere o per mantenere il trattato italo francese sul tav e li abbiamo avuto proprio in parlamento la plastica dimostrazione di che cos'è la banda del buco perché il fascista razzista nazista salvini ha votato non ha nemmeno fatto lo sforzo di presentare la sua di mozione pro tav ha votato quella del pd quella di forza italia quella di fratelli d'italia e quella della bonino mentre i cinque stelle si sono votati la propria che era l'unica no tav e che ha avuto anche i voti di leo o meglio di un pezzo di leu la parte ambientalista non legata al partito degli affari naturalmente le emozioni pro tav hanno prevalso sulla mozione notava perché perché 5 stelle non hanno la maggioranza assoluta hanno soltanto la maggioranza relativa e la coalizione di tutti gli altri lega partito democratico cioè i fascisti gli antifascisti messi insieme ha prevalso a quel punto il premier conte non ha potuto far altro che dire senza la revisione del trattato rischiamo troppo rischiamo di pagare penali rischiamo di essere accusati di violare quel trattato e quindi ha dato il via libera all'indizione delle gare dei bandi di gara per le opere che sono in corso in questi mesi il che non vuol dire che il tav si faccia anche per il ponte sullo stretto si arrivò a bandire le gare le vinse l'impregilo poi si decise quello che si era sempre saputo e cioè che il ponte sullo stretto non si sarebbe fatto e così l'impregilo adesso chiede i danni chiede le penali allo stato vedrete ci rivedremo nei prossimi anni che sarà la stessa cosa anche per il tav adesso faranno i bandi di gara ci saranno delle aziende sempre i soliti che si aggiudicheranno quelle gare e saranno cooperative rosse grandi colossi palazzinari che hanno tutti cointeressenze nei giornali e nei partiti della banda del buco dopodiché anche per il ritrarsi dei francesi il tav non si farà e loro recupereranno i soldi delle tangenti con una bella cresta naturalmente incassando penali dallo stato che così resterà cornuto e mazziato perché non avrà l'opera e contemporaneamente dovrà pagare quelli che chiedono di essere risarciti per non averla costruita a questo si puntava non tanto a farlo il tav tutti lo sanno che bisognerebbe bombardare gli abitanti della valle per piegare la loro resistenza e riuscire a fare quella porcheria che inquinerebbero wiener ebbe la loro vita per 20 anni perché il cantiere durerà vent'anni semmai comincerà ecco perché i francesi hanno rinviato al 2038 perchè lo sanno che se mai si farà durerà 20 anni quel cantiere ma sanno anche che non si farà l'unico scopo di tutta questa battaglia che è durata un anno e che adesso si è già completamente spenta non era fare l'opera perché non serve a nessuno era creare i presupposti per cui le aziende a cui è stato promesso un sacco di soldi possano avere una carta in mano per rivalersi contro lo stato e portar via soldi allo stato cioè portare via altri soldi dalle nostre tasche questa è l'operazione perfetta che naturalmente era pronta già prima ha vissuto un piccolo incidente di percorso con quelle maledette elezioni del 4 marzo 2018 che sono andate al contrario delle aspettative del partito degli affari partito degli affari che ha subito trovato all'interno dei nuovi barbari un suo nuovo santo protettore nella persona di salvini lo ha gonfiato come un tacchino come un pallone volante fino a portarlo alla maggioranza sta continuando a pomparlo nella speranza che prenda i pieni poteri e continui a fare gli interessi del partito degli affari come ben li facevano prima quelli del centrosinistra e del centrodestra affinché le elezioni tornino ad essere quella farsa che sono state per 20 anni vince la destra vince la sinistra vince sempre il banco le lezioni della roulette truccata avete presente il casinò con la roulette truccata vince rosso vince nero vince sempre la roulette vince sempre il croupier vince sempre il banco poi certo per convincere la gente ad andare a votare bisogna fare finta che da una parte ci sono i rossi e dall'altra parte ci sono i neri l'importante che il partito degli affari non abbia nulla da temere né dagli uni né dagli altri l'importante e sterminare gli unici corpi estranei al partito degli affari che purtroppo una volta nella vita l'anno scorso il 4 marzo erano arrivati primi sono quelle cose che capitano come quando il verona vince il campionato perchè quell'anno si fa il sorteggio degli arbitri come quando bertoglio vince il giro d'italia essendo un pirla quando tiziana rivale vince il festival di sanremo sono cose che capitano una volta nella vita no sono quegli imprevisti dopo i quali immediatamente si fa in modo di richiudere le acque del mar rosso e di fare in modo che la navigazione del partito degli affari ritorni più placida e tranquilla che pria sempre che naturalmente gli elettori continuano a farsi [ __ ] da questa informazione infame che ha trasformato salvini in un gigante della politica e ha trasformato l'opera più inutile della storia in un'opera utile che addirittura le persone credono di auspicare che nasca per caricare i loro figli appunto su un treno merci accanto un po di carbone ea qualche cavolfiore vi ringrazio

IT WASN'T LIKE THERE WAS SOME LIST OF PEOPLE WHO THEY SUSPECTED WERE DANGEROUS OR GUILTY OF CRIMES. THESE WERE WE'VE SEEN MORE AND MORE OF THESE BASICALLY WORKPLACE RAIDS LIKE SHOW UP TO A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED AND DOING A JOB AND GO IN. RIGHT. THAT THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THESE RAIDS WERE TODAY. &gt;&gt; WHAT DO. &gt;&gt; WE DO? &gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT, CHRIS. &gt;&gt; ONE WAS IN THE FASHION DISTRICT HERE, JUST AROUND THE CORNER ON ALAMEDA STREET, DOWN ALAMEDA STREET IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES.

I WAS TALKING TO A YOUNG WOMAN JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO WHO I LOST HER IN THE CROWD, BUT HER NAME WAS ERICA PEREZ. SHE SAID HER MOTHER WAS JUST DEPORTED EARLIER IN THE WEEK. AFTER SHE. ERICA PEREZ, HAS BEEN A FIREFIGHTER FOR CAL FIRE, RESPONDING TO SOME OF THE WILDFIRES OUT HERE IN LA. BUT IN OTHER PLACES. ACROSS LA.

          <attvalue for="3" value="Lebanon's army has threatened to withdraw from the ceasefire monitoring body following Israeli airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Beirut's southern suburbs. The army said the strikes, which occurred just before the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha, have undermined its role in maintaining the fragile truce. Although Israel issued evacuation warnings, the timing of the attacks provoked strong local outrage. Lebanese officials warned that future strikes could end their cooperation in monitoring and search efforts. They accused Israel of violating the ceasefire and bypassing official communication channels. France condemned the attacks, calling them a threat to regional stability. In a statement, French authorities urged Israel to withdraw from Lebanese territory and called on all parties to honour the ceasefire signed in November.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;#lebanon #israel #hezbollah #MiddleEastTensions #CeasefireViolation #BeirutStrikes #EidAlAdha #LebaneseArmy #IsraelAirstrike #FranceCondemns #BlueLineCrisis #unpeacekeepers #middleeastconflict #CeasefireCrisis #RegionalSecurity&#10;&#10;Times Of India (TOI) Is The Largest Selling English Daily In The World. &#10;&#10;Times Of India Videos Bring You Global News, Views And Sharp Analysis.

          <attvalue for="7" value="imagine if you will a world so grand and mighty that it feels as though it will stand forever a kingdom so vast and powerful that its very name is whispered in awe across the lands but what if such a mighty nation with all its strength and wealth could be swept away in an instant by just a single breath of divine will let us take you on a journey into the ancient past to a time long ago where the people of AD a proud and powerful tribe lived amidst the golden sands between Yemen and Oman their city I am was a place of unimaginable beauty and strength where towering structures reached towards the heavens and riches flowed like rivers the people of Ad were a mighty force feared and respected by all who encountered them they had it all luxury power and influence yet for all their might they were not immune to the most insidious of dangers pride they were the first to carve idols from stone to shape gods from their own hands and worship them turning away from the truth revealed by Allah in doing so they abandoned the guidance of the prophets losing themselves in their own arrogance and desires their story as told in the Quran is not just a tale of the past it is a timeless warning for us all it reminds us that no matter how strong wealthy or powerful we become we are never beyond the reach of Allah's will the pride that once led the people of Ad to forget their creator to build idols and place their trust in them eventually became the very reason for their downfall the destruction of the people of AD serves as a stark reminder to us all it shows us how easily even the mightiest of nations can fall how swiftly the divine breath can sweep away the arrogance of man their story is a chapter from the Quran meant to teach us the dangers of pride and the importance of humility before Allah as we reflect on their fate let us be mindful of our own hearts and actions remembering that true strength lies not in the idols we create but in our submission to Allah the one who holds all power in his hands let us learn from the past and strive to walk humbly in the footsteps of those who are truly wise imagine if you will a land of such breathtaking beauty that it takes your breath away a land where the very air seems to shimmer with wealth and power this was the kingdom of the AD a tribe whose name echoed through the ages their strength as towering as their stature they were giants not only in size but in the immense wealth that flowed through their land the rivers that snaked through the valleys brought life to the lush fertile soil feeding gardens heavy with dates and pomegranates that seemed to spill over with abundance the air was rich with the scent of nature's bounty in the bustling markets of their cities the hum of activity was constant traders from faroff lands bartered with gold silks and spices it was a place where the finest treasures of the earth were exchanged where the fruits of the world's labor came together in a dazzling display of opulence the homes of the AD shimmerred like jewels their walls adorned with intricate mosaics that told tales of their wealth and influence every corner every building was a testament to their success but here lies a remarkable and perhaps unsettling truth the ad were so powerful so wealthy that they did not simply build homes for comfort they carved grand castles into the very peaks of the mountains themselves these majestic fortresses were not meant to be lived in no they were something much more significant they were declarations they were symbols of their might built to reach the heavens standing tall as monuments to their arrogance the AD were not content with mere palaces they wanted the world to see their power to gaze upon these towering structures and know that no one no matter how far or wide they traveled could ever match their grandeur travelers from distant lands would pause in awe as they gazed upon these colossal wonders they would wonder aloud who built such marvels and the answer would be clear only the ad their authority knew no bounds they had shaped the laws that governed distant tribes imposing their will upon those who lived under their rule in their hearts the ad held a belief that they were unmatched untouchable their pride rang out in every word every action they would declare with unwavering certainty who is mightier than we it was in this overwhelming sense of self-importance this belief that they were invincible that the seeds of their downfall were planted but for now in the glow of their wealth and power they saw no end to their reign they were giants and they believed they would stand forever but then a turning point arrived one that would challenge the very foundation of the AD's power what if their greatest threat didn't come from another mighty army or a rival tribe but from a single humble voice of truth amidst the grandeur and wealth of the AD a voice rose a voice that spoke not of riches or glory but of righteousness from among them was chosen Prophet Hud peace be upon him a man of wisdom grace and unwavering resolve allah had sent him to guide the hearts of the ad to remind them of their true purpose with a calm yet powerful presence Prophet Hood peace be upon him stood before them and his message was simple yet profound worship Allah alone he spoke with clarity calling them away from their misguided ways he pointed to the idols they had fashioned with their own hands Samud Harah and others and revealed a painful truth these were nothing but creations of their own craft lifeless and powerless the people of Ad skilled artisans who had built towering temples and adorned them with precious jewels had given their offerings to these stone figures yet their intellect their craft and their power couldn't help them see the truth of faith these idols could not guide them could not protect them in the dazzling wealth and splendor of their cities the people of AD had become blind they saw their idols as the key to their success as guardians of their fortune but behind their veils of gold and jewels a dark force had led them astray shayan with all his cunning had cloaked their sins in beauty tempting them to worship what they had created and turning their hearts away from the one true creator prophet Hud peace be upon him urged them to turn back to Allah to reject the false idols they had elevated above the one who had given them life but his words though filled with wisdom and truth were met with mockery and scorn the people of Ad in their pride and arrogance could not fathom that their strength was fragile that their power was not eternal and so they rejected the truth still Prophet Hood peace be upon him did not waver with each passing day he continued to call them to the path of righteousness urging them to repent and return to the worship of Allah alone his heart full of compassion sought nothing but their salvation but would they listen would the people of Ad so consumed by their own pride turn their hearts back to the one who had created them or would they continue to walk down the path of arrogance blind to the truth that stood before them the story of Prophet Hud peace be upon him and the people of AD serves as a powerful reminder that no matter how grand or powerful we may become we must always remain humble before Allah our strength our wealth and our achievements are but fleeting gifts and only through faith and obedience to Allah can we find true lasting success the leaders of the AD draped in their finest robes and seated in their grand ornate halls received Prophet Hood's words with nothing but contempt their eyes filled with arrogance glinted with mockery as they listened to his call for worshiping Allah alone they exchanged glances and then with cold sharp laughter they turned to him mocking his message &quot;show us proof Hud,&quot; they taunted their voices dripping with disdain bring the punishment you speak of let us see if your God truly has the power to strike us down their arrogance had built a thick wall around their hearts a wall so strong that it shielded them from any truth the words of Prophet Hud peace be upon him were like a breeze passing over a stone unable to penetrate the hard shell of their pride they scoffed at the very idea of repentance blind to the fact that the punishment he spoke of was not a threat but a warning an opportunity for them to turn back before it was too late but Prophet Hud peace be upon him stood before them with unwavering resolve his heart filled with trust in Allah was unshaken by their mockery he did not flinch in the face of their scorn &quot;i reject your idols,&quot; he proclaimed firmly his voice calm but resolute i place my trust in Allah the one who created me and you do what you will your threats do not frighten me for my faith is stronger than your arrogance.&quot; His words echoed through the halls resonating with a truth that no mockery could silence the leaders of the ad enraged by his defiance began to plot against him they schemed to imprison him to exile him from their lands believing that by removing him they could rid themselves of the inconvenient voice of truth yet despite their anger and their plans Prophet Hood's message rang louder than their threats he continued to call day after day urging the people of Ad to abandon their idols and return to the worship of Allah alone his resolve never faltered for he knew that his mission was not one of personal gain but one of mercy and guidance for his people even if they rejected him his duty was to deliver the message and he would not rest until he had done so the more they tried to silence him the more his words spread the truth no matter how hard they tried to bury it could not be contained it is a powerful reminder that no matter the opposition the light of truth will always find a way to shine through even in the darkest corners of arrogance and pride Allah's judgment descended upon the mighty add like a slow relentless storm one that began as a whisper but would soon drown the land in its fury for three long years the skies withheld their mercy and a severe drought seized the land the lush valleys once teeming with life turned into barren wastelands rivers that once flowed with abundance now lay dried and cracked their waters swallowed by the earth the once vibrant gardens of dates and pomegranates withered to dust their fruits no longer hanging heavy on the branches the pride of the ad once as towering as the mountains themselves began to crumble their mighty wealth and influence could not shield them from this divine trial the markets once alive with the chatter of trade grew silent the grand cities adorned with mosaics and splendor withered like the gardens they had once boasted of their livestock the symbol of their prosperity began to perish their cries filling the air this drought though seemingly natural was a clear sign no one no matter how powerful or wealthy stands above the will of Allah as hunger and despair took hold of the people their arrogance began to falter in desperation they turned to the very idols they had once worshiped in pride 70 of their elders robed in ceremonial garments gathered and journeyed to a sacred shrine pleading for mercy for rain for salvation they sought the idols for help believing that these lifeless figures held the power to bring relief then as if in response to their cries three clouds appeared in the sky strange vibrant clouds each one a different hue red yellow and black the people gazed up their hearts filled with hope but it was their leader who would make the final choice after careful consideration he pointed to the black cloud convinced that it was the one that would bring the long- awaited rain his eyes sparkled with certainty the black cloud he believed was a sign of hope the harbinger of salvation the people their hearts now alike with anticipation rejoiced they cried out in unison &quot;Our salvation has arrived.&quot; They believed that this cloud this sign was the answer to their prayers the promise of the end of their suffering they thought they had secured their salvation but little did they know the cloud they had chosen was not a symbol of mercy but of impending destruction in their moment of triumph they were blind to the truth that had been before them all along the drought the hunger the death of their livestock these were not random occurrences but signs from Allah meant to guide them back to the right path yet in their desperation they had chosen to place their trust in the idols they had so carefully crafted instead of in the one who had given them life and sustenance the people of Ad were about to learn a bitter lesson no one can escape the will of Allah no matter how much they may try to defy it their salvation would not come from idols nor from the clouds in the sky but from turning their hearts to the creator the one who controls all things but here lies the twist in their story what if the very cloud they welcomed the one they believed would bring salvation was instead the harbinger of their destruction among the crowd there was a perceptive woman one whose heart was not swayed by the frenzy of the masses with deep wisdom she looked up at the black cloud that loomed overhead and uttered a warning a cry of truth that few would heed &quot;this is no rain,&quot; she said her voice filled with dread and clarity but wrath this cloud carries not mercy but punishment yet her words were lost in the deafening cheer of the crowd the people caught up in their fervor drowned out her caution believing with all their hearts that the cloud was their salvation the leader of the ad confident in his choice did not listen and so the black cloud a symbol of divine wrath was welcomed as if it were a blessing and then with the force of Allah's decree the storm began what followed was not a gentle rain but a mighty wind fierce and unrelenting that howled through the skies it was a wind like no other its roar shaking the earth its force carrying with it a power that no man or kingdom could withstand for seven nights and 8 days this storm did not relent its fury unleashed by the will of Allah it tore through the land with a violence that shattered everything in its path it was not a mere tempest but the wrath of Allah a divine punishment delivered with precision and strength the proud cities of the Aad with their towering castles and intricate mosaics were no match for this force the grand structures built to reach the heavens in defiance of Allah's will crumbled into rubble the once mighty ad with their wealth and power were powerless before the storm their prideful strength was nothing in the face of Allah's might one by one the great cities fell their walls reduced to dust the people of Ad who had once towered over all were now swept up in the storm despite their strength despite their towering stature they were no match for the force of Allah's wind the storm lifted them from the earth casting them into the air like fragile branches ripped from a tree and when the storm finally subsided their bodies lay scattered broken and lifeless as though they were nothing more than fallen twigs in the wilderness the legacy of the AD once etched in stone their names whispered in awe across the lands was now but a faint echo in the desert winds the great civilization that had thought itself invincible was no more their wealth their power their towering idols all had crumbled beneath the weight of their pride the desert which had once known the glory of their reign now stood silent bearing witness to the fleeting nature of arrogance and the eternal power of Allah thus the story of the ad serves as a powerful reminder no matter how mighty we may become no matter how high we build our castles or how grand we believe ourselves to be we are never beyond the reach of Allah's will their tale is one of pride but also of profound humility a reminder that all power all strength comes from Allah alone and it is he who has the final say in all matters centuries later in the city of Medina the prophet Muhammad peace be upon him witnessed dark clouds gathering in the sky as the people around him rejoiced at the prospect of rain a blessing so desperately needed after the heat of the desert the prophet's heart trembled his thoughts turned to the people of Ad and the storm that had destroyed them so many years before he remembered how their pride had led them to reject the truth and how their arrogance had been swept away by a storm they mistook for salvation the prophet's caution in that moment was profound a reminder that even blessings like rain could conceal something far more dangerous he knew that sometimes Allah's decree may come in a form that seems like mercy but it may also carry hidden judgment the dark clouds were a reminder to him and to all of us that we should never become complacent or presumptuous even in times of ease and comfort just as the ad had believed their salvation lay in the cloud we too must remember that we should never rely solely on appearances but always be aware of the deeper truth of Allah's will when the soft rain began to fall the prophet peace be upon him turned to Allah in prayer offering words of humility and supplication oh Allah let these clouds bring goodness and shield us from their harm in this simple prayer the prophet encapsulated the spirit of wisdom and caution that we should all embrace even in the face of what seems to be a blessing we must always seek Allah's protection acknowledging that all power and control lie in his hands this prayer is one we too should make in our own lives it reminds us to be humble in times of abundance and to seek Allah's guidance and protection for he alone knows what lies within every event every moment the rain may seem like a blessing but only Allah knows what it truly brings thus we ask for goodness for mercy and for protection from any harm that may be hidden beneath the surface the prophet's caution and his prayer are timeless lessons they teach us that blessings can sometimes be a test and that we must always turn to Allah in good times and bad seeking his guidance and mercy for only he knows the true nature of the clouds that gather over us the ad possessed everything that many of us strive for strength wealth and wisdom they were giants in their time masters of their land builders of monuments that reached toward the heavens their influence stretched far and wide their authority unquestioned yet despite all their blessings their arrogance and ingratitude sealed their downfall in their pride they turned away from Allah's guidance believing that their power was eternal that no force could bring them low but Allah in his wisdom showed them that no matter how high we build ourselves without humility and gratitude we will always fall the story of the ad is not just a tale of a people long gone it is a lesson carved into eternity a warning that echoes through time the ad raised great structures and ruled vast lands but in their hearts they were filled with arrogance they defied Allah believing that their wealth and strength would shield them from any consequence where are they now their monuments lie in ruins their cities reduced to dust their names are but a faint whisper in the desert wind they are gone lost to history a reminder that all things no matter how grand are temporary in the face of Allah's will on judgment day Allah will not ask us about the ad or the people who came before us he will not ask us about their wealth their power or their arrogance instead he will ask us about our own deeds our own hearts and our own actions this is a moment for self-reflection a time for us to consider what are we truly pursuing in this life aspire Dean community think about this are we chasing after fleeting treasures status wealth and acclaim that will fade before Allah or are we cultivating what will endure faith humility and gratitude are we building lives rooted in the temporary or are we planting seeds that will blossom into something eternal the choices we make today the actions we take the way we live will shape our tomorrow when your moment arrives when you stand before Allah will you be prepared the ad were not ready for their hearts were closed to the truth but we unlike them have the opportunity to act with awareness and humility every small action every act of kindness every moment spent in worship is a seed we plant for the future let those seeds grow into something beautiful something lasting let them blossom into paradise where our actions are judged not by the fleeting wealth we accumulated but by the faith we nurtured the humility we embraced and the gratitude we showed as we walk through this life let us remember the lesson of the ye ad let us remember that true strength lies not in wealth or power but in our relationship with Allah in our submission to his will let us plant seeds that will bear fruit in the hereafter seeds that will grow into trees of eternal peace and joy and may Allah in his mercy guide us all to the path that leads to his paradise thus ends the tale of the ad a powerful reminder to remain humble no matter how high we may rise or how much we may achieve their story though rooted in the past serves as a timeless lesson for all of us in the pursuit of success wealth and status let us never forget the importance of gratitude humility and our unwavering dependence on Allah if this story stirred your heart if it reminded you of the fleeting nature of this world and the eternal value of faith then we encourage you to share it like this video share it with someone who may need this wisdom and leave a comment what lesson from the ad will you carry forward in your own

          <attvalue for="7" value="Captioning provided by MUHSEN (www.muhsen.org) When you talk about the vastness of the mercy of Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la and his bounty, what you realize is that sometimes you come across these authentic ahadith. And at first you might even be a little suspicious about whether or not they're authentic because the reward that is mentioned is so great for seemingly very simple things. And then you realize that the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam as he talks about these deeds that are otherwise inaccessible to us, or these rewards that are otherwise inaccessible to us, the deeds that he does SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam are always regular habits that we can adopt in our lives. And who knows how many Hajjs and how many rewards we will find on the day of judgment bi-idhnillah Ta'ala if we sincerely undertake those deeds. (dramatic music) First and foremost, the sincerity of intention. And, you know, sometimes, especially for those that make the intention of Hajj, it doesn't really hit them that, you know, inshaAllah you had the niyat so bi-idhnillah Ta'ala because you have the intention, sincere intention it counts, but I didn't feel it right. I didn't get to go to Madinah and go to Mecca. I didn't feel the struggle of Hajj. And so it's hard for me to conceive that perhaps I actually would have the reward of Hajj May Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la granted to all of us, who made the intention for Hajj or Umrah Allahumma Ameen. And then you look at this particular hadith where the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam chose to talk about the people who wanted to go to Tabuk. Now remember Tabuk was a difficult journey. It was in the heat of the summer, and it was a journey that the hypocrites did not want to go on because it just required so much. And they made all sorts of excuses and the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam is speaking to those who actually went to Tabuk, and they actually encountered all of its hardships. And he says, &quot;There are people that are not with you.&quot; habbasahum al marad, That they were held back by some sort of sickness or al eudhr, They had some sort of excuse, but they have the same reward as you. So the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam is saying that to the people that went under that huge journey, that undertook that huge journey, with all of its hardships. And he's saying SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam &quot;Look, there are people that have the same reward, even though they did not struggle the way that you struggled.&quot; So the sincerity of intention is important. And it's something that we have to always remind ourselves of that innamal ammalubinniyaat that actions are but by intentions. It's not just some sort of a comfort that the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam gives to us when we can't fulfill a deed, it's something that requires work. Like you have to actually work on your intention, and make sure that as you intend to do something that you sincerely intended for Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la and then the reward is assured from Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la. Now, one of the things that we see with the sahabah is that when moved to al Madinah, for example, they were unable to make it to Mecca, and they missed umrah. And we see the wisdom of the Hadith of the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam where he says that, &quot;Whoever makes wudu in Madinah, and then he heads out Masjid Quda, the first Masjid in Islam to pray two rak'ahs, that that will equal Umrah.&quot; That that will actually equal Umrah. So imagine if you just moved to Madinah, and you now have that comfort from the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam that going out to Quba is like going to Mecca and getting the reward of Umrah. So that's something that we still do today because in the mercy of Allah, though there might be context to these things, they are not restricted in their reward. This is something that is available to the entire ummah. And so you have one of the most hopeful hadiths. Not just about attaining the reward from Hajj, but Hajj with the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam. Imagine if you lived in Madinah, and everyone came back and you missed out, right? Think about the few people that did not get to go on Hajj with the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam, and it's being referred to as Hajjatul wada' the farewell Hajj, there's a chance that the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam won't go out again. And so people are really remorseful and regretful that did not go with the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam. And there's this particular woman, Umm Sinan Al-Ansariya radiAhlahu ta'ala Anha who was so sad because she wanted to go on Hajj with the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam, but she was unable to. So she goes to the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam and she complains to the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam about her situation. That, &quot;Ya Rasulullah, I missed Hajj with you.&quot; So this is after the Hajj, and the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam says, &quot;Well, what stopped you from doing Hajj with us O Umm Sinan?&quot; And she said, &quot;My husband only has two camels. He used one for himself to go out with Hajj for you. And the other camel is for irrigating our land, so I had no way to actually go out with Hajj or for Hajj with you SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam. The Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam could have given her a specific answer to her situation. He could have said to her for example, that you know, &quot;You had the sincere intention, so inshallah it counts.&quot; And that would have been true to everything that the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam had already said about so many other things, but instead a gift to the entire ummah. The Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam says to her, &quot;If you can go out in umrah in Ramadan fa inna umratul fi Ramadan, taqdi hajjatul ma'i &quot;If you do Umrah in Ramadan, it is equal to doing Hajj with me.&quot; Notice the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam did not tell her to go to Hajj next year, because the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam knew that he would not be around for Hajj next year. But he gave a gift to the ummah, may Allah reward Umm Sinan for asking the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam that question because when you see the Haram in normal circumstances full in the time of Ramadan, and the people flocking from all over the world, know that that is the reward of Hajj with the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam. Now you have all of these various deeds, and this is something that I want to end the series with because these are things that are accessible to all of us bi-idhnillah Ta'ala, and they all equal Hajj. And these are all authentic narrations that I'm going to share with you. What are the deeds that the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam mentioned equal Hajj? Number one, the most famous and the most common. The Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam said, &quot;Whoever prays in jama'ah, whoever prays in congregation, and remembers Allah from Fajr. So prays Fajr in congregation, and remembers Allah until sunrise.&quot; So they make dua or they do dhikr, they remember Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la in one of the legislated ways. &quot;And then they pray two rak'ahs after sunrise.&quot; Salat'ul Duha The Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam said &quot;That that person has the reward of Hajj, tamaa, tamaa, tamaa complete, complete, complete. The reward of Hajj and Umrah, complete, complete, complete.&quot; So that's something that you can do on a regular basis. You could pray Fjar, and you could stay until sunrise. And that is the reward of Hajj and Umrah. And that's something that the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam mentions authentically. Then there are other narrations, all of them authentic. One of them, the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam said, man masha ila salatin maqtubatin fil jama'ah &quot;Whoever walks to one of the obligatory prayers to pray in congregation. fahiha kahajjah Then that is the reward of Hajj.&quot; Wa man masha ila salatin tatawuh' &quot;And whoever walks to pray a voluntary prayer in the masjid, then that is our Umrah.&quot; And in one narration, the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam specifies, Salatul Duha So if a person one day decides that they want to go to salatul Duha, or they wanna go pray two rak'ahs in the masjid, Salatul Duha or a voluntary prayer, then that is the reward of umrah. And when a person walks to the mandatory salah, and the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam says, &quot;That is like a Hajj complete, complete, complete.&quot; Well what about the other things? And notice they all surround the masjid here, right. The Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam said, in another authentic hadith, min ghada ilan masjid, la yurridu illa anyata allama khayra auyu allima &quot;Whoever goes out to the masjid and what they want, the only thing that they want is to learn something good, or teach something good.&quot; So both the student and the teacher, when there's a hajaqah, and you go out to the masjid, to one of those circles of remembrance. And think about this by the way, in the age of everything being virtual now, especially post COVID, right? When things open up and you actually have the opportunity to go and listen to something in person, attend a class live, the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam said, &quot;kana lahu kaajlhi Hajj.&quot; &quot;That that person has the reward of a person who went out for Hajj, taama.&quot; And he said, &quot;All together, complete, complete, complete.&quot; Why is the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam keep saying tamaa? Because you might be thinking to yourself, &quot;Come on Ya Rasulullah, really? The entire Hajj?&quot; The Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam is saying, &quot;The reward of Hajj complete, complete, complete.&quot; So these are things subhanAllah that surround the masjid, that a person could do on a regular basis. Praying Salatul Fajr, and staying until Salatul Duha. Going to the obligatory prayer, or going to pray a voluntary prayer specifically, perhaps Salatul Duha when they have the opportunity to do so. Or a person going to the masjid to learn or to teach. May Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la make that reward accessible to all of us, Allahuma ameen. And then there's one more narration that I want to share with you in this regard also an authentic narration from Anas ibn Malik radiAllahu ta'ala Anhu. A powerful narration. He says that, &quot;A man came to the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam&quot; attarajun Nabi SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam afaqal, inni ashtahil jihaad. He said that, &quot;I want to go out and fight for the sake of Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la. I desire to go out and fight for the sake of Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la to struggle in the path of Allah. Wa inni la akdhiru ilaihi But I don't have the means to do so. So I can't go out in Tabuk. I can't go out in Hunayn. Ya Rasulullah I'm unable to do so. What was the answer of the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam? He said, &quot;hal baqi ahadun min walidayk? Are either of your two parents still alive?&quot; &quot;qala ummi&quot; He said, &quot;My mother.&quot; The Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam said, fa ablil laha udhran fibirriha The Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam said, &quot;Then show your closeness to Allah, come close to Allah with your intention, strive and struggle by obeying her, by showing her goodness, by giving her good companionship, by serving her and the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam.&quot; And of course, we know that when it comes to jihad, this is the famous narration of the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam. He sent the young man back, and he said, fafihi ma fajahaddun &quot;Strive in your parents, right? Strive in their favor, that go back to your mother, heaven is under her feet.&quot; But here in this particular narration, which is authentic narration, the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam says, fa innaka idha faaddhadhalik &quot;That if you do what I just told you, if you honor your mother,&quot; the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam said, fa anta hajj wa mu'tamur &quot;You are a person who is amongst those who do Hajj and mutamir you are one of those who has done umrah wa mujahid fi sabilillah So subhanAllah if one of your parents is alive, honoring your parents is like jihad and Hajj and Umrah all together.&quot; And this is an authentic narration from the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam. subhanAllah we find this throughout this entire series and throughout everything that the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam was doing in Hajj, Rasulullah SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam did not want to restrict our Islam to a single gathering but rather to transform our entire lives. And that's something that we take, even from the ultimate gathering that happened in this world with the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam. May Allah resurrect us in the ultimate gathering in the hereafter in his companionship, SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam and allow us to be his neighbors in Jannatul Firdous. Allahumma ameen, Jazakumullahu khairan Was Salaam Alaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuhu In these days, as we exert ourselves with all sorts of good deeds that our Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam taught us, we invite you to spend in the way of Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la so that we may all further ourselves along this journey and draw closer to him." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="we're receiving reports that several people have been injured in southern Israel in the city of ashalon following rocket attacks video shows damage to parts of residential buildings Israeli emergency services are responding to the scene Imran Khan has more from Tel Aviv just after 3 p.m. local time loud sirens were head where I am in central Tel Aviv I counted at least eight explosions local media uh saying that 10 explosions in total took place in the South and uh east of uh Central Tel Aviv uh then there was a message from the Israelis via loudspeaker telling people to remain in their shelter also we've seen a rocket being fired from Gaza into ashalon where two people were lightly injured now where I am is actually nicknamed hostage swear it's worth showing you around uh this is effectively the headquarters of the bring them back campaign now their meeting uh with the Israeli War cabinet that's a meeting they've been asking for almost since the War Began 60 days ago um what they want from this meeting is to find out exactly what the Israeli War cabinet is doing to bring the remaining captives back home however the slogan of this campaign is not bring them back but bring them back now they want this to be done as quickly as possible and given the intense pressure uh that the Israeli War cabinet is under to fight this war from the more far right elements of the of uh the liid party which is the party of both the defense minister and the Prime Minister and the pressure that they're under from the Americans to allow humanitarian Aid in getting the captives out is although a priority not possibly a priority right this minute and that's what these uh captives families want they want these captives to be released as quickly as possible Imran Khan Al jazer Tel Aviv all right now mayor zon is a senior Israeli Analyst at the international crisis group joins us now live from Tel Aviv good to have you with us so first of all let me start with a line that's just been dropping about the Israeli government saying to families of the captives that they are unlikely to be able to release all of the captives how are families receiving this or likely to receive this kind of this kind of statement well I think the families of the hostages that are still there are absolutely up in arms about the what seems like a decision by the Israeli government uh when the truce fell apart uh to go into Gaza uh and continue its operation with full force and intensity without providing any information on how or when it will get back these hostages and as the families have said the hostages are the priority because they are the ones whose lives are at stake whereas the operation is something that can happen after they are securely brought back home so I think that there is uh extreme pressure and extreme anger amongst the families of the hostages and the Israeli public at large that the government doesn't really seem to be providing a clear plan not only on how to bring home the hostages but on how to secure a victory uh what we're seeing I mean the people who do see the images from Gaza are seeing death and destruction and we're not really seeing so much of the achievement of the military objective to bring down Hamas so I think Israelis are very upset and very confused how um does the resumption of Israeli strikes how does it impact netanyahu's position well netanyahu's position right now seems quite secure uh he has the full backing of the us to continue with this war he has a far-right government that some of them have been calling for uh reoccupying Gaza for settling Gaza now Israel claims that that's not uh its objective but uh despite the fact that most of the Israeli public is not happy with Netanyahu and doesn't trust him even before October 7th there doesn't seem to be any kind of way to get him out of office and so for now he's in office and people are still in trauma and in shock and and were at War and so the situation is that the longer that this uh operation continues it seems like he'll be able to continue to remain in his seat at the same time if Israel isn't able to provide um achievements in this operation I think Israelis will will lose uh more and more of their patience and there's also hundreds of thousands of reservists uh who are you know currently in the Army they're in the North or in the South uh the economy is being hurt so there is even an internal time limit I think to this and and there are more and more calls for Netanyahu to step down this is something that was going on a lot all of the last all of this last year um I think that will gain momentum but for the time being netanyahu's position is is quite strong and there is consensus in Israel that he that it's it's the right objective that it we need to topple Hamas so in that sense um he's in a pretty secure place we know that Israel withdrew its negotiating teams from qat do you think negotiations are going to have to resume at some point or how do you read the the mind set right now amongst Israeli decision makers do they just plan to go ahead and continue this bombing campaign endlessly well I think uh the reason for bringing back the uh negotiating team and whether or not some form of negotiation is still going on you know it's hard to tell it's hard to know exactly what's happening I assume that the actors Qatar Egypt the US and to an extent Israel as well is is and Hamas are they're interested in negotiating forther releases but uh Israel is very very adamant about uh a ground operation to um to get to Hamas uh senior officials I think they are very clearly interested in trying to take out senoir and they are determined to do that and they they don't think that anything less uh than toppling Hamas both militarily and as far as its governing capabilities will bring them security that's their line now I don't I don't necessarily think that that's an effective approach but that's the approach that they've chosen so it seems like they will continue to do this until uh the US uh steps up its pressure which does not currently seem likely to make them stop or the in general the humanitarian disaster which we're seeing unfold in Gaza starts to create more and more pressure um but so far that doesn't seem to be the case and if Israel is able to both allow and ramp up humanitarian Aid into the strip it seems like that will be enough uh for the US to stand down on that point we've heard from people like 35 un experts on October this 16th referred to a genocide in the making as to what Israel's military operation was doing how much awareness of the Carnage is there amongst Israeli public opinion how much focus is on that there really isn't that much focus on that because Israelis are completely focused inwards uh they're focused everybody has somebody that was either taken captive or a victim of the October 7th attack and as it is as I'm sure your audience knows uh the Palestinian issue was sidelined and has been sidelined for for decades really in Israeli Society uh Israel has not had to pay a price for its policies of occupation and segregation uh and what some human rights organizations of course call apartheid so these are not the issues that consume Israelis but of course the October 7th attack changed that so now Israelis are forced to deal with the Palestinian issue on some level but they're not dealing with it by you know by seeing images of what's happening in Gaza that's not that's not what's happening in Israeli mainstream media what we're seeing is just that Hamas is a terrorist organization that it's evil um and that it needs to be wiped out um that's what Israelis understand and and they are legitimately uh you know their security was shattered the government itself failed to secure and protect Israelis on October 7th so um Israelis are really just focused inward but I think what they're going to have to understand at some point is that it's not just about trying to Decap you know to incapacitate Hamas it's also about changing an Israeli government and making it so that Israel Israel and its leadership can actually provide stability and security something that we still don't see after 60 days in Gaza thanks so much mov on sign" />

เรื่องราวเกี่ยวกับความเปลี่ยนแปลง แม่น้ำโขงที่เกิดขึ้นเนี่ย ตลอดระยะเวลาที่ผ่านมาที่มีเขื่อน ทางตอนบนเนี่ย 20 ปี มันก็มีผลกระทบเกิดขึ้นหลายอย่าง มันไม่ค่อยมีปลาขึ้นมา เดี๋ยวนี้น้ำมันแห้งมันก็มีปลาน้อย ดิฉันคิดว่านี่ไม่ใช่แค่ปัญหาของชุมชน ลุ่มแม่น้ำโขงอีกต่อไป มันเป็นปัญหาของทุกคน ไม่ว่าจะเป็นจีน-สหรัฐฯ หรือเวียดนาม-ไทย หรือใครก็ตาม เราต่อสู้เพื่อสิทธิของแม่น้ำ เราต่อสู้เพื่อสิทธิของพวกเราเอง แม้ว่าดิฉันจะเป็นลูกสาวของแม่น้ำโขง ดิฉันเกิดที่นี่ แต่นี่ไม่ใช่แม่น้ำของดิฉันคนเดียว นี่คือแม่น้ำของทุกคน เพราะมันเป็นแม่น้ำโขง สายเดียวของโลก ใช่ไหม โลกนี้มีแม่น้ำโขงเพียงสายเดียว และมันหล่อเลี้ยงพวกเรา มันหล่อเลี้ยงมหาสมุทร และตะกอนทั้งหมดที่เคยไหลลงสู่ทะเลจีนใต้ สู่มหาสมุทร กำลังถูกปิดกั้นโดยเขื่อนเหล่านั้น โรงไฟฟ้าพลังน้ำเหล่านั้น และเราไม่เห็นมาตรการที่รับผิดชอบ ในการบรรเทาปัญหาเหล่านี้เลย แม่น้ำโขงไหลเป็นระยะทางเกือบ 5,000 กิโลเมตร จากที่ราบสูงทิเบต ผ่านจีน พม่า ลาว ไทย กัมพูชา และเวียดนาม ก่อนจะไหลลงสู่ทะเลจีนใต้ แม่น้ำและลำน้ำสาขาเป็นรากฐานของวิถีชีวิต และอัตลักษณ์ทางวัฒนธรรมของผู้คน 17 ล้านคนในลุ่มน้ำโขงตอนล่าง ในจำนวนนี้ ส่วนใหญ่เป็นชาวประมงและเกษตรกร ที่พึ่งพาการไหลตามธรรมชาติของแม่น้ำ เพื่อการดำรงชีพ อย่างไรก็ตาม ระบบแม่น้ำที่ไหลอย่างอิสระ ในช่วงต้นทศวรรษ 1990 กลับถูกแทรกแซงและแบ่งแยก เพราะการสร้างโรงไฟฟ้าพลังงานน้ำ ในช่วงกลางทศวรรษ 1980 การก่อสร้างเขื่อนหลัก 12 แห่งตามแม่น้ำโขง เริ่มต้นขึ้น โดยเป็นส่วนหนึ่งของแคมเปญของ ปักกิ่งเพื่อพัฒนาจังหวัดที่ยากจนทางตะวันตก และจ่ายไฟฟ้าให้กับภาคอุตสาหกรรม ชายฝั่งตะวันออกที่กำลังเติบโต โดยไม่มีการปรึกษาหรือเตือนผู้ที่อาศัย อยู่ทางปลายน้ำเลย เราจำการเปลี่ยนแปลงได้ การเปลี่ยนแปลง อย่างรุนแรงของระบบนิเวศ ความผันผวนของระดับน้ำที่ผิดปกติ ภัยแล้งที่เกิดขึ้นอย่างฉับพลัน น้ำท่วมฉับพลัน ที่ไม่สอดคล้องกับ การไหลตามฤดูกาลของแม่น้ำโขง วันนี้ ระดับน้ำสูงขึ้น สองสามวันต่อมา น้ำก็ลดลง เมื่อเขื่อนมีน้ำมากขึ้น พวกเขาก็เปิดเขื่อน ทำให้พื้นที่ตอนล่างน้ำท่วม บ้านเรือนบางหลังก็จมน้ำไป เขื่อนจีนจะมีส่วนทำให้เกิดปรากฎการณ์เหล่านี้ หรือไม่นั้น ยังคงเป็นที่ถกเถียงกันอยู่ แต่ประเทศที่ได้รับผลกระทบก็ไม่ได้ปราศจากความผิด ไม่ใช่แค่จีนที่ต้องรับผิดชอบ แน่นอน จีนต้องรับผิดชอบ พวกเขาเป็นกลุ่มแรก ๆ ที่สร้างเขื่อน โดยไม่สนใจผลกระทบต่อพื้นที่ตอนล่าง ไม่สนใจเสียงของคนท้องถิ่นในประเทศปลายน้ำ แต่ผู้เล่นทั้งหมดจากในภูมิภาคและนอกภูมิภาค ก็มีส่วนเกี่ยวข้องเช่นกัน แต่เราจะระบุตัวพวกเขาอย่างไร เราจะทำอย่างไรให้พวกเขาจะประพฤติตน อย่างมีความรับผิดชอบ บริษัทเอกชนทำการก่อสร้างเพื่อแสวงหากำไร แต่ประเทศทางตอนล่างก็มีส่วนรู้เห็นด้วย ลาวฝากความหวังการพัฒนาเศรษฐกิจไว้กับพลังงานน้ำ โดยมีเขื่อนที่ดำเนินการอยู่ 77 แห่ง สองแห่งอยู่บนแม่น้ำโขงสายหลัก มีการวางแผนจะสร้างอีก 61 แห่ง เจ็ดแห่งจะอยู่บนแม่น้ำสายหลัก กัมพูชาประกาศห้ามสร้างเขื่อนบนแม่น้ำสายหลัก เป็นเวลา 10 ปีในปี 2020 แต่ยังคงสร้างเขื่อนบนลำน้ำสาขา และนำเข้าไฟฟ้าจากลาวอยู่ เวียดนาม ซึ่งรับผลกระทบส่วนใหญ่ ของพื้นที่ปลายน้ำ ก็สร้างเขื่อนทางต้นน้ำและลงทุน ในเขื่อนของลาวด้วย ไทยไม่ได้สร้างเขื่อนขนาดใหญ่ตั้งแต่ปี 1994 แต่เป็นผู้ลงทุนรายใหญ่ที่สุดในเขื่อนของลาว และซื้อไฟฟ้าจากลาวเช่นกัน แม้จะมีความกระตือรือร้นในช่วงแรกเกี่ยวกับ โครงการพัฒนาอื่นๆ ของจีนตามแม่น้ำโขง รวมถึงเขื่อนไฟฟ้าพลังน้ำตามแม่น้ำ ในส่วนของประเทศจีน ไทยก็เริ่มระมัดระวังมากขึ้นเกี่ยวกับโครงการ ที่อาจทำร้ายผลประโยชน์ของประเทศ ในต้นปี 2020 โครงการจีน ในการระเบิดแก่งในแม่น้ำโขง เพื่อเปิดทางให้เรือขนาดใหญ่ จากจีนแล่นลงมาตามแม่น้ำ ถูกยกเลิกโดยคณะรัฐมนตรีไทย ส่วนหนึ่งเป็นเพราะการรณรงค์ที่นำโดย นักเคลื่อนไหวด้านสิ่งแวดล้อม เช่น เพียรพร ดีเทศน์ และนิวัฒน์ ร้อยแก้ว หรือที่รู้จักกันในนาม ครูตี๋ เราร่วมกันรณรงค์ต่อต้านการระเบิดแก่งในแม่น้ำโขง เพื่อการเดินเรือขนาดใหญ่ที่ เสนอโดยทางจีนและบริษัทจีน มันเป็นการทำลายแม่น้ำโขงแบบ แบบที่เราเรียกว่ามันน่ากลัว เพราะว่ามันเป็นการ ระเบิดเอาเกาะ แก่ง หินผา ออกไป มันมีการระเบิดออก หรือขุดออกไปเนี่ย เรื่องพวกนี้มีผลกระทบหมด ใช่ไหม เรื่องของปลา เรื่องของพันธุ์พืชต่าง ๆ ที่อยู่ตามเกาะดอนต่าง ๆ แล้วก็จะมีผลประทบเรื่องความมั่นคง ทางอาหารของคนด้วย ประชาชนเป็นห่วงเรื่องความมั่นคง ด้านทรัพยากรธรรมชาติ ความมั่นคงทางอาหาร และความมั่นคงของชาติ จะเกิดอะไรขึ้นถ้าสิ่งกีดขวางตามธรรมชาติเหล่านี้ ถูกนำออกไปหมด และเรือขนาดใหญ่จากจีนสามารถ เข้ามาถึงไทยได้อย่างง่ายดาย แม่น้ำโขงกลายสนามการแข่งขันระหว่างสหรัฐฯ กับจีน และบางครั้งนักข่าวและผู้กำหนดนโยบาย ก็บอกว่าเป็นจุดวิกฤตทางภูมิรัฐศาสตร์ เทียบได้กับทะเลจีนใต้ มันยังเป็นพื้นที่ที่มีการแข่งขัน ระหว่างประเทศมหาอำนาจ ทั้งอเมริกา จีน อินโดนีเซีย เกาหลีใต้ ออสเตรเลีย การบอกว่าแม่น้ำโขงเป็นสนามแข่งขันของมหาอำนาจ สร้างความไม่พอใจให้กับผู้คนในภูมิภาคนี้ เพราะมีนัยว่าพวกเขาต้องเลือกข้าง ระหว่างจีนกับสหรัฐฯ ประเทศลุ่มน้ำโขงตอนล่างต้องรักษาสมดุลระหว่าง ความสัมพันธ์ทางเศรษฐกิจที่แน่นแฟ้นกับจีน กับการปกป้องผลประโยชน์ของชาติที่อาจไม่สอดคล้อง กับแนวทางของปักกิ่ง ในขณะเดียวกัน สหรัฐฯ ก็วิจารณ์เขื่อน ของจีนบนแม่น้ำโขง และการทูตโครงสร้างพื้นฐานของจีน ในขณะที่เรื่องราวทั้งหมดนี้กำลังเกิดขึ้นอยู่ ชุมชนที่ยากจนและชุมชนชายขอบในลุ่มน้ำโขง กลับเป็นผู้ที่ต้องรับมือกับความเสียหาย ต่อแม่น้ำที่เกิดขึ้นอย่างต่อเนื่อง มันก็มีหลายอย่างนะที่เป็นผลกระทบ นอกจากหนึ่ง เรือมันวิ่งไม่ได้แล้วใช่ไหม เรือมันวิ่งไม่ได้เพราะน้ำตื้น ตื้นเขิน เรือวิ่งไม่ได้ แล้วก็พวกที่เขาทำประมง มันก็มีผลกระทบต่อพวกเขา เพราะน้ำมันจะเปลี่ยนอยู่ตลอดเวลา เพราะว่าในฤดูน้ำหลากเนี่ย ฤดูฝนเนี่ย น้ำมันต้องยกระดับสูงขึ้น การที่น้ำมันยกระดับสูงขึ้นในฤดูฝนเนี่ย น้ำมันก็จะไหลเอ่อเข้าไปใน แม่น้ำสาขาต่าง ๆ ของแม่น้ำโขง ปลาจำนวนมากมันก็จะเข้าไปวางไข่ แต่หลายปีที่ผ่านมาบางปีเนี่ย บางปีน้ำมันก็ไม่ยกระดับขึ้นเต็มที่ ทำให้ปลาไม่สามารถเข้าไปวางไข่ในแม่น้ำสาขาได้ มันก็ทำให้ปลาเนี่ย ปริมาณปลามันลดลง มีผลกระทบ การที่มีปลาลดลงก็มีผลกระทบกับคนหาปลา พี่น้องชาวบ้านที่พึ่งพาอาศัยปลาเป็นโปรตีน เมื่อสองสัปดาห์ที่แล้ว ดิฉันไปล่องเรือ กับครูตี๋ที่ชายแดน และเราจอดที่หาดทรายแห่งหนึ่งซึ่ง มีผู้หญิงลาวมาเก็บสาหร่ายน้ำจืด มาเก็บไก ดิฉันคุยกับเธอ และเธอบอกว่าการเก็บสาหร่าย ในช่วงหน้าแล้งเมื่อน้ำใส เธอได้เงินถึงวันละ 1,500 บาท ซึ่งถือว่าเยอะมาก และทันใดนั้นเมื่อระดับน้ำลดลงเพราะเขื่อนจิ่งหง สาหร่ายก็หายไป ในภาวะปกติ มันไม่ได้เป็นแค่รายได้เท่านั้น มันให้ศักดิ์ศรีด้วย เพราะมันเป็นเงินของเราเอง เราไม่ต้องพึ่งพาสามี พ่อ หรือสมาชิกชายในครอบครัว ดังนั้นคุณค่าจึงไม่ใช่แค่ทางเศรษฐกิจ แต่เป็นศักดิ์ศรีของคุณในฐานะมนุษย์ด้วย แล้วคุณค่าแบบนี้ จะได้รับการมองเห็น บันทึก และจัดระบบ ในการตัดสินใจได้อย่างไร นั่นเป็นความท้าทายที่ใหญ่มาก การเปลี่ยนแปลงสิ่งแวดล้อมเหล่านี้ อาจนำไปสู่การย้ายถิ่นฐานครั้งใหญ่ ซึ่งในที่สุดอาจนำไปสู่ความขัดแย้งในสังคม และความไม่มั่นคงทางการเมืองในแต่ละประเทศ แม้จะมีปัญหา แต่ประเทศลุ่มน้ำโขงตอนล่างส่วนใหญ่ ก็ยังคงสร้างและให้เงินทุนในการสร้างเขื่อนไฟฟ้าพลังน้ำขนาดใหญ่ ผู้สนับสนุนพลังงานน้ำโต้แย้งว่าเขื่อน ช่วยผลักดันการพัฒนาเศรษฐกิจ ควบคุมน้ำท่วม ลดภัยแล้ง และช่วยบรรเทาความยากจน พวกเขาบอกว่าพลังงานน้ำเป็นแหล่งพลังงานสีเขียว และมีความยั่งยืน แต่ไม่ใช่ทุกคนที่คิดแบบนั้น พลังงานน้ำจากแม่น้ำโขงถูกมองว่าเป็น มองผิด ๆ ว่าเป็นแหล่งไฟฟ้าสีเขียว มันอาจจะไม่ปล่อยคาร์บอน แต่มันไม่ยั่งยืน และมันยังเพิ่มปัญหาให้กับคนอื่น ๆ ด้วย ผลเสียโรงไฟฟ้าพลังงานน้ำขนาดใหญ่ รวมถึงการสูญเสียทรัพยากรประมงและตะกอน รวมทั้งค่าใช้จ่ายที่จำเป็นในการชดเชย ชุมชนที่ต้องย้ายถิ่นฐาน และจัดหาอาชีพอื่นให้ ต้องถูกนำมาชั่งน้ำหนักกับผลประโยชน์ ที่คาดว่าจะได้จากการผลิตไฟฟ้า การชลประทาน และการควบคุมน้ำท่วม แม่น้ำที่ไหลข้ามพรมแดนมักจะส่งเสริม ความร่วมมือระหว่างประเทศ มากกว่าสร้างความขัดแย้ง ในภูมิภาคลุ่มน้ำโขงก็เป็นเช่นนั้น รัฐต่าง ๆ ร่วมมือกันสร้าง โครงสร้างพื้นฐานขนาดใหญ่ แต่กลับเมินเฉยต่อความเสียหายด้านสิ่งแวดล้อม และผลกระทบทางสังคมที่เกิดขึ้นจาก แก่นของเรื่องนี้คือการที่รัฐกลัวที่จะ สูญเสียสิทธิอธิปไตยของตน ในการหาผลประโยชน์ทางเศรษฐกิจสูงสุด จากทรัพยากรน้ำที่มีอยู่ ปัญหาแม่น้ำโขงทุกวันนี้ก็เพราะว่า &quot;ฉันสร้างในบ้านฉัน&quot; นี่แหละ คำว่า &quot;สเตท&quot; หรือว่าอำนาจของรัฐอ่ะ มันยังอยู่เหนือคำว่าการใช้ทรัพยากรร่วม หรือว่าการดูแลทรัพยากรร่วมกัน มันยังอยู่เหนือกว่าไง แม้จะเป็นเช่นนี้ เรายังมีความหวังอยู่ หากผู้กำหนดนโยบายยอมรับสิ่งที่กำลังเกิดขึ้น และลงมือแก้ไขในตอนนี้ การหาแหล่งพลังงานที่ปล่อยมลพิษต่ำในภูมิภาคนี้ ที่ไม่ต้องพึ่งพาพลังงานน้ำขนาดใหญ่ ย่อมเป็นไปได้ หากเร่งการลงทุนในพลังงานหมุนเวียน ประเทศลุ่มน้ำโขงตอนล่างก็จะสามารถ ลดหรือกำจัดการปล่อยมลพิษได้ และยังคงรองรับความต้องการ พลังงานที่เพิ่มขึ้นได้ภายในปี 2050 ผ่านการผสมผสานพลังงานแสงอาทิตย์ ลม ชีวมวล และการผลิตไฟฟ้าพลังน้ำแบบสูบกลับนอกลำน้ำ แม่น้ำโขงควรได้รับความสำคัญเป็นลำดับแรก เพราะเป็นแหล่งที่ความหลากหลายทางชีวภาพสูง ในการสนับสนุนทางการเงินเพื่อความยั่งยืน ระดับนานาชาติ การเก็บและแบ่งปันข้อมูลมีความสำคัญต่อ การบริหารจัดการพลังงานน้ำในลุ่มน้ำโขงให้ดีขึ้น และเพื่อบรรเทาผลกระทบ โดยเฉพาะจากปัญหาน้ำท่วม ในการแบ่งปันข้อมูล ควรรับฟังชุมชนที่เดือดร้อน เพื่อเพิ่มประสิทธิภาพของระบบเตือนภัยล่วงหน้า และเพื่อช่วยชี้นำการกำหนดนโยบาย และส่งเสริมความรับผิดชอบ เจ้าหน้าที่ควรเปิดโอกาสให้ผู้เดือดร้อน ได้แจ้งข้อกังวลต่อผู้กำหนดนโยบาย และมีส่วนร่วมในการตัดสินใจเกี่ยวกับ การพัฒนาที่จะส่งผลกระทบต่อพวกเขา สิ่งนี้จะช่วยส่งเสริมความเป็นอยู่ที่ดี ของประชาชนนับล้านที่อาศัยอยู่ในลุ่มแม่น้ำ ในระหว่างนี้ ภาคประชาสังคมกำลังพยายามเต็มที่ เพื่อส่งเสริมโครงการให้ความรู้แก่สาธารณชน เกี่ยวกับสถานการณ์ปัจจุบัน และเพื่อสร้างความเข้าใจอย่างถ่องแท้ ในคุณค่าของแม่น้ำโขง เรื่องแม่น้ำโขงเนี่ย การแก้ไขปัญหา แม่น้ำโขงเนี่ยมันคงไม่ได้สิ้นสุดที่รุ่นเราหรอก มันจะต้องไปถึงรุ่นลูกรุ่นหลานอะไรอีก ซึ่งเราต้องทำเรื่องโฮงเฮียนของเราไง ทุกวันเนี้ย ก็เพื่ออย่างเงี้ย เราก็คิดว่านี่เป็นเรื่องที่สำคัญต่อการที่จะ ต้องปกป้องแม่น้ำโขงในอนาคต ต้องทำอย่างนี้ ดิฉันในฐานะลูกสาวของแม่น้ำโขง ครูตี๋ในฐานะลูกชายของแม่น้ำโขง และพวกเราในฐานะลูกของแม่น้ำโขง เราจะอยู่ที่นี่ ปกป้องสิทธิของแม่น้ำโขง ไว้เป็นมรดกให้แก่ทุกคน"

          <attvalue for="3" value="War in Sudan has pushed about one million refugees and returnees into isolated and impoverished parts of neighbouring Chad. &#10;&#10;Crisis Group expert Charles Bouëssel visited this region to learn how it is coping with the influx." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Since the outbreak of the war in Sudan in April 2023, more than 970,000 people from Sudan have sought refuge in eastern Chad, particularly in the Ouaddaï region, which hosts the majority of the refugees. This region already had a poverty rate much higher than the rest of the country and the more than 50 percent increase in population size within the space of a few months threatens to destabilise a region that was already suffering from very serious problems. We have a rapid increase in unemployment rates. Wages are being driven down. Food prices are increasing. Rental prices are rising, we have widespread inflation. The lack of professional and economic opportunities in the region is pushing many young Chadians to seek to emigrate, particularly to the northern part of Chad, in the Tibesti region, where gold mining and gold panning are widespread. Some even decide to continue their journey to Libya, hoping to find work there or even to make their way to Europe. Of course, this is a very dangerous journey, but as socio-economic conditions continue to stagnate, we are likely to see an increase in these migration flows. Inevitably, we’re seeing more and more Chadians, people I've spoken to, blaming refugees for the increase in prices, and there have already been a few attacks. For now this remains very limited, but refugees continue to arrive. It must be acknowledged that the humanitarian response to this crisis has been very quick. But this humanitarian response is underfunded, and this underfunding generates violence. If the humanitarians receive more resources they could prioritise targeting the points that triggered the first episodes of violence and which are the most sensitive issues, namely: access to water and access to firewood. If you stop at a water source, you’ll see people arriving by cart, on horseback, from very far away, several dozen kilometers, to fetch water. One of them, with whom I had the chance to speak, told me that from his perspective the state had done nothing for this area since Tombalbaye, who was the first Chadian president after independence. That gives an idea of the feeling of abandonment the region has been experiencing for decades. In some refugee camps, the basic minimum of six litres of water per day per person is barely met. In these refugee camps, you can see long lines of women with their jerrycans waiting to collect drinking water. And you can already feel the tension, the very high tension, in these queues, with people fearing they will arrive too late, that the supplies will no longer be enough for them. So disputes occasionally break out. Two main risks could lead to an escalation of violence in eastern Chad. The first is the severe deterioration of the socio-economic situation. The second concerning factor is the rise in intercommunal tensions. And if I want to summarise very roughly, the main fault line is between the Arab populations and the non-Arab populations. The majority of the Sudanese refugees who have arrived belong to non-Arab communities, many of whom have suffered very violent atrocities at the hands of one of the parties to the Sudanese conflict, the Rapid Support Forces, which are mostly made up of Arab communities. So, these refugees arrive in Chad with very strong anger, a deep, visceral hatred toward Arabs, which adds to pre-existing tensions in the region and could lead to significant intercommunal conflicts. These tensions are tied to anxieties surrounding identity, especially among the non-Arab populations who have seen Arab herders, particularly from northern Chad, arriving since the 1980s. They feel that their customary power and control over the land are threatened by the herders, who practice mainly pastoralism, while the local populations are more sedentary and practice agriculture. In addition to being stigmatised, especially in Ouaddaï, they were used to selling their livestock in Sudan. Since the war broke out in Sudan, these sales networks have disappeared, and Sudanese herders are now coming to Chad to sell their cattle, so the supply has increased. This has led to a decrease in demand and an increase in supply, which has caused the prices of cattle, camels, and especially goats, to drop. We are aware that Chad does not have unlimited resources, and we commend the measures that have already been taken, particularly infrastructure projects on one hand, but also initiatives to combat the high cost of living, such as cash envelope distributions to households in Ouaddaï to address rising food prices and increasing rates of malnutrition. It would be important to continue these policies and, where possible, expand them. That's one thing. The other is that the Chadian authorities also have levers, tools, to reduce intercommunal tensions, particularly between Arab and non-Arab populations. They could make more visits to the region. This would send a positive signal that the state has not forgotten them, with state representatives who could deliver messages of peace. And finally, the Chadian government, as well as humanitarian organizations, could strengthen the capacities of the mixed committees. These committees are made up of members from different communities in the region, These committees are made up of members from different communities in the region, as well as representatives of the refugees. They provide them with a framework for dialogue. Therefore, these communities play a critical role and, for the moment, they have helped prevent the spread of violence." />

The threat perceptions about China’s strategic ambitions, concerns about Washington’s reliability, and growing competition and insecurity prompting governments in the region to upgrade their military capabilities.

          <attvalue for="7" value="We are introducing a new series called Asia’s Military Modernisation: a series of reports that looks into the geopolitical tensions in the Indo-Pacific; how countries in Asia react and respond to the growing, intensifying great power competition between the U.S. and China, particularly in the military space. So in this series, we are zooming into America’s Asian allies, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Australia because those are the countries that showcase the most changes in their military and defence postures; not only in terms of their capability building, but also in changing their military doctrine. So China in recent decades has made a great leap in projecting their military capabilities. From a fairly outdated military, the People’s Liberation Army is now a very formidable force, to the degree that many say it can compete with the United States, which is the world’s most powerful military power. And by and large, U.S. military spending is still dwarfing China’s. But China’s progress in both PLA, navy, space and in many other aspects, including non-strictly military like the coast guard, has made very significant advances to the degree that the U.S. feels it can be a risk, it can be a threat to the U.S. and U.S. power projection, as well as its network of allies in the region. China’s objectives are, of course, first and foremost defending its own sovereignty. But it has claims, in a number of regions, and disputes, border disputes, whether they are land or maritime, with a number of neighbours. And in recent decades we have noticed an increase in China's willingness to project that power, to conduct more exercises to showcase its power, but also increasingly claim control over disputed areas, including building military outposts in the disputed waters, conducting exercises and at times even incurring into the disputed waters or airspaces. So the countries we are looking into have several commonalities. They are, of course, American allies in the region. They share the threat perception towards China’s growing projection of its military capability and willingness to demonstrate it in the disputed areas. And certainly being China’s neighbours, some of them closer than others, they feel the heat, so to speak. But on the other hand, they also have a certain degree of anxiety about U.S. commitments to the region, commitments to the alliances, especially now that President Donald Trump is back. And he is very publicly known for not valuing alliance relationships and especially, I think, alliances in Asia, where many of those countries have the perception that they are not getting enough of Trump’s attention, because he tends to focus on big powers, right. Major players. And therefore we see changes in their defence policies, defence spending, and defence doctrine, in general. International Crisis Group is venturing into squarely talking about geopolitics for the Asia region. It is an opportunity to advocate for de-escalation, understanding and shedding some light and transparency into the defence and military trends in the region." />

Wolff says the Trump administration's tariff strategy is borne out of an ahistorical &quot;notion of the United States as a victim&quot; despite the fact that &quot;we have been one of the greatest beneficiaries in the last 50 years of economic wealth, particularly for people at the top.&quot; In response to the growing economic fortunes of the rest of the world and the associated decline in U.S. hegemony, Trump and his allies are &quot;striking out at other people&quot; in desperation and denial of an end to U.S. imperial dominance. &quot;[It's] not going to work,&quot; says Wolff.&#10;&#10;Democracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on over 1,500 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

global tariffs in modern US history including a 10% blanket tariff on all imported goods from about 185 countries In addition many US trading partners including the European Union China and Japan will see even higher tariffs China now faces a total 54% tariff Trump announced the plan during a speech in the Rose Garden at the White House My fellow Americans this is Liberation Day waiting for a long time April 2nd 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn the day America's destiny was reclaimed and the day that we began to make America wealthy again Going to make it wealthy good and wealthy For decades our country has been looted pillaged raped and plundered by nations near and far both friend and foe alike American steel workers auto workers farmers and skilled craftsmen We have a lot of them here with us today They really suffered gravely They watched in anguish as foreign leaders have stolen our jobs foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream The impact of Trump's tariffs are expected to be felt around the world While Trump claims the tariffs will boost the US economy many economists fear it could lead to a recession or worse Trump's trade war could also shift global alliances as countries seek new trading partners China Japan South Korea have already announced plans to increase trading ties and coordinate their response to Trump's tariffs We begin today's show with Richard Wolf professor of economics ammeritus University of Massachusetts Ammeris visiting professor in the graduate program in international affairs at the New School He's the founder of Democracy at Work and hosts a weekly national TV radio program called Economic Update The author of a number of books including most recently Understanding Capitalism and the Sickness is the System: When Capitalism Fails to Save Us from Pandemics or Itself Professor Wolf it's great to have you with us again Well start off by responding to and were you surprised shocked or do you you guess that well about 185 countries were going to have see increased or tariffs On the on the one hand we knew something like this was coming On the other hand the sweep and the scope of it does make you stop Mr Trump is right It is a changing moment in American history and world history But I think his representation of what's going on is completely fantastical and has only to do with the self-promotion uh that he is engaged in most of the time It was never foreigners who did it to us This notion of the United States is a victim We have been one of the greatest beneficiaries in the last 50 years of economic wealth particularly for people at the top just like him Uh it has nothing to do with foreigners taking advantage of us This attempt to make himself strong and powerful relative to others to blame the foreigner These are cheap shots that a a real president wouldn't do And there's the most important point The American economy is in trouble The American empire is in decline We don't want to discuss it in this country We engage in denial and instead we are striking out at other people a sad way of handling a decline The British Empire declined before us So did all the others We are now at that point We had a great 20th century 21st century is different You have to face those problems That's not being done What's being done is to say we have difficulties but they're all somebody else's fault and we're going to solve it by punishing them I would like to point out as you suggest quite rightly Amy that the rest of the world is not going to sit by The United States does not have the power it had in the 20th century It is not in the position it seems to imagine itself when the secretary of of the treasury added to Mr Trump's comments that he warned the rest of the world not to retaliate That would imply that if they do there would be escalation Yes he said there will be escalation Well nothing will guarantee more escalation than if they do nothing because then it's an invitation to Mr Trump to keep doing it as each of these efforts doesn't work Given how dramatic this was yesterday is it possible he was deciding this to the very last second as they put this off And um explain exactly You're a professor you're a teacher Most people don't even realize how tariffs work Okay A tariff is a tax It's just a particular tax that got that name It used to be called import duty All it means is when something comes into the United States that was produced outside and is brought in to be sold it has to pay a tax as literally as it crosses our border into our country It is paid by the American company that brings it in which may pass it on to the consumer Usually what happens and the tax goes to Uncle Sam It goes to Washington Mr Trump loved to suggest that tariffs were paid by the others a little bit like Mexico would pay for the wall Never happened It's not going to happen here either It's an American tax Is there something remarkable that clues you in to how big a change this is That the Republican party which has branded itself as the anti-ax party for a century is now imposing the most massive tax imaginable Why this big change because we have big big problems and this kind of slapping the rest of the world is an attempt to solve a little bit of them but it is not going to work because we don't have the power to do it anymore I want to go to UAW President Sean Feain uh who supports Trump's new tariff saying last week we applaud the Trump administration for stepping up to end the free trade disaster that's devastated workingclass communities for decades Fain spoke Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation We've seen over 90,000 manufacturing facilities leave the United States We've seen uh in the big three alone in the last 20 plus years 65 plants have closed Um you know and so look tariffs aren't the uh total solution Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to uh get these companies to do the right thing and and and and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here uh and and you know invest in the American workers if they're going to bring jobs back here You know they need to be life sustaining jobs where people can make a a good wage a living wage have adequate health care and have a retirement security and not have to work seven days a week or multiple jobs just to scrape to get by paycheck to paycheck Well while UAW President Sean Feain praised Trump's tariffs he also said he had great concerns about President Trump's move to eliminate contracts for 700,000 federal workers the firing of workers at the National Institute of Health and other agencies I was a bit disappointed I like John Fain many of us do But this was disappointing to say basically I will support the president because he does something that might help my union Even though Sean Feain knows as most economists do that if you put a tax on the goods coming in they will go up in price because we have to pay that tax now And that will lead to domestic producers able to raise their prices because their competitors from abroad are stuck with this tax So we expect a boost to inflation which is going to hurt the working class of this country in in a very serious way especially if it if it builds on itself which often happens when you do tariffs like this And I want to remind everyone including Sean Feain that that the auto workers also represent workers in places that need export markets that produce in America and sell abroad When those countries retaliate as they likely will we will lose export markets and that will mean fewer jobs And no one let me stress no one now knows whether the jobs lost from this trade war will be greater or smaller than any jobs that are gained It is a big risk being taken by Mr Trump And if it doesn't go well it'll be very bad for the American economy It will produce the recession folks are worried about because if the prices go up people buy less and that loses jobs When you look at all of this this is an incredibly risky effort to blame the world punish the world and then cross his fingers which is what he's doing hoping it comes out all right Reminds me of a fed a football metaphor This is a Hail Mary pass You throw it down the field you hope it bounces into your team's hands but that's all it is a long shot And it's a sign of how troubled the American economy now is If you can put this in the bigger picture uh talk about the tax cuts and how they fit into the tariffs the what is it something like 4 trillion dollars in tax cuts and who benefits and then talk about the other issues that President Trump keeps saying that they're not going to touch even though uh what many call his co-president Elon Musk whether he steps back from being you know giving speeches or not uh going after social security issues like Medicaid Let me start with the tax issue The biggest single thing that Trump did in his first presidency was the tax cut of of December 2017 And when that tax cut was written into law it had a sunset It expires this year 2025 If that is expiration is allowed to happen corporations and the rich who were the big bene beneficiaries back then will face a big tax cut He doesn't want to do that because that's his base That's his donor support He doesn't want to have those taxes go back up Well then what is he going to have to do If he keeps on spending and he doesn't let those taxes go back up he's going to have to borrow trillions as we have been doing He doesn't want to be the president who keeps borrowing trillions in part because the rest of the world is a major creditor of the United States and they're not going to continue to do it the way they have So he's in a jam He has to do something So his hope is to savage the expenditures in this country Look what he's doing Mr Musk stands there with a chainsaw to give us the clear implication I'm I'm going to solve the problem on the backs of the working class I'm firing them all I don't care what the rest of the working class suffers I'm going to fire all these people without notice without plan Calling this efficient is a silly joke An efficient process takes time takes experts You're not doing that You're just wholesale firing Calling that efficiency is an attempt to fool people but shouldn't make any difference Mr Trump is now in a jam He can't get out of this without in some way solving the problem that has been built up And there is no way other than the one he's doing because it's the last gasp of how to take away from the mass of the people the ability to borrow I mean let's be honest If you put a tariff you make everything coming in from abroad more expensive That means people will buy less of it They'll shrink their standard of living If American companies take advantage of the tariff which they always do by raising their prices that will also hurt the working class you are emiserating your workers in order to try to solve the problem you haven't solved before But here's the irony that may in the end come back to haunt us Europe has been unable to unify under the umbrella of American alliances The enmity of the United States is bringing Europe together better than the alliance was able to do And as you pointed out very important China Japan and South Korea with long histories of animosity and tension are getting together to cope with this Wow We are unifying the whole world If you want the big picture in my judgment after World War II George Kennan taught us about containment We're going to contain the Soviet Union The irony which the philosopher Hegel would enjoy we are becoming contained We are isolating ourselves The votes in the UN are the United States alone or the United States and Israel and two or three other countries the isolation politically the isolation now economically We are the rogue nation for the rest of the world We may not want it We may not agree but it doesn't really matter if that's how they perceive us And that's what's happening You talked about South Korea Japan and China joining together One of the biggest announcement of tax cuts was against Taiwan It's just a little more complicated for Taiwan to join that group And also and also another one was Vietnam which got a very heavy whack I mean is there no recognition of what the United States did to that country Maybe you wouldn't want to crush them with this kind of a thing after I as I'm saying this is a change This is a sign to the world that as the United States empire declines This is a nasty place that's going to you know gesture and thrash around doing damage everywhere as it copes with its own decline Former Greek finance minister Jiannis Varafakus recently wrote a piece headlined Donald Trump's economic master plan He wrote quote this is what his critics don't understand They mistakenly think he thinks that his tariffs will reduce America's trade deficit on their own He knows they won't Their utility comes from their capacity to shock foreign central bankers into reducing domestic interest rates Consequently the euro the yen and the uh remend will soften relative to the dollar This will cancel out the price hikes of goods imported into the US and leave the prices American consumers pay unaffected the tariff countries will be in effect paying for Trump's tariffs Do you agree with that Professor Wolf No Even though Giannis and I do a lot of work together so normally I I defer to him He's wonderful in his analysis I don't think this is correct Is it a possible outcome Yes You know we're in a situation let me put it this way tariffs are not new They've been around for hundreds of years uh if you teach a course in international economics which I've done you you tell students here are thousand books here are 5,000 articles we know and the answer is when you impose a tariff you don't know what the outcome is because it depends on everything else going on Interest rates exchange rates of currencies rising or falling economies around the world You can't know in advance It's a very risky thing Which is why for the last 50 years we have had administered by the US something called free trade or neoliberal or globalization All of that is over now The United States can't win anymore in that system So it is reverting to economic nationalism And that's a fundamental shift that throws the world It was the accepted wisdom for 50 years 50 the last 50 years not to do what Mr Trump is doing now If you want you can think that everybody who thought that way for 50 years was wrong and Mr Trump the genius is correct But that would be a long shot Better bet he's trying to save his own political life and he's trying to cope to his credit with a declining economy without having to admit that that's the case This won't end well it it normally doesn't And what we're going to see is the fighting against one another of the Europe block the Asian block the American block at a time when the United States is weaker than it has been economically and politically Look at the debacle in the Ukraine as well The misunderstanding that the Russians could turn to the Chinese and the Indians to cope with the costs of that war in a way that hadn't been calculated and as turning out to shape the outcome And it's not a question of which side you're on but just watching how it lines up That's the problem 30 seconds As you often talk about are you seeing this as the beginning of the end of American empire Yes I think we are already in 10 12 years of that decline It can't Here's a single best statistic If you add up the GDP you know the total output of goods and services in a year for a country of the United States and its major allies the G7 it's about 28% of global output If you do the same thing for China and the bricks it's about 35% They're already a bigger block of economic power than we are Every country in the world thinking about building a railroad or expanding its health program They used to send their people to Washington or London to get help They still do but when they're done they send the same team to Beijing New Delhi Sao Paulo and they often get a better deal The world is changing and the United States could cope but as with alcoholism you have to admit you have a problem before you're in a position to solve it We have a nation that does not yet want to face what this all adds up to" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="KARL'S. &gt;&gt; LAST NAME. &gt;&gt; IN HIS CONTACTS. I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY. &gt;&gt; POSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; BUT WHO KNOWS? BUT DESPITE TRUMP AND. &gt;&gt; MUSK BLOW UP, THIS. &gt;&gt; RULING TONIGHT MAKES CLEAR THAT WE ARE STILL. LIVING WITH THE CONSEQUENCES. &gt;&gt; OF MUSK'S. &gt;&gt; TIME IN THE ADMINISTRATION. &gt;&gt; AND WE COULD BE. FOR SOME TIME, WHICH IS. &gt;&gt; WHY WE. &gt;&gt; NEED TO KEEP FOCUSING ON IT. &gt;&gt; AND TALKING ABOUT IT. I MEAN, REMEMBER. &gt;&gt; ELON MUSK. &gt;&gt; IS A MAN WITH A VENDETTA. &gt;&gt; EVEN MORE. SO NOW, A MAN IN. &gt;&gt; OPEN WARFARE WITH THE. &gt;&gt; PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND NOW HIS. &gt;&gt; STAFF HAS OBTAINED ACCESS. &gt;&gt; TO THE MOST SENSITIVE. &gt;&gt; PERSONAL DATA. &gt;&gt; OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. I MEAN, WHEN THAT 24 YEAR OLD FORMER SPACEX INTERN IS COMBING THROUGH THE SENSITIVE DATA, WHICH HE MAY BE NOW, MAYBE NEXT WEEK, WHO DOES. HE THINK HE'S WORKING FOR. &gt;&gt; THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR HIS OLD BOSS. &gt;&gt; ELON MUSK? I HONESTLY DON'T. &gt;&gt; KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. AND THAT IS A VERY FRIGHTENING PLACE TO BE. HERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION. WHAT PROTECTIONS DO WE HAVE THAT THIS DATA. IS NOT GOING TO WIND UP BEING FED INTO ELON MUSK'S AI PROGRAM? &gt;&gt; I MEAN, THAT'S A REAL CONCERN THAT ONE FORMER GOVERNMENT. &gt;&gt; OFFICIAL TESTIFIED ABOUT IN THIS. &gt;&gt; CASE. &gt;&gt; SAYING, QUOTE, IF SOCIAL SECURITY DATA HAS BEEN INTEGRATED INTO AN AI TOOL. &gt;&gt; OWNED BY ELON MUSK, THIS WOULD. &gt;&gt; CREATE AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE AND ALSO POSE SIGNIFICANT PRIVACY AND SECURITY RISKS FOR. THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. YOU THINK. VERY MUCH. &gt;&gt; IT WILL. &gt;&gt; THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; IS THAT ELON MUSK AND HIS COMPANIES WERE ALREADY SIGNIFICANTLY ENMESHED IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. &gt;&gt; BEFORE TRUMP TOOK OVER. &gt;&gt; NOW, TRUMP. &gt;&gt; HAS GIVEN MUSK AND HIS MINIONS. &gt;&gt; EXTRAORDINARY NEW ACCESS TO. &gt;&gt; EVEN BROADER SWATHS OF THE GOVERNMENT. AND AS THEIR FEUD. &gt;&gt; ESCALATES, MUSK. &gt;&gt; MAY HAVE FEWER AND. &gt;&gt; FEWER REASONS TO TREAD CAREFULLY AT ALL. &gt;&gt; THE NEW YORKER'S RONAN. &gt;&gt; FARROW HAS BEEN COVERING THE PROBLEMATIC RELATIONSHIP. THAT'S ONE WAY OF. &gt;&gt; PUTTING IT. &gt;&gt; BETWEEN MUSK'S. BUSINESS EMPIRE. &gt;&gt; AND OUR FEDERAL. &gt;&gt; GOVERNMENT FOR YEARS. I MEAN, BACK IN. &gt;&gt; 2023, LONG. BEFORE MUSK HAD EVEN ENDORSED. &gt;&gt; TRUMP. &gt;&gt; RONAN FARROW PUBLISHED A DETAILED. REPORT ON THIS VERY TOPIC, AND. &gt;&gt; HE'S. &gt;&gt; BEEN PUSHING THE PUBLIC TO VIEW MUSK'S RISE THROUGH THAT EXACT. &gt;&gt; LENS. &gt;&gt; LENS EVER SINCE. &gt;&gt; IN MY VIEW, THE REAL STORY HERE ISN'T JUST ABOUT MUSK. &gt;&gt; IT'S ABOUT A MODEL. &gt;&gt; OF POWER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S. &gt;&gt; FACILITATED HIS. &gt;&gt; RISE AND HOW PUBLIC. &gt;&gt; INSTITUTIONS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING. &gt;&gt; REPLACED BY. &gt;&gt; PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS. &gt;&gt; OPERATING WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY. &gt;&gt; IT'S ABOUT. &gt;&gt; WHY WE'VE. &gt;&gt; BUILT. &gt;&gt; A SYSTEM. &gt;&gt; WHERE SOMEONE. &gt;&gt; LIKE HIM. &gt;&gt; EFFECTIVELY SUBSTITUTES FOR THE STATE, WITHOUT. &gt;&gt; THE CHECKS. &gt;&gt; THAT. &gt;&gt; GENERALLY COME. &gt;&gt; WITH PUBLIC POWER. &gt;&gt; JOINING ME. &gt;&gt; NOW IS RONAN FARROW. &gt;&gt; HE'S AN. &gt;&gt; INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER FOR THE NEW YORKER. &gt;&gt; HE'S REPORTED EXTENSIVELY. &gt;&gt; ON ELON MUSK'S RISE TO POWER. HE'S ALSO. &gt;&gt; REPORTED EXTENSIVELY. &gt;&gt; ABOUT HOW DATA CAN BE WEAPONIZED AGAINST AMERICAN CITIZENS. &gt;&gt; RONAN. I REREAD YOUR 2023 PIECE THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; AND THERE. &gt;&gt; IS SO MUCH IN. THERE THAT IT INCLUDES WARNING SIGNS. IT INCLUDES REALLY. &gt;&gt; A. &gt;&gt; BETTER UNDERSTANDING THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT FOR ALMOST ANYBODY TRYING TO DIGEST THIS ONE. I WANT. &gt;&gt; TO TALK TO YOU. &gt;&gt; ALL ABOUT THAT, BUT I. &gt;&gt; ALSO WANTED TO. &gt;&gt; START BY. &gt;&gt; ASKING YOU ABOUT THE SUPREME. &gt;&gt; COURT RULING THAT THAT HAPPENED JUST THIS AFTERNOON. IT'S GOING TO ALLOW D.O.J. UNFETTERED ACCESS TO. &gt;&gt; DATA AT THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION. &gt;&gt; AS I MENTIONED, YOU'VE ALSO DONE A LOT OF REPORTING ON THE WEAPONIZATION OF DATA. WHAT WHERE DOES YOUR MIND GO FIRST ON WHAT THAT MEANS? &gt;&gt; WILL YOU. &gt;&gt; MAKE. EXACTLY THE RIGHT POINT? &gt;&gt; DATA CAN. &gt;&gt; BE WEAPONIZED. THERE IS. &gt;&gt; A. &gt;&gt; REASON WHY PRIVACY LAW. &gt;&gt; EXISTS, WHY. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A REALLY. &gt;&gt; IMPORTANT BODY OF. CASES THAT. &gt;&gt; THE SUPREME. &gt;&gt; COURT HAS RULED ON OVER. &gt;&gt; THE. &gt;&gt; YEARS. &gt;&gt; AND WHY WE'VE SEEN INTERNATIONALLY. WHEN YOU AGGREGATE DATA AND YOU PUT IT INTO HANDS WITH LITTLE OVERSIGHT, IT CAN AND VERY OFTEN WILL BE ABUSED. I MEAN, I'VE REPORTED ON THAT IN MANY PLACES AROUND THE WORLD. BUT JUST TO TAKE AN EXAMPLE OF A CURRENT SUPERPOWER, WE'VE SEEN HOW CHINA HAS CENTRALIZED DATA IN AN UNRESTRICTED WAY AND USED THAT TO CREATE A SURVEILLANCE APPARATUS THAT REALLY HAS BEEN USED TO TARGET ETHNIC MINORITIES. YOU CAN TAKE THIS KIND OF PERSONAL DATA, WHICH INCLUDES HEALTH DETAILS, MENTAL HEALTH DETAILS, FINANCIAL DETAILS, AND YOU CAN USE IT TO TARGET PEOPLE, TO COME AFTER PEOPLE, TO CATEGORIZE PEOPLE AND TAKE ACTION AGAINST THEM, DENY THEM RIGHTS. SO THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF, AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THE MINORITY IN THE COURT TODAY REALLY SOUNDING ALARM ABOUT THIS. YOU KNOW, JUSTICE JACKSON SAYING THE COURT HAS LOST ITS WAY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PRIVACY PROPONENTS ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THEN YOU COME TO THE HANDS. WE'RE PUTTING IT IN DOGE. THIS IS AN UNPROVEN AD HOC ORGANIZATION. THERE ARE STILL UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS LEGAL STATUS. THERE'S NOT A LOT BY WAY OF CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT OR RESTRICTIONS. THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS STAFF. A LOT OF THE DOJ'S STAFF IS HIRED UNDER THE SAME STATUS. ELON MUSK WAS HIRED UNDER AS SPECIAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, BASICALLY MEANING THEY COULD FAST TRACK THE HIRING OF REALLY YOUNG, REALLY INEXPERIENCED PEOPLE. THIS OPENS UP A WHOLE LOT OF RISKS AND VULNERABILITIES, WHICH WE CAN GET INTO. &gt;&gt; NO QUESTION. &gt;&gt; ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; WE JUST TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THAT. I MEAN, AND ONE OF THE GOALS OF DOGE HAS. ALWAYS BEEN TO SCOOP. &gt;&gt; UP DATA. &gt;&gt; I MEAN, THEY HAVEN'T. &gt;&gt; MADE ANY SECRET OF THAT. &gt;&gt; I SPOKE WITH SOMEONE RECENTLY FROM THE WHO USED TO WORK IN THE IRS, WHO SAID SOMEONE FROM DOGE TOLD HER IN A MEETING THAT DATA IS THE MISSION, THAT GETTING DATA IS THE MISSION. I MEAN, YOU'RE AN EXCELLENT INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER. YOU'VE MENTIONED SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU YOU WANT MORE INFORMATION. &gt;&gt; ON, BUT. &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE WATCHING, OR WHAT ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU THINK PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; SHOULD. &gt;&gt; BE ASKING ABOUT THIS ACCESS AND WHAT THEY COULD BE DOING WITH IT? &gt;&gt; THE POINT YOU MADE THAT DATA IS THE MISSION IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE FOR ALL OF US TO SIT WITH, JUST AS CITIZENS CONCERNED ABOUT ALL OF OUR SAFETY AND FREEDOM. SILICON VALLEY HAS SHOWED US THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN, THEY ARE ON A MISSION TO AGGREGATE DATA ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS IN ORDER TO MANIPULATE AND MONETIZE HUMAN BEHAVIOR. WE ARE COMING TO A RECKONING ABOUT HOW SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS DID THAT. WE ARE STILL TO COME TO A RECKONING ABOUT HOW AI COMPANIES WILL DO THAT. ELON MUSK AND HIS STAKE AND ROLE IN DOGE CONNECTS DIRECTLY TO ELON MUSK'S STAKE AND ROLE IN GROK. THROUGH HIS COMPANY, XAI. THERE IS EVIDENCE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TRANSPARENCY ON THIS. WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS, BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT HE IS FEEDING A LOT OF THIS SENSITIVE DATA INTO HIS OWN AI PRODUCTS, USING THEM TO TRAIN HIS OWN AI PRODUCTS. WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF THAT DATA MAY BE EXITING WITH HIM, MAY SHOW UP IN HIS SYSTEMS IN YEARS TO COME, WHICH ARE SYSTEMS THAT ACCORD TO HIS PRIVATE INTERESTS, WHICH ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE INTERESTS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. AND ALL THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE THAT DATA COULD BE AND GO WITH SOME OF THESE OFFICIALS STILL IN THE GOVERNMENT IS A HUGE, HUGE, HUGE ONE. YOU DID. I MENTIONED I REREAD THE EXTENSIVE PROFILE. EVERYBODY ON OUR TEAM REREAD IT TODAY ABOUT. IT'S BASICALLY ABOUT HOW ENTANGLED MUSK HAD BECOME AT THAT POINT IN TIME WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY APPARATUS OF THE UNITED STATES. IN SOME WAYS. &gt;&gt; HOW POWERFUL. &gt;&gt; HE HE HAD BECOME. I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, THAT ENTANGLEMENT HAS HAS ONLY GROWN DEEPER IN MANY, MANY WAYS. I MEAN, AND YESTERDAY, MUSK THREATENED TO DECOMMISSION THE SPACECRAFT THAT BROUGHT BACK TWO STRANDED ASTRONAUTS. UNCLEAR WHERE THAT SITS AT THIS POINT, BUT THAT WAS A THREAT. KNOWING AND FOLLOWING AND INVESTIGATING AND REPORTING ON HIM AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE. IF HE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE THINGS PAINFUL FOR TRUMP, AND REALLY MORE IMPORTANTLY, FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, GIVEN ALL OF HIS COMPANIES AND ENTANGLEMENTS. &gt;&gt; WHAT ELSE. &gt;&gt; COULD HE DO? &gt;&gt; THERE IS A BIGGER PICTURE HERE, WHICH IS PART OF WHAT I WAS WRITING ABOUT OF WANING GOVERNMENT POWER AND OF RISING PRIVATE POWER. THERE ARE A LOT OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL FACTORS THAT HAVE LED UP TO THIS POINT, BUT WE ARE IN A STATE NOW WHERE THERE ARE KEY SERVICES THAT ONCE WOULD HAVE BEEN A GUARANTEE FROM THE STATE THAT ARE IN THE HANDS OF PRIVATE, UNACCOUNTABLE BILLIONAIRES AND PRIVATE, UNACCOUNTABLE COMPANIES THAT THEY RUN. YOU MENTIONED THE THREAT TO DECOMMISSION THE DRAGON CRAFT. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE HAVE TO FERRY ASTRONAUTS FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION BACK TO EARTH. THERE IS LITERALLY A POSSIBILITY THAT IF HE WERE TO ACTUALLY DO THAT, AND IT DOES SEEM LIKE SOMEONE TWEETED AT HIM AND SAID MAYBE NOT, AND HE SAID, OKAY, OKAY, FINE, I WON'T. BUT THIS IS THE THRESHOLD FOR DECISION MAKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT COULD LITERALLY LEAVE HUMAN BEINGS STRANDED AND FACING DEATH. AND WE HAVEN'T BUILT IN REDUNDANCY. AND WHAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WERE TELLING ME EVEN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WAS, HEY, WE'RE ALARMED BECAUSE THERE IS AN ERRATIC PERSON WHO HAS HIS OWN COMPLICATED INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCES AND BUSINESS INTERESTS, WHO IS CONTROLLING KEY FUNCTIONALITY THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DEPEND ON. AND THAT'S NOT ISOLATED TO ELON MUSK. WE ARE SEEING THAT ACROSS THE BOARD. WE ARE SEEING COMPANIES LIKE PALANTIR RUN BY ANOTHER BILLIONAIRE MUSK DONOR, PETER THIEL, PLAY A ROLE IN AGGREGATING AND CENTRALIZING DATA ACROSS THE US GOVERNMENT, AGAIN BEING GIVEN UNPRECEDENTED ACCESS AND POWER TO TOOLS THAT REALLY CAN BE USED TO TARGET AND HARM PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; RONAN FARROW. &gt;&gt; I HOPE. &gt;&gt; YOU WILL COME BACK AND TALK WITH ME ABOUT PALANTIR AND PETER THIEL AND ALL OF THAT, BECAUSE DATA AND THEIR ACCESS TO DATA AND ALL OF THESE BILLIONAIRES IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT STORY TO FOLLOW RIGHT NOW, AND FEW PEOPLE KNOW" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="TA NEHISI COATES IS A NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLING AUTHOR AND RECIPIENT OF THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD AMONG OTHER ACCOLADES. HIS LATEST BOOK, THE MESSAGE IS IN BOOKSTORES NOW AND HE JOINS ME NOW. GOOD TO SEE YOU MAN. GOOD TO BE BACK, BACK AT IT. GOOD TO BE BACK THERE TOO. YEAH. WELL, I'M GONNA START WITH THIS UH FROM THE BOOK BECAUSE I THINK IT SETS UP OUR, OUR CONVERSATION AND ALL THE CONVERSATIONS PEOPLE WILL SEE YOU HAVING OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, YOU SAID THE LATE JAMAL KHASHOGGI, UH THE, THE MURDERED WRITER UH FROM SAUDI ARABIA WAS FOND OF THE ARABIC PROVERB. SAY YOUR WORD THEN LEAVE. I TRY TO LIVE BY THAT BECAUSE I AM AT MY WORST OUT THERE DEFENDING YOU, SAY MY CHILDREN, WHICH ARE YOUR BOOKS, DEFENDING MY BOOKS. AND I'M AT MY BEST MAKING MORE OF THEM. THIS PART OF THE GIG I THINK IS YOUR LEAST FAVORITE. WELL, BEING HERE WITH YOU IS NOT GOOD. YOU KNOW, THE THING I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING OF WAS THIS SORT OF DISCOURSE THAT HAPPENS UM WHEN WRITERS WRITE WHAT THEY WRITE AND THEN SOMEBODY REPLIES AND THEN THE WRITER DECIDES THAT THEY NEED TO CLARIFY. UM, I, I'VE ENGAGED IN THAT IN THE PAST. IT'S A TRAP A LITTLE BIT. OH, YEAH. I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY HELPED ME. WELL, WELL, PART OF WHAT MAKES IT HARD AND PART OF THIS BOOK, THIS BOOK AS MUCH AS ANYTHING. AND SOMEONE ASKED ME THE OTHER DAY I WAS RAVING ABOUT IT AND THEY SAID, WHAT'S IT ABOUT? AND I, THAT WAS BROUGHT UP A LITTLE SHORT DOING ME BOTH. WELL, IT'S AS MUCH AS ANYTHING, IT'S A LOVE LETTER TO WRITING. IT IS, IT'S A LOVE LETTER TO WRITING. AND PART OF WHAT COMES THROUGH IS THAT THE WORK THAT GOES INTO THE CLARITY OF WRITING IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO IN ANY OTHER MEDIA. YEAH. AND, AND THAT WAS LIKE A REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT THING FOR ME. I THINK PEOPLE FORGET THAT, YOU KNOW, IN AN ERA IN AN ERA WHERE, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY VIDEO IS SO IMPORTANT UM HERE. UM BUT I THINK PEOPLE REALLY FORGET THAT AT THE BASE OF IT, YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY HAS TO WRITE SOMETHING DOWN, YOU KNOW, AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS TEACHING AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY WITH SO MUCH STILL I'M TEACHING WITH SO MUCH OF THIS BOOK COMES OUT OF, YOU KNOW, THE THING I WAS TRYING TO IMPRESS UPON MY STUDENTS IS EVEN IF ALL YOU DON'T GO ON TO BE ESSAYIST, POETS, FICTION WRITERS, THE PROCESS OF LEARNING TO EXPRESS YOURSELF WITH CLARITY IS VALUABLE. IT'S, IT'S, IT'S VALUABLE NO MATTER WHAT YOU GO, GO ON TO DO THE THINGS THAT I TRY TO DO, YOU KNOW, IN THE EXTREME, IN ORDER TO WRITE A BOOK LIKE THAT IS NO DIFFERENT THAN THE THINGS I TRY TO DO WHEN I'M TRYING TO WRITE A MEMO OR EMAIL. THERE ARE THREE ESSAYS IN THIS BOOK. UM, THE ONE THAT I THINK IS PROBABLY GOING TO GET THE MOST ATTENTION. DAKAR. YEAH, EXACTLY. YOU KNOW, MOST ATTENTION AND THE MOST CONTROVERSY AND, AND THE MOST DISCOURSES ABOUT YOUR TRIP TO UH BOTH ISRAEL AND PALESTINE TO THE WEST BANK AND, AND, AND TEL AVIV AND OTHER PARTS OF ISRAEL. UM JUST START BY TALKING ABOUT YOUR WAY INTO THAT STORY, LIKE WHAT YOU, YOU READ A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT IN THE ESSAY ABOUT A FEW LINES IN THE CASE FOR REPARATIONS THAT YOU FELT LIKE MAYBE YOU WERE GLIB ABOUT A HISTORY THAT WAS MUCH MORE COMPLEX. I, I THINK GLIB IS THE CORRECT WORD. UM YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE WRITING SOMETHING RADICAL AS IT WAS AT THE TIME, YOU KNOW, IN 2014, FOR THE CASE OF REPARATIONS, YOU'RE REALLY ALWAYS TRYING TO GROUND IT IN SOME SORT OF REAL THING SO THAT PEOPLE CAN PERCEIVE IT. AND IN THE CASE OF CASE FOR REPARATIONS, IT WAS REPARATIONS. AND I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS UH FROM THE STATE OF GERMANY TO THE STATE OF ACTUALLY WEST GERMANY TO THE STATE OF ISRAEL, NOT NECESSARILY DIRECTLY TO HOLOCAUST VICTIMS. UM I NEGLECTED TO ASK A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION, WHICH IS WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THAT STATE? UM BECAUSE FOR ME, THE CASE FOR REPARATIONS WAS NOT SIMPLY ABOUT COMPENSATION FOR SOMETHING THAT, THAT HAS BEEN DONE, BUT ABOUT MAKING THE WORLD SAFE FROM A PARTICULAR KIND OF OPPRESSION UH AT LARGE. UM AND AS IT TURNED OUT, AS WAS VERY CLEARLY REVEALED TO ME WHEN I, YOU KNOW, DID MY TRAVELS UM TO USE THE STATE OF ISRAEL REV REPARATIONS TO THE STATE OF ISRAEL AS AN EXAMPLE, ACTUALLY UNDERMINED THE VERY MESSAGE OF, OF, OF, OF THE THING I WAS TRYING TO GET ACROSS IN THE ARTICLE. AND WHY IS THAT BECAUSE ISRAEL IS AN APARTHEID STATE? AND I DON'T MEAN THAT AS A SLUR, I MEAN THAT IN REPEATING THE REPORTS OF AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, I MEAN THAT IN REPORTING, UH UM REPEATING THE REPORTS OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN, I MEAN THAT IN REPORTING THE RE THE REPORTS OF UM ISRAELI HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP BET SALAM. UM I MEAN THAT IN REPORTING THE FEARS OF ISRAEL'S OWN PRIME MINISTERS, EHUD BARAK, EHUD OLMERT. UM AND I MEAN THAT IN TERMS OF WHAT I ACTUALLY SAW, WHICH WAS A SOCIETY IN WHICH HALF THE PEOPLE LIVE AND HAVE THE BENEFITS OF FULL CITIZENSHIP AND THE OTHER HALF LIVE ON VARIOUS TIERS SOMEWHERE BELOW THAT. UM THIS WAS IMMEDIATELY CLEAR TO ME THE FIRST DAY I GOT THERE AND CERTAINLY BY THE SECOND DAY WHEN I WAS WALKING THROUGH HEBRON AND I LITERALLY SAW STREETS WHERE CERTAIN PEOPLE COULD WALK DOWN AND CERTAIN PEOPLE COULDN'T, WHERE I COULD WALK DOWN. AS LONG AS I WAS CLEAR THAT I WAS NOT MUSLIM AND OTHER PEOPLE COULD NOT WHEN IT WAS MADE CLEAR TO ME THAT I WAS WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE AND SPENDING A GROUP OF PEOPLE SPENDING TIME WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO SHOULD THEY FALL INTO ANY SORT OF TROUBLE OR GET INTO ANY SORT OF, SORT OF TROUBLE WOULD BE TREATED BY THE MILITARY JUSTICE SYSTEM WHILE ALL AROUND THEM WERE ISRAELI JEWISH CITIZENS WHO WAS SUBJECT TO THE BENEFITS OF THE CIVIL SYSTEM. YOU CAN IMAGINE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE DEGREE OF HARSHNESS THERE. OH, AND IT WENT ON, IT WENT ON, YOU KNOW, IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR ACROSS THE BOARD IN TERMS OF THE LAWS AND THE POLICIES. I I'VE BEEN ON THE SAME STREETS IN HEBRON AND HAD THE SAME REACTION WHICH IS THAT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A MORAL ABOMINATION OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUS, OBVIOUSLY. BUT I THOUGHT ABOUT YOUR CASE FOR REPARATIONS ESSAY BECAUSE THE GAP FROM THE CASE FOR REPARATIONS IS ON TO ME IRREFUTABLE AND ROCK SOLID MORAL FOOTING. IT IS THE CASE THAT AMERICAN WEALTH WAS BUILT IN THE PLUNDER THAT THERE IS SOMETHING OWED FROM THAT MORAL CERTAINTY TO THE. OK. WELL, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT? THINGS DO START TO GET MORE COMPLEX AND FROM THE MORAL CERTAINTY OF STANDING ON THE STREET IN HEBRON TWO, THIS IS NOT MORALLY ACCEPTABLE TO HOW DO WE HAVE 15 MILLION PEOPLE BETWEEN THE RIVER AND THE SEA WITH FULL EQUALITY, PEACE AND FLOURISHING. THAT IS MORE COMPLEX. THAT IS, THAT IS. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, IN MANY WAYS, THE NEXT STEP IS A LOT CLEARER TO ME, IN FACT, AND ACTUALLY, IT WAS THE CASE FOR REPARATIONS BECAUSE THE OTHER THING I WAS CONFRONTED WITH WAS THE EXTENT TO WHICH PALESTINIAN VOICES HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY PUSHED OUT OF THE FRAME. SO THE FIRST STEP IS ACTUALLY AN EASY ONE TO ELEVATE, YOU KNOW, THE VOICES OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY HAVING THE EXPERIENCE AND ASK THEM WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN HERE, YOU KNOW, AND NOT, YOU KNOW, ONE OR TWO OF THEM, YOU KNOW, BUT IN, IN SOME SORT OF MASS WHERE, YOU KNOW, IN MANY WAYS, THAT ESSAY IS ABOUT MY COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP WITH JOURNALISM, WHICH I LOVE, WHICH IS A PROCESS I LOVE, WHICH IS ONE THAT I ACTUALLY APPLIED RIGHT THERE. BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU AND I'VE SAID THIS AND I'LL CONTINUE TO SAY THIS, I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN HOW MANY MAJOR MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS HAVE A BUREAU IN JERUSALEM WHERE THEY HAVE A PALESTINIAN CORRESPONDENT OR BUREAU CHIEF. II, I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THOSE NUMBERS, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY, I THINK, YOU KNOW, ANYBODY AND ANYBODY SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK THAT KIND OF JOB. UM JUST LIKE I THINK ANYBODY SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COVER RACE IN AMERICA. BUT IF THERE WERE NO BLACK PEOPLE DOING IT OR VERY FEW, WE'D HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. IT'S INTERESTING. YOU SAY THAT? UH, LET ME JUST STOP FOR A SECOND. IT'S INTERESTING. YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE I, I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU CHOOSING TO WRITE ABOUT THIS TOPIC. I THOUGHT OF A CONVERSATION THAT YOU AND I HAD BEFORE I WROTE MY SECOND BOOK, CALLING A NATION WHICH IS ABOUT RACE AND POLICING IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN WHICH I, WE WERE JUST TALKING AS, AS FRIENDS. AND I WAS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, LIKE I WANNA WRITE THIS BOOK, BUT IS IT A LITTLE WEIRD FOR A WHITE GUY TO WRITE THIS BOOK? AND YOU WERE LIKE, WELL, YOU'RE AN AMERICAN. IT'S AS MUCH YOUR, IT'S YOUR STORY AS MUCH AS ANYONE. SO YOU SHOULD WRITE ABOUT IT. AND, YOU KNOW, IN THE CASE OF THIS NEI NEITHER YOU OR I ARE EITHER JEWISH ISRAELI, PALESTINIAN OR ARAB, BUT WE'RE AMERICANS AND THE AMERI AMERICA IS NOT SOME SMALL PART OF, OF, OF WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE. A LARGE PART OF IT AND, AND IT'S MARKED EVERYWHERE. YOU KNOW, THERE'S AN ESSAY I TALK, UH YOU KNOW, AN EXHIBIT, I TALK ABOUT THE CITY OF DAVID WHERE I WENT TO WHERE THERE'S AN ACTUAL PLAQUE THAT THANKS AMERICA FOR ITS SUPPORT. I WAS RECENTLY READING AAA REPORT UH BY UH A PALESTINIAN AMERICAN SCHOLAR, NORA EREKAT AND JOSH PAUL WHO RESIGNED FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT. AND ONE OF THE POINTS THEY MADE WAS EVERY PLANE THAT DROPS A BOMB ON GAZA WAS GOTTEN FROM HERE. THOSE ARE OUR BOMBS WE'RE RESPONSIBLE. AND THAT'S WHAT, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF TIMES THE PUSHBACK IS, WELL, LOOK, THERE ARE BAD THINGS HAPPENING, YOU KNOW, ALL OVER THE WORLD. WHY PARTICULARLY ARE YOU PICKING ON THIS ONE THING I'M PICKING ON BECAUSE I AM RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE IT IS THE PRESIDENT OF THIS COUNTRY WHO HAVE SAID WE HAVE A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH ISRAEL. SO IF WE HAVE A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP, THEN I HAVE TO TREAT IT SPECIALLY IF THAT'S A WORD ESPECIALLY MAYBE. AND SO THAT, THAT, THAT TO ME WAS WHAT, YOU KNOW, VERY MUCH CALLED ME THERE. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A FEW, SOME OTHER THINGS AND, BUT I WANT ONE MORE POINT ON THIS, THE THING THAT I HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO SEE PEOPLE SAY ABOUT YOU AND THE THING THAT I THINK YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF WILL BE BASICALLY OF THE C OF THIS FORM THAT YOU WERE WELL MEANING BUT NAIVE, SMART AND CURIOUS, BUT ESSENTIALLY GOT LED ON A VERY ONE SIDED SORT OF PROPAGANDA TOUR, A KIND OF POTEMKIN TOUR IN WHICH THE FULL COMPLEXITY YOU COULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO SAT AND YOU WOULD HAVE MET ISRAELI FAMILIES LIVING UNDER ROCKET FIRE, RIGHT? YOU COULD HAVE, YOU COULD HAVE THIS ALL HAPPENED BEFORE OCTOBER 7TH, BUT YOU COULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO ISRAELI VICTIMS OF YOU KNOW, BRUTALITY AND TERRORISM AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THAT YOU CAME AWAY WITH THIS VERY ONE SIDED IMAGE FROM THIS ONE SIDED EXPERIENCE. HM. WELL, I, I'LL SAY TWO THINGS. THE FIRST THING IS IT IS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT TO SPEND ALMOST 30 YEARS IN MEDIA AS I HAVE AND NOT BE VERY MUCH EXPOSED. AND FRANKLY, YOU LIVE IN AMERICA AND BE A THINKING PERSON AND NOT BE EXPOSED TO THE DEFENDERS OF THE ZIONIST PROJECT. IT'S JUST, IT'S, IT'S HARD TO DO THAT. IT'S ALL AROUND US. SO I WAS NOT, THAT WAS NOT THE THING I WAS LACKING IN FAMILIARITY WITH. THE SECOND THING I WOULD SAY IS LOOK, UM I, I AM AGAINST THE DEATH PENALTY. OK? I DON'T CARE IF THE GUY SLAUGHTERED 10 CHILDREN AND ATE HALF OF THEM. I DON'T THINK THAT PERSON SHOULD BE KILLED. THERE IS NOTHING I WOULD SEE THAT WOULD CHANGE MY OPINION ON APARTHEID. A ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. MY CASE IS NOT BASED ON UM A HIGHER OR ELEVATED PALESTINIAN MORALITY. IT'S NOT BASED ON THE NOTION THAT, THAT, THAT PALESTINIANS ARE, ARE, ARE SOMEHOW ANGELS OR SOMEHOW MORALLY BETTER. THEN THIS IS WHAT I BELIEVE ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS. AND THERE'S NO THING THAT I WOULD SEE THAT WOULD MAKE THAT GO AWAY. I AM AGAINST SEGREGATION. I AM AGAINST APARTHEID. I AM AGAINST JIM CROW. NOTHING WILL MAKE THAT OK. NOTHING, NOTHING THEY CAN DO WOULD MAKE THAT. OK? THERE'S A LINE IN THE BOOK THAT I THINK IS KIND OF THE THESIS OF THE TA NEHISI PROJECT. UM YOU WERE TALKING TO TWO THERE'S AN AMAZING ORGANIZATION CALLED BREAKING THE SILENCE IN ISRAEL. YEAH. UH TWO FOLKS THAT ARE ISRAELIS WHO HAD SERVED IN THE ID F AND WHO WOULD THEN COME OUT LATER TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY HAD DONE AND HOW MORALLY UH ABOMINABLE THE, THE THE OCCUPATION IS. AND YOU'D SAY THEY WERE RAISED UNDER THE STORY THAT JEWISH PEOPLE WERE THE ULTIMATE VICTIMS OF HISTORY. BUT THEY HAD BEEN CONFRONTED WITH AN INCREDIBLE TRUTH THAT THERE WAS NO ULTIMATE VICTIM, THAT VICTIMS AND VICTIMIZERS WERE EVER FLOWING. THIS IS TRUE HUMAN BEINGS. THIS IS TRUE OF HUMAN BEINGS AND JUST LIKE ZIONISM DOESN'T REPRESENT A PARTICULAR UH A JEWISH EXCEPTION OR SOMETHING THAT, YOU KNOW, IS BEING PERPETRATED THAT HUMAN BEINGS HAVEN'T DONE BEFORE THAT HUMANS AREN'T CAPABLE OF DOING. YOU DON'T GET AN EXCEPTION FROM THE FACT THAT THAT VICTIMS VICTIMIZED ALL THE TIME. YOU KNOW, THAT THAT IS THE THE NATURE OF THE THING AND, AND, AND SOMETHING THAT FRANKLY, I AS YOU KNOW, A BLACK AMERICAN CARRYING ALL OF THAT, YOU KNOW, IN PRESENT AND PRESENTLY WRESTLING WITH. I MEAN, YOU WRITE ABOUT THAT IN THE BEAUTIFUL STRUGGLE JUST AT THE MICRO LEVEL OF YOUR BLOCK IN BALTIMORE, RIGHT? LIKE THERE IS NO INHERENT DEEP NOBILITY, YOU KNOW, AND NOW I'M SPEAKING OF MY OWN PEOPLE FOR HAVING BEEN SUBJECTED TO ENSLAVEMENT, JIM CROW, ET CETERA. IT'S BAD, IT'S WRONG. HOPEFULLY, IT CONFERS SOME DEGREE OF WISDOM UPON YOU BUT SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? AND, AND, AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE JUST DECIDE, HEY, THE LESSON ACTUALLY IS POWER, YOU KNOW. AND SO II, I LOOK, UM THAT PART THAT YOU JUST QUOTED IS ACTUALLY VERY, VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. UM BECAUSE THE PEOPLE YOU ARE QUOTING ARE PEOPLE WHO SERVED IN THE ID F IN THE ACTUAL OCCUPATION. SO IT'S LIKE, WHAT, WHAT WAS I, WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO? YOU KNOW? II, I TALKED TO PEOPLE WHO WERE VICTIMS OF IT. I TALKED TO PEOPLE WHO DID IT. IS IT THAT I DID NOT TALK TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE WHO DID IT, YOU KNOW, I MEAN, I, I'M JUST NOT, THAT'S, THAT'S HARD FOR ME. THAT'S HARD FOR ME IN ONE OF THE ESSAYS, A BOOK. YOU TRAVEL TO SOUTH CAROLINA WHERE YOU MEET AN ENGLISH TEACHER WHO TEACHES AN A P UH ENGLISH CLASS WHO WOULD ASSIGN BETWEEN THE WORLD AND ME. UH YOUR SECOND BOOK. UH SHE SIGNED UP BETWEEN THE WORLD AND ME. YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. CHECKING, MAKING SURE BETWEEN THE WORLD OF ME OR A P ENGLISH CLASS AND, AND PURSUANT TO THE SORT OF CRITICAL RACE, THE PANIC THAT WE SAW COME IN THE WAKE OF 2020 SOUTH CAROLINA LAW AND COMPLAINTS BY LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS, IT GETS PULLED AND YOU GO DOWN. I LO I LOVE, IT'S A, A BEAUTIFUL ESSAY BUT I ALSO JUST LOVE THE SCENE BECAUSE YOU GO THERE EXPECTING BASICALLY THIS LIKE FULL REACTIONARY HIGH AND WHAT YOU GET, WHAT DO YOU GET WHEN YOU GET DOWN THERE? I THINK THAT WE FORGET THAT WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS THIS IS A VERY, VERY RARE DISTRICT. LIKE THAT MEANS LIKE 7030 30% IS ACTUALLY A LOT OF PEOPLE FULLY CAPABLE OF ORGANIZING THEMSELVES. AND, AND THAT'S WHAT I SAW, THAT'S WHAT I SAW. I SAW THAT PEOPLE WERE UM QUITE UPSET WITH THE PROSPECT THAT THEY WERE THAT THIS UH TEACHER MARY WOOD WHO IS FROM CHAPIN, BY THE WAY. YEAH, SHE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL, HOME, HOMEGROWN TEACHERS IN THE HIGH SCHOOL. SHE WENT TO THAT SHE WOULD BE DRIVEN OUT BECAUSE SHE DEIGNED TO EXPOSE HER A P ENGLISH CLASS BY THE WAY, UH YOU KNOW, TO THIS BOOK AND FOLKS TURNED OUT TO SUPPORT HER, YOU KNOW, AND IT WAS UM IT WAS MAGNIFICENT TO SEE. I DO THINK LIKE THERE'S A DEEP HUMANISM THAT RUNS THROUGH THIS WHOLE, THROUGH I THINK YOUR INTELLECTUAL PROJECT AND YOUR WRITING PROJECT. AND THROUGH THE BOOK WHICH COMES BACK TO THIS, LIKE THERE ARE NO FIXED CATEGORIES THAT OF HUMANNESS AND THAT THE, THE, THE, THE RACE CRAFT, THE DESIRE TO CREATE THESE FIXED CATEGORIES IS ALWAYS IN THE TOOL OF CREATING SOME HIERARCHY. BUT THAT, AND THAT THE WORK OF WRITING AND THE INTELLECTUAL WORK OF CLARITY IS TO CONSTANTLY BE PULLING AWAY AT THAT FICTION. IT IS. UM WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE AND TRUE. IT'S LIKE THE GREAT DIFFICULTY OF, OF, OF, UH YOU KNOW, IN MY MIND OF, OF, OF BEING A WRITER BECAUSE YOU'RE NEVER COMPLETELY AT HOME. YOU'RE NEVER REALLY LIKE, YOU NEVER HAVE THE LUXURY OF SAYING THESE ARE MY PEOPLE. WE'RE RIGHT. WE'RE OK. THIS IS MY SIDE. NO, NO, THESE ARE MY PEOPLE CULTURALLY. THESE ARE MY PEOPLE HISTORICALLY, BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT TOMORROW I MIGHT NOT HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING, YOU KNOW. AND I, AND I SAW THAT, I SAW THAT IN ISRAEL, BY THE WAY, LIKE I SAW THAT UP FRONT THAT I MIGHT NOT HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING. I MIGHT HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING THAT MIGHT, YOU KNOW, FIND ME AN OUTCAST, YOU KNOW, FROM MY OWN HOME. YOU KNOW, TA NEHISI COATES IS THE AUTHOR OF THE MESSAGE WHICH I HEARTILY HEARTILY RECOMMEND YOU READ. UH IT IS OUT NOW, YOU CAN GET IT WHEREVER YOU GET YOUR BOOKS. GOOD TO HAVE YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHRIS. THANKS FOR HAVING ME BACK." />

He joins Democracy Now! to discuss his work, the necessity of advocating for Palestinian rights, and the violence of Israeli occupation. Abu Toha, who evacuated Gaza in late 2023 after being arrested, beaten and detained by the Israeli military, now resides in Syracuse, New York. He says that, while grateful for the platform granted by the Pulitzer, he cannot celebrate the achievement while &quot;my sisters, my brothers and my parents in Gaza are starving.&quot; Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip has trapped millions of Palestinians in famine conditions, unable to evacuate and under threat of daily bombings and Israeli troop movements. &quot;The only celebration for me is when there is an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza [and] the West Bank, and when justice and peace are served in Palestine,&quot; says Abu Toha.&#10;&#10;Democracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on over 1,500 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

          <attvalue for="7" value="democracy depends on a free press please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org/give this is democracyow democracynow.org the Warren Peace Report i'm Amy Goodman with Juan Gonzalez israeli strikes on Gaza have killed at least 11 Palestinians so far today with deadly attacks reported in Kanunis in Bethlia in Gaza City the attacks follow Israeli attacks that killed 54 Palestinians Monday health officials in Gaza say at least 57 Palestinians have already starved to death the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees in reported some 66,000 children in Gaza are suffering severe malnutrition due to Israel's total blockade of food and aid now in its ninth week some Palestinians have resorted to eating turtle meat grass rotten or expired food one displaced grandmother Um Muhammad Al Talka said it took her five hours of standing in a line at a community kitchen in Gaza's Nusadat district to get one meal to feed her hungry children and grandchildren i've been coming here since 8:00 a.m to the Takaya soup kitchen for food to alleviate our hunger and be able to stand up we are suffering from famine real famine i have not eaten anything since this morning i cannot speak because of hunger on Monday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outlined plans for the stepped up offensive on Gaza saying the Palestinian population quote will be moved for its own protection he says the whole population must move south netanyahu did not say how much of Gaza Israel plans to seize reuters reports it could include all of Gaza's territory we're joined now by the acclaimed Palestinian poet Masab Abu Toha on Monday he won a Pulitzer Prize for commentary for his writings in the New Yorker magazine he was praised for his quote essays on the physical and emotional carnage in Gaza that combined deep reporting with the intimacy of memoir to convey the Palestinian experience of more than a year and a half of war with Israel.&quot; At least 31 of MSab's family members have been killed by Israel in Gaza his books include things you may find hidden in my ear poems from Gaza and Forest of Noise first Mosab it's terrible to say in light of what's happening in Gaza to start off by saying congratulations but wow you just won the Pulitzer Prize talk about what this means to you and the statement you put out um as you learned of this huge honor uh first of all I would like to thank you Amy u appreciate your work appreciate Democracy Now thank you so much for your voice um uh this honor has u brought to me tears and joy uh I mean joy because uh this is um um I mean this is a big prize this is something that every every writer um I mean writer and and artist and journalist it dreams of uh winning uh but this is also very sad for me because the pieces for which I I won the prize the the four pieces I mean I wrote about seven or eight pieces for the New Yorker uh this prize was uh awarded to uh four of my pieces uh the four pieces are one for uh one about an article that I wrote about starvation in Gaza the other one was about the difficulty of traveling as a Palestinian the third one was about uh the loss of the refugee camp and the fourth uh was about um the Gaza we leave behind uh and unfortunately as I'm you know looking at the titles of these essays the situation in Gaza is worsening i mean not day after day but minute after minute and people are are dying I mean children are dying of hunger uh people are dying for lack of uh not only food but also medicine uh so this this this prize means a lot to me but it also reminds me that that there's a lot uh to work on not only um uh by writing but also uh encouraging uh people who have the power to take action to stop all of this and Mosab uh I wanted to ask you given the fact of the continuing attacks of the Israelis in Gaza and the complete failure of the world community to be able to do anything to stop Israel uh your sense of uh what you're seeing in terms of the American public uh since you've been in the United States in terms of its response uh to the war i think the American public uh and also people around the world are eager uh to learn uh they I mean the unfortunately the mainstream media is not doing enough uh Israel has been uh preventing uh people from visiting Gaza not only after October 7th but even before but especially after October 7th um uh journalists medics u a few a very very few little number of of of uh doctors have been allowed to go to Gaza i think the American people need to uh uh need to hear more and more voices i mean my voice is I mean is one is only one voice that uh that that is necessary to hear but there are so many other voices that that are there still in Gaza journalists and writers and artists and and and and um and university professors who have so many stories to tell my story is one story my story is other people's stories but we we need to hear more and more people and I think that the American public uh is truly eager and not only eager but I mean they they feel the necessity they they feel the the duty uh to hear and learn uh about more and more stories in Gaza and I'm happy that my power pieces that won these awards are uh stories that I wrote about myself about my people in Gaza about the refugee camp where I was born my family members who were killed my my my students my my my great aunt whose body is still under until today since last October um so there are so many other stories uh that are to be heard and I hope that the American magazines and newspapers and the American channels news channels would open up their spaces to let these writers and people in Gaza share their stories because this is what we should be doing at least i mean I mean killing people in Gaza is one crime but also not not giving them the space to talk about their pain and also demands because all the time we hear you know politicians yesterday we hear President Trump saying that I we want to we want to help the people of Gaza we want to we they have to move we will feed them but I mean come on i mean we are not people who need to be fed we are not hungry because we don't have food we are hungry because we are under occupation we are under siege we are we are under genocide this is not this is not what people in Gaza want it's not that they want only to eat they want freedom this is what they want masab Abu Tawha I want to turn to you speaking at the Jewish Voice for Peace National Meeting this weekend you read If I Must Die by the great Palestinian poet killed in Rafa Rafat Alar if I must die by Al if I must die you must live to tell my story to sell my things to buy a piece of cloth and some strings make it white with a long tail so that a child somewhere in Gaza while looking heaven in the eye awaiting his dad who left in a blaze and bid no one farewell not even his to his flesh not even to himself see the kite my kite you made flying up above and thinks for a moment an angel is there bringing back love if I must die let it bring hope let it be a tail if I must die mosab Abu Toha you referenced Rafat uh in winning uh the Pulitzer Prize yesterday talk about your relationship with him who he was and what he means for the people of Palestine yeah I talked a lot about Rifhat i wrote about him uh Rifat was a university professor uh who was murdered and this is not mentioned a lot he was not only murdered alone he was murdered along with his with two of his siblings and four nephews uh Rifat died while he was holding a pen in his hand while he was wearing his glasses uh reading poetry and writing more poems to us um asking us to continue his message which is the tale of every people in who are oppressed by occupation who are under siege who are dying in a genocide if I must die let it bring hope let it be a tale if he must die we need to tell Rafad's tale we need to I mean as I said before if I must die this is a crime to be to for someone to die to be killed by occupation and we have to remember here that 70% of the population in Gaza are refugees so these refugees they have stories it's not that they were killed by an occupation no they were killed as they have dreamed all their lives to return to their homeland so died with his with two of his siblings and four nephews and in the past he lost another brother in 2014 so Rifatwas was not only a writer he was not only a university professor but he was also a mentor for so many young writers he introduced me to the we are not numbers project in 2014 after the Israeli 51-day attacks on Gaza which claimed the lives of three close friends of mine about whom I wrote uh in my poetry and in my essays so Rifat was was was more than I mean it is a huge loss and this is why we have to honor his memory by continuing to tell the tales not only and when Rifhat said let it be a tale it's not only Rifhat's tale because Rifhat's tale my tale my grandparents tail are the tales of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and our tales are not only Palestinian tales it is a human tale of loss after loss loss after loss while the world is watching us so we refuse to die just like that we will we will fight to live not only to live but also to tell the stories of those who died before us who were who were who were meant to die in blindness to die in darkness no we will live we will fight we will continue to speak up because this loss the loss of Rifhat and so many hundreds of my friends and family members should not uh be a waste they we should tell the stories of these people because we don't want to lose more people when we write a poem it's not because we feel we feel pain for those who we lost but we are trying to stir people into action when they feel what we are feeling and uh Moab you you have been you have been telling the stories of what has been going on there through your poetry and writing but even in the United States it has not been easy there right-wing groups have called for deporting you uh and uh and President Trump is cracking down on non-citizens critical of Israel talk about the problems you've had even being able to speak at many universities um I mean I mean this is this is the tragedy of being a Palestinian or being a pro Palestinian human rights you are not safe living in Palestine for example in my case in Gaza I was wounded at the age of 16 in an airirst strike that killed seven people i lost three close friends of mine in 2014 i was abducted by the Israeli forces in November 2023 i lost my house which is the family my family house in in October 2023 two of my brothersin-laws in brothersin-law were abducted by the forces and we don't know anything about them so and I lost so many members of my family as I said and I survived by the way air strikes I mean air strikes that were just two houses away from me in Jabalia camp or in Betah so it is I mean to live in Gaza is is very dangerous so I didn't feel safe living in Gaza and now when I'm traveling outside of Gaza not only in the United States I don't feel safe because I mean we are not usually welcome anywhere it's not only in the United States but it's it's most of the world and now when when when we come to the United States you know to raise our families and to to share the stories of people who we lost i mean I'm not talking about I'm not talking about another people so this is this is what is different about me as Muslim i'm not talking about other people i'm talking about myself talking about my siblings about my parents about my grandparents i'm talking about the graves of my great my my grandparents who I will never find because Israel destroyed cemeteries i will not take my grandchildren and show them the kindergarten where I which I attended not my my university where where from where I graduated in Gaza i mean to come here and speak about these things is not even welcome so what should what should I do as Palestinian i mean I don't know no I mean uh we we I mean this word doesn't make sense in Gaza you will be you will get killed wounded or abducted when you go out and try to speak about these things you are uh being chased by these hate groups these extremist groups so what what is what do they want to from me and when they talk about deportation I mean I mean someone would deport someone to to to their homeland but my homeland is occupied i wish I could go back to Gaza but before you deport me back to Gaza I need to be in Gaza where Palestine is free i can't go back to a country that is not only under occupation but that is undergoing genocide so I would I would I would love to go back to Gaza i don't I mean it is it is not my my my biggest dream to live in United States my biggest dream is to live in my free homeland in Palestine to to be able to visit uh the the original home city and live in the original home city of my grandparents Yafa which is also the name of my uh 80-year-old daughter this is this is this is why where I would like to be deported i would like to go back and live in a free uh Palestine masab I want to thank you so much for taking this time to talk with us i'm so sorry also that you had to cancel your tour all over the country you apologized to people at all the universities where you were going to be speaking saying how much you looked forward to sharing a Forest of Noise with them i want to congratulate you on your son's birthday this weekend as you were at Jewish Voice for Peace uh speaking and reading your poetry and also ask if it's Syracuse University where you are now if they'll be holding a big celebration you are now a Pulitzer Prize winner as was announced yesterday yeah I mean uh yes I'm looking forward to celebrate but as but but as you understand it is not easy for me to celebrate anything i mean um I mean during the some some of the events people would be dancing on music I mean I I I do not feel fine you know celebrating something i am the only celebration is for me is when there is a an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and also in the West Bank and when justice and peace are served in Palestine this is the only this is the only reason for me to celebrate but I can't celebrate while I'm while I know that my sisters my my brothers and my parents in Gaza are starving you know I'm sending them this this good news telling them that this is my hope that my voice would reach more and more people who have the power to intervene and stop this suffering i can't just dance or eat you know cake or or just you know I mean it is it is not normal for me but what is what is what is good about this is that this recognition I hope would prove uh to be a step towards great under a greater understanding and would uh stir people in power to take action to put an end because I don't want to continue writing essays and poems about these these the these painful uh memories and these painful realities mab Abu Toha thank you so much palestinian poet and author on Monday he won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary for his essays published in the New Yorker

          <attvalue for="3" value="Support our work: https://democracynow.org/donate/sm-de...&#10;&#10;We speak with the acclaimed writer Ta-Nehisi Coates, whose book The Message features three essays tackling the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, book bans and academic freedom, and the legacy of the transatlantic slave trade. The Message is written as a letter to Coates's students at Howard University, where he is the Sterling Brown Endowed Chair in the English department. As part of the research for the book, Coates traveled to Senegal and visited the island of Gorée, often the last stop for captured Africans before they were shipped to the Americas as enslaved people. Coates also visited a schoolteacher in South Carolina who faced censorship for teaching Coates's previous book, _Between the World and Me_, an experience he says showed him the power of organizing. &quot;That, too, is about the power of stories. That, too, is about the power of narratives, the questions we ask and the questions we don't,&quot; Coates says of the community's response.&#10;Democracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on over 1,500 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] this is democracy Now democracynow.org The War and Peace report I'm Amy Goodman in this holiday special we spend the rest of the hour with the acclaimed writer and journalist tanasi coats author of the new book the message which is based in part on a trip he took last year to the occupied West Bank in Israel coats Compares Israel's apartate system to that of Jim Crow here in the United States he writes it occur occurred to me that there was still one place on the planet under American patronage that resembled the world that my parents were born into unquote in his book coats also writes about traveling to Sagal where he visited the slave trade Memorial at gory Island and going to South Carolina where school officials tried to ban his book between the world and me which won the national book award in 2015 team his current book the message is written as a letter to his students at Howard University where tanasi coats is the Sterling Brown owed chair in the English Department the message is coat's first collection of nonfiction since his 2017 book we were 8 years in power an American Tragedy democracy Now Juan Gonzalez and I spoke to tanasi coats in October I began by asking him about where the book begins senagal I asked him to talk about a journey he took there with great trepidation as you said you know we'll spend a lot of time talking about the occupied territories in Israel and the West Bank but it's good to start here because the the two parts are kind of paired to each other um a African-Americans are uh a group of people who have lived under the weight of a um um artifice a creation a kind of Mythology of what Africa is in our minds uh if all of the myths of racism all the justifications for enslavement all the justifications for Jim Crow at the end of their day they have their origins in these constructions of Africa as this Savage place the idea that you know having been brought here uh we're better off um very very typical of you know colonizing and conquering um um um movement and one of the things we've done to push back is create our own narratives our own Journeys our our own ideas of what Africa is my very name comes out of that which I'm very uncomfortable with as I talk about in the book and talk about it oh boy oh Lord um I wrote it I should be very comfortable talking about it um you know I was born in 1975 and that was a period in time coming out of black power uh coming out of you know black is beautiful like really discovering this idea that our sense of beauty our our our nose our lips our names our her that we had the right to take control over that um including our history and so my name is an ancient Egyptian name that refers to the ancient Kingdom of Nubia um the notion was that put very very crudely that if the West had its kings and queens if it had its great monuments if it had its great ideas so did we and part of growing older part of you know and I actually talk about this in between the world and Me part of becoming a writer actually is like our job is to be skeptical of clean stories and I learned that very very early on and the message is kind of a continuation of that of course the ultimate I would say I guess climax in that journey is going to see the continent itself and moving past um myth moving past the idea of constructed um um narratives even when they're uh liberatory even when they're emancipationist uh to see the people themselves and that is what took me to dhar and that is what I think took so long for me to go to dhar uh and in terms of uh What uh most surprised you uh in the trip could you talk about that yeah um what most surprised me is the thing that will not surprise any African-American watching this interview it was it was my deep sorrow is my deep deep deep sorrow and I think like much of what I you know just said in answer to Amy's question I'd already intellectualized before I went and so I was I was already thinking about this but thinking about something and being confronted with it is a totally totally different thing a great Mike Tyson said everybody's got to plan until they got punched and as soon as that plane started descending out of the clouds over daa and I saw the buildings uh rising up I was being punched it is one thing to think about the Middle Passage to think about your ancestors theoretically it is quite another to literally sit on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean um and look out and understand that this was even if only symbolically last stop and and when you went to gore you decided that you did not want to have a any of the tour guys you wanted to wander around on your own no talk about that experience well by by then it was it was like day three and so I understood that um as much as I thought I was going to see the continent I was actually going to see some sort of departed version of myself you know from hundreds of years ago I was walking with ghost the whole time and I just I didn't want to be talk to my family is from the eastern shore of Maryland not too far from Ocean City for anybody who knows that geography it's like right on the Atlantic Ocean and so to get back to synagog to get to dhar which is itself right on the tip of the continent you know I would look out and I would have these moments and I would say my God you know what I mean there's part of me all the way on the other side and there's part of me that's here and so again gory is a place that has a lot of story and a lot of myth around it and I I about that I thought I was fully prepared but I'm going to tell you brother you get on that boat and that boat pulls off and you think about all of your ancesters and it was 700 a.m. in the morning and I was alone on that boat and uh it is a very very different experience and back to your name tanasi and also which goes to your parents as well and how their influence on you your dad a former Black Panther and a publishing um uh a publishing press right in your house yeah yeah no and I think like what they were really trying to do and this actually goes to the core what the what the book is about how do you tell your own story how how do you free yourself from a history from novels from film from television an entire architecture that is designed to tell you that you are exactly where you belong because of who you are because of what you are either because of your genes because God said you know you belong there how do you construct something different and one of the things I'm trying to confront in the book is I think perhaps Step One is almost to make a mirror image of the people that that have put you in that situation well you say we're this we're actually that but I think one of the most difficult things is to Free Yourself entirely of that structure and to construct your own morality your own stories your own ideas that don't necessarily depend um on those who have put you in a situation to begin with and the the structure of your book is addressed to your students uh at Howard the decision to choose that form for your book you know I was to be honest with you I've not said this anywhere I was very worried about that because I'd done that like I'd written this letter in between the world and me and I thought people get oh my God he's going to do this again what between the world and me again but the fact of the matter is I am always trying to achieve intimacy with the reader that's that's the you know the the the primary job I you know I would tell my students all the time look you are dealing with readers who could be doing anything else they could be on their smartphones they could be playing video games they could be watching movies they could be watching TV somewhere making love they could be doing anything but reading you and so you have a responsibility to make them feel a sense of intimacy and immediacy and I was lucky in the sense that you know these were very very real conversation that IID had with my students so I had something to pull from you know and also you know the the the fact of just the letter form allowed me to do that it allows me to get you know a kind of intimacy with my reader talk about George Orwell why I write and um connecting politics and language in the promise you made to your students at Howard your between the world and me was written to your son Samari this to the students yeah so we usually start actually with politics in the English language that's that's that's the first essay that I have them read you know just to think about language as a political thing you know we we live in this world where um I feel that um often times we are taught not that everybody subscribes it it's that art lives over here and politics lives over here and that politics itself is actually very very limited that you know it happens every two or four years it's in the voting booth it's who you decide you know to vote for it's what issues you decide to activate on but one of the arguments that I make in the message is that there's an entire architecture outside of the world of mean politics that determin how politicians actually talk the choices they give you know Etc why does Camala Harris feel the need for instance to say that she has a gun what what is that actually based on and I would say it is based on archetypes of femininity I would say it's built based on archetypes of race archetypes of the cowboy and where do those archetypes come from they come from our art they come from our literature they come from our film our TVs our commercials you know and at their base they ultimately come from writing because somebody has to write those ultimately and in that world things that seem separated from politics never really are and so I wanted to start that that uh book um or this book the message with that Oilwell quote because that that's like one of the things he kind of is obsessing with in that essay and at the same time there's this beautiful tension that I often feel which is in a different world you know he would just write Beautiful Stories he would just play with language for the hell of playing with language but he doesn't live in that world and I don't feel that my students live in that world they live in a world of of as we'll talk about genocide partide segregation global warming you know category five hurricanes you know flood on one Coast fire on the other these are immediate issues and I I I don't believe that they as writers we as writers have the luxury of sort of sitting back in our salons and in our living rooms you know simply constructing beautiful language for the hell of constructing beautiful language it has to be engaged with how from cot you take us to Colombia South Carolina uh why that choice well I was writing this in a time where this um wave of book Bannings was happening um and I always wanted to write about that but I I felt that I was worried about making the writer the center of of the book Banning because even though the the work is directed at the writer the writer is actually not the person that suffers under the book band the teacher suff under the book under the book man it's the teachers who are under threat for losing their job it's the teachers who get harassed it's the Librarians who are under threat of losing their job it's the Librarians who get harassed it's the students who lose the ability to have access to different worlds and different ways of thinking and I was trying to figure out how I could write this in such a way um so that I would not be the center of it luckily you know I ended up in conversation with a teacher by the name of Mary wood uh from chapen South Carolina went to chapen high school where she teached um and where she was trying to teach between the world and me um and got into some amount of trouble for that um and she invited me down you know just to you know go to a hearing um and that's what I did and um it was quite it was quite eventful it was not the world that I expected it was not the um the audience I expected um it was interesting to see uh how much support actually was rallied behind her even though she's in a deep red area uh in a deep red State um and so that too is about the power stories that too is about the power of narratives the questions we ask and the questions we don't you write in the message about this experience in South Carolina I see politicians in Colorado and Tennessee and South Carolina moving against my own work tossing books I've authored out of libraries Banning them from classes I feel snatched out of the present and dropped into an age of pitchforks and book burning bonfires my first instinct is to laugh but then I remember that American history is filled with men and women who are as lethal as they were ridiculous now if you got one running for president right now you know lethal and ridiculous well you talk about um the area you were in 7030 split 70% for Trump and yet and this is what you were just talking about this 30% how surprised you were by the minority the power of it when it's mobilized yeah you know it's like one of these things like again like this goes back to to how we construct language it's either a blue or red District right even purple doesn't quite like carry the quite you know like the real connotation so you think it's red uh okay battle's over why am I here you know but 30% and 30% activated around an actual issue is actually a lot of people you know what I mean and and it was like like I could not have known that without seeing it like you have to and this is like one of the messages I have you know for my students in the book you you have to walk the land you can't you know sit on your but reading reports you know what I mean and even reading books like this one and say hey I'm going to be a writer you have to have actual experiences so I have to walk in that room you know and meet this you know white woman in her 70s you know who tells me in the wake of George Floyd we organized a reading group at our church for Black authors and I love cson Whitehead oh my God have you read him you know like I have to have that experience with somebody you know I have to have that that shock you know um and so I I I just feel like it was like really really important in in in in the message to actually model the work that I was articulating or model the lessons that I was actually articulating for my students when you just referred to president Trump can you elaborate further um he looks ridiculous but he is in fact quite lethal you know um and I think uh certainly in 2016 uh there was great great temptation to laugh you know what I mean um you hear these things you know you hear him say certain things you know you see him you know in certain places and there there's a kind of dis dismissiveness um but what we actually are dismissing is a kind of Darkness that I think lurks deep deep within all of us and can actually be appealed to it's not um comfortable to say that you can win through hate it's not comfortable to say that you can win through anger it's not comfortable to say historically it actually has been very effective at you know uh electorally to pick out weak people or people who are not in you know the most advantaged political space and to demonize them and use them as a tool that that actually has been quite effective for people in pursuit of power we would rather think that um good wins all the time that people see the best in each other it reifies our Notions of what America is our stories that we tell ourselves of what America is but it doesn't correspond with the actual history and the truth tanasi coats author of the new book The Message in a minute will return to our conversation and talk about Israel and Palestine" />

Meanwhile, the Israeli government has unanimously voted to sanction the Israeli newspaper Haaretz_, claiming that its editorials &quot;have hurt the legitimacy of the state of Israel and its right to self defense.&quot; _Haaretz has criticized the move, which comes just months after Israel banned the international media outlet Al Jazeera, as anti-democratic.

          <attvalue for="7" value="I want to bring giddon Levy into this conversation in Tel Aviv um giddon if you could start off by responding to there was a um latest text from the Israeli negotiator Gan Basin um who wrote the ceasefire agreement which went into effect today is good news the agreement is between Israel and the government of Lebanon not between Israel and Hezbollah it seems that Hezbollah has been weakened enough um it says uh it seems that it's been weakened enough um that let's see if I can find this that it's been weakened enough to end the war in Lebanon before the war in Gaza has ended your response to this and also the response in Israel right now to I think it was about 4 a.m. that the ceasefire or this cessation in hostilities went into effect yes I wish I could tell you that Israel is happy about the ceasefire I wish I could tell you that there is even a relief in Israel but unfortunately in Israel everyone almost everyone is critical about this agreement I guess many Israelis did not have enough for sure the right Wingers for sure the most of the inhabitants of the north they would like to see more blood and more destruction Lebanon and therefore they are so sour today and the other Camp as usual is saying nothing and even one of the opposition leaders Benny gun even criticized the ceas he saw the war should go on in other words Israel wants Wars that's the inevitable conclusion when you see reactions to a ceas fire which puts an end at least partial end to suffer in both sides suffer which didn't lead to anywhere Israel didn't achieve anything in this war it will not achieve anything in the war in Gaza 10 times or 1,000 times worse and here I must emphasize that nobody should have any Illusions has no intention to put an end to the war in Gaza what happened in Lebanon will not happen soon in Gaza because if he goes for an agreement in Gaza he loses his government and that's his top priority and Israel at least part of Israel has very serious intentions to resettle Gaza don't underestimate those settlers the sky the limit for them they just wait for Donald Trump to get into the office and I will not be surprised if we very soon later see settlements in Gaza in other words nothing was solved yesterday accept of the the the punishment of of Lebanon which came to its end but also this is for a very limited time I mean when the prime minister speaks about the agreement and all he has to say are threats about Lebanon and kbal that if any violation will take place immediately Israel will attack again so we are going from one war to the other and from one viol confrontation to the other without even suggesting any other alternative nothing nobody speaks about diplomacy nobody speaks about touching the core issues both in the north and in the South our friend from from Lebanon our Lebanese friend just mentioned violations of the of the sovereignity of Lebanon anyone speaks about the fact that Israel I'm sure will continue to fly over Lebanon known for intelligence this will be kosher this will be legitimate and only the violation of of of Israeli sovereignity is never forgiven and get Lev I wanted to ask you in terms of the the the toll on the the IDF now over 800 soldiers have been killed in Gaza about the estimates are about 70 73 or 74 uh in in Lebanon on and those are the only ones the ones publicly acknowledged uh the what is the impact on Israel of continuing this war on the economy of Israel on migration on tourism and the other aspects of economic life in Israel the price is enormous but somehow Israeli accepted this is this unbelievable phenomena in which people are ready to sacrifice the dearest ones I mean who is more than your son without seeing a real purpose I mean they all tell themselves that they were killed sacrificed for the for the defense of Israel what what kind of defense is it if you bomb camp in Gaza what what does Israel benefit out of it the economical price is one thing I mean you mentioned tourism there's no tourism whatsoever there are hardly any International Airlines to fly in here but there is a much heavier price namely turning Israel into a par State you know it very well from the United States but everywhere else it's not only that netan and and the Gallant are now wanted all over the world every Israeli will feel it when he will go abroad now every Israelis everywhere will feel at least discomfort in presenting himself identifying himself as an Israeli and still Israelis are ready to take this only because they were told that we have to live from war to war to live on our sword and there is no other option which is a total lie because Israel never tried an alternative but brainwash like brainwash gon and I don't know if you can respond to this but the Israeli cabinet has unanimously voted to sanction your paper harat saying its editorials quote have hurt the legitimacy of the state of Israel and its right to self-defense unquote under the move the Israeli government will stop advertising in the paper cut off all Communications with haret haret has slammed the decision saying it quote is another step in netanyahu's Journey to dismantle Israeli democracy like his friends Putin eruan Orban Netanyahu is trying to silence a critical Independent Newspaper haratz will not bulk and will not morph into a government pamphlet that publishes messages approved by the government and its leader unquote this all comes 6 months after Israel banned Al jazer from operating in Israel and as the president-elect here in the United States uh Donald Trump threatens to go after major US broadcasters and Publications calling the media the enemy of the people get on you serve on the editorial board of harats I know you can't speak specifically about the sanctions against your paper but can you talk broader about these threats to the Press sure it's not that I can't but we decided that this this message that you just read now is is our reaction as a newspaper but I think that those sanctions tell much more about Israel and Israel's government than about the arids and here I think especially in the United States who always speaks about the shared vales about the only democracy in the Middle East so first of all it's questionable if if a state which rules in such a brutal way in five million people can it all be defined as a democracy but let's put the occupation the part they side even for us Jews in Israel who used to live in a quite liberal democracy things are changing right now from day to day from week to week legislations against freedom of speech against the legal system against any kind of Human Rights against any minority are being ruled and and nobody says a word I mean nobody can stop it at least as long as this government is there so what I would like to stress here Amy is that you have to also look at what's going on within the Jewish Israel it is Chang changing while we are speaking and the war in Gaza and Lebanon has a lot to do with it because the those two Wars with all their lack of legitimacy and brutality also influence the domestic structure and the domestic system of Israel and you see the outcome I don't take my freedom of speech and I have of speech total freedom of speech but I can't take for granted anymore well I want to thank you both for being with us and I want to give Lena munza just we have 30 seconds but the last word on what you expect to happen from here as you watch what has happened to your country uh at least for this moment from afar uh look we're very terrified of the day after Mr Levy talked about the effect on internal Israeli politics we're also very afraid uh Lebanon is a very fragile you know pluralist state but at the same time the Israelis also have known very much how to uh work on that so they've been specifically bombing where the refugees have gathered we've seen over the last few months that people have been Turning Away refugees these refugees are largely Shia from South Lebanon uh and from uh the southern suburbs of of Beirut so there's been a lot of hostility that has incurred uh so we're really really afraid of the day after in terms of you know the internal stability of the country and what's going to happen to it and I just want to say you know to go back to this idea of collateral damage this is something that the United States normalized you know in our region in Iraq the way to punish an entire country in order to change some sort of internal mechanism which then devastates the country because of course they have no idea what they're doing and this is not you bring about change so we're all also very afraid of now what's going to happen to Lebanon internally as we go on and as the pieces are picked up and a lot of anger and recrimination is going to start coming to the surface among the population so you know as we say in Arabic Al like we have no idea what's going to happen Lena muner we want to thank you for being with us lean's writer and Senior editor of the Arts and literature magazine the maraz and gon Levy award-winning Israeli journalist at harat's author of the new book The Killing of Gaza reports on a catastrophe we thank you so much both for joining us from Montreal and from Tel Aviv" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="this week on Christian World News the first British citizen convicted of a thought crime army veteran Adam Smith Connor talks about the dream that took him to an abortion clinic and the prayer that led to his arrest and conviction plus can one stone change the course of history that's the question behind the popular new streaming series about a beloved king of Israel efron Graham takes us behind the scenes of the House of David and the push to post the Ten Commandments more than a dozen states are challenging the status quo to put God's laws in public schools hello everyone welcome to this week's edition of Christian World News i'm George Thomas and I'm Wendy Griffith thanks for being with us you know imagine being arrested not only for praying but for the contents of your prayers in fact in Britain that is exactly what's happening and you're too close to an abortion clinic yeah in Scotland people living near abortion clinics could even be charged for activities inside their homes dale Herd reports on the first UK citizen convicted of a thought crime while many knew about the case against a British Army veteran Vice President JD Vance brought it to the world's attention again in a speech to the Munich Security Conference a little over two years ago the British government charged Adam Smith Connor a 51-year-old physiootherapist and an army veteran with the heinous crime of standing 50 m from an abortion clinic and silently praying for 3 minutes not obstructing anyone not interacting with anyone just silently praying on his own when Adam Smith Connor was approached by police officers they asked &quot;What is the nature of your prayer today?&quot; What is the nature of that i'm praying for my son making the charge against him what many are calling a thought crime we met Smith Connor at a church in Southampton England where he told us of a terrible dream that led him into the prolife movement a dream in which he was butchering a baby i was carving up this baby um as if I was carving up the Sunday roast i didn't have any sense of guilt or anything it was it was no feeling of of anything as I was doing this when I woke up it was like a nightmare in reverse so what horrified me was that I'd carved up this child who I knew it was my son and um it horrified me that that that I hadn't felt anything as I did it and over the following days I I came to realize it related to an abortion that I'd paid for two decades earlier that abortion hadn't even crossed my mind but God knew that that was sitting on my conscience and knew that I wasn't going to figure it out for myself that that needed to be cleansed so I feel that he gave me that vision that dream to wake me up to to what had happened adam began to go to abortion clinics to pray for his son and would eventually be charged for it they asked me to to leave the area i declined because I don't think that prayer can ever be considered uh a criminal act or illegal uh I was out out of line of sight from the clinic behind a tree and I didn't look at anyone i didn't approach anyone i didn't speak to anyone the United Kingdom's new buffer zone law makes it illegal for anyone to do anything that intentionally or recklessly influences someone's decision to use abortion services the law will apply within a 150 meter radius of the abortion service provider by using a word like influence it's very unclear what the law means lois Mlache Miller with Alliance Defending Freedom International says the government's use of the word influence has created a very broad law that could potentially be used against private conversations as well as a person's thoughts and prayers but what about a mother asking her daughter &quot;Are you sure?&quot; Is that influence what about a friend uh who's offering support to a woman who's considering uh continuing her her pregnancy is that influence a 63-year-old retired medical scientist from Bournemouth England was also put on trial for standing near an abortion clinic and holding up a sign reading &quot;Here to talk if you want,&quot; and talking to women who approached her so what you up to today sorry I'm praying you're praying yes okay in Scotland this letter sent to citizens warns that anyone living within an abortion clinic buffer zone could violate the law while inside their own homes some think it could include praying near a window if a woman seeking an abortion walks by smith Connor said he's grateful Vice President Vance defended him before world leaders adam Smith Connor is a British Army vet who risked his life in Afghanistan for the cause of freedom only to return home to be convicted of a thought crime smith Connor said he thinks about the personal price he paid and how a close friend gave his life to protect the very rights that now have been taken away by his government i've got a profound sense of sadness that for our nation the fact that we have plummeted to such a depth so quickly i believe in in the Bible and what the Bible says and I I live that out in my life and and the fact that I'm now convicted for doing that I think is quite shocking and the absurdity of a trial for the contents of your mind the contents of your prayers just has no place in a liberal free dem democratic society and yet and yet here we are an appeal of Adam's conviction has been set for July cbn senior international reporter Dale Herd joins me now for more dale just unbelievable uh you know we've heard similar stories of Christians being targeted in the UK how did this once stronghold of the faith become hostile so hostile to Christianity and that's probably a long answer but it is ironic that in this officially Christian nation where the monarch is anointed with oil by the archbishop that Christians today feel like secondass citizens that's not an exaggeration look we just had a a Muslim mufty appointed the head of education in Britain there is no way that they would appoint a an outspoken Bibleelving Christian to any position like that that it's believed to be the first overtly religious leader appointed to a job like that and it was a Muslim and of course folks have heard about how they celebrated Ramadan uh uh in the Windsor Palace so yeah it it is a really strange state of affairs and and it has to do with um what happens when Christianity is the state religion which it is not here and Christianity is thriving christianity seems to struggle in nations like that where it is the state church dale it's not just Christians you have reported extensively on the rise of anti-semitism in UK describe what's happening and why anti-semitism is so has become so prevalent yeah it's exploded and in a story that I did recently uh we found that most Jews in Britain are thinking about leaving this is unheard of in a country that has been a haven for Jews where Jews have fled to and one would think that this anti-semitism is coming from the influx of refugees from the Middle East and and that is a primary reason but it was interesting to discover that um close behind is the far-left and the this is the opinion of Jews in Britain saying number one it is a radical Muslims number two it's the far-left in Britain and number three it's teenagers uh that have essentially learned anti-semitism on social media they now today hold views about Jews and Jew hatred that their parents don't hold and they're sort of indoctrinating one another and this has been a very dangerous trend uh Dale last question do you see any hope for Christianity uh in the UK yes and and I know you agree with me that with the Lord there's always hope and the hope in Britain is outside of the established church you know Americans are very enamored with the cathedrals in Britain and in Europe but the Christians there they kind of associate those with a dead faith and the future of Christianity in Britain is outside although some may worship in these cathedrals it's primarily outside them in hotel conference centers in storefronts where churches are thriving and people want to see spiritual power in their services as well this has been a key element in the growth of Christianity in Britain they're tired of dead faith they want to see some action at church yeah and a story that you have reported on extensively is this whole idea of reverse myology those coming from the global south who have a passion and a desire to rekindle the faith in the western countries are opening these huge churches all across Great Britain all across Europe which is also an encouraging uh sign as well Dale thank you so much for your excellent reporting appreciate it thank you buddy you great reporting well coming up behind the scenes at the house of David meet the creative minds and talented actors creating this inspiring new streaming [Music] series welcome back to Christian World News the saga of King David is one of the most epic stories in the Bible a look at this beloved character is now streaming in a brand new series called House of David and I've been watching it and it's amazing our colleague CBN's Efim Graham traveled to Greece to bring us this behindthescenes look at this Prime Video's new venture into biblical storytelling can one stone change the course of history this simple question sets the stage for the cinematic biblical series House of David a full-scale retelling of David's rise from an overlooked shepherd boy to Israel's most celebrated king why do my brothers get to fight and I'm stuck here david you are not a man of blood michael Escander leads the cast as David god does not see what man sees he sees into the heart and you you have the heart of a lion they're casting for this series they have all these actors in place but they still haven't identified their David and they go through thousands of audition tapes and wait months and months and months and finally we come to you why i don't know how does that feel scary uh yeah I mean like obviously like with an opportunity like this and to to tell this type of story it's so special and everyone wants it but um it's scary because there's so much pressure you know being the one person to do this like I I like to think that there's plenty of people who could have done it i'm just the lucky one at the time you're on Broadway in a successful play um and you kind of have a a desire to to to be David tell me what where did that desire come from i wish I knew i wish I knew i I think uh it goes back um to the show The Chosen like I watch the shows and every single time I watch an episode I cry i see I see the Bible come to life um and uh not only that but I see human beings in front of me i don't see some big grand person far away um and I've always been uh inspired by that and I've wanted to be a part of it and so I thought to myself man if they ever have an audition you know I'd love to maybe play King David in a flashback scene maybe like young King David hurting the sheep or whatever and that was a long time ago that was 2021 and so to get the opportunity now to do that but on a full scale and to dive deeply into the story of David uh is such a full circle moment from that initial spark the Philistines have assembled the sparks behind this epic series John Irwin whose film credits include Jesus Revolution and I Can Only Imagine it's a story of family i think I mean it's it's a story of destiny and John Gunn whose work includes the case for Christ and I still believe I saw the print of a hand larger than a weaver's basket i have a giant what how do you balance telling the story that most of us think we know um with biblical accuracy but then telling a compelling story we feel like a great responsibility for the source material and you want to get it right and you want to honor it and the way to honor it is to understand the heart of it and then to fill in those gaps in ways that supports the truth of the heart of that and then you get a lot of help from people to go like no this is great but this is actually inaccurate the Bible is kind of like you know flying through a theme park in a jet you know it's a it's a historical overview at a high altitude so it's it's wonderful to I like Ken Burns uses this phrase emotional archaeology which I really like and to first of all love the material um you know you know learn the material and then really think about okay these are real people and if they're in chapter 3 they don't know about chapter 4 and then you read all that David was going through in the Psalms and then you cross reference them to the life that he was living you know do you read 1 and 2 Samuel and and um you know it really comes to life my king I will fight the giant fight him with the same spirit you bring into this room send me your Goliath bringing the role of Goliath to life is bodybuilder actor and Mortal Kombat star Martin Ford how does Mortal Kombat prepare you to play Goliath h patience i mean it's quite funny you should say that because the characters are kind of very similar ria Khan and Goliath in a sense of they are the ultimate bad guy larger than larger than life and a power that's unrecognizable by humans when I think of Goliath in biblical terms I don't even think of Goliath as a human per se because we're thinking giant massive so what's the difference in what people are thinking versus what we're going to see well I think the power of of allowing us to tell the story with a backstory allows you to to see him more as what you've just suggested that you don't as a human m and if we can if we can have that relatability to the fact that he is our human he does have a family he has brothers and a mother and there's a there's a driving force there's a motivation for his actions it's not about the greatness of the giant it is about the greatness of God are you afraid terrified what has David taught you playing him what what lesson have you Oh man what hasn't he taught me i think most of all David has taught me courage and bravery because the one thing that David always does is he doesn't run from his fears he goes right to them and I think that's a lesson we all need is to not run away from our fears but to to face our fears to to stand up against the giant and to say I am here even though we might be scared like might be terrified we still choose to stand against giants again I ask this question [Music] can one stone change the course of history efron Graham CBN News Athens Greece up next religious tyranny or religious freedom the controversy over the push to put the Ten Commandments into public schools welcome back to Christian World News this week the Texas Senate passed a bill requiring the Ten Commandments be placed in school classrooms it's part of a move by Republicans more than a dozen states that have introduced sim similar legislation cbn's Paul Petite reports from Texas bless his food bless his family um thank you for the great message last night adam Alouse believes his 16-year-old son Dylan and other Texas high school students would benefit from daily seeing the Ten Commandments in their classrooms they can look at it they could say maybe go home with their parents and say you know what does this mean what does you know shall not cover that neighbor's wife what does that mean so put the thought in their mind texas is joining at least 14 states where legislators want to reintroduce Christian principles in public school spaces posting the Ten Commandments in our public school classrooms allows students to have an understanding and an appreciation for our heritage for systems of law and the connection of the Ten Commandments to Western civilization jonathan SCS an attorney with the group Texas Values helped draft the Texas bill we're confident with the recent election results that this is what voters want they want to make sure that we preserve our values and that we teach about these things in our public schools and we get back to basics lawmakers in these states are also seeking to take advantage of the political shift and Supreme Court rulings opening the door to more religious expression in schools god is mentioned in the Declaration of Independence it's on our money in music like God Bless America it's in our literature and it's in the pledge to the flag why would we not mention God in our schools the courts need to understand that by removing God they are replacing it with nothing opponents including the ACLU and others however argue such measures violate the First Amendment this is clearly outrageous this is not religious liberty this is religious tyranny louisiana became the first state to mandate displaying the Ten Commandments in classrooms freedom from Religion Foundation is among those challenging that law it's up to parents to indoctrinate or not their children or expose them to whatever so-called holy books they want or whatever edicts or mandates they think are true but not for our public schools so of course we're very alarmed at all the copycat legislation state legislators here in Texas believe their bill will stand up to scrutiny following a 2022 Supreme Court case that ruled a Washington state high school football coach had the right to pray on the field immediately after football games only thing I even asked for from the very beginning was to be reinstated as a coach and to be able to pray on the 50 yard line but the great part about it is it just took one person to stand up and said enough is enough coach Joe Kennedy believes the ruling in his favor has energized the fight for religious freedom in schools people are standing up they're being bold in their faith they're being bold in their constitutional rights as Americans it's basically a combination while Alas wants Texas schools to prioritize academics he also sees value in an exposure to biblical principles that have shaped Western civilization i think being there in the schools is important i think it would be good to have in the schools if it's good enough for the Supreme Court also to display in that courtroom should be good enough for a public school classroom in Texas Paul Petite CBN News finally this week Christian students at Western Kentucky University got creative in spreading the gospel they sure did about 70 students wrote the Gospel of John in chalk along a two-mile stretch of the campus the students from Baptist Campus Ministry Crew and Hill Toppers for Christ wrote and illustrated all 21 chapters of John's gospel one student said quote &quot;I pray this sparks a revival among our college campuses and that Jesus will be made known.&quot; That is so cool look at all that scripture the word of God i love it i love it it does not return void that's it for this week's edition of Christian Worldviews until next week from all of us here goodbye and God bless you" />

of them children and women earlier today at a state dinner in Qatar President Trump said he wants the US to take Gaza and turn it into a freedom zone well we're working very hard on Gaza and Gaza has been a territory of death and destruction united States get involved and make it just a freedom zone have a real freedom zone a freedom zone this comes amidst mounting warnings of starvation in Gaza which is the headline of our next guest's new piece in the London Review of Books alex Dval executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tus University author of the book Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine welcome back to Democracy Now uh congratulations on the efforts of so many at TUS and also outside of TUS to have uh Romesa released um the uh Turkish student uh who was a Fulbright scholar and was taken by masked ICE agents on the streets of Somerville uh Ramesa Oturk now out of an ICE jail alex if you can start off by laying out um what you found in your new piece for the London Review of Books Starvation in Gaza so just a couple of days ago the United Nations integrated food security phase classification which is a real mouthful um it's a it's a system it's a collaboration of different humanitarian agencies um and they undertook a survey it's the fifth such survey since the beginning of the war in in in the most recent war in Gaza some 19 months ago they undertook a survey of food security and malnutrition and what they found was yet again that uh the majority of people in Gaza are facing emergency or catastrophic levels of food insecurity and levels of malnutrition are rising fast and this is directly related to the total blockade imposed upon the Gaza Strip at the beginning of March and normally um in situations of famine there are many complex factors that uh work in between the level of food availability and and children getting hungry and beginning to die in large numbers in the case of Gaza it's actually sadly a lot more straightforward there's really the only food that is available is that that is permitted to enter by Israel and those food stocks are running out russians are getting low and the poorest and most vulnerable are beginning to starve and die well you write in in your piece uh Alex Cival uh that quote &quot;Gaza is an anomaly a laboratory in which we will discover how much nutritional stress a population can withstand before succumbing on mass so if you could uh elaborate on that and whether that is indeed the conclusion that was reached in the IPC report so a a normal healthy adult will uh last somewhere between 60 and 80 days deprived of all nutrition now we haven't got to that stage but children perish much more quickly and there are a significant numbers of children who need specialized feeding need food that cannot be readily prepared with just the food that is available with the uh with the lack of clean water the lack of electricity supplies so we are seeing the most vulnerable um already succumbing and there are two scenarios that were laid out in this report one is a situation in which the status quo continues the level of blockade and the level of destruction continue unimpeded in which case um mass starvation famine is inevitable it is a question of weeks before that unfolds the second scenario is if the Israeli US plan for setting up a an an alternative humanitarian system comes into play now the background to this is that Israel um wants to debar the UNRA and the United Nations and um other international humanitarian organizations from being present on the ground in Gaza and to to put humanitarian provision in the hands of a new system uh a new method a new scheme the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and not many details are available about this but what is known is that the plan is to have just four distribution centers in a small part of Gaza supplying at most 60% of the population with minimum rations and the food would be brought and distributed by uh members of this uh new foundation including uh US private military contractors protected by the IDF and it would simply be those rations and and and basic hygiene and medical kits there would be no reconstruction of infrastructure no specialized feeding um for malnourished children etc now even if this were to work the conclusion of the IPC it doesn't spell it out in quite so many words but it's pretty clear the conclusion is mass starvation would still unfold just somewhat more slowly so uh Alex could you also um talk about the fact of this this concept of yours of surveillance humanitarianism how does the aid scheme that you've just been talking about uh that is proposed by the Israelis and backed by the Americans fit into that uh how precisely would it work you've also said the plan is quote an individualized version of late colonial counterinsurgency back in the 1950s the British government mounted a a a anti-communist counterinsurgency in Malaya and they explicitly called it operation starvation and the idea was that every individual who was in a protected village would and and and was properly accredited with the authorities would receive enough food and every item of food was counted going into those protected villages and outside the protected villages where the communist gerillas were able to roam no food would be available they would be forced to starve now what we're seeing is a version of this um a much more sophisticated version being uh uh being implemented by Israel today so clearly their intent is that no food should get into the hands of Hamas and they have details about every individual in Gats so the the plan as a by inference is that they would screen every individual and they would put accredited individuals who have no link to Hamas on the distribution list those individuals would be notified by text message to come to pick up the uh the rations that they are allocated at a certain time in a certain place and their identities would be verified by face recognition and other technologies and then they would go they would take those rations those rations would presumably be just enough for a few days perhaps a week so that they would um there would be very little chance of them falling into the hands of anybody else and then they would have to um come back so it is um the the the welfare indeed the survival of every Palestinian family in Gaza would be dependent upon on a week-to-eek basis on this type of surveillance and and accreditation system in a you can look at it as the the sort of the counterpart of the uh the surveillance and AI algorithms the the the lavender system that is being used by Israel to identify by um members of Hamas whom they are targeting for u assassination so they would have a counterpart for feeding the people whom they um are prepared to keep alive meanwhile Alex Dval the New York Times is reporting some Israeli officials are privately admitting Gaza is on the brink of starvation and warn of the effects if the blockade is not lifted since it takes a while there are thousands of trucks waiting outside to get in to increase the humanitarian aid and you have President Trump today in Qatar uh talking about um uh is Gaza being a freedom zone controlled by the United States your response i'm not quite sure what President Trump means by a a freedom zone but I think it is it is clear across the board um with the information that we have and I have no doubt Israel has pretty much the same information and they may just dispute some of the details but the the overall um picture is is completely clear that something dramatic is going to have to be done to prevent mass starvation and and and and famine unfolding in the very near future in in Gaza the situation cannot be allowed to to get to the brink and then just pull back slightly from the brink has been as has been happening when the Israelis um opened u supply routes and and food distribution a year ago and and again with the the ceasefire a few months ago the population simply cannot withstand um this type of pressure for uh really any longer without the the utmost catastrophe unfolding well Alex you conclude your piece by saying that Israel may quote do just enough to keep most Palestinians alive but whether this prevents the destruction of Palestinians in Gaza as a group is another matter if you could say what you mean by that what do you imagine Israel will do so the um what we see in this process of if if it unfolds this sort of individually targeted surveillance humanitarianism is keeping individuals and and families alive but dismantling the entire structure of society now clearly the uh the dismantling of Hamas is the political and military goal of of Israel but if it goes further towards the dismantling of society as a whole which is one of the things that we often see during famines it's not just that individualized biological suffering it is the tearing apart of social bonds the collective humiliation the degradation of society that is the the the deep trauma the profound experience of famine if that is allowed to proceed then Palestinian society as it has existed will be in irrevocably changed torn apart traumatized and if Israel knowingly does this then it will be culpable not just of the the war crime of starvation but of the destruction of of of the Palestinian people of Gaza alex Dval thank you so much for being with us executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tus University author of the book Mass Starvation: The History and Future

Also tonight, the severe storms and tornado threat right now multiple states, the South, the Northeast, the seat of LaGuardia airport in New York, and in Boston tonight, Lee Goldberg is here. First tonight, President Trump talking to ABC News about Elon Musk saying Musk has lost his mind. With the president revealed, and with the president said just moments ago, about whether he has any plans to talk to Musk, Jonathan Carl standing by. Also, as we come on the air tonight, the tornado and flood threats reported tornadoes already in multiple states, storms moving into the Northeast, embossed in giant trees coming down. And the images coming in at this hour from the Guardia airport, planes backed up As far as you can see, the ground stops, the storms tonight and right into the weekend, legal, but standing by with the forecast. ABCU's the first to report late today, deported migrant Kilmar, a bregal Garcia is now back on U.S. soil, return from El Salvador. Months after the White House acknowledged it was an administrative error to deport him. But the return comes with a major turn In this case, the charges he's now facing here in the U.S. Russia attacking Ukraine, saying its retaliation for those Ukrainian drones that struck deep inside Russia. Martha Ratitz is in Ukraine tonight as the missiles come down and tonight her exclusive interview with President Zelensky. Zelensky revealing it was Russian drivers who unknowingly drove those drones deep into Russia. And what else he told Martha? Tonight, the American passenger describing the horror as tourists are trapped in a crowded ferry that capsize. The tour boat flooding with water, passengers jumping for their lives, smashing windows to get out. There is breaking news at this hour back in the U.S. the former sheriff, a convicted murderer on the run, who escaped in a makeshift uniform and where they have just found him what we've learned. also the fugitive father who authorities say killed his three young daughters tonight the hunt for him widening and what they're now telling members of the community overseas tonight the American heroes in Normandy. We remember D day and we remember what they told us on the beaches of Normandy and our promise and hanging by a thread. He's been performing his own death defying stunts for years. Tonight Tom Cruise just setting a new world record you'll see it right here. &gt;&gt; From ABC news world headquarters in New York this is world news tonight with David New York. &gt;&gt; Good evening and it's great to have you with us here Friday night will get to these storms the tornado threat and that scene at LaGuardia Airport here in New York City and images of the storm setting Boston all of it in a moment here. Lee, of course, has the forecast. But we do begin tonight with President Trump talking to ABC News about Elon Musk. Tonight, President Trump telling our Jonathan Karl that Musk, quote, &quot;has lost his mind.&quot; And what the president said just moments ago about whether he has any plans to talk with Musk. ABC's chief Washington course, but at Jonathan Karl leading us off, after talking with the president about Musk amid this explosive feud between the two men. A day after his explosive breakup with Elon Musk, President Trump told me, &quot;Musk is quote the man who has lost his mind, adding that Musk wants to talk to him, but he's quote not particularly interested in talking to Musk right now.&quot; In just a moment to go, ABC's Rachel Scott asking Trump about Musk. &quot;You have any plans to speak with Mr. Musk? This was one of her closest advisors.&quot; I don't have any plans. Sources close to the president tell me Trump is telling people that Musk's outburst happened because he's using drugs. I asked Trump about that, but he wouldn't comment on the record. The president later told CNN about Musk, quote, &quot;He's got a problem. The poor guy's got a problem.&quot; This after yesterday's spectacle, which began when Trump in the Oval Office reacted to Musk's escalating attacks on his budget bill, which Musk has called a, quote, disgusting abomination. I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot. Musk was watching and while Trump was still speaking, he fired back. Posting, without me, Trump would have lost the election, such in gratitude. Trump responded on his own social media, suggesting Musk was just another disgruntled former employee, saying, quote, &quot;Elon was wearing thin. I asked him to leave.&quot; He also threatened to cut Musk's $20 billion dollars in government contracts. Musk went nuclear, suggesting Trump should be impeached and then going even further, linking Trump and notorious sex trafficker, Jeffrey Epstein. Time to drop the really big bomb Musk posted on X. Real Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. That explosive accusation caught everyone by surprise. FBI director Cash Patel, hearing what Musk had said while he was in the middle of an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan. - Jesus Christ, that's a crazy thing to say. How does he know? Does he know that Donald Trump is in the Epstein files? Or does he have access to the Epstein files? - I don't know how he would, but I'm just staying out of the Trump Elon thing. That's way out, my God. - What the fuck are they doing? - What the fuck are they doing? I know my lane and that ain't it. But overnight, it seemed like both Mosque and the President were trying to tone things down. When one of Trump's top supporters posted, they should make peace for the benefit of our great country. We are much stronger together than apart. Mosque responded, &quot;You're not wrong.&quot; In sources, teleBC News at the White House is considering either selling or giving away that red Tesla Model S that Trump brought bought with some fanfare back in March as a show of support for Elon Musk. Trump was just asked about this on Air Force One and he said he hasn't really thought about it. - John Carl and the conversation, John, thank you. We turned out of the severe storms on the move tonight from Texas really all the way up into the Northeast. In fact, look at the images from LaGuardia Airport in New York City tonight. Ground stops at multiple airports across the Northeast at LaGuardia, the line of planes. As far as you can see, the delays mounting amid multiple ground stops and the storms moving in. Near Lubbock, Texas, a tornado bearing down in a home but somehow that home was spared. This one also near Lubbock, more than two dozen reported tornadoes in just the past 24 hours. In Vamburian, Arkansas, a tornado striking this neighborhood, damaging more than 50 homes. And today, on Massachusetts storms reaching into the northeast, giant trees coming down to cars and homes in South Boston. Lee Goldberg standing by with the forecast and Maria V. Ariole in Texas tonight. Tonight more than 35 million on alert for severe storms. tornado siren sounding in Van Buren Arkansas just after dawn. Sheat metal flying off this warehouse. Authorities in Van Buren say at least 50 structures were hit. How's your place? It's gone. If thanks gone. families in shock. I just heard a big noise. My window cracked a tree fell in the in the window. Man, it was this close to my bed. overnight multiple tornadoes reported in New Mexico and West Texas. This powerful twister churned near Lubbock Storm chasers, Simon Brewer and Justin Drake getting up close. Oh my gosh, man! Storms also dumped a rental rain that swamped drivers in shallow water texas. Lightning likely to blame for these massive oil storage tanks erupting in flames southeast of Oklahoma City. and an early round of storms in the Boston area taking down trees. Plains stacked up at New York's LaGuardia airport, more than 100 flights canceled their alone, as the northeast is under threat again tonight. And David, you can see with the damage left behind by those storm straight line winds, heading this building, knocking it all over. Families tell me right now they are very concerned about the weather that is expected to hit over the next few days. We're talking about hail more rain and now this entire area Lubbock they are under a tornado watch. David. Yeah, all over again, Maria. Thank you. Let's get right to chief meteorologist Lee Goldberg of our New York station, W A B C back with us tonight. Highly. Hi, David. It's the very thundest room warning in the Lubbock area right now. We can't get a break in this area. There's a tornado warning in the Oklahoma Panhandle. The watches extend to Eastern Colorado. There's another tornado to watch western Kentucky, western Tennessee. We've had severe storms in New England, showers in the Hudson Valley have been tracking storms here in the New York area. Let's time this out. Showers and storms, ways of them. We'll go through the northeastern in the day tomorrow. They'll be offshore in the evening and then our focus turns to the south. And we have a severe threat all the way from Texas and Oklahoma to the East Coast. Some of the strongest storms and enhanced threat for damaging winds over Mississippi and Alabama. By Sunday, you're talking about a threat that's on the East Coast from Virginia Beach to Savannah and a renewed threat once again over the Texas Panhandle. They can't get away from the storms. David. Lee Gilbert back with us on a Friday night, thank you Lee. Tonight, ABC News, the first report that deported migrant, Kilmar, Obrego Garcia, is now back on US soil, returned from El Salvador months after the White House acknowledged it was an administrative error to deport him in the first place. But the return tonight comes with a major twist in this case, the charges he now faces here in the US. Here's Pierre Thomas. Tonight, ABC News first to report Kilmar, Arbago Garcia, with a White House initially said was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, is now back on American soil. A dramatic turn in an ongoing political firestorm. The government of El Salvador sending him back today after an arrest warrant was issued here in the U.S. &quot;The man has a horrible past, and I can see a decision being made, bring him back show everybody how horrible this guy is. Yeah, you drivers that Lauren connected to this 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. Arbago Garcia driving an SUV with nine other people in sign. I mean, how many roles have you got in here? Four? Troopers at the scene suspicious. He's a hate-hawling these people for money. You got a [bleep] dollar is what he's doing. And tonight, a DOJ indictment accusing Arbregogarcia of being part of a human smuggling operation that transported drugs, weapons, and thousands of undocumented migrants, including MS-13 gang members and children across the country. He made over 100 trips the grand jury found, smuggling people throughout our country. Tonight, Arbago Garcia's lawyers blasting the government's actions. They'll stop at nothing at all, even some of the most preposterous charges imaginable, just to avoid admitting that they made a mistake, which is what everyone knows happened in this case. Abrego Garcia's return coming almost two months after the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that his removal to Al Salvador was, quote, &quot;eligo.&quot; In order to trump administration to facilitate his return. Tonight, DOJ filing notice in federal court saying it believes it has complied with a judges' order to return Abrego Garcia here to the U.S. and that the case should be dismissed. &quot;Here, Thomas, in Washington, here, thank you. We turn now to the war in Ukraine. Martha Raditz is there as Russia now attacks Ukraine, Russia saying its retaliation for those Ukrainian drones. Tonight, Martha's exclusive interview with President Zelensky, Zelensky revealing it was actually Russian drivers who unknowingly drove those Ukrainian drones deep inside Russia. Martha Raditz tonight and her exclusive interview from Kiev as those Russian missiles came down overnight. Tonight, Ukraine reeling from a deadly and terrifying barrage. Nearly 500 Russian missiles and drones raining down on Ukraine. Russia says this is retaliation for that stunning Ukrainian attack. There's Ukrainian drones that flew deep inside Russia and set Russian military planes on fire. Now, Russian missiles slamming this neighborhood in video circulating online. An outside cave where we are, explosions as Russia's fury is felt here. (gunfire) Ukraine's national athletics team taking cover as bombs fell around them. We took shelter during a relentless four hour long assault here, our team in the bunker as Russia targeted nearly every corner of Ukraine. More than 50 people have been killed or wounded in these attacks, and tonight, with his country under attack, my exclusive interview with President Zelinsky. - It's quite a night. Yeah, this is going on. We ask about that brazen drone attack on Russia. Drone's launching out of containers of top trucks, soaring toward their targets, setting multiple Russian warplanes, including nuclear-capable bombers on fire. Zelensky telling me it took a year and a half to plan, then making this stunning revelation, saying the Russians themselves unknowingly delivered those drones to their locations. &quot;You had Russian drivers who had no idea.&quot; &quot;They didn't know.&quot; &quot;They didn't know.&quot; &quot;The drivers didn't know what they do.&quot; &quot;Yeah, they just did their job.&quot; And three years into this bloody war, we ask the Ukrainian leader to respond to this comment from President Trump comparing it to two children fighting in the park. Sometimes you see two young children fighting like crazy. They hate each other and they're fighting in a park. And you try and pull them apart. They don't want to be pulled. Sometimes you're better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart. Do you think the president is getting that message when he says things like it's two children fighting? A president. &quot;It's not about President Trump, Zelensky told me. It's really about any person who is thousands of miles away and cannot fully feel and understand this pain, adding, we are not kids with Putin at the playground. He is a murderer who came to this park to kill the kids.&quot; And, David, President Zelensky telling me he does not believe that Putin wants peace and is urging President Trump and world leaders to put much stronger sanctions on Russia. Meanwhile, here in Ukraine, those intense Russian bombings continue. David. Martha Raditz, Ukraine for us tonight. Martha, thank you. She'll be in key. Even more of her interview with President Zelensky and her reporting. Sunday morning, right here on ABCs this week, we'll be watching Martha. Thanks. Back here in the U.S. tonight, there is breaking news, authorities saying escape killer a former police chief is now back in custody in Stone County, Arkansas tonight. He's known as the Devil in the Ozarks. Grant Hardin was recaptured this afternoon about a mile and a half from the prison grounds. He was on the run for 12 days. Prison officials say he wore a law enforcement style uniform to get past guards to make his escape. Now back in custody tonight. Now to the American passenger describing the horror after tourists were trapped in a crowded ferry that tourboat flooding with water, passengers jumping for their lives smashing windows to get out. Here's Britclinit. &quot;Tonight, an American tourist speaking out after surviving this horrific ferry sinking off the coast of Bali. 24-year-old Lauren Deg was on the trip of a lifetime celebrating her birthday when the ferry was suddenly hit by a large wave. Everyone was screaming bloody murder and like, get out because they were saying like, go, go, go out the front but they had nowhere to go. Aji nine passengers and five crew on board, the ship taking on water, beginning to tilt. Lauren kicking the window, breaking the glass to escape. Passengers desperately clinging to the overturned ferry being pummeled by waves. People were just throwing themselves, just jumping across to the other. All survived according to Indonesian authorities who sent in divers to ensure no one was trapped. And David, that passenger at Laura and saying that among those scrambling to escape were people with babies and old people. David. Just extraordinary, Britt. Thank you. When we come back tonight, word coming in, the school shooting the authorities say they foiled. It was planned for a high school graduation more in a moment.

Tonight authorities issue a new warning in their man-hunt for a father accused of killing his three young daughters in rural Washington State, police releasing a new image of Army veteran Travis Decker. The bodies of his daughters were found near a campground in Chaland County. Residents in the area tonight are now being urged to lock all doors, windows, when we come back tonight, the American heroes were turning the Normandy and will go there too. And Tom Cruise jumping into the record books tonight and you'll see it. - To the index, Tom Cruise landing in the Guinness Book of World Records tonight.

He jumps from the helicopter, deploys the shoot and sets it on fire. And by the way, he did this 16 times. That's why he's Tom Cruise. When we come back here, the moving image in Normandy, you've got to see this tonight, the World War II hero and his one wish for everyone at home listening. What he told us in the moment.

          <attvalue for="7" value="thank you for coming and for joining us here in beautiful Los Angeles California i hope you had a hope you had a good long weekend i hope you had a good Memorial Day yesterday was uh Memorial Day the day on which we remember the sacrifices our fellow Americans made to protect the freedoms we now willingly give up in exchange for a red baseball cap our our president celebrated the first two letters of Memorial Day this weekend um just right off the bat you're not supposed to say happy Memorial Day it's a day of remembrance and respect so of course our hippopotus began the day by wishing a happy Memorial Day to all which okay at least it was positive for a change oh what's that oh there's more including the scum that spent the last four years trying to destroy our country blah blah blah blah blah blah blah any subject he connected to the previous administration would you like some ketchup Mr president ketchup if Biden was still in charge we'd never catch up he's a loser i'll just leave it here on the table oh thank you thank you trump gave um the commencement speech at West Point on Saturday now West Point if you don't know is where the brightest and sharpest go to learn to lead military people but when it comes to speaking to young future leaders most of them around 22 years old no one knows how to motivate and inspire like our commander-in-chief to be really successful you're always going to have to work hard an example is a great athlete Gary Player great golfer he wasn't as big as the other men that were playing against him great big strong guys gary was a smaller guy i don't want to say too he's a friend of mine and he gets a little angry at people because he hits the ball just as far he said &quot;I hit the ball further than them why am I [Applause] small?&quot; Maybe you didn't eat your vegetables i don't know i have no idea all I do know is nothing lights up a crowd of young people like a story about 89year-old golf legend Gary Player except maybe for a warning about trophy wives i tell a story sometimes about a man who was a great great real estate man he ended up getting a divorce found a new wife could you say a trophy wife i guess we can say a trophy wife it didn't work out too well but it doesn't and that doesn't work out too well i must tell you a lot of trophy wives doesn't work out but it made him happy for a little while at least think we just found out what it would be like to take a whole graduating class to visit grandpa in the home i mean how long before we find him wandering in his bathrobe along the side of the road in fairness he did get into military stuff at one point dazzling the graduates with insight into some of the new technology and weaponry that awaits them it's a very different uh war fair out there today now they've introduced a thing called drone right well drone it's It's controlled by a thing called computer he always sounds like a caveman who just got thawed out of a block of ice as far as I know Trump didn't charge the cadetses for the speech that was a freebie unlike the event he had at his golf course an exclusive dinner with the president for the top 220 grifters who purchased his cryptocurrency in large amounts the VIP guest list reportedly shelled out a total of $148 million for the chance to dine with the president of the United States just as our founding fathers intended some of these people paid tens of millions of dollars to be there expecting to get the chance to talk to Trump instead he showed up he spoke for about 15 or 20 minutes he danced his way off stage to YMC he danced out of the room and all the way to the bank and said &quot;No.&quot; He treated these crypto bros like they were his own sons and didn't meet personally with any of them didn't take photos they said the dinner was bad a lot of them left disappointed you know we talk a lot about how much Trump hates people who don't agree with him he also seemed to be too fond of the ones who do one of the items on the menu for dinner was what they called a Trump organic field green salad which is funny because salad is the only thing he knows less about than crypto it's quite an in celebration there are about 200 people in this photo i think about four of them are women and the number one token holder was Chinese-born crypto mogul Justin's son well even Chinese crypto bros are named Justin ain't that something and if that name sounds familiar it's because you remember that dope who blew $6.2 million on a banana duct taped to a wall that's Justin's son so you got some savvy investors here including former Lakers and Clippers star and Kardashian mate Lamar Odum who came out of hiding uh one time Lamar Odin I don't remember spent $75,000 on a 4-day trip to a brothel that is now Lamar's second biggest waste of money but good for him you know this here's how you know this club coin is legitimate when the top holders are former uh sex drug and gambling addicts and Chinese banana collectors it was a turbulent weekend for Donald Trump you know how he promised he would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours well it turns out he hasn't and he's starting to now realize that he may have misjudged his KGBF yeah I'll give you an update i'm not happy with what Putin's doing he's killing a lot of people and I don't know what the hell happened to Putin i've known him a long time always gotten along with him but he's sending rockets into cities and killing people and I don't like it at all okay we're in the middle of talking and he's shooting rockets into Kiev and other cities i don't like it at all he doesn't like it at all i mean what happened he used to be such a sweet guy now he's firing rockets trump has two modes there's the I know more than everyone mode and the I'm just finding out what everyone already knew what do you want to do about that i'm surprised i'm very surprised we'll see what we're going to do what am I going to tell you you're the fake news aren't you you're totally fake all right any other questions i don't like what Putin is doing not even a little bit he's killing people and something happened to this guy and I don't like it something happened huh what happened this is not the Putin I married so this morning Trump issued a sternly worded something he wrote &quot;What Vladimir Putin doesn't realize is that if it weren't for me lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia and I mean really bad he's playing with fire.&quot; Well that should do it that should Vladimir Putin poisons people and throws them out windows you think you're going to scare him with the title of a John Cena movie but Trump isn't the only elder statesman with a a friend in need king Charles was in Canada today to show his support for the Commonwealth during this difficult time the King delivered an uncharacteristically fiery speech this morning in front of the Canadian Parliament [Laughter] [Music] sentences won't someone please come lick the royal thumb next i want to see him try to open a Capri Sun that would be better so then once once he was able to pry the Manila envelope pages apart the king spoke not just with power but also with grace every time I come to Canada a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream and from there straight to my heart gross i don't know sound like somebody went a little nuts on the poutine and while Charles had trouble showing who's in charge in Canada no one had a longer weekend than the president of France Emanuel Mcronone do you see the video of him getting smacked by his wife so the Mcron landed in Vietnam and and they open the doors and then you can see there he is in the back and you see his wife Rajit shoves him in the he realized he's on camera he gives a little bone shore let's see that again because you can see here um two hands straight to the head and then uh it's what the French call sakre blue this video was immediately everywhere mcronone claimed afterwards that they were joking around and I don't know about you I would have been open to believing that had I not watched them get off the plane and walk down the stairs because you can see he shakes this guy's hand now he offers his wife who has just um pushed him uh no no thank you she doesn't take the arm very Melania of her it's uh but who knows maybe they were joking we're looking at at this through American eyes they probably just finished having sex with the flight attendant you know a slap is how the French put a button on a manager that's how you know it's over it wasn't exactly a freakoff let's just say that have you been following this Diddy trial GMO no I haven't you have You do have a new um thing on your Yeah I have a new boot thank God yes okay very good well I will tell you things aren't looking pretty for Diddy right now the court heard testimony today from one of his former assistants a woman named Capricorn Clark who said on her first day on the job he told her &quot;If anything happens I will have to kill you.&quot; Which is a heck of a way to say welcome to the team it's not a great orientation but Kid Cuddy testified he said Diddy snuck into his house and unwrapped his family's Christmas presents which I would very much like to see depicted in a Hallmark Channel holiday movie at some point we can wait but Cuddi also claimed Diddy blew up his Porsche with a Molotov cocktail which is rude and then they asked Capricorn Clark about this today and she said she had no idea how Diddy and his security guy broke into Kid Cuy's house though considering everything we know about how much baby oil he used he's he probably slid in through the mail slot now I mentioned last week people have been going nuts online about the courtroom sketches people are are fascinated because they say they don't look anything like Diddy or the witnesses but it's easy to say that when you know who you're looking at they know it's Diddy to start with so they're biased so we decided to consult a jury of pedestrians who had not seen the drawings had no information about them at all we sent a team out to Hollywood Boulevard with the actual courtroom sketches to ask a simple question who is this who is this man i have no idea who is this um I have no idea i have no idea i have no clue he's either in the Lakers or he is in prison um it's not Malcolm X it's not MLK nero wasn't he some kind of leader or ruler was that the guy that just brought me over here ash I actually kind of see it who is this rodney Kenny i don't know jeffrey upstag came to mind not OJ Simpson is it and who's the attorney he's hugging johnny Cochran do you think OJ was innocent i would it's like I'm 50/50 with that one who is this man sean Cole that's him again that's him that's him again that's definitely him oh that's him in the hotel mom how did you hurt your neck oh I dislocated my shoulder did you slip on baby oil i know that's my hair gmo do you know how many subscribers we have on YouTube now uh 20 millions that's right yeah that's why we're wearing these glasses thanks for being a subscriber if you're not help us get to 20 million and one [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="i'm Jimmy I'm the host Very kind Thank you for watching Thank you for joining us I'm glad you're here We have a um we have a special theme for the show tonight or at least for the monologue tonight It's a through line that seems to be running through everything lately And that through line is stupid This is going to be a stupid show And why not look around you We're living in the golden age of stupid right now We are unable to distinguish between fiction and fact We seem to have learned nothing from the past Science is now a matter of opinion According to researchers at John's Hopkins University since the pandemic vaccination rates for measles mumps and reubella are waning Fewer people are getting them for themselves and for their kids Turns out the only thing we learned from co co is how to make sourdough bread But in Hawaii vaccination rates have dropped 15% which it dangerously threatens what they call herd immunity Have you ever noticed that people who do their own research always do it wrong They're never like I did a deep dive and uh turns out every credible scientist in the world says we should get the measles vaccine So I did I Trump is actively waging war against Harvard University which seems to be one of the very few institutions with integrity right now They are fighting back Although according to CNN a lot of other colleges have begun quietly negotiating to avoid the president's wrath I hear Brown University just changed their name to Orange to appease him Trump right now is pushing back against a story from the best-selling author of multiple Trump tell alls Michael Wolf who says the real reason he's going after Harvard is because they didn't accept him when he was a student Trump responded &quot;Michael Wolf a third rate reporter who was laughed at even by the scoundrels of the fake news recently stated that the only reason I'm beating up on Harvard is because I applied there and didn't get in.&quot; The story is totally false I never applied to Harvard In other words he applied to Harvard Harvard is really in a terrible spot The White House trying to cut their funding They're threatening to revoke visas for foreign students This woman was one of the commencement speakers at Harvard She graduated from the school And pay attention to what's happening in the background while she talks because somehow it weirdly sums everything up The message itself is if I have to put it into one sentence it will be humanity rises and falls as one I think we are living in a very difficult time There's a lot of divisions in terms of know ideas um ethnicities identities and I think this is a time where we can use a little bit more moral imagination and imagine ourselves being connected with Yeah Or we could just keep beating each other's ass until we get hit by a truck You know Harvard may be the most elite university in the world but it is still in Boston Don't ever forget that Trump claims the reason for his battle with Harvard is he wants them to crack down on anti-semitism which is definitely why his people voted for him especially this guy who Trump pardoned on his first day He hates anti-semitism so much he wore a Camp Awitz hoodie to demonstrate But despite the overall feeling of gloom at our nation's universities our students are still graduating still having fun This is the scene at CalPoly Pomona where one new graduate started his postacademic career with a flip Scotty Nin The Nin is short for ninoop And then we have the high school version of that from South Plantation High School in Broward County Florida Ailio Rodriguez See this is what happens when you make the owner of the WWE Secretary of Education But the biggest flip of the day belongs to Elon Musk On Friday Trump gave Elon Musk the key to the White House And I guess he better change the locks because today Musk had something very nasty to say about Trump's big beautiful bill He wrote &quot;I'm sorry but I just can't stand it anymore This massive outrageous pork filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination Shame on those who voted for it You know you did wrong You know it.&quot; Boy when he's off the ketamine he is a lot less fun I mean he's right but shame on those who voted for it Who bankrolled these people that voted for it I want the name of whoever bankroll Oh wait It's his name For Elon Musk to call this a disgusting abomination is really saying something because this is the man who created this disgusting abomination Musk also tweeted that Congress is bankrupting America Yo Elon bro were you not paying attention when Trump said he was going to run the country like one of his businesses Trump versus Elon What an unexpected I'm not sure who to root for It's like Diddy versus R Kelly Obviously this was a um a big deal at the White House So uh they asked press secretary Karen Levit about it and she dodged that question like her boss did the draft How mad do you think President Trump is going to be when he finds out that Elon Musk said &quot;I'm sorry but I just can't stand it anymore This massive outrageous pork- fililled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination Shame on those who voted for it You know you did wrong You know it Look the president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill It doesn't change the president's opinion This is one big beautiful bill and he's sticking to it I love that the question is how angry is the president going to be Is it going to be Chernobyl or Vuvius Just going to be regular Mad or extra crispy either way She's very good at pretending grandpa is a sane individual Somehow Trump has managed to restrain himself and not lash out at Elon Musk probably for about 288 million reasons but it's only a matter of time Trump spent the day doing productive work He signed more in a series of important executive orders Sir the purpose of this executive order is for the beautifification of our national monuments specifically to augment the breasts on the Statue of Liberty You said that right now Lady Liberty is quote A5 and you felt that other countries are laughing at the size of the statue's bosom So this order allocates money meant for veteran housing to provide the Statue of Liberty with a 13 ton boob job He did a very good job didn't he How many people here could have done that I don't know I think a lot Now say I did a good job again Thanks Good job Guys I still have to give the president his bath So when he's done scribbling like a baby everybody applaud so that I can get home Is that it Yep Let's get you in the tub All right Okay Well that's a step in the right direction I'm for that The White House also unveiled Trump's new presidential portrait You know he wasn't happy with the one they shot for him when he took office in January so they he had them do it again And this is the new portrait It's called Sneering in the Dark Isn't that fun This is the last thing a McNugget sees before it dies They actually cropped the original photo was much wider They um they shot it on the Death Star Emperor Palpatini hand seated It's interesting because this was Trump's first presidential portrait in 2017 He's brightly lit He's smiling in front of American flag How did we get to this Could it be a robot clone of Donald Trump I mentioned last night Trump reposted an absolutely wacko conspiracy theory that says President Biden was really a robotic clone which was a topic of light-hearted conversation on Fox News That brings us right back to our theme tonight Apparently Donald Trump reposted somebody's post on Truth Social claiming that Biden had been executed in 2020 and was replaced by a robotic clone Clearly President Trump did not believe that I mean I know Trump's sense of humor I'm sure he was just trolling him What do you think Well I would hope so but I think also it gets to the real heart of this scandal which is who in the world was president for the past four years if it wasn't Joe Biden Was it a clone Was it a cable of White House officials Yes Was it a cable of White House officials Or even scarier a cabal of them That reminds me I need to cancel my subscription to Cabal Uh but don't let her misprononunciation distract you from the point she was making which was every bit as dumb as the word she got wrong Then we have our Secretary of Education Miss Linda McMahon who appeared before the Senate Appropriations Committee where Mark Wayne Mullen made a strong case for improving education in his home state of Oklahoma And what was we ranked in reading and math in 1979 I'm sorry what What was we ranked nationally in math and and and reading in 1979 You hearded me What was we ranked Was we reading good or reading bad That's what happens when you get homeschooled by your dog Luckily for Mark Wayne he wasn't the only dummy at the hearing He had some serious competition from Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana We spend $1.858 858 billion dollar a year on TRIO Yes More than 10 years Yes So that's over a trillion dollars we've spent on this program Madam Secretary and I'm not a great mathematician but I think you were talking about a trillion dollars Uh I believe 1.5 billion times 10 is $15 billion That's a little bit off from a trillion dollars I think the the budget cuts 1.2 billion for Well 1.2 that would be 12 billion not three Okay Okay All right Now we finally found a dumber Kennedy than RFK These are the people These are the people responsible for passing our budget They can't do simple math And to top it off we have a new character throwing his stunts cabinet in the ring the acting head of FEMA the guy in charge of the department supposed to help us after a natural disaster told his staff yesterday he wasn't aware the United States had a hurricane season which obviously had some of his staff concerned Then a spokesperson tried to spin it by telling the press he was joking This is the guy His name is David Richardson You tell me does this look like a guy who was joking This is There's not a funny bone in this body He looks like Vgo the Carpathian's mean older brother silently watching you drown It's Is there anyone in this administration who knows how to do their job You know there used to be a political party in the United States called the Nothings They didn't call themselves that They called themselves the American Party which they wanted to make America great again by kicking out the immigrants who back then were the Germans and the Irish like these two uh seen here stealing an election Does this sound familiar to anybody The Nothings argued that Germany and Ireland weren't sending their best people They were sending unskilled wretched refues like this guy Frederick Trump and this kid Patrick Kennedy And they had to go but they didn't go And now their ancestors are the new no nothings Including our head of homeland security Christy I don't know what habius corpus means Gnome And our secretary of education doesn't know the difference between AI and A1 And Pete I don't know who's on my signal thread or that I shouldn't be using Signal Hegth And now David I didn't know there was a hurricane season Richardson I hope we don't have a situation We have to put this new guy to the test But hurricane season is here And those individuals who still do work for FEMA Trump has already cut 2,000 of them want us to be ready when disaster does strike The following is a message from the Federal Emergency Management Agency Hurricane season is upon us and quite frankly it caught us off guard Uh with all the layoffs and budget cuts we just don't have the headsp space to deal with disasters this year So let's get you ready to be on your own Step one get a whistle That way if there's a flood and you get stuck in a raft or something you can blow it and maybe someone will help Step two sandbags Get some bags put sand in them That'll be good for something Step three get a membership to Mara Lago God sends hurricanes to punish drag queens and destroy woke libraries but God loves and protects President Trump and all his many properties And finally step four learn to like cat food Not just eat it like it Cat food is cheap and it's not as bad as you think Cat food has all the vitamins you need and it's a great way to bond with your pets So good luck I guess from those of us who were left here at FEMA Remember God helps those who help themselves This was a message from FEMA Paid for by your friends at Meow Mix Meow Mix not just for cats anymore I'm more of a fancy fish guy but that's GMO Do you know how many subscribers we have on YouTube now Uh 20 million That's right Yeah that's why we're wearing these glasses Thanks for being a subscriber If you're not help us get to 20 million and one" />

the Late Show we value every human being no matter who they love as long as they are Neielson families who buy our sponsors products Quick reminder for the month of June the Charman Bears will be pooping rainbows Enjoy the go One person one person without a lot to be proud of today is Iowa Senator and mother-in-law noticing you don't cut sandwiches the way her son likes Joanie Ernst Senator Ernst held a town hall on Friday on Friday where she attempted to sell Trump's big beautiful bill which happens to include big brazen cuts to Medicaid and the audience weren't buying it when you are arguing about illegals that are receiving Medicaid benefits 1.4 million 1.4 They're not they are not eligible So they will be coming off So we people are not well we all are going to die Mhm Wow Uhhuh Wow If that's your answer Senator why have any laws at all why have any regulation just update those bathroom signs to say employees could wash hands but death comes for us all Also also also Senator are we all going to die because if so someone should tell the United States Senate This exchange this uh this here exchange probably would have blown over eventually but people started criticizing Joanie Ernst and she couldn't not respond to that So she doubled down with this apology Hello everyone I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize for a statement that I made yesterday at my town hall I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that yes we are all going to perish from this earth So I apologize and I'm really really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the tooth fairy as well Oh my god is the tooth fairy dead i knew something was wrong when she didn't leave me cash after I had my crown replaced Also it's hard to tell in this video but Ernst apparently filmed this in a cemetery Wow Seems a little tonedeaf but it does explain her new campaign Yard Signs Ernst Ernst then explained why we should all stop struggling and simply long for the sweet embrace of death But for those that would like to see eternal and everlasting life I encourage you to embrace my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Yes Because Jesus was famous for his cavalier attitude toward the poor and the sick As it says in the Gospel of John &quot;Die Lazarus die Stay down.&quot; There you go People forget firm The fact that the hungering wolf of oblivion lapsed forever at our door with his eternal tongue isn't the only good news out there Because now it's official Elon Musk is leaving the federal government There you go There you go There it is In fact is this true i'm told we have footage of him waving goodbye No Wrong wave Wrong wave Elon Musk's time at the White House will be remembered as a steaming pile of public service As the chief chainsaw wielder of Doge he oversaw the firing of nearly 10,000 workers And according to one estimate his cuts to USAD have been blamed for 300,000 deaths But you know it's shocking shocking but that was just part of the GOP's campaign promise We are all going to perish from this earth According to Trump according to Donald Trump Elon isn't saying goodbye to Doge He's saying see you later Elon's really not leaving He's going to be back and forth I think I have a feeling it's it's his baby Yes And since it's his baby he's going to be naming it and abandoning its mother But the weirdest I think maybe the weirdest part of this weird weird beating was Elon's face because for some reason he had a black eye Oh no If only someone in the White House had access to [Music] makeup So So why why the black eye who hates who hates Elon Musk enough to punch him in the face i'm not Sherlock Holmes but could it be everyone plastic this is plastic We had a long debate in rehearsal whether this was worth the stage weight of going for it What do you think so I think it was Now thank you citizen When asked about his shiner Elon blamed his 5-year-old son X Mr Musk what is your eye okay what happened to your your eye i noticed there's a bruise there Yeah Know I was just horsing around with little X and I said uh go ahead punch me in the face And he did Completely normal thing every every normal parent says to their child because because we all know parents know you got to run bedtime like a prison yard Okay Okay buddy you know the drill Put on your PJs brush your teeth and walk up to the biggest daddy in this room and punch him right in the face Wow Although Trump made a a big deal of appreciating Elon behind the scenes he's just as skeved out as the rest of us Reportedly Trump has described Musk as 50% genius 50% boy Better watch out Elon because by your own logic that means 50% of you wants to punch you in the face Now to be to be fair Elon might seem a little eccentric because he is absolutely zooted to the gills on Vitamin Freak According to a new report during the 2024 campaign Elon was using drugs far more intensely than previously known including ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms It's not clear exactly when Musk was taking the combination of ecstasy and shrooms but I'm guessing they kicked in right about [Applause] here I'm Super Jack Wow that's good That's good In addition to the shroom and eballs he was also apparently on weight loss drugs or as the guy he endorsed calls it the fat shot drug Elon's favorite flavor of brain spice evidently was uh was ketamine which he told people he was taking so much of that it was affecting his bladder Wow Bad for Elon Great for my pre-show diction exercises The a-hole's khole effed his pee hole The a-hole's khole effed his pee hole Yay Get out of here I don't know what it's about I don't know what we're doing here I don't know what we're doing Now Elon had previously said that he took a small amount of the drug to treat depression but it seems like he might have been taking way more than that because bladder problems impact chronic users of ketamine and can lead to frequent and painful urination and episodes of incontinence That is rough You know you're depressed so you take ketamine Then you take so much ketamine that you pee your pants and that makes you more depressed So you need more ketamine I mean is there is there any way to break this vicious cycle we are all going to perish from this earth Thank you Senator Thank you Thank you We have message of hope Musk denied the drug abuse posting I am not taking drugs The New York Times was lying their ass off I tried prescription ketamine a few years ago and said so on X Well it wasn't just on X It was also on mushrooms and ketamine Let's see what other to what other totally normal things happened while we were off Oh yeah Um on Saturday the president of the United States posted a conspiracy theory that Joe Biden was executed and replaced by a robot clone Now okay obviously this is absolutely crazy You can't be a robot and a clone Okay it's complete madness Unless follow me down the rabbit hole here Follow me down deep under Cheyenne Mountain to the nuclear strike proof NORAD command center where top engineers may have collaborated with geneticists using crisper to follow the instructions in a manual like this that I made on my work printer titled Project Build Back Better that contains blueprints for something called the Jobot that could be controlled remotely from Hunter Biden's laptop It was a perfect plan with only one flaw The jobot couldn't recognize George Clooney Let's take a look at the post the president of the United States shared There is no hashtag Joe Biden executed in 2020 # Biden clones doubles and robotic engineered soulless mindless entities are what you see That's right In 2020 a secret cabal took out an old slow Joe Biden and replaced him with an older slower Joe Biden Oh yes Oh yes It's it's it's natural It's just like when you trade in your rusted out 93 Honda Civic for an old man who loves trains And any if any of you doubting Thomases out there need more proof Trump's post shows two signatures Biden's old signature Joe Biden and the clone one JR Biden Back to the rabbit hole Okay we all know the R stands for Robinette but this story is all about doubles So the double E and the double T cancel each other out Now we're left with Robin Rob in What's the opposite of in out Rob out Very curious And who are the Democrats trying to fool you Robot Joe Biden We got a great show for you tonight My guests are Jean Smart and North Carolina Governor Josh Stein When we come back are men okay are we [Applause] [Music] Hey [Applause]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="MR. SCHIFF: TODAY, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ART OF THE DEAL, BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN BUSY MAKING DEALS, NOT HIS PROMISED TRADE DEALS. THOSE ARE HEAVY ON PROMISES, BUT VERY LIGHT ON ACTUAL DEALS. NOT ANY DEALS IN CONGRESS TO LOWER COSTS FOR THE AMERICAN PE PEOPLE THAT COULD MAKE IT EASIER TO AFFORD A HOME OR TO BUY GROCERIES. IN FACT, WITH FEWER CARGO SHIPS ARRIVING IN OUR PORTS, AND OUR CLOSEST ALLIES AND NEIGHBORS BOYCOTTING AMERICAN GOODS, THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE NOTHING BUT MAKE YOUR LIFE MORE DIFFICULT. MEDICAID IS UNDER ATTACK. SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICES ARE CLOSING BY THE DOZENS. FOOD ASSISTANCE, RENTSAL ASSISTANCE, ENERGY ASSISTANCE, ALL ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK. THERE IS NO END TO THE DESTRUCTION. THE FIRST 114 DAYS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN ONE BAD DEAL AFTER ANOTHER FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES. BUT IF YOUR LAST NAME IS TRUMP? THESE 114 DAYS HAVE BEEN JUST ABOUT THE GREATEST DEAL OF ALL TIME. NEW AIRPLANES FROM YOUR FRIENDS IN THE GULF. NEW HOTEL DEALS. NEW GOLF COURSES. NEW MEME COUNCILS. NEW TOWERS -- NEW MEME COINS, NEW TOWERS. YOU NAME IT, DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY ARE CASHING IN. SO TODAY, I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT JUST A FEW OF THOSE DEALS FOR THE TRUMP FAMILY, HOW HE'S LINING HIS OWN POCKETS AND FLEECING THE REST OF US IN THE PROCESS. HOW HIS FAMILY IS GETTING EVEN RICHER, WHILE THE REST OF US ARE TREATED LIKE SUCKERS. TODAY, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE TEN BEST DEALS FOR DONALD TRUMP AND THE WORST DEALS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HOW THE GRAFT IS ON FULL DISPLAY, AND HOW YOU, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, ARE BEING LEFT HOLDING THE BAG. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK FAR FROM THE WHITE HOUSE TO FIND SOME OF THE MOST FLAGRANT EXAMPLES. SO ENTERING IN AT NUMBER TEN OF THE TOP TEN DEALS FOR DONALD TRUMP AND THE WORST DEALS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WE ONLY NEED TO LOOK AT THE SOUTH LAWN. WE ALL SAW THIS HAPPEN ON THE WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS. DONALD TRUMP AND ELON MUSK TURNING THE PLACE INTO A TESLA SHOW ROOM. BUT WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED IS WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE AND AFTER THIS PHOTO WAS TAKEN. JUST BEFORE TRUMP TURNED THE WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS INTO A USED CAR LOT, TESLA STOCK HAD BEEN IN AN HISTORIC AND DISASTROUS SLUMP. WITH THEIR MARKET VALUE CUT IN HALF SINCE DECEMBER, MUSK NEEDED A JOLT TO HIS AILING COMPANY, AND HE GOT IT. WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED WHETHER HIS SYMBOLIC PURCHASE OF A TESLA AT THE WHITE HOUSE MIGHT HELP THE COMPANY'S STOCK, TRUMP SAID, I HOPE IT DOES. BUT THAT WASN'T ALL. BECAUSE THE BEST PART OF THE DEAL FOR DONALD TRUMP TOOK PLACE AFTER THE TESLAS HAD BEEN DRIVEN AWAY AND THE CAMERAS HAD BEEN PACKED UP. BECAUSE NOT LONG AFTER THE SPECIAL LIVE STREAM ON X, OR TWITTER, HAD ENDED, SOMETHING EVEN MORE IMPORTANT HAPPENED. WITH TESLA SHARES ON THE REBOUND, ELON MUSK PROMISED TO PUMP $100 MILLION INTO DONALD TRUMP'S POLITICAL OPERATION. THAT'S RIGHT, DONALD TRUMP RECEIVED ONE OF THE LARGEST POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS IN AMERICAN HISTORY, ALL FOR THE PRICE OF ONE MEASLY TESLA MODEL S AND THE USE OF THE WHITE HOUSE AS A SALES ROOM. A DAMN GOOD DEAL FOR DONALD TRUMP, IF YOU ASK ME. FOR YOU, THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER, NOTHING AT ALL. ZERO, ZILCH, ZADEH. ALL YOU GOT -- ZERO, ZILCH, NADA. FOR NUMBER NINE, WE ZOOM TO MAR-A-LAGO WHERE YOU CAN GENERALLY FIND THE PRESIDENT GOLFING ON YOUR DIME AND LINING HIS POCKETS IN THE PROCESS. WE SAW THIS DURING THE FIRST TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, BUT AT THAT TIME HE WAS STILL FINISHING THE FRONT NINE. DURING HIS FIRST TERM, DONALD TRUMP MADE AN ASTOUNDING 473 TRIPS TO HIS OWN GOLF COURSES WHILE IN OFFICE. BUT THIS TERM, HE SEEMS DETERMINED TO GO FOR THE CLUB RECORD. IN JUST HIS FIRST 100 DAYS DONALD TRUMP SPEND OVER A QUARTER OF THOSE DAYS WHILE IN OFFICE, A QUARTER OF THOSE DAYS WHILE IN OFFICE, GOLFING. WOULDN'T YOU LIKE A JOB LIKE THAT? WHERE YOU GET TO PLAY GOLF EVERY FOUR DAYS? PRETTY SWEET. THROUGH MARKET COLLAPSES, DONALD TRUMP IS OUT ON THE GOLF COURSE. THROUGH NATIONAL CRISES, DONALD TRUMP WAS OUT ON THE GOLF COURSE. ENJOYING THE GOLDEN AGE IN HIS GOLDEN GOLF CARS, PLAYING THE BACK NINE WHILE YOU STRUGGLE TO PAY YOUR RENT OR MORTGAGE. WHICH IS BAD IN AND OF ITSELF, THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS SPENDING SO MUCH TIME WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY CHALLENGES FACES AMERICAN FAMILIES, OUT ON THE GOLF COURSE, BUT THAT'S NOT THE WORST OF IT, BECAUSE GUESS WHO IS PAYING FOR ALL THAT GOLF -- YOU ARE! YOU ARE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE TAXPAYER. THAT'S RIGHT, ALL THOSE DRIVES AND CHIP SHOTS, ALL THOSE SLICES AND THOSE HOOKS, ALL THE MISSED PUTTS, YOU'RE PAYING FOR EVERY HOLE. THIS TERM, REPORTS SUGGEST HE'S SPENT WELL OVER $30 MILLION IN TAXPAYER FUNDS ON THESE GOLFING TRIMS. THAT'S YOUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AND IT'S NOT JUST THE USE OF THESE TAXPAYER FUNDS THAT'S A TRAVESTY, IT'SHAT THESE TAXPAYER DOLLARS GO TO BENEFIT HIM DIRECTLY, HIS GOLF COURSES, HIS HOTELS CHARGE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS AND OTHER WHITE HOUSE STAFF TO PLAY GOLF WITH HIM OR TO ACCOMPANY HIM ON HIS ROUNDS, TO RENT GOLF CARTS AND HAVE MEALS. YOUR TAX DOLLARS ARE GOING TO HIS HOMES DIRECTLY. AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED AND WEALTHY ENOUGH, MAR-A-LAGO MEMBERSHIPS WILL COST YOU A MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE, WHERE YOU ARE HOBNOB WITH THE PRESIDENT AND SEE IF YOU TOO CAN GET ANY SPECIAL DEALS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT DON'T SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY AT THE TRUMP GOLF COURSES BECAUSE THERE IS A MOVIE YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO WATCH. COMING IN AT NUMBER EIGHT OF THE TOP TEN DEALS OF THE TRUMP FAMILY IS ME LANA'S -- MELANIA'S NEW DOCUMENTARY. IT IS A, QUOTE, UNPRECEDENTED BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT FIRST LAID M MELAINA TRUMP. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. AMAZON IS GIVING $40 MILLION IN CASH TO HIS FAMILY, THE TRUMP FAMILY, TO LICENSE THIS DOCUMENTARY, DIRECT CASH INTO THE POCKETS OF THE TRUMP FAMILY. BUT APPARENTLY THEY'RE STILL LOOKING FOR MORE. MELANIA'S AGENT HAS BEEN TRYING TO SELL SPENCERSHIPS FOR THE FILM STARTING AT $10 MILLION TO PROMINENT CEO'S AND BILLIONAIRES AT THE INAUGURATION. IN RETURN, BUYERS WOULD GET THANKED AT THE END OF THE CREDITS AND BE INVITED TO THE PREMIERE. THEY ARE PITCHING A SHOW ABOUT DON JR.'S TIME OUTSIDE, A HUNTING SHOW. WHO WOULDN'T LIKE TO SEE IT. IT MIGHT BE LIKE SEEING DICK CHENEY GO HUNTING AGAIN. IF YOU AREN'T INTO GULF OR TV SHOWS OR BUYING TESLAS AT THE WHITE HOUSE, NUMBER SEVEN, WE HAVE THE TRUMP FAMILY'S NEW PRIVATE CLUB. AS PART OF THEIR CRUSADE TO REFILL THE SWAMP, THE TRUMP FAMILY IS OPENING A PRIVATE CLUB RIGHT HERE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. IT WILL BE CALLED THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. I WISH I WAS KIDDING. MUCH LIKE THE TRUMP HOTEL IN THE FIRST ADMINISTRATION, IT WILL SERVE AS A GATHERING PLACE FOR TRUMP WORLD AND A WAY TO DIRECTLY PAY HOMAGE TO HIM IN THE WAY OF CAVIAR AND CHECKS TO HIM AND HIS KIDS. FOR A COOL $500,000 MEMBERSHIP FEE, YOU CAN SCHMOOZE WITH PEOPLE IN THE ADMINISTRATION. THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH CLUB IS AN INVITE-ONLY CLUB FOR INSIDERS, INVESTORS AND BILLIONAIRES TO DIRECTLY LINE THE POCKETS OF THE FIRST FAMILY, SENDING A MESSAGE CLEAR AS DAY TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO DO BUSINESS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES IF YOU WANT TO BE WITH TRUMP, YOU'VE GOT TO PAY THE COVER CHARGE. AND NOW ENTERING IN AT NUMBER SIX OF THE TOP TEN DEALS OF DONALD TRUMP, OF HIS PRESIDENCY, A BRAND-NEW TRUMP HOTEL IN DUBAI. RIGHT NOW LITERALLY AT THIS MOMENT, DONALD TRUMP IS IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES. YOU CAN IMAGINE THE SCENE, STANDING IN A GOLD-PLATED RESUME, AND JUST BEYOND THE LINE OF SIGHT IN THE DISTANCE IS THE SKYLINE OF DUBAI THAT WILL LIKELY GET A NEW FEATURE, THE TRUMP INTERNATIONAL HOTEL TOWER DUBAI, AN 80-FLOOR BEHEM OTSDZ -- BEHEMOTH, IT WILL APARTMENTS THAT START AT $2 MILLION AND PENTHOUSES THAT WILL START AT TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. EVEN BETTER, IF YOU CAN'T MAKE THE TRUMP NEW CLUB HERE IN D.C., THERE WILL BE AN EXCLUSIVE MEMBERS ONLY CLUB IN DUBAI, SAID TO REDEFINE THE MEANING OF EXCLUSIVE LUXURY, ALL BENEFITING, THAT'S RIGHT, DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY. NOW THEIR VENTURES IN THE MIDDLE EAST DON'T START OR STOP IN DUBAI. NUMBER FIVE OF THE BEST DEALS OF THE TRUMP FAMILY OF HIS PRESIDENCY, THEY'RE CASHING IN THIS TIME IN QATAR. COMING SOON TO DOHA, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION GOLF COURSE. THIS IS AN 18-HOLE COURSE, A CLUBHOUSE, HIGH-END VILLAS WITH BEACH ACCESS. A $5.5 BILLION DEAL, BILLION WITH A B, SET TO NET THE TRUMP FAMILY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. A DEAL THAT'S REPORTEDLY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH QATARI D.R., A COMPANY OWNED BY IN THIS CASE THE QATARI GOVERNMENT ITSELF. NOW, I'M SURE QATAR'S MULTIBILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THE PERSONAL FINANCES OF THE TRUMP FAMILY IS ENTIRELY COINCIDENTAL. I AM SURE IT IS NOT INTENDED TO INFLUENCE U.S. POLICY TOWARDS THE COUNTRY WHICH ALSO HOSTS AL-JAZEERA IN ANY WAY. I KNOW IT'S EASY IN ALL THE TRUMP CORRUPTION AND SCHEMES TO MISS THE FOREST FOR THE TREES, BUT LET'S NOT FAIL TO APPRECIATE JUST HOW UNPRECEDENTED THIS IS, JUST HOW CORRUPT AND DANGEROUS THIS IS. THE PRESIDENT'S NAMESAKE COMPANY IS DIRECTLY IN BUSINESS WITH A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT AND THE MONEY IS GOING INTO HIS POCKET -- NOT THE TREASURY, NOT YOUR POCKET AS THE TAXPAYER, IT'S GOING INTO DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY'S POCKET, HIS. BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY GULF NATION IN BUSINESS WITH THE PRESIDENT AND HIS FAMILY. NOT BY A LONG STRETCH. THERE IS AS SAUDI ARABIA. BECAUSE ENTERING IN AT NUMBER FOUR IS THE NEWLY ANNOUNCED TRUMP TOWER IN JETTA AND THEIR TWO BRAND-NEW PROJECTS IN RIYADH. THESE WILL NET THE TRUMP FAMILY MILLIONS AS WELL, AND THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THE TRUMP FAMILY HAS CASHED IN WITH THE SAUDIS. MONTHS AFTER TRUMP LEFT THE OFFICE THE FIRST TIME JARED KUSHNER FIRM RECEIVED A $2 MILLION INVESTMENT FROM NONE OTHER THAN THE SAUDI CROWN PRINCE, IT WAS SO SHADY -- THEY WERE OVERRULED BY HIGHER UPS IN THE SAUDI ROYAL FAMILY AND THE MONEY WEPT STRAIGHT INTO THE TRUMP FAMILY'S ENTERPRISE, $2 BILLION. IT IS NOT JUST DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY CASHING IN AT YOUR EXPENSE. THE WORLD'S RICHEST MAN IS USING HIS ROLE TOO AS A SPECIAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE TO CASH IN AS WELL. BECAUSE EVEN WHEN YOU'RE THE WORLD'S RICHEST MAN, AS ELON MUSK IS, ENOUGH IS NEVER ENOUGH. ENTERING IN AT NUMBER THREE ARE ELON MUSK'S SHADY STARLINK DEALS. ELON MUSK WHEN HE'S NOT TWEETING OR FIRING ESSENTIAL GOVERNMENT WORKERS IS STURNING STAR -- IS IT TURNING STARLINK INTO A GLOBAL POWER. HOW? BY USING HIS PROXIMITY TO TRUMP TO HAVE A RAFT OF DEALS TO OTHER NATIONS TO PURCHASE STARLINK SATELLITE. REMEMBER LOSETTO, DONALD TRUMP SLAPPED TARIFFS ON THE COUNTRY, IN HOPES OF A TRADE DEAL, THEY CAME TO THE TABLE AND THAT MEANT COMING TO ELON MUSK'S TABLE. I WANT TO READ FROM A LEAKED INTERNAL STATE DEPARTMENT MEMO. QUOTE,INGAS THE GOVERNMENT OF LASOTHO NEGOTIATES A TRADE DEAL WITH THE UNITED STATES, IT HOPES THAT LICENSING STARLINK DEMONSTRATES GOOD WILL AND THE INTENT TO WELCOME U.S. BUSINESS. AS THE GOVERNMENT OF LASOTHO, IT HOPES THAT LICENSING STARLINK REPRESENTS GOODWILL AND AN ATTEMPT TO WELCOME U.S. BUSINESSES. THIS IS FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S OWN CABLE IN BLACK AND WHITE. IT'S JUST PLAY TO PAY TO GET OUT FROM UNDER THE TARIFFS THAT TRUMP IMPOSED ON LASOTHO, THEY WILL BUY ELON MUSK SATELLITE SYSTEM. PAY OFF THE TRUMP REGIME, YOU WILL GET A DEAL. ELON MUSK MET WITH MIRENDO BOTO. THE MEETING WAS PRIVATE BUT THE RESULTS WERE PUBLIC. SHORTLY AFTER THE MEETING, INDIA ANNOUNCED TWO STARLINK DISTRIBUTION DEALS, MILLIONS INTO MUSK'S POCKETS NEGOTIATED STEPS AWAY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. SINCE THEN -- SINCE THE IMPOSITION OF THESE TARIFFS, SINCE THE NEED OF OTHER COUNTRIES TO COME IN AND NEGOTIATE TARIFFS AWAY WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, ELON MUSK HAS REACHED DEALS WITH SOMALIA, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, BANGLADESH, PAKISTAN AND VIETNAM. AND THAT'S JUST WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT SO FAR. BUT I PROMISE YOU THIS WILL NOT BE THE END OF IT. IT'S AMONG THE MOST OBVIOUS, EGREGIOUS AND DANGEROUS ACTS OF CORRUPTION IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WANT OUT FROM UNDER A TARIFF, MAKE A DEAL WITH ELON MUSK AND STARLINK AND THEY'RE BARELY TRYING TO HIDE IT. WHICH BRINGS US TO NUMBER TWO OF THE TOMORROW TEN DEALS FOR DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT, AND IN THE TOP TEN DAYS, THE TOP TEN WAYS THAT THE AMERICAN ARE ENDING UP HOLDING THE BAG. BECAUSE QATAR ISN'T JUST INVESTING IN A NEW TRUMP TOWER AT HOME. THE QATARI GOVERNMENT IS ALSO GIFTING THE PRESIDENT A NEWS AIR FORCE ONE. AN AIRCRAFT SO OPULENT THAT THEY'RE CALLING IT A SKY PALACE, A PALACE IN THE SKY. A $400 MILLION GIFT FOR DONALD TRUMP THAT TAXPAYERS WILL HAVE TO PAY TO DEBUG. YOU CAN IMAGINE ALL THE NATIONAL SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF GETTING AN AIRPLANE WITH ALL OF ITS ELECTRONICS AND ALL OF THE VENUES THAT COULD BE HID EN, YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD COST TO DEBUG. IT WILL NEED TO BE UPGRADED TO MEET THE STANDARDS OF AN AIR FORCE ONE. IT WILL COST TAXPAYERS A FORTUNE. AND THEIR PLAN, THE QATARI PLAN IS TO GIVE THE PLANE TO THE PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY BEFORE DONALD TRUMP'S TERM ENDS. THAT WAY THE PRESIDENT CAN KEEP USING IT AS HE PLEASES. THAT WAY DONALD TRUMP, IN ADDITION TO HIS OWN PRIVATE PLANE, IN ADDITION TO AIR FORCE ONE, WHICH HE IS VERY UPSET WITH BECAUSE IT'S A FEW DECADES-OLD AND, YOU KNOW, IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE AMENITIES THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS COME TO EXPECT, HE GETS TO KEEP THIS PALACE IN THE SKY. WHILE AMERICAN AIRPORTS ARE IN CRISIS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS, SHORTAGES, MASS BLACKOUTS AND DELAYS, SURGING PRICES FOR YOU THE PASSENGER, THIS IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS FOCUSED ON. NOT BRINGING DOWN AIR FAIR FOR YOU, NOT DEALING WITH THE LUGGAGE FEES AND THE HIDDEN COSTS WHEN YOU BUY TICKETS, THAT'S NOT WHAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES CARES ABOUT, THIS IS WHAT HE CARES ABOUT, HE CARES ABOUT GETTING A $400 MILLION GIFT FROM QATARI, WHICH HE CALLS A NICE GESTURE. GIVING A NEW TERM TO NICE GESTURE. I THINK OF NICE GESTURE AS SOMEONE PICKING UP THE TAB AT CHIPOLTE, BUT FOR DONALD TRUMP IT IS A $400 MILLION PALACE IN THE SKY THAT HE GETS COULD KEEP -- GETS TO KEEP OR MAKE USE OF WHEN HE IS NO LONGER PRESIDENT. NO MATTER THAT IT SURPASSES EMOLUMENTS, BUT THE FACT IS THE QATARIS ARE NOT STUPID. THEY'RE GOING TO WANT SOMETHING FOR THAT $400 MILLION PLANE. THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH, THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A FREE $400 MILLION PLANE. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE QATARIS ARE GOING TO WANT IS FAVORABLE U.S. POLICIES TOWARDS QATAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THEY DIDN'T WANT SOMETHING FOR THAT PLANE, MAYBE THEY WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU OR SOMEBODY ELSE NOT NAMED TRUMP. THIS IS, IN FACT, WHY WE HAVE A CLAUSE IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT PROHIBITS GIFTS LIKE THIS BECAUSE WE WANT TO KNOW THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS ACTING ON OUR BEHALF, ON OUR COUNTRY'S BEHALF, ON OUR NATIONAL SECURITY BEHALF, NOT SOME FOREIGN INTEREST THAT GAVE THEM A $400 MILLION GIFT. IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE TRUMP WON'T RETURN THE FAVOR WHEN THE TIME COMES, WHEN THE QATARIS WANT SOMETHING THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE IN OUR NATIONAL INTEREST, IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE TRUL WON'T RETURN THE FAVOR WHEN THAT TIME COMES, AND I'VE GOT A 747 PALACE IN THE SKY THAT I'D LIKE TO SELL YOU. BUT THAT'S NOT THE MOST CORRUPT. COMING IN AT NUMBER ONE OF THE TOP TEN BEST DEALS FOR DONALD TRUMP AND THE WORST DEALS IS TRUMP'S CRYPTO SCHEME. YOU HEARD ABOUT THE MEME COIN. THIS IS THE LOGO OF THE MEME COIN. THE PRESIDENT'S MOST BRAZEN CASHING IN, HAS ALREADY MADE HIS FAMILY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BETWEEN ITS SOARING VALUES AND THE TRADING FEES. THIS MEME COIN HAS GONE UP AND DOWN IN VALUE, BUT THE THING IS, EVERY TIME IS GETS TRADED, EVERY TIME IT'S BOUGHT OR SOLD, THIS GUY GETS CUT. HE GETS THE FEES, ESTIMATED ALREADY AT THE VALUE OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IT'S LIKE POSTING HIS VENMO ACCOUNT ONLINE, INVITING PERSONAL MONETARY TRIBUTES FROM FOREIGN POWERS, FOREIGN INVESTORS OR ANYONE ELSE WHO IS WILLING TO PAY UP. YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE PRIVATE DINNER THAT THEY'RE OFFERING ASSOCIATED WITH THIS MEME COIN. THE TOP 220 MEME COIN OWNERS, MANY OF WHOM ARE IMPORTANT INVESTORS INVITED TO A PRIVATE DINNER WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. BUSINESSES ARE BUYING AND JOCKEYING TO BE ONE OF THE FAVORED FEW WHO ALSO GET A PRIVATE AUDIENCE WITH HIM IF THEY'RE WILLING TO BUY MILLIONS OF MEME COINS, NOT TO MENTION A PERSONAL TOUR OF THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT BEYOND THE MEME COINS AND THE DINNER PARTIES, THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE ALSO BREWING BEHIND THE SCENES. AS I SPEAK, ERIC TRUMP AND DON JR. ARE GETTING INTO THE ACTION, JETTING AROUND THE WORLD BUILDING THEIR OWN FINANCIAL EMPIRE IN THE CRYPTOBUSINESS SPACE. IN DEW BYE -- DUBOIS THEY ANNOUNCED THE JOINT VENTURE FIRM BACKED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF ABU DHABI THAT WOULD INVEST $2 BILLION USING TRUMP DIGITAL CURRENCY. NOW, I KNOW IT'S HARD TO KEEP ALL THESE BILLIONS APART. YOU'VE GOT THE $2 BILLION INVESTMENT IN JARED KUSHNER BY THE SAUDIS. YOU'VE GOT $5.5 BILLION INVESTMENT BY OTHER GULF NATIONS IN TRUMP PROPERTIES. YOU'VE GOT $2 BILLION HERE, $5.5 BILLION. ANOTHER $2 BILLION HERE AND PRETTY SOON YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SERIOUS MONEY FOR THE TRUMP FAMILY. THIS DEAL ALONE WILL GENERATE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF REVENUE AND FEES FOR THE TRUMP FAMILY. SO THAT'S THE ART OF THE DEAL WITH THIS PRESIDENT. TRUMP GETS RICH. YOU GET SCREWED. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. IT'S OBVIOUS TO ANYONE WHO LOOKS, BUT IT IS -- IT BEARS REPEATING. HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU. HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT MAKING YOUR LIFE BETTER. HE DOES NOT CARE THE PRICES ARE SOARING. OR THAT HOMEOWNERSHIP SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE. HE DOESN'T CARE IF YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN RENT OR GROCERIES, LET ALONE WHETHER YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT FAMILY ON A VACATION THAT YOU DREAMED OF. HE DOESN'T CARE IF THE HEALTH CARE YOU ARE HE LIE ON GETS CUT OR YOUR LOCAL SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICE CLOSES DOWN. HE DOESN'T CARE. IF IT HELPS PAY FOR HIS BILLIONAIRE TAX CUTS, IT'S ALL THE SAME TO HIM. HE DOES NOT CARE. TRUMP CARES ABOUT ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY. THE SAME THING HE CARED ABOUT WHEN HE WROTE THIS BOOK. AND THE SAME THING HE'S FOCUSED ON EVERY DAY OF THIS PRESIDENCY. DEALS TO MAKE HIMSELF RICHER, TO MAKE HIS FAMILY RICHER, TO MAKE HIS BILLIONAIRE FRIENDS RICHER, AND MY COLLEAGUES, HE IS SUCCEEDING. HE IS SUCCEEDING BEYOND HIS WILDEST IMAGINATION. HE WILL LIKELY MAKE MORE MONEY IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS THAN HE DID IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE UP TO THAT POINT. IN FACT, HE PROBABLY ALREADY HAS. WITH NEW GOLD PLATED SKYSCRAPERS AROUND THE WORLD AND A SUITE OF NEW GOLF COURSES TO MATCH, A FANCY IF YOU PLANE, A SPEEDY NEW TESLA WITH THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD IN THE PASSENGER SEAT, A CRYPTOEMPIRE AND PROJECTS AROUND THE WORLD THAT WILL KEEP THE GRAVY TRAIN GOING FOR GENERATIONS. AND NO MATTER WHAT WRECKAGE HE LEAVES BEHIND HERE, HE KNOWS THAT HE CAN HEAD OFF TO ONE OF THOSE GOLD-PLATED SKYSCRAPERS, LOOK DOWN ON THE REST OF US AND CHUCKLE AT HIS GOOD FORTUNE. THE ART OF THE DEAL INDEED. FOR DONALD TRUMP, NOT FOR YOU. I YIELD BACK." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="-I am back from a two-week break, and I am feeling excited to dive in and dissect the day's news. I have renewed zeal, you might even say a renewed zest for the job as well as a brand-new thesaurus... [ Laughter ] ...and I'm feeling exhilarated, vivacious, possibly even ebullient... [ Laughter ] ...at the prospect of once again synthesizing and contextualizing the day's top stories. Let's take a look at them. -President Trump reposting a far-right dark conspiracy that former President Biden was executed five years ago and is actually now a robotically engineered clone. -Musk accused, apparently, of using ketamine, psychedelic mushrooms, ecstasy, and they say he would travel with a box of 20 pills every day. -When Iowa voters asked Republican Senator Joni Ernst about Medicaid cuts that could lead to deaths, she replied, &quot;Well, we're all gonna die.&quot; -Sorry, I'm looking for a synonym for the words &quot;[bleep] me.&quot; Although, you know what? I think in this case, &quot;[bleep] me&quot; works just fine. For more on this, it's time for &quot;A Closer Look.&quot; ♪♪ You know, our politics are very divided right now, but I think we can all come together to give a big round of applause to a dedicated public servant who selflessly offered his talents and business acumen to the American people for no personal gain other than the flourishing of the great American experiment, and by all accounts, succeeded beyond his wildest dreams. And I'm just [bleep] with you. It's Elon Musk. -It's now official. Elon Musk is leaving his role as a special government employee in the Trump administration. -Musk fell far short of his DOGE goals after promising to cut up to $2 trillion in federal spending. He lowered expectations to only $150 billion in the current fiscal year. -I think they're only sending $9 billion in DOGE cuts to -- Which is nothing. It's a drop in the bucket. Which means pretty much his effort was a failure. -A legacy of disease, starvation, and death. -In the Oval Office today, President Trump's farewell to Elon Musk, what Elon Musk acknowledged today, Musk also explaining his black eye. -Man, it's wild that this guy arrived in Washington to cheers from conservatives, and now he's leaving with plummeting sales and a black eye. Although based on how he waved a chainsaw around like a nightclub lumberjack, I guess he should just be happy he still has all his limbs. By the way, Musk claims he got the black eye because he told his son to punch him in the face, and then his son did. I'm sorry. Why is this guy considered a genius? I mean, my boys love me, but all they're ever waiting for in regards to punching me in the face is an invitation. But Elon's former employer/subordinate, Donald Trump, was cool about it. -But I didn't -- I didn't really feel much at the time, and I guess it bruises up, but I was just horsing around with the kids. -I didn't notice it, actually. -Not...Not the compliment he thinks it is. [ As Trump ] &quot;I didn't notice it. I mean, you always look like [bleep]. Right, everyone? I mean, Elon always looks a little weird. Weird name, weird face. I mean, he looks like a Xerox of his own head shot. Noticing a black eye on this guy would be like noticing a dirt stain on a dumpster. Anyway, we're gonna miss you, Elon.&quot; So he's got a black eye and a record of failure. But, hey, at least he's not going home totally empty handed. -The former DOGE head and Tesla CEO held a joint press conference with President Trump in the Oval Office earlier today. Trump awarded Musk with a gold-colored key for his work with DOGE. -Classic Trump -- Musk endangers his businesses, exposes his personal life and becomes one of the most disliked public figures in America, and in return, Trump gives him a crappy prop from an escape room. [ As Trump ] &quot;It only works on one door, and that's the door that lets you the [bleep] out of here.&quot; In fact, Musk failed so miserably at his job and caused so much damage that he is now openly distancing himself from the Trump administration. -It's not like I agree with everything the administration does. So it's like there's -- I mean, I agree with much of what the administration does, but we have differences of opinion. Um, you know, there's things that I... I don't entirely agree with, um, but it's difficult for me to bring that up in an interview because then it creates a bone of contention. So then I'm a little stuck in a bind where I'm like, well, I don't want to, you know, speak out against the administration, but I don't want to... I also don't want to take responsibility for everything the administration is doing. -It's a real &quot;damned if you do, damned if you ask your son to punch you in the eye.&quot; Look, man, you shouldn't have become the Trump administration's new mascot. You were constantly there at the inauguration, at cabinet meetings, at press conferences. Saying you don't take responsibility for everything they're doing is like Gritty saying, &quot;Philadelphia fans are insane. I am a man of reason. [ Laughter ] If I am even a man. [ Laughter ] What is Gritty?&quot; [ Chuckles ] So what is Musk distancing himself from anyway? Well, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are rapidly dismantling American civil society and turning the country into a reclusive oligarchy in which consumer prices fluctuate with the whims of one man, the president openly enriches himself with [bleep] meme coins and invites bribes from foreign countries, colleges and universities are censored, families and migrants with no criminal record are kidnapped off the streets, members of the opposition party are arrested and harassed, and basic public services like food inspections and air travel safety and vaccine research grind to a halt while a secretive military contractor assembles a sprawling technological database to track American citizens, and massive amounts of wealth are redistributed from working class people to the top 1% through devastating cuts to health care and nutrition assistance programs. But I don't want to talk about any of that, and neither does the media. We both want to talk about something way more important. Joe Biden is and has been for a while very old. -House Republicans are escalating their pursuit of answers about then-President Biden's health and an alleged cover-up by those close to him. -We're going to try to get to the bottom of this because this is the biggest scandal in American history. -This is the biggest scandal I could ever imagine in our lives. There's never been anything like this. -This is a major scandal, in my view the biggest one in presidential history. -The biggest corruption in the history of the country. Bigger than Watergate. -I actually do believe this is a more egregious and longer-running scandal than Watergate. -I think it's about time the legacy media finally admits that was one of the greatest cover-ups and scandals that ever took place in American history. -This is the biggest scandal in American media history. -This is the biggest scandal that I remember in recent political history. -Then I hate to tell you this, you have a bad memory. Maybe...you should take a cognitive test. You can't remember a bigger political scandal? Oh, my God, does that mean Laura Ingraham is in... [echoing] cognitive decline? [ Thunder booms, witch cackles ] But in all seriousness, they're right. This is the biggest scandal in history. Bigger than Watergate, bigger than Iran-Contra, bigger than the Teapot Dome scandal. Yeah, I said it. [ Laughter ] Bigger than the Teapot Dome scandal. And if you don't remember the 1923 Teapot Dome scandal from your eighth grade history textbook, just do what I did and read the Google AI overview, which is never wrong. I typed in Teapot Dome scandal, and Google helpfully informed me that the Teapot Dome scandal occurred when the Superdome was accidentally constructed to resemble a teapot. It was actually really fun. In the fourth quarter of close games, they could just release steam. [ Steam hisses ] That's why they play the Sugar Bowl there. Of course, it's not even called the Sugar Bowl anymore. Now it's called the Credit Suisse Rocket Money [bleep] Dogecoin Bowl or Some [bleep]. [ Laughter ] Now you might be thinking to yourself, &quot;Wait, didn't everybody already know that Joe Biden was old? Didn't poll after poll show that the vast majority of Americans, including a clear majority of Democrats, thought he was too old to run for reelection and wanted someone else? Didn't he biff it so bad in the debate that his own party undertook an unprecedented effort to successfully force him out of the race? Weren't Democrats ultimately punished for Biden's disastrous choice to run again when they got their asses kicked in the November election? Didn't Seth play that clip of Biden falling up the stairs like a thousand times?&quot; This was on TV. Everyone saw it. If this was a cover-up, it was the worst [bleep] cover-up in American history. It was the worst-kept secret since Mika and Joe. We knew. We knew. Nobody has chemistry like that at 6:00 a.m. This was only like Watergate if the break-in had been live streamed on Twitch. But if you're asking those questions, you're wrong. It is a scandal because you don't know about all the secret information Republicans have. -Listen, I'll tell you something that I haven't said before, because it came from a Secret Service whistleblower this past year. This Secret Service whistleblower actually was assigned to Biden, and he told me that Biden used to get lost in his closet in the mornings in the White House. -I'm sorry, but you have a responsibility to immediately go public with whistleblower testimony when it is that hilarious. [ Laughter ] You've been sitting on Biden lost in his closet for a year? While the news has been relentlessly bad, you didn't think that might cheer us up? Just the fun of picturing him trying to make a plan once he realizes he doesn't know where the door is [ As Biden ] &quot;Ah, keep your cool, Joe. You've found your way out of stickier situations than this. Yeah, it could be worse. Yeah. It could be in a wardrobe. Next thing you know, you're in Narnia. Yeah, you meet a talking lion, you say 'Jesus Christ,' 'cause that's who the lion is supposed to be. I'm not kidding around.&quot; [ Laughter ] It was just a disastrous political choice, and the people who deserve the criticism for that are Biden and the aides who convinced him and themselves that he should ignore reality and run again. But it turns out that guy who got lost in the closet, that might not have been Joe Biden at all. It might have been an impostor. -President Trump spread an outlandish conspiracy theory over the weekend, claiming that former President Biden was executed back in 2020 and replaced with clones and robots. The president reposted the claim made by an obscure anonymous Truth Social user, boosting it to his 10 million followers. -If the Joe Biden from the debate was a robot, I imagine there was a guy backstage just smashing the buttons on his controller screaming, &quot;Did someone spill coffee on this?! I can't even get it to close its mouth!&quot; [ Laughter ] There's only one robot Joe Biden ever reminded me of, and it was that Honda robot that ate [bleep] on the stairs. [ Laughter ] But actually, if you think about it, this revelation is great news for Democrats. It turns out that wasn't Joe Biden who got stuck in a closet. It was a robot. And that happens to my Roomba all the time. But while we're on the subject of cognitive decline, I would just like to pose a brief hypothetical. Which of these symptoms do you think would be more concerning to a medical professional in assessing the mental acuity of an aging relative? It is insane that this is just a fact of our daily lives now. You wake up in the morning, check the president's social media feed, see that he thinks his predecessor is a robotically engineered clone, and then you just go about your day and the media will report on it like this. -President Trump spread an outlandish conspiracy theory. -No, an outlandish conspiracy theory is when your Aunt Jean has three wine coolers at the barbecue and tells you fluoride in the water makes the frogs gay. [ Laughter ] &quot;I heard that's what happened to Kermit. That's why he's so sassy now. But hey, that's none of my business.&quot; [ Laughter ] This is not just an outlandish conspiracy theory. This is the most powerful person in the world, being so unhinged and detached from reality that he not only thinks Joe Biden is a robot, but also that it's a cool thing to, you know, share with other people. But if all this bad news is getting you down, there's a bright side, you guys. I'll let Iowa's Republican Senator Joni Ernst explain. -This is Republican Senator Joni Ernst. On Friday, she had a town hall in which she was discussing Medicaid reform. There were concerns from the audience about SNAP benefit cuts and someone shouted out &quot;people will die.&quot; She replied, &quot;Well, we're all gonna die.&quot; -They are not eligible, so they will be coming off. So... People are not -- Well, we all are going to die, so... -Oh, my God, that's so reassuring. Did you get that from a Ziggy card? [ Laughter ] Democrats, by all means, do something about the party's old-age problems so we don't have to deal with the same issue in four years. But instead of spending your time arguing about the last guy, maybe do something about the incalculable damage the current guy is doing because even Republicans can't defend it. They're out there saying, if you don't like their ideas, it's okay because we're all going to die. Except for Trump, who doesn't say anything because he's either golfing, tweeting, or... -Lost in his closet. -This has been &quot;A Closer Look.&quot; ♪♪ [ Static ] ♪♪" />

المتحده دكتور ساكس احييك ا كلما نقول اننا اقتربنا من نهايه هذه الحرب كلما نقول ان المجتمع الدولي يجب ان يعني يظهر بقوه لايقاف حرب المجاعه وحرب الاباده الجماعيه من قبل الاحتلال على اهالي على قطاع غزه لا نجد شيء لا يوجد صد وتزداد اسرائيل ضراوه ما الذي يحدث هل لديك تفسير لهذا الامر اظن بان اسرائيل مستمره وبدعم الولايات المتحده الامريكيه مما يجعل من المستحيل على اسرائيل ان تتوقف اسرائيل لن تتوقف لم تتوقف الولايات المتحده الامريكيه او توقف الولايات المتحده الامريكيه لاسرائيل فاسرائيل تعتمد على الولايات المتحده الامريكيه في الدعم العسكري في الذخائر والتمويل وحتى اليوم الولايات المتحده الامريكيه لم تصلها الرساله التي وصلت للعالم كله تقريبا بان اسرائيل بقتلها وتدميرها في فلسطين هو امر غير مقبول من قبل او كل المعايير في القانون الدولي وايضا المعايير الاخلاقيه والولايات المتحده الامريكيه عليها ان توقف هذا ان لان اسرائيل ويؤسفني ان اقول بانها لن تتوقف ما لم تقم الولايات المتحده الامريكيه والدول ايضا المسؤوله في اوروبا ودول عربيه مثل المملكه العربيه السعوديه ودول الخليج الاخرى مصر والدول في منظمه التعاون الاسلامي كلها ينبغي ان تقول الولايات المتحده الامريكيه بان مثل هذا النوع من ال التدمير ينبغي ان يتوقف ولا وان لا يستمر ليوم واحد اذا ما قال الرئيس ترامب لل الحكومه الاسرائيليه باننا لا نسكن ان نسيطر عليكم لكننا ل ندعمكم فسيتوقف هذا على الفور متى ستاتي هذه اللحظه من وجهه نظرك ما اللحظه التي ستقول فيها امريكا او سيقول فيها ترامب لبنيامين نتنياهو كفى اود انا شخصيا ان اسمع هذه الرساله موجهه من العالم العربي الى الرئيس ترامب علنا ومن دون ايه استثناء او تاخير لا مزيد من الصفقات لا مزيد من المقايضات ولا مزيد من المنافع المتبادله حتى تتوقف الولايات المتحده الامريكيه عن دعمها وايضا من المذهل ان نقول نعم طيب سي بانه لهذه حتى هذه اللحظه الولايات المتحده الامريكيه تضغط على فرنسا والتي سوف تستضيف الاجتماع الاممي حول مشترك حول فلسطين وان تعترف في فلسطين الولايات المتحده الامريكيه ايضا تضغط على دول اخرى بهذا الشان وهذا امر غير مقبول بالكامل يعني لو لديك تفسير سيد لماذا الولايات المتحده الامريكيه هذه الدوله الكبيره عفوا للمقاطعه لماذا الولايات المتحده الامريكيه هذه الدوله الكبيره هذه الدوله التي تتحدث عن الاخلاق والقيم الى اخره طبعا انا اعلم ان هذا الكلام اصبح ماضيا لماذا تورط نفسها في حرب اباده جماعيه تزاع وتبث على الهواء مباشره بهذا الشكل وهذا لم يتغير سواء كان اسم الرئيس بايدن او اسم الرئيس ترامب يعني لماذا تدافع عن اسرائيل حتى وهي تقوم باباده جماعيه المتحده الامريكيه هي ا بين يدي اللوبي الصهيوني والذي يتكون من المس الحركه المسيحيه الصهيونيه في الولايات المتحده الامريكيه مع عشرات الملايين من الاعضاء وهنالك المكون اليهودي الصهيوني و وربما العنصر الاقوى هنا الصهاين المسيحيين في الولايات المتحده الامريكيه وانظروا الى المساع عادات التي قدمت الغزه في الايام القليله الماضيه هذه تقودها مؤسسه مسيحيه انجيليه و والتي هي من الواضح تقف الى الجانب الاسرائيلي وفي سلوكها المشين اذا هذا هو الضغوط اللوبياتي في الولايات المتحده الامريكيه وليست في الصالح الامريكي وليست وجهه نظر الشعب الامريكي وحتى حتى وجهه نظر حتى معظم الجاليه اليهوديه الامريكيه و والذين هم مشزون بما تقوم به اسرائيل فبالتالي المساله تتعلق بالتصدي لضغوطات ضغوطات اللوبيات وهذا يمكن القيام به بطريقتين نحن في الولايات المتحده الامريكيه علينا ان نقول لحكومتنا بانهم ينبغي عليهم ان يمثلوا صالح الشعب الامريكي والذي هو الى جانب النزاهه والقانون الدولي وليس الخراب الذي تمارسه اسرائيل وفي نفس الوقت باقي العالم العالم العربي والدول الاسلاميه ودول البريكس والاتحاد الافريقي وغيرها من التكتلات ان تقول الولايات المتحده الامريكيه باننا نعرف بانكم انتم الولايات المتحده الامريكيه من يمكن ارتكاب هذه الاعمال الوحشيه واسرائيل لن تتوقف لوحدها ونحن نرب الولايات المتحده الامريكيه هي من يمكن اسرائيل في الاستمرار بما تقوم به التقارير الصحفيه التي تحدثت على ان هناك خلاف لربما لم يظهر للسطح حتى الان بين ترامب ونتنياهو فيما يخص سواء موضوع حرب غزه التعامل مع الاداره السوريه الجديده التعامل مع الملف النووي الايراني وحتى الذهاب لي يعني التعاطي مع انصار الله الحوثيين في اليمن بعيدا عن اسرائيل هل هل هذا الكلام صحيح ومنطقي ام مبالغ لا يمكنني ان اقول لك ما هو صحيح وما هو غير صحيح لاننا في هذا العالم الذي نفتقد فيه المعلومات الصحيحه وهنالك كثير من المعلومات اي الغير دقيقه وايضا مع عدم مصداقيه من حكومه الولايات المتحده الامريكيه فبالتالي لا نسمع ايه امور واضحه لكن الوضع بحد ذاته واضح جدا فهنالك اباده جماعيه ترتكب والولايات المتحده الامريكيه متواطئه في هذه الاباده الجماعيه هذه هي الحقيقه الدامغه والولايات المتحده الامريكيه ينبغي عليها ان تامر بايقاف هذه والطريقه الوحيده من اجل حدوث هذا هو بان يقوم باقي العالم بان يقول الولايات المتحده الامريكيه باننا قد وصلنا الى نهايه هذه الطريق فلا هنالك مسار للسلام ولا هنالك تنميه اقتصاديه ولا فرصه لت علاقات طبيعيه الا اذا ما توقفت الولايات المتحده الامريكيه او وقفت الولايات المتحده الامريكيه تواطؤها في هذه المذبحه انا اؤمن بان هذه هي الطريقه الوحيده وان على باقي العالم ان يتخذ اجراءات عمليه في مقابل ان حتصل اسرائيل الى قناع هذه نهايه الطريق لانه بدون قانون دولي فاسرائيل تتصرف كدوله مارقه بالكامل ام طيب انا حتى يعني اغلق ملف الحرب الاسرائيليه على غزه لدي اخير فيها قبل ان انتقل لملفات اخرى اتمنى اجابه مختصره هل اسرائيل بهذا الدعم الامريكي اللام متناهي قاض على سحق القضيه الفلسطينيه على انهائها على تهجير الفلسطينيين وغلق الملف تماما ام لا اسرائيل تنوي القضاء على القضيه الفلسطينيه بشكل او باخر وبكل تاكيد هذه هي نيتها سواء من خلال القتل الجماعي او من خلال التطهير العرقي او من خلال القمع الكامل للمقاومه للحكم التمييز العنصري الاسرائيلي هذه الاليات الثلاثه التي لدى اسرائيل نحن في الولايات المتحده الامريكيه نمواجه ضغوطات كبيره بان نقوم بال الافصاح عن راينا بسبب هذه القوه للوبيات وحتى الطلاب الاجانب اما ان يسكتوا او سيتم ترحيلهم والجامعات تعاقب على ايضا ال التعبير عن الراي فبالتالي النيه والمقصد هو استخدام القوه والتلاعب السياسي حتى تقوم اسرائيل باستخدامها هؤلاء هاته الحلول احد هذه الحلول الثلاثه او مزيج بينهم ان تستمر بالقتل وان تستمر بالتهجير او وبكل بساطه تقوم باسكات جميع اصوات المعارضه بكل تاكيد لن يكون هنالك سلام بهذه الطريقه وهذا اقل شيء يمكن ان نقوله ولن يكون هنالك بكل تاكيد عداله ايضا بهذه الطريقه ولا حل للصراع بهذه الطريقه ولكن الولايات المتحده الامريكيه بيملاؤها الغطرصه وهنالك قوه كبيره في المتحده الامريكيه تظن بان هذا سوف ينجح والولايات المتحده الامريكيه ليس عليها ان تنحني امام اراده اي احد اخر وفي الواقع الضغوطات على الاعتراف بفلسطين بحد ذاتها ايضا هنا في هذا السياق غير مقبوله الحقيقه لكن هي على العكس 95% من تعداد سكان العالم يدعون الى وجود دوله فلسطينيه و ودوله تكون امنه و تحت اطار الامم الامم المتحده ومع ايضا امن متبادل في المنطقه نعم ابقى معي سيد جفري فقط دعني انوه للمشاهدين ان صحيفه اسرائيل هيوم تقول انه تم ايقاف مباراه في دوري كره السله الاسرائيلي جراء اطلاق صاروخ من اليمن نحو اسرائيل وهذه صور قبل قليل تظهر ايقاف مباراه لكره السله بعد اطلاق الصاروخ اليمني ا اصبحت الصواريخ اليمنيه تطلق بشكل يومي الان وكما ترون توقف الحياه في اسرائيل وتدخل الملايين الى المخابئ دعونا نتابع قليلا עכשיו [موسيقى] [موسيقى] عوده لضيفي مره اخرى سيد جفري سكس الخبير الاقتصادي والمحلل السياسيه ايضا سيد جفري دعني اذهب معك لنقطه متعلقه بتعاطي اداره ترامب مع سوريا الجديده سوريا تحت قياده الرئيس السوري احمد الشرع كيف تقيم هذا التعاطي؟ اظن بان هنالك امر واحد علينا ان نتذكره هو ان الولايات المتحده الامريكيه هي من قامت باسقاط نظام الاسد قاموا باسقاط حكومه الاسد والتي بدات بعمليات ل السي اي في بدات في العام 2011 ايام فتره اوباما عندما اعطى الاوامر لاسقاط بدء باسقاط حكومه السوريه فبالتالي هذا مشروع طويل الامد وليس مفاجئ بالكامل بان الوم المتحده الامريكيه تحاول انشاء علاقات مع الحكومه لانه في نهايه المطاف كانت الولايات المتحده الامريكيه هي من اسقطت الحكومه السوريه السابقه والان الولايات المتحده الامريكيه تحاول ان تتلاعب بالاوضاع حتى تدفع سوريا الى نوع من التطبيع العلاقات مع اسرائيل وحتى والمذبحه لا تزال مستمره في غزه وفي الضفه الغربيه لكن يعني انت تقول ان من اسقط بشار الاسد الامريكا والاداره الامريكيه لكن اسمح لي لولا المعارضه المسلحه الموجوده على الارض والسنوات والحروب التي خاضتها طيله 14 عاما او اقل قليلا مع نظام بشار الاسد لربما لم تكن الولايات المتحده الامريكيه تستطيع اسقاط نظام بشار الاسد هل هذا الطرح صحيح؟ لا حسنا ينبغي علينا ان ندرك بان الرئيس اوباما هو من اعطى الامر السي اي في العام 2011 من اجل ان تسقط حكومه سوريا وفي عام 2012 الامم المتحده حاولت ان تنشئ اتفاق سلام في سوريا من اجل منع استمرار سفك الدماء ولكن الولايات المتحده الامريكيه تامرت على مقاربه الامم المتحده فبالتالي الولايات المتحده الامريكيه بشكل اساسي قامت بتمويل هذه الحروب ولعديد من السنوات وبكل تاكيد حدثت الكثير من الامور كان هنالك اطراف اخرى شاركت من المنطقه والتي اججت هذا الصراع ولكن عشرات الالاف من القتلى ودمار كبير في سوريا حصل وبشكل كبير لان الولايات المتحده الامريكيه عملت على زعزعه استقرار سوريا من خلال عمليات لتغيير النظام كما تسمى كما سميت بمعنى بان رئيس الولايات المتحده الامريكيه اعطى امرا للسي اي من اجل ان تقوم باسقاط حكومه بشار الاسد هذه هي طبيعه الدور الامريكي في الشرق الاوسط ولظالما كان دورا مزعزعا لاستقرار الشرق الاوسط ولعقود من الزمان اسقطوا حكومه ايران في عام 1953 واسقطوا حكومه العراق واسقطوا حكومه سوريا وبكل تاكيد هذا ترك الشرق الاوسط في حاله مريعه لقد مر قرن من التلاعب من قبل بريطانيا وولايات المتحده الامريكيه فانا ظني بان الولايات المتحده الام انه ينبغي ان يقال الولايات المتحده الامريكيه لقد يكفي ما قامت به ويجب عليهم ان يتوقفوا عن تدمير الشعوب العربيه و بما في ذلك ما يجري من عبر الوحشي في غزه اظن بان هذه ينبغي ان نكون الرساله الواضحه الان مع قدوم ترامب الى الشرق الاوسط تم الترحيب به باحترام كبير وترحاب حار ولكنني امل بان العالم العربي قد قال بوضوح لرئيس الولايات المتحده الامريكي بان اجراءات الولايات المتحده الامريكيه قامت بخلق كارثه في الشرق الاوسط وينبغي عليها ان تتوقف لان الشرق الاوسط بمس الحاجه للسلام والتنميه والتنميه لا يمكن ان تتحقق الا اذا كان هنالك سلام والسلام لا يمكن ان يتحقق الا اذا كان هنالك دوله فلسطينيه ولهذا هذه مسؤوليه الان الولايات المتحده الامريكيه لانهاء عقود طالت من استخدامها للفيتو ضد دوله فلسطين لان العالم كله يريد هذا باستثناء طبعا الولايات المتحده الامريكيه والاسرائيل لقد ان الاوان لهذه الحرب لان تتوقف ولان تقوم الولايات المتحده الامريكيه وتلعب بدورها باتجاه السلام ام يعني اسمح لي ان اذهب بك الى الجانب الاقتصادي ويعني القرارات الاقتصاديه وخصوصا المتعلقه بمساله الجمارك التي قام باتخاذها الرئيس ترامب ثم توقف قف عنها قليلا بعد ذلك سببت الكثير من يعني الفوضى في العالم اجمع هل انتهت هذه الاشكاليه ومساله مثل هذه القرارات ام لا لا نعرف ل ان وجهه نظري الشخصيه لطالما كانت بان هذه الرسوم الجمروكيه من قبل ترامب هي غير قانونيه لان هنالك شخص واحد في الولايات المتحده [موسيقى] الامريكيه بنظامه الوحيد يمكنه ان يفرض مثل هذه الرسوم الجمريكيه هنالك محكمه في الولايات المتحده الامريكيه قالت ما قلته هو العديد من الاشهر بان هذا امر غير قانوني وغير قانوني لدونالد ترامب ان يقوم باعلان حاله الطوارئ ويفرض الرسوم الجمركيه لانه في نظامنا السياسي هذه هي مسؤوليه الكونغرس الامريكي ليست مسؤوليه الرئيس الولايات المتحده الامريكيه والمحكمه اوقفت هذا ومن ثم ذهبت الى الاستئناف ومحكمه الاستئناف لم تقم ب فرض ايه حكم المحكمه الدنيه ولكنها لم تعكس القرار او وتركت المساله مفتوحه فيما اذا كانت المحاكم سوف تدافع عن الدستور ام لا و هذا ما نحن نتعامل معه هذه الرسوم الجمريكيه اذا ليست في صالحه الولايات المتحده الامريكيه ونحن لسنا بصدد حاله حيث الولايات المتحده الامريكيه تقوم بفرض ارادتها وحدات الضرر في الخارج ولكنها تضر بنفسها هذه كما نسميها معركه خاسره خاسره حيث هنالك سياسه خاطئه مشاكل تواجهها الولايات المتحده الامريكيه وعبر تطبيق السياسات الخاطئه كل العالم او ازاء العالم سيخسرون هذه عباره عن سياسه طائشه خطيره ايضا تحظى بدعم سياسي قليل دعني اختم معك بسؤال اخير سيد جيفري متعلق بمنطقه الشرق الاوسط اتمنى طبعا تكون اجابه مختصره يعني اسرائيل تريد ببساطه شديده ان تتزعم المنطقه يكون لها اليد العليا على كل دول المنطقه خصوصا تركيا وايران ودول الخليج فضلا عن عن مصر هل هي قادره على ذلك هل نحن ذاهبون في ل صالح موازين قوى لصالح اسرائيل ام لا لا اسرائيل لا يمكنها ان تهيمن على المنطقه هي دوله صغيره في منطقه جغرافيه كبيره على اسرائيل ان تعقد السلام مع دول الجيران حتى تنجو على المدى البعيد والولايات المتحده الامريكيه في مرحله ما سوف تقول لاسرائيل بانه لقد اكتفينا لا يمكنكم ان تتابعوا ان تستمروا في هذه المذبحه نعم المفكر الامريكي البروفيسور جيفري ساكس استاذ الاقتصاد بجامعه كولومبيا الامريكيه شكرا جزيلا لك كنت معي عبر الانترنت من نيويورك Ok" />

soldiers directly they are zooming who's walking here and killed many people here uh two kids they are going out from the center to their homes here in the center and they were injured one of them even he lost his hand he's 15 years Good These five marters here they are from Balata Most of them they are from this this street even they were um a rocket They bombed by a rocket uh beside Balata camp Uh they of course they turned into pieces and after that the big bulldozer took them in pieces with with soil with the cement of the ground to take them to ambiguous place Now until now their their families they don't know where is their toms So one of them This one for example they removed his head from his body Uh they left his body part of his body uh from his legs and a little bit from the big aon part and his family buried his uh this part That's only what happened [Music] [Music] What was that [Music] [Music] well I'm a Jewish American Uh and many of my family a lot of my friends you know know what the situation is here and are active in trying to end the occupation Um but I think I need to speak more with my family Um and my synagogue that I grew up in the temple community that I grew up in that still stands with Israel through all this Um and need to share what is actually happening here and the humanity get started [Music] Yeah [Music] [Music] sorry [Music] for him [Music] [Music] Alhamdulillah He's happy that you made it safe I see She has that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] It's like sure that you you've already witnessed [Music] [Music] October [Music] [Music] seeing how Palestinians are forced to live um despite their right to be here despite their right by law despite their by international law by um all of the the rules of law that we know Um seeing how they're forced to live is overwhelming It's devastating I'm feeling um humbled grateful overwhelmed inspired welcomed angry frustrated [Music] happy to be here mad as hell at the US government using tax dollars to do what's done to the pal Palestinian people here But I'm glad I'm here We're glad you're here When I go home I will continue to meet with my representatives my senators in DC We have um a campaign called uh not another child not another hospital which we are doing with doctors against genocide Now I able to tell them what I heard and saw in Balato You know how 88% of the children have witnessed a parent beaten 55% have had a parent die at the hands of the idea How there are now 50 children in a classroom with one teacher How a whole generation is being deprived of a future at our hands Someone called uh the United States United States of Israel and I think that fits you know I have a duty now to change this to tell my representatives the truth to demand you know that they take responsibility I think one thing that I'm really excited about is hopefully continuing to uh communicate with them about the fact that people here are urgently asking us to continue displaying um our message that it's absolutely unacceptable that the United States continues to fund uh a genocide and a war Um and so I'm excited to go back and make that message even louder There's such unbelievable horrors that take place here Such unbelievable terror and violence and not just the physical violence but the everyday violence of not being able to take a particular road and not being able to go down a particular a particular street that the the that children don't know if they're going to make it through the day or the night Like you can't read about those things I I've I see that and I've met the the people and I've seen the horrors and just like looking at all these spaces where Palestinian villages have been destroyed and settlements built It's just it's it's just more horrible than anything I could have ever read or any of my Palestinian people that I have spoken to and told me about what happens here Seeing it for myself changes everything cuz I can't unsee what I've seen and I can't unknow what I now know [Music]" />

permanently remove 1 million Palestinians from Gaza and transfer them to Libya On Friday UN Human Rights Chief Vocar Turk said Israel's actions in Gaza are quote tantamount to ethnic cleansing Gaza's health ministry confirms Israel's killed at least 53,300 Palestinians in Gaza since October 2023 The death toll does not account for thousands of people believed dead including those trapped under the rubble nor those killed by the indirect effects of Israel's assault on Gaza In fact the number could be more than two times three times higher For more we're joined in Montreal by Muen Rabani Middle East analyst co-editor of Jud Jalia and a non-resident fellow at the Center for Conflict and Humanitarian Studies He's a contributor to the book Deluge Gaza and Israel from crisis to cataclysm Welcome back to Democracy Now Men Thanks so much for being with us um if you can respond to the situation right now the escalation of the attacks on Gaza Well the situation as anyone who's following the news can see is thoroughly apocalyptic Um there is not only an unprecedented siege but also an unprecedented intensification of Israel's genocidal military campaign in the Gaza Strip And judging um by the statements of Israel's most senior leaders it aims towards the complete occupation of the Gaza Strip and the destruction of everything that remains standing in the Gaza Strip and ultimately the mass for forcible expulsion of its entire population And the past few days have have been um particularly cataclysmic At the same time uh negotiations about a potential new agreement are ongoing and um this will be decided neither by Israel uh nor by the Palestinians but by the United States To the extent that Israel continues with this assault it means that it has a US green light for doing so uh to the extent that the situation changes that means that Israel has been instructed by Washington to change course Talk about Israel partially lifting the blockade What exactly does this mean after 11 months of a full blockade on medicine and aid 11 weeks at this stage it doesn't appear to mean very much according to reports um available this morning Um Israel is preparing to permit something on the order of 50 trucks to enter the Gaza Strip And we're talking about a population of between 1 and a half and 2 million people who have been deprived of any um uh goods entering from outside the territory since the very beginning of March So this is clearly um a drop in the bucket Uh I think the more important question is whether this is the beginning of a lifting of the siege under US and international pressure and just as importantly whether Israel and the US are going to move ahead with this hairbrain scheme that has already been denounced by the international aid community of setting up a aid mechanism whose purpose is to force the relocation of the Gaza Strip population to specified locations where they can um uh access limited humanitarian supplies under the watchful eye of US mercenaries acting on behalf of the Israeli military government Can you talk about the US plan that's been reported to move Palestinians to Libya yes it's interesting that this report has now been formally denied um by the US embassy in in Libya um uh I think as a precautionary measure given what happened to that embassy about a decade ago But we do know that um President Trump has repeatedly uh proposed an initiative whereby the entire Palestinian population of the Gaza Strip would be forcibly relocated outside the Gaza Strip Um it would be taken over and rebuilt presumably by US real estate developers um acting in coordination with Israel And there have been persistent reports that the US and Israel have been approaching a variety of countries both within the region and beyond to accept these uh forcibly displaced uh Palestinians And in respect of Libya um the reports are that the US has offered Libya to unfreeze billions of dollars in um Libyan funds that have been uh frozen in international financial institutions since the reign of uh Muhammad Gaddafi who was overthrown and killed over a decade ago If and only if Libya accepts um uh 1 million Palestinians on its territory this would increase the Libyan population by over 10% And it's effectively bri bribing Libya with its own money to participate in this war crime and crime against humanity But it seems to me exceptionally unlikely that Libya will even um seriously consider this proposal for one moment given um the impact it would have on on Libya's uh domestic uh politics which is very strongly pro Palestinian And I think the real issue here is not the extent to which this um initiative can actually be implemented but rather the legitimization it gives to Israel's determination repeatedly expressed to expel the Palestinian population of the Gaza Strip and further down the line from the West Bank as well On Friday President Trump actually said quote &quot;A lot of people are starving in Gaza under the Israeli blockade.&quot; He said the US wanted to help reduce the suffering What can the US do what can the world do you have up to a 100,000 people in the Netherlands protesting outside the H You have a number of Italian parliament members going to the Egyptian side of the Rafa border uh demanding that uh um the world stop arming Israel Can you talk about what the solutions are at this point well you had as you mentioned the 100,000 approximately protesters in the Netherlands um with reports of something in the range of half a million in London um uh the day before And there is um growing opposition and and disgust with Israel's engineered starvation policy and absolutely genocidal military campaign in the Gaza Strip And a number of European governments are now beginning to speak more loudly as well calling for example for a reconsideration of Israel's preferential trade privileges with the European Union But at this stage the decision really will be made not in London or Brussels or Berlin but in Washington because of the extraordinary leverage that the United States exercises over Israel And it will take no more than a phone call from Washington to the Israeli government to effect a complete reversal in Israeli policy within the space of a day Um that's really the only reason we're now seeing this limited very limited resumption of aid And with respect to the statements by um uh President Trump I think we also need to bear in mind we're dealing here with a quite erratic leader who can contradict himself in the space of a day or even an hour So what we really need to focus is not so much on what he says but what the United States does There are ongoing um negotiations for a new agreement and it's difficult to tell exactly what's happening there Of course they're being held um behind uh closed doors but we still need to find out the extent to which Washington is exercising genuine pressure if any on Israel to force it to um accept an agreement that will um uh res that will lift the siege lead to an exchange of captives and ultimately put an end to this genocidal war Uh let me ask you finally Drop Site News is reporting a senior Hamas official received assurances from President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff the US would force Israel to lift the Gaza blockade within two days after releasing the USIsraeli citizen um Edan Alexander Basam Naim a member of Hamas's political bureau said the Trump administration reneged on its promise saying they didn't violate the deal they threw it in the trash your response to the report and if do you think that's why they lifted Israel lifted it partially well these these reports may well form part of the background of today's developments that we've uh been discussing but at the time it was um you know Hamas said it was uh releasing this um Israeli soldier who's also a US uh citizen as a goodwill gesture on the eve of uh Trump's uh visit to the Middle East And the Americans also said they had offered nothing in exchange So um quite clear clearly there were no formal undertakings by the United States But I think it's entirely reasonable to suppose that there were informal assurances given and those once again ended up uh not not being worth um uh the paper they were or in this case were not written on Um but at the same time they could form part of the background of the developments that we're seeing now which is that negotiations seem to have been intensified I think it's very premature to conclude that they will succeed or result in a meaningful agreement but there's quite clearly more going on behind the scenes um than than we are directly aware of Muin Rabani I want to thank you for being with us Middle East analyst co-editor of Jadalia and a non-resident fellow at the Center for Conflict and Humanitarian Studies uh contributor to the book Deluge speaking to us from Montreal Canada Democracy Now is funded by viewers like you Please give

WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE DECISION FOR THEM TO BOW OUT OF THE RACE? &gt;&gt; IT'S A SECRET BALLOT, AND PARLIAMENTARIAN -- IT'S A DEEPER, REFLECTIVE MOMENT WHETHER THEY WANT TO STAND AS SPEAKER. IT'S A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY. WITH IT COMES THE RESPONSIBILITY TO UPHOLD THE INSTITUTION, TO BE THE VOICE OF THE COMMONS, OF THE PEOPLE, AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS A PRIORITY EVERY DAY. SO YOU KNOW, OUR CONSERVATIVE COLLEAGUES ARE GREAT PEOPLE. AND I'M SURE THEY HAD THEIR OWN REASONS TO TAKE THEIR NAME OFF THE BALLOT. &gt;&gt; WAS SOME OF IT MATH?

IT'S A SHORT SITTING FULL OF PAGEANTRY THIS WEEK, AND WORK NEXT WEEK, AND THEN, OF COURSE, THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE DEALING WITH INTERNATIONAL SUMMITRY. BUT HERE IS A COUNTRY IN CRISIS. DEFINED AS SUCH BY THE PRIME MINISTER. A COUNTRY THAT HAS TO DEAL WITH SOME VERY HEADY ISSUES OF HOW TO DEAL WITH THE DEFICIT, OF HOW WE DEAL WITH A PLAN FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH, A PLAN FOR TAXES. THE COUNTRY CAN'T AFFORD TO BE AT A STANDSTILL ANY LONGER. IT'S A VERY SHORT PARLIAMENT TO PREDICT HOW IT WILL PLAY OUT. MY HOPE AND WISH IS THAT WE CAN GET TO WORK FOR LONGER, TO ACTUALLY SEE THE BUDGET AND THE PLAN THAT THE NEW GOVERNMENT WOULD PROPOSE TO CANADIANS AND SEE IT NOW. SEE IT IN THIS SESSION. &gt;&gt; David: OKAY, THE PLAN -- WE'LL GET -- I MEAN, THERE'S THE SEVEN POINTS IN THE MANDATE LETTER. JUST A SINGLE MANDATE LETTER FOR ALL OF CABINET, AND WHILE IT'S LIMITED IN THE NUMBER OF POINTS, THEY'RE ALL PRETTY BROAD, RIGHT. YOU CAN FIT A LOT OF THINGS INTO THOSE. WHAT SORT OF SPECIFICS ARE YOU WATCHING FOR TOMORROW IN TERMS OF THE SPEECH FROM THE THRONE AND HOW QUICKLY THIS WILL MOVE WITH THE NEW CARNEY GOVERNMENT? &gt;&gt; LOOK, THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES THIS COUNTRY HAS TO DEAL WITH. WHETHER IT'S THINGS LIKE THE COST OF LIVING OR ACTUAL SOLUTIONS IN BUILDING HOMES FOR PEOPLE, ON UNLEASHING OUR ECONOMY AND OUR RESOURCES, ON CONFRONTING OUT-OF-CRIME, ON FIXING AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT HAS SEWN CHAOS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THESE ARE BIG HEADY ISSUES. BIG CHALLENGES. WE KNOW THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN INSPIRED BY A LOT OF THINGS THEY'VE SEEN FROM THE OPPOSITION, THE CONSERVATIVES, AND WE APPLAUD THEM FOR THAT AND CONSERVATIVES AND THE OPPOSITION HAD SAID DURING THE CAMPAIGN WE'RE READY TO WORK FOR 100 DAYS TO PASS THREE LAWS THAT ARE READILY DRAFTED AND READY TO GO. OUR PLATFORM IS DRAFTED AND READY TO GO. IT'S COSTED AND READY TO GO. IT'S A PLAN. WE WERE TOLD THERE WOULD BE A PLAN BY THIS GOVERNMENT. BUT IT'S NOT YET BEEN PRESENTED AND THEY SAID THEY NEED EXTRA TIME TO DO SO WHICH I THINK IS A BIT UNFORTUNATE. &gt;&gt; YOU THINK YOU COULD HAVE HAD A BUDGET READY TO GO BY NEXT MONTH? &gt;&gt; TWICE BEFORE IN ELECTIONS, AS YOU KNOW, I USED TO WORK WITH FORMER PRIME MINISTER HARPER, AND I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO GO THROUGH THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT AND HOW TO RELY ON THE EXCELLENT CIVIL SERVICE, AND THE FINANCE OFFICIALS OF WHICH Mr. CARNEY WAS ONCE PART OF. THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A TRANSITION PLAN, AND THINKING AROUND HOW TO MANAGE THE FINANCES OF THE COUNTRY. AND Mr. CARNEY HAD A COSTED BUDGET THAT HE HAD PRESENTED THROUGH HIS OWN LIBERAL PLATFORM. SO IN MY MIND, LET'S EXTEND PARLIAMENT, LET'S GET TO WORK AND LET'S GET TO WORK FOR THE PEOPLE OF CANADA ON THE PRIORITIES I JUST INTIMATED WOULD BE THE PRIORITIES OF ALL CANADIANS. THAT IS COST OF LIVING, HOUSING, FIXING THE BUDGET, GROWING THE ECONOMY, UNLEASHING TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF RESOURCE WEALTH SO THAT WHEN THE G7 OCCURS, THE PRIME MINISTER IS WELL EQUIPPED TO ACTUALLY GIVE THE WORLD WHAT IT HAS BEEN DEMANDING SO MUCH OF. &gt;&gt; David: Mr. HARPER, WHEN HE WAS ELECTED IN 2006, THE ELECTION WAS LATE JANUARY. SWORN IN FEBRUARY. AND THERE WASN'T A BUDGET UNTIL MAY, RIGHT. WHILE THIS IS A FOURTH LIBERAL MANDATE, AS YOU DESCRIBED IT, Mr. CARNEY IS A NEW PRIME MINISTER WITH A NEW PLAN. IS A SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER BUDGET TRULY OUT OF BOUNDS IF YOU CONSIDER THAT HE'S -- HERE WE ARE PLAIT MAY. &gt;&gt; WELL, LISTEN, Mr. CARNEY'S GOVERNMENT IS -- WAS WON BY THE SKIN OF HIS TEETH. IT WAS A BIG ELECTION IN MANY WAYS. WHERE BOTH PARTIES PERFORMED VERY ADMIRABLY. THE CONSERVATIVES BUILT A HUGE VOTING COALITION, A GENERATIONAL SHIFT FOR WHAT THE PARTY WOULD NOW REPRESENT THROUGH 8 MILLION VOTES, AND ONGOING, WHEN PRIMEMINISTER TRUDEAU WAS ELECTT WAS A NEW MANDATE, AND THAT IS NOT THE CASE, AND WHEN IT COMES TO AGENDA AND CONTINUITY, EVEN IF IT'S A CHANGE OF DIRECTION, WELL, THE PRIME MINISTER HAD ALREADY BEEN MAKING BIG DECISIONS ON TARIFFS, ON PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE AUSTRALIA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND FRANCE. HE SEEMED PRETTY CONFIDENT ABOUT BEING PRIME MINISTER PRIOR TO THE ELECTION. I WISH HE WOULD BE AS CONFIDENT TODAY IN PRESENTING A BUDGET THAT AS SOMEBODY WHO PRESENTED HIMSELF AS A STRONG FISCAL MANAGER SHOULD BE PREPARED TO DO. &gt;&gt; David: YEAH, LOOK, I KNOW YOU LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE 8 MILLION VOTES. THE CONSERVATIVES. IT WAS A GOOD ELECTION IN TERMS OF RAW DATA FOR THE CONSERVATIVES, RIGHT. YOU KNOW, A GAIN OF, WHAT, 25, 26 SEATS WITH THE TERRA NOVA REPLY. AWAY. AND 60 VOTES AWAY AND THEY ALSO HAD A GOOD RESULT AND YOU KNOW HE'S GOING TO GO AHEAD AT A PARTICULAR SPEED. WAB KINEW WAS HERE EARLIER AND HE SEEMS TO THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE DECISIONS ON THINGS LIKE THE MAJOR NATIONAL INTEREST PROJECTS MAYBE AS SOON AS NEXT WEEK. NOT THE FINAL DECISION WITH THE COSTING, BUT LET'S GO THERE, AND THE WESTERN PREMIER AND YOU'RE A WESTERN MP, AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT AN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR, AND ENERGY CORRIDOR TO GET TO ABACUS DATA. HUDSON BAY, IF THEY MOVE THINGS ON THAT FAST, DOES THAT SATISFY SOME OF THE CONCERNS YOU HAVE ABOUT THE LACK OF A BUDGET AND WHAT YOU PERCEIVE AS A LACK OF URGENCY. &gt;&gt; WE WANT PROGRESS ON THE RESOURCE POTENTIAL OF THE COUNTRY, AND THE POTENTIAL OF THE WEST, AND I THINK IT WOULD GO A LONG WAYS OF DEALING WITH A LOT OF THE PRESSURE AND RESENTMENT WE FEEL IN ALBERTA, AND GOOD FAITH DECISIONS. PIECEMEAL DECISIONS THAT ARE HALF BAKED WITHOUT DEALING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY LOCKED AWAY INVESTMENT FROM OUR COUNTRY RESOURCES, THAT HAVE PREVENTED FROM GETTING OUR RESOURCES TO TIDEWATER, AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT OIL AND GAS. I'M TALKING ABOUT MINERALS -- CRITICAL MINERALS, PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER ALLIED COUNTRIES AND ECONOMIES. THESE ARE ALL BIG DECISIONS THAT ARE BEST FIT AS PART OF A NATIONAL PLAN AS A NATIONAL BUDGET. WE PRESENTED THAT DURING THE ELECTION. WE HAVE A FULLY THOUGHTOUT PLAN HOW TO BUILD ECONOMIC CORRIDORS, AND SHOVEL-READY PROJECTS TO BUILD INVESTMENT IN THIS COUNTRY AND MULTIPLY IT TO GIVE CANADIANS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH. GAME-CHANGING IDEAS. AND SO IF YOU'RE STILL RESISTANT ON BLOCKING PIPELINES, IF YOU'RE STILL RESISTANT ON ALLOWING SHIPPING TO HAPPEN OFF OUR COAST, IF YOU'RE RESISTANT TO THE THINGS THAT WE HEAR MINISTER GUILBAULT AND OTHERS INDICATE THEY ARE HOLDING ON TO THE OLD POLICY, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. UNTIL WE SEE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO, WE'LL RESERVE JUDGMENT. &gt;&gt; David: THE QUICKEST WAY TO MAKE YOU HAPPY IS IMPLEMENT YOUR PLATFORM. I DON'T THINK IT WILL HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; IT WAS A GREAT PLATFORM. LISTEN TO MARK CARNEY, IT MIGHT HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; David: WELL, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE. THANK YO" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="this was the scene on Tuesday afternoon at the displacement area of El Moasi Rafa tens of thousands of starved Palestinians throng to the place where the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had set up food distribution points we were made to queue inside fence lanes 1 m wide and 20 to 30 m long each after an hour and a half my turn came and I was handed a box but people were hungry and jumped over the fence to get the food israeli soldiers fired shots in the air the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation or GHF was created with backing from the US and Israeli governments to replace traditional UN aid agencies israel accuses Hamas of stealing the aid from civilians and says the new distribution model is meant to prevent that but UN agencies are critical and have refused to work with the new organization we do not participate in this modality uh for for the reasons uh that we have u given um it is a distraction from what is actually needed recent imagery verified by Al Jazzer shows how Israel made sure that three of the four distribution centers were set up near Araf in southern Gaza and only one towards central Gaza but none in the north alazer has also obtained images showing the inhumane manner people were squeezed into tiny spaces while queuing for aid the motive behind the plan according to critics is to force people in northern Gaza to move south to obtain food but once south they may never be allowed to return to the north they say Israel is weaponizing hunger and using humanitarian aid to facilitate the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians the hunger streak in Gazms say they have no choice we found people gathering flour off the ground so we went to this place and found humanitarian aid being distributed the distributing entity did not ask for identification or anything they just asked for citizens to take the boxes it's been over 88 days since the crossings were closed and we are suffering from severe famine on Sunday the executive director of the controversial USIsraeli agency resigned saying the mission couldn't adhere to humanitarian principles but despite international opposition and the chaos it has already created on the ground there is no indication Israel is about to abandon its plan muhammad Val also zooms outside in central Gaza's largest hospital in Dala tar there's very little water or electricity in Gaza even if people were able to get supplies how does that affect how much they're able to use well Rob even when people here managed to get their hands on humanitarian supplies the lack of water and electricity in fact turn these supplies into limited use items if not completely unusable altogether uh let me just give you a sense of what that means here on the ground it's very impossible to cook any dry food uh in Gaza including lentils rice or uh even pasta without having uh water and if you had water you would need also electricity or fuel source which have been both completely cut off entirely from Gaza and people started recently to resort to completely burning scrap wood or plastic in order to make fire and this has been completely very dangerous and unsustainable so it's not just about bringing aid to the Gaza Strip but what might come next i mean here the uh numbers of atrox that were sent to the Gaza Strip over the course of the past week remain nowhere close enough to meet the very widescale uh starvation here in Gaza and basically the Israeli systematic military acts on the ground that include the uh destruction of civilian infrastructure all kinds of electricity networks in Gaza and the systematic ban of water flow to the territory also adding layers and layers of complications regarding how aid will be used in Gaza because families have run out of all cooking gas and recently they started to walk for long distance in order to get one meal per day and at the same time they started to rely on the sole disselination water plant in Gaza that currently is operating uh uh by the uh solar panels after the Israeli latest decision to cut off the soul electricity the line that is feeding the entire diesel ship plant there so Gaza is still in Gaza with a very soaring humanitarian crisis and families on the ground still navigating unthinkable circumstances in order to survive the next day tar not only are they facing a humanitarian crisis of course the Israeli attacks are continuing there have been more of them in the last 24 hours just talk us through what the latest attacks have been well Gaza is still a very active war zone and Israel is mobilizing more troops in order to operate in multiple fronts in Gaza and over the past 12 hours we have seen a cleur strikes that had concentrated on targeting residential houses one of the deadliest was in Asawi neighborhood when a multiplestory building was completely flattened nine civilians according to medical reports were killed and 15 others were reported injured civil defense members are reporting horrific tales of how they managed to recover casualties from underneath the ruffle there as the escalation is continuing elsewhere especially in Der Balah where we are as the Israeli military targeted another residential house is not too far from our broadcast point here as six Palestinians were killed in the strike and there were earlier more today from the courtyard of Al Axa Hospital Ahmed a very uh chaotic and even uh desperate scenes of families being completely and physically broken following the uh following the loss of their loved ones and they have been wondering about whether this world will come to an end but the severity of the military acts on the ground and the ongoing escalation give a clear indication that there is no end in sight for this ongoing war as the humanitarian toll continues to mount day in day out d thank you very much indeed d A Zoom there talking to us from Adair Albala make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from
