          <attvalue for="7" value="panic chaos a young girl tries desperately to shake her brother back to life an Israeli drone has just struck a busy street in Gaza City israel insists it only targets Hamas but so many it kills the civilians when grief is so raw how do you put it in words can I get rid of it may God take revenge on you this woman screams her child one of more than 54,000 victims of Israel's assault death is constant in Gaza but that doesn't make it any easier to bear for everyone here Israel is guilty of genocide but some direct their anger at Hamas too may God punish you this distraught man says of one Hamas leader i pray you are killed too back at the scene of the attack a man is collecting pieces of human flesh in a plastic bag all he can do to give the victims a dignified burial this part of Gaza City is crammed with families who've been forced to flee from elsewhere since breaking the ceasefire in March the Israeli military has displaced more than 600,000 Palestinians un data shows that 82% of the Gaza Strip is now a declared militarized zone or under evacuation orders the entire population is somehow meant to live in less than a fifth of the territory that's supposedly safer israeli officials have suggested their aim now is to push Gazans towards the south where three of the new Israeli backed aid distribution sites have been built this afternoon the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation resumed operations after multiple instances of desperate Palestinians being shot trying to reach their site today's distribution passed off peacefully but the scheme has been widely criticized by the UN major charities and those forced to scrabble for something anything to feed their families we almost died in there we almost died all this to get some food for our children this is all I could get a bit of flour a bit of lentils and two packs of pasta working alongside Israeli forces under this new aid distribution scheme a new armed militia led by an alleged former Gazen criminal Yasa Abu Shabbab has previously been accused of running a looting gang from inside Israeli military controlled territory now his men are openly working with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation he denies wrongdoing and insists he's helping his people today after a political rival accused the Israeli prime minister of arming Abu Shabbab Benjamin Netanyahu released this video admitting to supporting clans in Gaza to rival Hamas all the time Israel's bombing campaign continues targeted this morning a group of journalists in a hospital courtyard their colleagues reporting on their deaths as they mourn the Israeli army said it had killed a member of the militant group Islamic [Music] Jihad but the three victims were all known to have worked in the media prior to the war yet more families torn apart by suffering which shows no sign of ending well joining me now the former Israeli Prime Minister Ehood Almouth and first of all your reaction to this revelation that Benjamin Netanyahu has been supporting a rival militia to Hamas jihadist Israel hating and potentially arming them i don't know what to say in as long as this militia is uh helpful in distributing the uh needs of the population in an effective way in cooperation with the Israelis maybe this is a positive step but I I'm not familiar with the facts to be able to judge it from a distance again I think that it is incumbent upon Israel to make sure that all the humanitarian needs of the population are provided in an effective manner this is very important this is our moral obligation how to do it it's not simple and as you can see I mean in this chaos which is part of Gaza today and as long as the military operations continue it's probably very complic so if the this militia is helpful in providing the needs and actually effectively providing the needs then maybe this is one way of coping with this difficulty now you have argued that Benjamin Netanyahu should now face war crimes charges can you explain why well I'm here using a terminology that I didn't use but yes what I said and I keep on saying is that when a war is uh declared by a majority of Israelis is not a result of any national security interest of the state of Israel when it is obvious and is accepted widely that uh there is not a chance that as a result of these operations we will be able to save the lives of the hostages perhaps on the contrary we may risk them and we may lose them if in this process of a war which is not waged because of national interest but as people say because of the political interest of the prime minister we're losing soldiers we may lose the hostages and quite a few Palestinians not involved are killed this is a crime and now I don't know whether it falls within the legal definitions of a war crime whatever but it doesn't matter it has to stop right now we have to end the war we have to return all the hostages and we have to make the necessary arrangements together with Egypt and Jordan and America and the Emirates and others in order to establish a new government in Gaza that will take over from Hamas this is what we need to do instead of continuing an unnecessary war kama and Emanuel Macron have both said they are considering further sanctions against members of the Israeli government would you support that well you don't want me to give equivalence on something that I'm not familiar with i can say this if uh um Benvir and Smriidge these two outspoken extremist messianic uh fundamentalist uh supporters of terror ministers senior cabinet ministers in Israeli government will continue to be representatives of the spirit of this government that I will not be surprised if uh friendly countries and I consider President Mcron to be a friend of state of Israel i know him i know what he thinks i know that he is committed to the uh best interest of the state of Israel not of the government of Israel but if he will decide to take measures against the specific individuals because of what they say and what they do I will not be surprised ahood Alma thank you very much indeed for joining us well earlier today the Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson Orurin Marmstein offered an interview it was on the basis that our agreation of four minutes couldn't be edited more people have been killed today in Israeli air strikes the British prime minister has described what's going on in Gaza as appalling and intolerable and is considering further sanctions the French are also considering sanctions what's your response hi Christian it's good to be on the show first I want to share with you some of the sentiment in Israel it's a very emotional day in Israel two of our hostages were are back they are back in a military operation they are dead this is Gadi and Judy 73 years old and 70 year old those are two cup two people grandpa and grandmother went for a morning walk and they were slaughtered and I I will ask you about this but I'd be grateful if you question i will answer i will answer i just want to share with you something that I heard before coming to this show this is the last phone call of Judy crying calling the emergency in a line saying &quot;My husband is just been shot i've been shot my h my husband brain is spilled o over come and help me.&quot; Unfortunately no one helped her she was slaughtered gadi was slaughtered and 56 more hostages are still in the hell nightmare called Hamas we want to see them back and every day that passes by just makes it more urgent to have our hostages released yes but your response to the international condemnation of what you're doing is what we're trying to share the situation as is with international comm community and international organization and the the situation is the following unfortunately kamas is still a threat an immediate threat to the people of Israel we are not in a situation in which we cannot vouch that we won't have another October 7 and this is why this war is still going on so you carry on i mean you the former defense minister Avdor Lieberman has said that Israel has been supplying weapons to a jihadist rival militia uh operating in Gaza under areas of Israeli control how is that happening so first I think the one making those statements needs to be asked but it hasn't been denied by the prime minister's office i think what the prime minister office published is that Israel is doing everything possible to fight Hamas including arming other militia i don't think they had it in in their statement so I think this is the the word are you not denying it no I'm I'm saying that we are doing everything possible to fight this evil what kind of person killed a 70-year-old grandma in her morning walk what kind of person takes Ariel and Kir Bibbas two babies and kidnap him if you can explain this to me which kind of what kind of of cause justify taking babies as hostages I I would be astonished and it's the lesson of what has happened in bringing back these two bodies that armed conflict is the way to get the hostages back because many of the hostage families fear that more of those who are still alive will be killed if this war carries on i think first we should listen and respect the hostages families i would say almost in a sacred way they are going through living hell i can't imagine having my my daughter my my my mother in captivity in Kamas but the war carries on because we're very tight for time i can't imagine so we we should listen to them but on the same time we should also judge what what proved to be very effective it's the combination of military operation and diplomatic means and if you allow me I can explain about the diplomatic means i'm afraid our time is up uh so Orura Masne thank you very much thank you thank you" />

Although later he told one journalist he wasn't even thinking about the billionaire tycoon. Not even one bit. &#10;&#10;His former mentor Steve Bannon, never a Musk fan, even called for the South African born billionaire to be deported. For his part Mr. Musk has been strangely muted today reposting veiled insults.

          <attvalue for="7" value="it was the bromance of the century the improbable union of the world's richest man with the world's most powerful it's 24 karat gold and but all that glitters is not gold and yet no one could have predicted a breakup as fast as public and as ugly as this i'm very disappointed in Elon i've helped Elon a lot with our It was this public trashing of Musk in the White House yesterday that lit the fuse for the spectacular blow up to come elon and I had a great relationship uh I don't know if it will anymore i was surprised trump was furious that Musk had publicly criticized his big beautiful bill as an abomination that would bankrupt America but Musk was watching on in real time and hit back immediately without me Trump would have lost the election such ingratitude the president then hit back on his own social media platform elon was wearing thin i asked him to leave i took away his EV mandate that forced everyone to buy electric cars that nobody else wanted and he just went crazy and then came the threat the easiest way to save money is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts to which Musk quickly replied &quot;Go ahead make my day.&quot; The bromance is over the alliance between the world's richest man and the world's most powerful Donald Trump is imploding right now in real time before our very eyes the news networks could hardly believe Musk was only Donald J trump time to drop the really big bomb donald Trump is in the Epstein files that is the real reason they have not been made public it was a jaw-dropping allegation that Musk compounded by sharing video of Trump with the deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein musk provided no evidence for his allegation and there is none but the accusation was nonetheless stunning the Republicans on the Hill were quick to dismiss it it's just another accusation another shiny object there'll be another wreck on the interstate next week and are you not shocked by the allegations that he's in the Epstein files oh I don't give a give a about that he's accusing him though of being in the Epstein files it's more than a billionaire spat isn't it isn't this potentially dangerous for Donald Trump look I've heard you've heard some unbelievable things said on both sides uh if he accuses him on the Epstein what what do the facts say if it is we're going to see everything just like with John Kennedy murder you bring everything out for the Democrats the Shardan Freud was only too visible it was inevitable we knew this was going to happen this was like uh uh forecast that this would be something like the brick of a McBTH play you know it was all these people that are power hungry some uh fishing for power for influence i suppose it was in the stars everybody was predicting it uh when it first began you've got two gentlemen uh with uh gargantuan egos and both appearing to suffer from malignant narcissistic personality disorder and they basically converged around a common platform of plunder and pillage of the American people hasn't lasted very long this love i don't know that any of these things last very long there'll be probably something tomorrow that'll get people all upset too as the spat played out shares in Tesla plunged as investors feared a feud with Trump would inevitably hurt Musk's business empire and it might while Musk is hoping to derail the president's mega spending bill and is threatening to use his cash to hurt Republicans in next year's midterm elections it's all a far cry from this when the two men stood shoulderto-shoulder outside the White House showing off Musk's Teslas just three months ago now the car Trump bought in support of his first buddy a lonely symbol of their spectacular billionaire bust up so now what becomes of the brokenhearted their social media posts might look flippant but with such enormous wealth and power the feeds of Donald Trump and Elon Musk are really inconsequential or as one commentator put it &quot;I'm just so glad that one of these men has the nuclear codes and the other has all our personal data.&quot; So what consequences could there now be in Washington and indeed in Silicon Valley here's Kieran Woodley into space come here take over Elad he gave him and his campaign hundreds of millions to win the election he gave him a seat at the table he took a chainsaw to government waste he gave him a golden key in thanks but was this relationship now disintegrating like a SpaceX rocket always doomed to failure you have the president of the free world the richest guy on earth one of the smartest guys on Earth conflicts they're kind of predictable is aren't they elon Musk was never really a true MAGA follower a billionaire whose companies rely on global trade a close relationship with China and the electric vehicle revolution we will drill baby drill and all that goes against a tariffloving nationalist movement that is all about oil and gas that's why Steve Bannon one of Trump's longtime supporters has always accused Musk of being an opportunist they're not populist you know I tease Elon all the time if I get turning from a technofudist globalist to a populist nationalist we can make some progress here while the MAGA world rejoices what will happen to the other tech billionaires who lined up to attend the inauguration i'm sure if I we were in the boardrooms or in the private conversations with the tech lords today they are extremely nervous uh about this fight and beginning to understand that there are fundamental elements of the MAGA movement that are not in sympathy with what they with the future they imagine that nervousness will depend on whether Trump hurts Musk using the powers of the government to not just roll back electric vehicle subsidies but perhaps even cut other federal contracts with Musk SpaceX company all this coming at a time when Musk is already feeling the economic and political pressure he's taken a series of hits and defeats doge is a failure the Tesla brand has been deeply hurt both domestically and internationally by his fervid support for MAGA so I think it it's probably an accumulation of defeats that made him wake up one morning and say &quot;Wow I'm in a good deal of trouble.&quot; If the president holds the most cards can Mus direct his chainsaw at Trump and pose his own threat because he claims that his nearly $300 million in last year's election is the reason why the Republicans now control all three branches of government and with President Trump facing tricky midterm elections next year could a prolonged breakup lead to Musk causing Trump an electoral headache i can tell you that congressional Republicans are getting anxious about this elon Musk has a lot of money he spent nearly $300 million to help Trump get elected for a lot less he could be influential when it comes to congressional elections and some of these Republicans are wondering is Elon actually going to come and spend money against me if I vote for this bill and a million dollars in a tough congressional district goes a very long way musk did plow millions into a Wisconsin Supreme Court race early this year and he lost and that will give him pause everybody but both men know that if their bromance was a wild ride their breakup will have just as many twists and turns the Republican party and the American people are holding their breath ahead of the next move well the US political consultant Frank Lance joins me now from Oxford frank it's great to have you back on the program um why did this escalate so quickly and so publicly do you think because they're so well known these are two individuals that is known by everyone who's watching this show we've known that Elon Musk is brilliant as as one of your commentators said we know that Donald Trump is the most powerful person political person in the world and I don't know of any time since Franklin Rosen issues with some of the industrialists in 1933 1934 you have to go back almost 100 years for this situation to replicate itself and that was before social media that was before cable news so you've got the technology you've got the interest from the public you got so much money involved so much so much politics people are paying attention but in terms of the substance of their relationship I guess you could say a breakup was inevitable because you know Musk has his the biggest factory for Tesla's in China he didn't like the tariffs you know the MAGA crowd around Steve Bannon never liked Musk they thought he was too snooty and too rich was this an inevitable breakup given their conflicts of interest well I'll tell you inevitable for Steve Bannon to say that maybe Elon Musk should be deported it was not inevitable for uh for uh Musk to say that Donald Trump uh was with the Epstein crowd that these are the most vicious individuals that are involved in this and just as it grew to something so powerful and so meaningful the the relationship to come apart the bigger they are the harder they fall i've I've been using the analogy of this is uh King Kong versus Godzilla uh this reminds me of a of a football match in your country how dramatic it can be when the fans of both sides go to war against each other we're not done yet we've only just started this conflict okay okay well one of the things coming up is of course the vote in the US Senate on the big beautiful budget this is what they ostensibly fell out over is Musk in a position now having withdrawn his support from the president and his money no longer being activated against Trump critics is he in a position to torpedo this budget and what consequences would that have the well the consequence is that this is the seminal legislation the tax cuts the budget cuts how we're going to deal with Medicaid all the issues are put into this one piece of legislation and if Donald Trump fails to pass it that's his just justification for Republicans in the midterm election so this is number one on everyone's radar but number two is also how this impacts the elections in 2026 and the fact is when Elon Musk was funding the efforts against the Trump opponents it caused everyone to fold caused everyone to compromise because they did not want to be primary now it's wide open now anything can happen in 2026 i don't believe that Elon's break with Donald Trump will torpedo legislation i do believe that we're going to see a new level of independence among Republicans in the House and the Senate which may be a problem for Donald Trump but it's certainly going to have an impact on where we go from here so without the threat of Musk and his money some of these Republicans who are very unhappy about this budget and a few other things like tariffs might we discover that they have a spine uh actually I got to be candid with you and the answer is yes that's that is the question i know what they say in private i know how they actually feel and the pressure now is not going to be to cave the pressure is going to be if you haven't cut enough spending there'll be more members who will say I will vote no if they haven't cut taxes far enough more members saying I will vote no this could not come at a worse time for President Trump but in the end in the end this is there's an issue here over the relationship between business and politics i think it was an unholy relationship if it wasn't good for democracy it wasn't good for economic freedom what we need is more people involved more more issues more legislation i think this is absolutely essential for the future of the country so I don't necessarily think this is a bad thing okay frank Lance thank you very much indeed well Matthew Bart is a Republican strategist and former State Department appointee for Trump's first term in office he joins me now from Washington matthew thanks for coming on the program i mean there was this extraordinary coalition wasn't there all the way from Steve Bannon and the mega mega crowd to Elon Musk you know a South African-born billionaire who came to America on a student visa you know who who believed the tariffs were nonsense whose biggest factories in China etc etc is that coalition now kaput I'm not sure if it's kaput but there is a massive fracture in it right now Matt you're correct Donald Trump came to power in 2016 uh largely on a white workingclass vote he then returned to power in 2024 with that same base expanded into vast minority groups and workingclass uh parts of the population combined with this high techch uh bro led in part by Elon Musk that is now all uh torn aunder as the personal relationship between the president and his friend his advisor his donor um his employee um is now cracked wide open uh for all to And I think it's worth reflecting on the fact that this wasn't just you know his best friend at some stage i mean there was little X the kid running around in the Oval Office as if it was a play pen in IKEA you know they were always on the plane the mother was there they were they practically moved into the White House do you think there was genuine love there because I think at Trump at one stage said &quot;I've never loved a man as much as I've loved this guy.&quot; Or maybe it was Musk or both yeah i listen I you know who's to say but it appears as if there was genuine affection between the two um acceptance maybe both as outsiders both as those who maybe think different um uh to quote the old Steve Jobs commercial um yeah he had Christmas dinners um and then a political symbiotic relationship um that seem to go hand in hand um now you're seeing you know what were bumps in the roads are now just tectonic shifts uh tectonic uh plates shifting uh under the ground beneath of both men right Now um it is unclear if this can be repaired though both are notoriously um able to turn on a dime but as it stands now it is personal it is ugly um and it is for the world to watch and is it going to get worse uh it certainly could um you know we will see how uh President Trump has has has actually chosen a a posture of non of trying to deescalate the situation uh not incur more of Elon's wrath it seems as if right now Elon is kind of sat on the sidelines maybe even taking some advice to cool off for a moment um but there are ideological differences around the legislation around potential subsidies there are uh ego differences between the two men and there are also some financial differences uh both in terms of again Tesla's bottom line um what Trump uh as well as you know a suite of government services from Starlink um uh to to to uh to to SpaceX um so this is a complicated situation it may appear entertaining um but there's some very serious uh consequences ramifications from Capitol Hill to the campaign trail i could never really work out speaking to Republicans you know in America during the election campaign whether they really liked Elon Musk and I just wonder what you think and what the polling says and also I mean a lot of the cabinet members who were sitting there you know rather kind of meymouthed as Elon Musk was standing up and holding forth they must be delighted to see the back of him very possibly um listen Elon Musk is one of the greatest minds not just of our generation maybe of history an engineer who has brought the future to the now has been wildly successful um in terms of the private sector and then his approach to government um while maybe amiable um and and and initially welcomed um was disastrous um and the damage he did to institutions to even the world's poorest people is beyond shameful um and we are $36 trillion in debt minus the Doge cuts we remain $36 trillion in debt so as successful as he has been in the private sector is equally as disastrous as he's been in government like you said there are many cabinet officials that buted heads heads with him and are probably glad to see him" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="the talk of a ceasefire in Gaza is it real or just political theater if it's the latter why do news organizations keep falling for it we get the Hamas perspective on the negotiations the pitfalls and the patterns ukraine Russia drone strikes on both sides of the border and peace talks there that have gone nowhere plus the logging off club young people checking out of social media for their own good it is a recurring pattern in the ceasefire negotiations the ones aimed at ending the carnage Israel continues to inflict on Palestinians in Gaza proposals surface hopes rise then the talks collapse and the responsibility for that along with the eyes of international news outlets all land in the same place on Hamas israel agreed Hamas rejected it is a framing that is so familiar it rarely gets questioned but behind that characterization lies a deeper imbalance and it goes beyond military power it's about the narrative one that casts the Palestinian side as irrational obstructive inherently violent while somehow portraying Israel even at its most brutal its most genocidal as credible reporting the story that way has a suffocating effect on what news consumers are looking for the truth and it happens over and over again international news organizations should have it figured out by now but it's not as though they're being played by Israeli propaganda it's more like they're playing along when ceasefire talks fail as they did in the latest round of negotiations involving Israel Hamas and the United States the question that news consumers want answered is a basic one why and there is a journalistic urge to assign blame point fingers hamas has rejected a US proposed ceasefire deal for the Middle East conflict now it's Hamas uh that has uh issues uh with the plan uh when examining the headlines coming out of the international media the sound bites produced in various news studios the answer couldn't be simpler there's multiple articles and headlines that speak of how Hamas failed in the negotiating table where Hamas's position and the Palestinian position more broadly is discarded and Israel's position is basically advanced and trying to always blame the victims blame the Palestinians for their own undoing this is this is a a a trajectory of a policy that has been uh going on since the outset of the war and continues on all major news media in the west specifically when in fact by Israel's own admission by the Israeli media's own admission it's Israel that has often torpedoed a lot of these processes to obstruct even coming close to something of a ceasefire agreement israeli media had themselves disclosed that is that Netanyahui himself had torpedoed nine different attempts where Hamas were asking for something as basic as handing all hostages over in exchange for just preventing a ground invasion but it has been very convenient for both the US and Israel to blame the resistance when things have gone wrong when Israel has tried to torpedo any process of serious talks hamas had image problems internationally long before October 7th 20123 often framed as a barbaric terrorist organization the resistance movement reinforced that reputation through the brutality of its attacks on Israeli civilians that day and Hamas's strategy of capturing those atrocities on video for the world to see that imagery also had an eradicating effect on the context of the larger story in Gaza decade after decade of Israel's illegal occupation more monstrous and often misleading labels were then attached to Hamas terms that are seldom applied to Israel and the genocide it is inflicting on Gaza war crimes on a scale that dwarfs what Hamas did on October 7th it is a moral disparity a colonial mentality that taints the international news coverage of the ceasefire negotiations including the most recent talks where the third party at the table was Israel's closest and most important ally the US in this latest round I think the fingerpointing was mostly on Hamas largely because of the spokespeople that we heard speaking to it steve Wickoff the main negotiator from the US who essentially framed it that way saying Israel agreed to this hamas said no and changed the terms it is true that Hamas said no to the deal because it was a deal that made more on Israel's terms than through a process that would lead to an end of the war hamas's demands within um these ceasefire agreements are not outside the remmits of international law the full withdrawal of Israeli forces allowing for the uninhibited entry of of aid into Gaza and a permanent sessation of hostilities yet for some reason Western media insists on presenting these as unreasonable illegitimate demands how this narrative has been able to persist as long as it has is completely unfathomable as a spokesperson for Hamas Basam Naim has appeared on multiple media outlets albeit less often than Israeli spokespeople do naim has been privy to the ceasefire negotiations including the latest round of talks involving the Trump administration and Steve Witoff although Hamas's side of the story is usually given less credence and less airtime than the Israeli version it is one that news consumers could use considerably more of especially those who depend on American and international media platforms to understand what is happening in Gaza witkoff certainly contributed to reinforcing this negative portrayal we spoke to him in the last round of these negotiations and agreed on a plan to end this war he said our talks were positive and constructive but when he spoke to the Israeli side he came back with another proposal saying it was the only one available so this is the second time or even third that Witoff agrees with us on something and then makes a U-turn this prejudice towards Hames and the Palestinians is reflected in the American and international media because his voice carries weight within Gaza Hamas has been out to control the narrative it has suppressed journalists at times and even abducted some the movement was voted into office in 2006 and polls taken since the October 7th attacks have persistently shown that only 20 to 30% of the population supports Hamas censorship is common however during times of war and Gaza is no exception so Palestinians expressing dissent and those reporting on it don't have it easy many people in Gaza are very reluctant to openly speak out against Hamas many said that October 7th whatever anyone thinks about a right to resistance that Hamas had not prepared the population for it they had no plan for how the population was going to be impacted but there's also a lot of musling within Gaza by Hamas of journalists critiquing Hamas for those who are outside there's an idea that uh criticizing Hamas is somehow counter to being in solidarity with Palestinians many people off the record will be very critical but are very hesitant to be on the record as criticizing uh Hamas at least while the war is still ongoing there's no free flow of information necessarily hamas did crack down on some of the journalists and pressured them sometimes through imprisonment these oppressions that happen against journalists which are a problem in their own right are overblown to actually legitimize the daily violence and massacres that are happening in the Gaza Strip we should not overblow these violations as a as a means to completely discredit Hamas or exclude it from the political space uh more broadly Hamas is far from the biggest threat to journalism in the Gaza Strip unlike the Israelis it has not banned the international media from entering the war zone to bear witness document a genocide nor has it targeted journalists the way Israeli forces have killing more than 200 of them one would think that the casualty figures alone the slaughtering of so many reporters would generate more empathy among Western journalists and the news outlets that provide their paychecks the fact that it doesn't is a story in itself another measure of what Palestinians in Gaza are up against there is an enormous global media machine that's run by the Americans and the Zionists they pump out large amounts of media material to lie distort and fabricate we keep trying to present our position but journalists don't really engage and even if they do our statements will be at the bottom of their report the mainstream media is not impartial on the contrary it's been directly involved in this war and the negotiations in favor of the Israeli enemy and since the beginning of the war the mainstream media have adopted the Israeli narrative even though it was false hamas is not under represented hamas is over represented but as a profane barbaric actor that is irrational completely out of the realm of human possibility this is the dominant representation of Hamas this goes to tell us that this mainstream western media is is completely complicit in the ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip backing the government's policies in their countries in the UK in the US in Canada and other places of complete backing and political cover for Israel as it conducts in the war therefore the media is basically reframing what is happening in negotiations in a way that serves the continuation of American UK European policy of diplomatic cover and of course of material support for this genocide that is going on in the Gaza Strip moving further east now where negotiations to end the war between Russia and Ukraine have also come up short an audacious Ukrainian drone attack on multiple Russian airfields has revived the spectre of a possible nuclear confrontation tarak Nafa has been tracking the messaging around this story as a second round of direct peace talks between Moscow and Kiev ended this week without a major breakthrough Ukraine's security service posted and heavily publicized footage of a huge drone attack on its neighbor called Operation Spiderweb the coordinated drone strikes took place deep inside Russian territory reportedly damaging or destroying more than 40 military aircraft including bombers capable of dropping nuclear weapons that provided Ukrainian officials with a shot in the arm for their war narrative domestically and globally news outlets in the country have been running wall-to-wall coverage of what they called an historic operation ai generated videos paying tribute to the head of Ukraine's security services Vasel Maluk have since gone viral he's being hailed as a national hero operation Spiderweb has also boosted President Vladimir Zilinsk's image in international news outlets which had taken a serious beating as his popularity in Ukraine has tanked over in Russia the muted media coverage of the drone attacks tells a story of its own initial reporting featured short official statements from regional officials who failed to explain how Ukraine was able to pull off such an extensive attack since then the story has vanished from Russian news broadcasts president Vladimir Putin hasn't directly addressed the drone strikes but did accuse Ukraine of terrorist acts putin made no mention of Russia's own drone attacks on Ukraine the largest of which took place last month including on civilian areas thanks TK there is a trend emerging in mobile phone and social media use it's about logging off the need to be offline and it's gaining popularity particularly among younger millennials and Gen Z after decades of increased connectivity and screen time more and more young people now acknowledge how harmful that can be social media platforms plead not guilty they argue they have safety measures built into their systems like content monitoring and screen time limiters some governments have even proposed restrictions on young people signing up to social media however to combat loneliness mental health pressures and what seems to be an inability to function IRL in real life a less top-down more community-based movement has sprung up people who meet put away their devices and commit to living offline even if it's just for a bit the listening posts Ryan Kohl's now on why so many young people are logging on to the logging off club gen Z has a problem their families know it their co-workers know it most of all they know it i'm sorry to have to tell you this but we think you might have brain rot when you're saying my brain is cooked it's cooking the touch grass challenge go outside and touch some grass like I'm doing right now go go go stop doom scrolling if you have an issue with doom scrolling listen up for a generation that was born into an internet enabled mobile phone connected world screen addiction is a serious problem tackling it has required reintegrating into the society that exists in real life and that's where the clubs come in so at Logging Off Club we host our events around three main themes connection curiosity and wellness those are three things that we lose out in today's digital age and on social media we've collaborated with a walking club a crochet club and then essentially we just bring people together ask them to leave their phones in a bucket with us and just get talking to each other and get involved in the activities usually people feel lighter when they hand out the phone as if some sort of responsibility or obligation was put away and I think that comes from that sense of hyperconivity but of course there's other people that have a more difficult time and might experience some anxiety at first so this is why we provide some gentle guidance and usually through time they all reach that joy of being offline we felt like we were living our lives on super speed never really taking the time to stand still reflect and be off of our phones and actually be present with ourselves but also with the people around us we always say we want to become the third space for people to come relax and also translate it into different ways of enjoying being offline a third space is an environment in which people meet each other in person they can be churches they could be cafes they could be shopping centers gyms swimming pools libraries is a big one as well one of the things that younger generations have probably recognized is that these spaces are less accessible sometimes they've been shut down sometimes uh they don't operate in ways that are necessarily conducive for social interaction and as a result the attempt to start third space adjacent groups logging off clubs running clubs and dinner clubs but the whole point is that they're trying to kind of create social experiences that older generations may have taken for granted around the world screen time is skyrocketing modern urban life is packed full of screens but the The most addictive one fits right in the palm of your hand the bright display the notifications your email messaging apps and fitness trackers all in one device and most alluringly the possibilities of endless scrolling on social media phone addiction affects people of all generations but it's a particular scourge for Gen Z it is eroded attention spans anxiety over body image has spiraled and loneliness has become something of an epidemic it's paradoxical because the social media platforms that a majority of experts blame for Gen Z's isolation make big claims of creating social connection while most other tech companies focus on how people interact with technology we focus on building technology so people can interact with each other snapchat was built to enhance relationships between friends family and the world without Tik Tok I personally would lose that sense of community that I found within the app increasingly governments are responding to this crisis starting in December this year Australia will be implementing a ban on social media for children under the age of 16 many other countries have similar legislation under consideration governments need to recognize that social media addiction and technology addiction is a real phenomena and they should treat it more like a public health issue they need to also recognize that social media platforms and technology interact with every aspect of our society they are utilities and in the same way that governments regulate water electricity other types of utilities we use dayto-day these types of social technologies should be considered to be regulated in a similar way i definitely understand where the policy of regulating the use of social media comes from however it is rather a more sustainable approach where we educate people and provide them with tools to become more aware of what they need the technology for and have alternatives to scrolling by having offline habits reading a book and and experiencing the the benefits of that legislation like social media bans is definitely more of a reactive and band-aid solution to a bigger systemic problem that we have i mean I totally understand why governments and parents might feel like that is the solution to the immediate risk of many of the harms that we face online but what would actually be impactful is banning addictive algorithms because that is the problem here and that is why so many of us experience these types of harms while some governments grapple with the impact of phone addiction on young people older generations especially those with money aren't waiting around don't you want to take a break from emails notifications noise in the past few years a market has opened up for luxury getaways retreats to green resorts where people can put away their phones and immerse themselves in a wellness routine at Unplugged we help busy city folk like you get away from your devices so that you can recharge our off-grid cabins are nestled in nature i think it's important that when we talk about digital detoxing we recognize that there is a class divide and on one side there are very rich people CEOs or company executives who can afford to spend thousands and thousands of dollars going on these retreats and outsourcing their digital activity to people so that they can have um device free experiences but on the other side the people who often work for them are zero hour contract workers or gig economy workers for whom being online determines whether they get to eat that night or not i think it's definitely a privilege to to be able to log off and be offline uh especially because our lives are built around technology these days if you're working with a laptop or studying online course you do need to log in every day you cannot just put the laptop or phone away and live off grit and same if you're living away from your loved ones it is your only way to to keep connected to them so this is why they they call it the luxury like being offline is the new luxury because most of us I would say cannot really afford that tech companies can see there's a problem the lucrative young users they're all chasing want to live at least some part of their lives offline everyone has that one annoying app that they're most addicted to you know that one i hate these notifications how do you monetize someone's need to get away from you you say you are part of the solution but great technology should improve life not distract from it we came up with a range of ideas to help people find a balance that's right for them i do think that there is this irony in tech companies trying to use technology to solve the problems that they themselves have caused and so with these apps that are designed to reduce the amount of time that people spend on social media it doesn't solve the underlying problem what it says is that there are bad apps and there are good apps and if you subscribe to the good app then we can give you a better online experience rather than tackling the underlying problem which is that a user is spending too much time on their phones and not enough time in their social lives and it's really interesting to see now that AI is being sold to us as the solution to that very loneliness that has come as a result of this type of technology we're building this meta AI um it's our we call it personal AI that should like get to know you and like what you think is funny and like what you ate right so that way you know it can like or you know what your hobbies are so that way it can kind of relate to you there is this real push back and awareness among all of us that these are not true and that technology is not the solution and finally a revelation from one of Washington's former frontmen as the State Department spokesperson under the Biden administration Matthew Miller was the face of its diplomatic messaging operation miller made a name for himself and not in a good way good afternoon everyone day after day he defended the US's support of Israel by either dodging questions about all of the evidence coming out of Gaza or flatout denying that Israel was committing war crimes we continue to support uh Israel's right to defend itself when it comes to um uh potential violations of international humanitarian law we have our ongoing assessments um and they have not concluded recently Miller went on a podcast produced for the UK broadcaster Sky News where he admitted without hesitation or a trace of shame that he had been lying that the war crimes were and are real do you think what's going on in Gaza now is a genocide i don't I don't think it's a genocide but I think the um I think it is without a doubt true that Israel has committed war crimes you wouldn't have said that at the podium yeah look because I when you're at the podium you're not expressing your personal opinion you're expressing the conclusions of the United States government this is not the first such Maya moment politicians public figures even news outlets are now repositioning themselves in most cases it has more to do with protecting reputations than seeing the light people complicit in this genocide pretending they were always against it" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="In his second appearance on “Palestine Talks,” American author and journalist Max Blumenthal discusses whether the recent but unusual “joint statement” by Western nations – pressuring Israel to end its “egregious actions” against the Palestinian people – holds promise, how major tech companies in the West, such as Microsoft and Elbit System, have aided Israel in carrying out atrocities against Palestine and what a visit to Iran (shortly before the interview) reveals about how Israel, disturbingly, has exported certain methods of torture beyond its borders and may be the same ones it is using on the Palestinian people today. &#10;&#10;Subscribe: http://trt.world/subscribe&#10;Livestream: http://trt.world/ytlive&#10;Facebook: http://trt.world/facebook&#10;X (Twitter): http://trt.world/twitter&#10;Instagram: http://trt.world/instagram&#10;TikTok:   / trtworld  &#10;WhatsApp: trtworld.com/whatsapp&#10;Telegram: https://t.me/trtworld&#10;Visit our website: http://trt.world" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="thank you so much Max for sitting with me again today for Palestine Talks i'm hoping we can talk about Gaza the Israeli military and your recent trip to Iran before we get into all that in earnest I'm hoping you can shed light on the recent statement and this is verbatim the joint statement from the leaders of the United Kingdom France and Canada on the situation in Gaza and the West Bank where on the surface at least they seem to be concerned with the egregious actions as uh it's stated in the statement of the Israeli government and uh the statement as I'm sure you know speaks to the uh the blockade and um the refusal of Israel to let in food is there any promise in this rather unusual statement from the West that might be too little too late well it's certainly too little too late from a group of states that have given Israel too much as a genocidal assault on Gaza was clear from the beginning and was signaled within hours of October 8th by key Israeli officials these Western European nations played a key role in shielding Israel from diplomatic accountability providing it with weapons the UK provided Israel with spy flights over Gaza which have been secret and unaccountable to the British public now they're suddenly stepping up at least with some rhetoric and the sanctions that they're looking to issue or individual sanctions that's where the too little comes in one of the figures they're looking at is Daniellea Weiss a fanatical settler leader who wants to colonize parts of northern Gaza after they're ethnically cleansed so my theory on what's happening here and why the Europeans the uh part of the axis of assistance has finally stepped up and said what's taking place is abhorrent is they recognize that the consequences of the apocalyptic final endgame final solution assault that Netanyahu is waging on Gaza is ethnic cleansing and that hundreds of thousands of people could be pushed out of Gaza through what Netanyahu calls voluntary migration but which is anything but voluntary through the Sinai desert and ultimately into Europe and you would have another refugee influx of war torn refugees many of them potentially radicalized by watching their entire families be slaughtered before their eyes this follows uh refugee waves from Libya when Mar Gaddafi before being betrayed by the West after he normalized relations with them warned that the shores of Lampedusa in Italy would be flooded with refugees from Africa that took place after Libya was destroyed and destabilized the refugee wave from Europe a million refugees following the dirty war which Europe participated in helped destabilize European politics and led to Brexit and so this coalition of leaders Starmer Mcronone they're afraid I think of another refugee wave which will drive right-wing populism in Europe and weaken their own domestic base weaken them domestically so this is a self-serving statement in my view and what also is interesting to look at here is how is the chatter from uh Israeli accounts on social media threatening Europe uh there's one count account account in particular uh open source or osent 613 on Twitter which consistently echoes the messaging of Israel's military intelligence apparatus and it has warned that if Europe goes forward with targeted sanctions even individual sanctions Israel could retaliate in a number of ways including by ending cooperation security cooperation security assistance and intelligence sharing which would then trigger in the words of this account a wave of jihadist attacks in Europe which suggests to me that Israel actually maintains jihadist sleeper cells in Europe which it can activate in order to punish the Europeans a kind of uh unconventional Samson option for any uh any accountability for this genocidal assault and that is absolutely terrifying as well as revealing about the the the role Israel plays as a so-called ally it's actually the ultimate frennemy and I I'm actually unclear about where the friendship lies here this is uh this is blackmail in the extreme you alluded to it just a moment ago about it being too little too late i'm wondering why did it take this long in addition perhaps to the reason you mentioned about the fear of um or the right-wing populism fear and um also maybe I should add like how do we ensure that even if this is promising in any way for the Palestinian people that these states are still held accountable that people don't forget that it took this long well I mentioned the the the threat of right-wing populism as a new refugee wave um you know looms on the horizon there's also the reality of Palestine solidarity mobilization we've seen recordsized rallies in the last week or two uh in Dublin and other parts and and and throughout the EU which certainly threatened the centrist neoliberal leadership uh which has tried to destroy these factions politically we saw that with the coup against Jeremy Corbin for example so they're concerned about instabil political instability the center is failing to hold they must recognize that the rules-based order that they represent through the transatlantic relationship with the US has been completely discredited through their support their steadfast support for what I consider to be the Holocaust of our times and billions of people across the world see it the same way and just the institutional uh lack of credibility any institution in Europe that seeks to uh play ball with Israel including Euro Vision the singing contest where we just saw an Israeli perform and was the the the producers of Eurovision actually had to lower crowd noise during the performance of the Israeli singer so that viewers wouldn't hear the loud booze and they had to play a message before the singer declaring that uh that that that that we stood we still stand with Palestinians for justice and human rights just to kind of soften the blow and the insult to our conscience of featuring this ghastly display on stage uh institutional credibility is collapsing across Europe european soft power is completely collapsing and the European public whether it's on the right for their own reasons which may be more sort of nationalistic or on the left just no longer support the centrist transatlantic consensus and how much have these states um since October but also before October 7th profited from their complicity and I'm wondering if in a very crass sense they don't see it now as being profitable and that has anything to do with the statement for the Europeans I think the Ukraine Russia proxy war the Ukraine proxy war is much more profitable and we saw this surge in sales and their defense industry after Trump humiliated Zalinski in the oval office and threatened to cut off arms to Ukraine um then it became clear what part of Europe's interest is in continuing this fruitless war but of Germany is the second largest supplier of weapons to Israel and and when I say second largest it's close it's a close second to the United States that's not widely recognized so Germany is not only uh mobilized by Holocaust guilt and this historic relationship with Israel which is a way of getting off cheap on the Holocaust kind of displacing it on the backs of Palestinians there's also a material interest there i mean they supply Israel with everything from dolphin class submarines uh a deal which Netanyahu exploited to uh fatten his own paycheck or or you know increase his own uh coffers but also uh cruiser like fast boats cruiser class boats everything that's needed to maintain the siege of Gaza as well as tech so Europe is deeply invested in the special relationship with apartheid Israel uh almost as much as the United States in the United States you see like Elbit Systems the Israeli state arms company putting factories strategically in congressional districts in Texas in order to ensure total support they'll spread out their factories and then say &quot;We're producing jobs.&quot; And then the members of Congress will actually show up at Apac and say &quot;I thank Israel for employing people in my own district.&quot; And what are they producing baby buster bombs uh drones that soar into the skies of Gaza and explode children with the push of a button that's those are the job creators in places like Texas Colorado and elsewhere so it sounds it's not just Israel it's other countries that are testing their weapons on Gaza is that the case how can these companies be held accountable legally or otherwise one company that I think needs to be looked at with particular scrutiny is Microsoft and the tech industry in general in Silicon Valley because Israel's uh genocide in Gaza has been the most high-tech assault in history and it's using AI pioneering AI to do targeting in ways we haven't seen before i assume the uh assassination of Muhammad Senoir who had taken over for Yaha Senoir in a tunnel in Gaza was arranged through AI targeting that's how he was located there and 70 civilians were killed in order to kill him that's sort of been standard operating procedure for Israel kill 70 people burn them alive in their tents bomb an entire wing of a hospital bomb a school slaughter entire families in their homes in order to get one senior Hamas commander who's quickly replaced and AI is at the center of this who's providing the AI technology companies like Palunteer which specialize in it run by Ultra Zionist CEO Alex Karp but also Microsoft is playing a quieter but much more substantial role as uh do not panic a Substack account that tracks the tech industry's involvement with apartheid Israel has documented Microsoft has hired an array of unit 8,200 personnel from Israel's cyber intelligence unit which oversees these AI genocide programs they're honeycombed throughout Microsoft's offices microsoft's they've helped design Microsoft's Azor cloud hosting program which actually hosts Israel's Rolling Stone program which is Israel's program to maintain the entire population registry of Gaza and to track the population's movements in order to kill them in the same way that IBM helped Nazi Germany maintain the Jewish population registry inside Germany it's the same level of criminality the same level of complicity there's actually a company that Microsoft just signed a deal with called AMD this is a company that was started very secretly in the 1980s by Israeli army veterans and Israeli intelligence veterans and it has maintained a very secret presence inside the United States during the George W bush era AMDOX was suspected of spying on the White House and the State Department and a counter intelligence investigation was initiated although they ultimately cleared them microsoft has just signed a deal with AMDOC to maintain telecommunications services so we're witnessing that at Microsoft meta has hired hundreds of former Israeli army personnel these are people mostly on the military intelligence side and so through the tech industry we are witnessing a vast Israeli intelligence penetration of American industry and American society which can then be weaponized against the United States in the event of a policy change i mentioned the threats against Europe before these uh these uh developments need to be challenged from inside the tech industry by people who are working there there has been an enormous amount of activism at Amazon at Google and elsewhere google which just signed a $ 35 billion deal with the Israeli firm Whiz which was founded by Unit 8200 veterans delivering a massive cash cow to the Israeli state which was starving for revenue after October 7th so these have to be challenged from inside the tech industry it's important for everyone watching this to understand that if you recognize that what we're witnessing is the holocaust of our time in the Gaza Strip and you are in a position where you can provide information or blow the whistle about complicity with the institution you're working in it could even be a Jewish institution in the United States because you were able uh as a Jew to get on the inside uh or a tech company or you are a police officer uh getting offered training with Israeli police personnel wherever you are you have the ability to blow the whistle and it's time for people to start stepping up and use their positions as insiders to blow the whistle on this genocide and it really starts with the tech industry right and these companies they're documenting the quote unquote performance of these weapons that they're using in Gaza and so they are So um what happens to this information does it get sold to states to um for them to figure out how to carry out uh more military-led atrocities that's one of the keys to the productive sector of Israel's economy is that according to journalist Yotam Feldman an Israeli dissident journalist who produced a documentary I think it's about 12 years old called the lab about Israel's military intelligence industry about 100,000 families virtually the entire upper middle class in Israel has some role or some material interest in the arms industry and Israel's weapons um you know a lot of them are good for sure they are at least they're as advanced as American weapons but what the advantage that they have is that they can go to any weapons fair around the world and market them as field tested because Israel is constantly at war and now the field testing is taking on new levels that we can't even imagine including you know quadricopters that would will fly into schools and private homes and assassinate individuals uh who knows it's still like a matter of debate what was used to kill Ismael Hania inside Thran but that's certainly something Israel would seek to market they have all of these opportunities to carry out hideous and daring acts of violence because of the nature of their state uh the unstable nature of the Israeli state as it and the logic of Zionism which sort of requires them to be in constantly in conflict to occupy a population of restive indigenous people simply because they are not Jewish and cannot fit into a state which Netanyahu just reaffirmed last week is not a state of all of its citizens it is the state of the Jewish people so this provides a boon for the arms industry as well as intelligence like if you take a direct flight from Tel Aviv to uh New York or Atlanta or somewhere chances are you might be sitting next to someone who's on their way to train security personnel privately or with some um state agency in uh their knowhow and they're so revered within like the NYPD or within corporate uh with within corporations israel's car Israelis carry this reputation it's a reputation bathed in blood yes that's perfect segue for this question I have here which bears on Israel's reputation or what was its former reputation as being the quote unquote only democracy in the Middle East and of course that's been exposed as a myth um since October 7th but of course before that and before our interview today you had some very interesting observations you shared with me about uh the consequences for Israel or Israeli society long term that aren't really being addressed in mainstream media i'm wondering if you can speak to that like what is going to happen to Israel and Israeli society after if we can put it this way after the genocide ends or after the hostilities end in Gaza what are um people who aren't from Israel for example traveling overseas going to experience after something like this well domestically Israel is going to go through a major shift which will be brought about through internal strife uh kind of civil conflict i mean sitting here it's hard to even predict when this ghastly horror will end when we'll stop waking up and opening our Twitter accounts and social media accounts and seeing images of shredded children it just been going on for so long and I think many people expected that after several months of that it would come to an end because it's just seemed unfathomable at this point in human history that could take place for so long what can we attribute that to to Jewish Israeli nationalists that can be attributed to an what they call an iron society national resilience that they were willing to go all the way to total victory and what is total victory in in the within the realm of in the framework of Zionism total victory is ethnic cleansing it's the completion of the genocide the genocidal process that began in 1948 which can deliver them an ethno religiously pure state free from these indigenous contaminants and getting the people of Gaza out is a priority that majority of them are refugees they have a militant mentality they're not going to stand down like the Palestinian Authority in in Ramla got to get them out of there how can you get them out of there without just be having the will to slaughter them shooting and bombing children as a kind of hobby you have to have a deeply deeply right-wing messianic society particularly among the youth that are pushing the buttons that are doing the killing and through this transitional process that really was consolidated with Netanyahu's election in 2009 he's now the longest serving Israeli prime minister they have been under this kind of right-wing messianic regime for long enough to have reached the point where they can just keep the killing going on a societywide basis indefinitely and they will be able to get the weapons because of their vast powerful lobby and and movement throughout Western capitals from Brussels and Washington indefinitely as well they'll have enough bunker buster bombs for the next year so the their uh s their their their ability to shed blood was underestimated including probably by Hamas i I I mean I think the theory of change of toan alaka alaka flood on October 7th did not include this going on for this long uh they assumed some kind of deal would have been brokered but there's this is going to come with major consequences for Israel their pursuit of total victory of a final solution which I mean so many Israeli young people I spoke to just want it they they would say we just need to push the button and oh just I wish they would all just disappear and die and this is their chance but that will come with a consequence there's still a sector of Israeli society that does not see uh the that does not see that as a resolution that considers it to be even inhumane and believes Netanyahu sacrifice the hostages in order to maintain this messianic fanatical coalition and pursue total victory and keep himself in power for as long as possible they're going they're in the streets but they're going to be uh pushing to topple this government there's also going to be pressure from the far right faction the Kahanist faction which has gained so much strength through this war the bezel smotrix uh Benguier who he just had a speaking tour in the United States where he found a large audience for his genocidal ideas they're going to be vying for more power and we're going to see a contest in Israel for I think the what what could be sort of the terminal phase of Zionism after Netanyahu israel without Netanyahu is going to face a lot of turbulence because Netanyahu has sort of united a lot of these factions before October 7th he had prevented a major uh a major war like this he'd always tried to negotiate his way out of it and then he went fully into it but most importantly Netanyahu was the most important propagandist for Israel on the world stage ever and the most effective one spoke perfect English he's a product of the United States of a high school in Philadelphia of MIT went worked in Boston Consulting with Mitt Romney he's as American as any American president but he's also defined Israel and he has this direct link to Israel's mythology through his brother Yoni who died in the Intebia raid so there's no figure after Netanyahu that can stand in hisstead so I see turbulence and social strife in Jewish Israeli society beginning as soon as there is a ceasefire and Netanyahu leaves the stage on the world stage I think it's pretty obvious where Israel is going it is a it is a pariah and you have a generation of Americans and Europeans and people around the world who see Israel as the new Nazi Germany which is tragic for me because I mean what is Israel's national logo it's the symbol of my faith community they've turned it into a swastika a lot of Jews are disgusted by this as well look at polls of American Jews liberal American Jews they simply no longer support Israel it's it's only Jews who have come from a conservative background and are raised in religiously hermetic closed settings that tend to support it that so that conflict is going to grow in the coming years and it's not going to ever move back into Israel's direction so the only way out for Israel going forward is more warfare and more threats and bribery of its so-called allies who are actually just too terrified to cut it off we even saw Marjgerie Taylor Green one of Trump's key allies in the MAGA faction in Congress suggest that she could be targeted with assassination for condemning Israel's actions and demanding a cut off in aid to Israel for actually for for condemning Apac she actually tweeted that she said &quot;I am a happy and healthy person and I would never take my own life.&quot; So I mean they know it yes they know that you know every Western leader I think knows that they face the threat of assassination if they turn on this monstrous apartheid entity well hearing you speak about Israel right now it's so violent so hateful even when you talk about those persons that you met who want to press the button it sounds like this is beyond bad politics it's pathological do you think that's going too far to call it pathological yeah sociopathic it is pathological you would say yes i mean you really have to be a sociopath to bear hug Netanyahu as Biden did you have to be a sociopath to look at what's taking place there and not use your leverage and I'm hoping on a positive note it will impress on people the urgency with which they should engage in say Palestinian solidarity um or do something to stop the genocide and I'm wondering if you have any final thoughts or observations well these are troubling times i remember our last talk in Washington and we were talking about many of the same themes and again it's just so dismaying and somewhat depressing that we're that we're the way that we're having having these conversations is is is is within the with within the the just abominable framework of an ongoing genocide so I hope the next one we have is takes place outside that framework and we're able to form a more long-term vision of how to prevent this from happening again uh but it's still important not to to lose motivation and to keep hope alive certainly thank you so much Max thanks a lot for having me thank you" />

separate deadly incidents during a week of aid chaos in gaza the victims palestinians traveling to depots they were told would provide help aid stations set up by the israelis and backed by the us a system that began under a cloud of controversy and criticism and is now at the center of two mass killings this is how an israeli us aid plan led to tragedy in gaza day one of the gaza humanitarian foundation's operations may 27th this hub in the far south opens its doors it does so after a week where just a trickle of aid has entered gaza following a near 3-month blockade the idea had been for nominated family representatives to collect food from ghf aid sites an idea that evaporated in the face of huge crowds competing for limited supplies in the leadup the plan had been criticized by the un and other bodies as unworkable and politicized the head of the organization jake wood quit before the program had even begun initially people had been reluctant to come here the process included biometric measurement hamas had urged resistance against what it called an israeli intelligence operation israel has denied that and in any case soon enough any idea of control was disappearing [Applause] desperation for food apparent across gaza not just at the sites provided by the ghf just a day after ghf opened its doors a warehouse storing flour operated by the un's world food program is overrun two are killed in the crush two die of gunshot wounds this a gaza market on may 29th armed men steal any food they can find the same location moments later an israeli strike targeting the hamas security forces who've been sent to stop the looting all the while ghf provides limited supplies and the system remains chaotic before the war the un says five to 600 trucks entered gaza every day now it's in the tens ghf claims it distributes thousands of boxes a day but relies on hungry people walking long distances into israeli military zones traditional supply chains continue to struggle with the sheer need and ongoing disorder on may the 31st world food program workers appeal for people to take just a sack of flour each after a convoy of 77 trucks is stopped and looted allah and then the first major incident at a ghf distribution center on sunday before dawn thousands try to get to the site in rafa and come under sustained fire gaza's civil defense says 31 people are killed and scores injured doctors at al-naser hospital back up those claims what we do know is that 28 people have been brought here to nasa dead we have five patients currently who are brain dead and we have over 200 patients here in the emergency department with injuries most of which are gunshot injuries so what happened in the early hours of june the 1st jhf has established four what it calls safe distribution sites inside gaza on sunday morning only one sds1 is due to open at 6:00 a.m but from midnight already thousands of people are gathering at a junction just over a kilometer away many we're told had traveled from the far north of the strip as more locals arrive pressure to get to the front intensifies witnesses tell us the crowd moves slowly southwards a tank near the site fires warning shots quadcopters first broadcast verbal warnings then shoot warning shots at around 3:30 we're told there is chaos crowds running back and forth soldiers tanks and naval boats all firing this is when the first gunshot injuries are reported an hour later the crowd now the biggest since the start of the ghf operations surges for the aid site it's at this point the majority of killings take place even then many still try to reach the site hundreds doing so around 5:00 a.m stripping it bare witnesses say within minutes [Music] the icrc field hospital receives nearly 180 injured the majority with gunshot or shrapnel wounds ghf claims reports of injuries fatalities or incidents during its operations are egregious fabrications and the israeli military tells us that the idf did not fire at civilians while they were near or within the aid site an official instead saying warning shots were fired when troops were advanced upon a kilometer away giving no further comment when asked if civilians had been hit what we have heard is very clear that there was an invitation to attend the food aid location as folk were making their invited way there they were attacked somewhere between the beach and the coast road by drones we heard by naval gunfire you've heard by tanks israeli forces obviously israeli forces not by uh gangs or any other armed groups criticism compounded because nos's including the un had been operating aid delivery in gaza for decades before where we need to go back to is to allow organizations like unra to do what it does best that is mass deliveries of humanitarian supplies opening the borders so that there's basic supplies going into gaza then on the morning of june the 2nd another incident along the same aid corridor this time three people are killed the israeli foreign ministry's response i love you trump good luck to release images of people returning to ghf sites saying they speak louder than hamas propaganda and media lies and then on the morning of june the 3rd a third consecutive shooting at the same location as people try to access the site for aid this time gaza's health ministry reports 27 killed and nearly 200 injured if it seems extraordinary that so many are ready to brave these risks well these are the stakes in gaza right now [Music] [Music] and grief children mourning their mother remided had already tried four times to get aid from the ghf site she died in her fifth attempt to feed her family [Music] for days now the israeli military has been condemning media lies admitting only to firing warning shots on tuesday a change in approach as some of the suspects continued despite these warning shots advancing towards the troops in a threatening manner further fire was directed near these specific individuals but doubling down on the accusation that media were reporting hamas propaganda without verification june 1st hamas claimed israel had killed 31 people at an aid site in rafa the new york times and others ran it ran with it then we've released an israeli drone israeli drone footage showing that hamas gunman opened fire on the crowd now did the media lead with that correction no for good reason as it turns out that footage used in another government briefing is from a different location and time from sunday's incident our colleagues in gaza say the gunman belong not to hamas but an armed gang selling stolen aid we challenge the israeli prime minister's spokesman on our program now these warning shots were fired david twice now twice now desperate people who have been starved for weeks have been shot at while trying to collect aid you are terrifying the population of gaza even more they're too scared now to go to collection points because they know they could be shot at by the idf so that is precisely the hamas rhetoric that they want you to to publish the un is calling for a full investigation into the shootings and maintaining its criticism of the nature of the new aid mechanism and all the while israeli air strikes continue to rain down israeli ground forces expand their operations in the north where three israeli soldiers are confirmed killed on tuesday israel's prime minister talks of the high price for achieving israel's war goals in kanun more neighborhoods are subject to evacuation orders for gaza's civilians the achievements of this war counted in increments of misery" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Hello. – Hi. Do you speak English? – Yes. Can I ask you a question? We're looking for the green line, do you know where the green line is? It doesn't exist. – It doesn't exist? All of Israel is our land. All of Israel is yours? – Yeah. Did the the green line used to exist? – No, never. You don't recognise the green line, there is no green line? God gave us Israel, all of it. Reporting in the Middle East for over 20 years, I've seen the conflict between  Israelis and Palestinians deepen, shift and return to the same painful questions again and again. At one point, there was hope for a resolution based on the green line. Drawn in 1949 to separate Israel from the West Bank in Gaza, it was seen as the boundaries of a possible two-state solution. But today, amid Israel's devastating war in Gaza and the occupation of the West Bank, that vision feels more distant than ever. The green line still exists on maps, but on the ground it's been blurred, physically, politically and in  ways that continue to inflame the conflict.   How can you have your next door neighbour saying,  'I want to have a safe house right next door to you and also I want to kill you and I want to drive you into the sea.' In this series, I'm travelling along the green line, meeting  Palestinians and Israelis living just kilometres apart, but shaped by vastly different realities, to discover whether peace is still possible and what future they envision. Now in this moment, I'm looking, and I see the Dome of the Rock, and I see the al-Aqsa, and I know things are going to change in Jerusalem.   In episode one, I begin in Jerusalem, a city at the heart of the conflict, and where divisions run deep. Excuse me, do you know where the Green Line is? It used to be here somewhere, I think. I don't know. It's not here any more? – No, I don't know. All right, thank you. Do you know where the green line is? This way? – Straight. OK, shukran. Do you know where the green gine is? No idea. – Do you know what the green line is? No idea. I don't know anything about it. Go from there, all the way to the right. Is it a border, do I need my passport? [Laughs] No? – You don't need your passport. OK, thank you, shukran. I'll go find it, thank you, thank you. For most of those I ask, the green line no longer exists in Jerusalem,  and hasn't for a long time. In many ways, the erasure of the green line began in 1967, when Israel occupied the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including here in East Jerusalem. Sorry? We didn't occupy the Gaza Strip, it's ours. What did – What did the gentleman say? He's saying that Israel never occupied the Gaza Strip or the West Bank,  that these territories belong to Israel, they're theirs. years after the occupation began, Israel  annexed the eastern part of the city, expanding Jerusalem and declaring it as the complete and united capital of Israel. For Palestinians, many of whom were displaced from western Jerusalem during the creation of Israel in 1948, the ongoing occupation is a painful reminder  of the loss of their most important city. Why? Today does the green line  still have any meaning for you? This is 'bullshit' in English. For me, this is my past and it's my future, and for you, when you come here, it's a story. For us, this isn't a story. It's our life and it's our survival. As the the Arabs express themselves, they're saying, 'no Jews should live in Israel', and they say it openly. They have an open agenda not a hidden – But I think the official position of the Palestinian government in any case has been of one of two states. Is that not something you would support? One of the three characteristics of a Jew is that they're compassionate, and we're compassionate until they're standing with rifles at us wanting to kill us and kill our children. Then we say, hang on a second, a two-state solution? Before we can talk about a two-state solution, we need to say, 'are you willing to live in peace?' The majority of those living in East Jerusalem are Palestinians but since the occupation began, an increasing number of Israeli settlers have crossed the Green Line and moved into Palestinian areas of the city. Shalom. Tziporah Piltz is one such settler. A mother of 10 and a tour guide, she's chosen to raise her family in the Arab neighbourhood of Ras al-Amud. Her home is located in the middle of a Jewish cemetery and overlooks one of Islam's holiest sites, al-Aqsa Mosque compound. We'll walk around over here, we'll see the view of the Temple Mount. Let's do it. – OK, let's go. We've lived here for 23 years. This is a very special cemetery because in the redemption, we're going to have the Messiah, we're going to have the temple, and all the dead people are going to become alive again so it's going to start from here, from the Mount of Olives. That's why people – – This is where going to where it's going to – Exactly, it's going to start from here. – OK, interesting. This is East Jerusalem and I like to talk about the Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem. You see there's a wall at the end of the the trees over there? – Yeah. They have 10 families living over there. Now all the mountain over there, that you see there now, is empty, that's going to be a big Jewish  neighbourhood of 300 families. So who makes that? The Jerusalem municipality, the Israeli government?  The Israeli government, yeah. That will be the eastern neighbourhood of of Yerushalayim What does it feel like for you, living, as you described, surrounded by Palestinian Arabs from this community in East Jerusalem. Well I feel it's a privilege, OK, living here,   because the first reason is as making  all Yerushalayim, all Jerusalem to be Jewish, that's like one of our aims, and to live overlooking the holiest site, overlooking the Temple Mount. This is the reason why I live here, you see this is my house over here. Wow, I have never seen the old city from this perspective. Yeah, this is amazing, amazing. The world was founded from this spot, OK, because over here is still the first temple of King Solomon, over here is the second temple of King Herod, and I believe where is going to be the third temple. So tell me about that, you say you want to build the third temple, why is that important to you? After the destruction of the second temple, we were all separated to Poland, Germany and Morocco and Yemen. What kept the Jews in all of these countries is the coming back to our nation, to our homeland, and rebuilding the Third Temple. Now, in this moment, I'm looking and I see the Dome of the Rock and I see the al-Aqsa and I know that it doesn't have to be in this spot. So, is there a place for both of them to exist or do you have to actually destroy one of those Islamic sites in order to build the temple?   We cannot have a mosque together with the Third Temple together, it doesn't go together. Meaning one of those structures, the al-Aqsa mosque, has to go in order for the temple to be built? Yes. My daily music. Instead of hearing the muezzin calling people to pray, I know that I'm supposed to hear the levites playing their instruments in the temple. I know it's music I'm supposed to hear, this is something temporarily,  it's not supposed to be in Israel. Do you ever see a solution based around two states –  one for Israelis one for Palestinians – based on the Green Line?   Definitely not. To give the Palestinian state, it means to give away, to give up, my homeland. The more settlements we'll have in Judea and the more settlements we're going to have in Samaria, that will solve our side because we need Jews, not only living in Tel Aviv and Haifa, we need two million, three millions Jews living in those in our original homeland. Now you're asking what to do with all the Arabs, and uh – That's a logical question to ask next, I mean, what about all the Arabs that are living already in East Jerusalem in these neighbourhoods that you mentioned. OK, so first of all, we have to know that Jerusalem is the capital of the state of Israel. If other people want to live here, they're welcome, they could live in Jerusalem, but they have their obligations what to do, OK. If the Palestinians you mentioned were to to stay  in Jerusalem, what would they need to do exactly?   First of all, recognise that things are going to change in the Temple Mount, we're going to have the Third Temple, OK. Things are going to change. Look, we have a lot of Arab countries all over the world, and we have only one homeland.  Everybody has to accept that this is our homeland But for Palestinians like Ramzi Abbassi, whose roots to Jerusalem trace back generations, this is the only homeland he's ever known. Like Tziporah, Ramsey is also a tour guide of Jerusalem. With a large following on social media, he creates videos about the issues facing Palestinians in this ancient city. Hi, Ramzi. – How are you doing, kefak. How's it going, nice to meet you, Matthew. The green line was here. – Yes, here, exactly. If a Palestinian from  the Gaza Strip or the West Bank, they want to come to Jerusalem, are they able to? and you have a lot of soldiers  and police walking around, I guess? in 2023, Ramzi was convicted by an Israeli court for communicating with a person affiliated with a terror group and for working with a banned social media platform, charges he vehemently denies. I've been noticing, we've been trying to talk with a lot of Palestinians here in East Jerusalem and a lot of people they're scared to say anything political, why is that? You're not worried about yourself to talk about these things? After taking me on a tour, Ramzi joins his  family for a meal at their favourite spot,   on the rooftops of the old city,  overlooking the al-Aqsa compound. How is it to live in Jerusalem? The Israelis will say they're doing all of this because they're worried about attacks from Palestinians, that they need to do all this for self-defence, what do you say to that? So, what's the solution then? As we eat, a group of a few dozen Jewish  Israeli women turn up on a tour of their own.   Leading the group is Tziporah. How's it going, we're filming. I'm giving a tour. – Are you? We've been going around the Old City  today just meeting all kinds of people   and it's funny we came across you here. So what are you doing? It's a tour that the whole aim of it is, first  of all, a connection between mothers and daughters. None of the women over here are from  Jerusalem, all of them are out of Jerusalem to increase the rebuilding of the temple, that's the whole aim of the tour, this is what we do. In the next episode, I'll travel north along the green line to the city of Tulkarm, meeting Palestinians  displaced from their homes and speaking with Israelis living in towns just across the wall facing the edge of the West Bank." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="- This was the Gaza Strip, a 25 mile stretch along the Mediterranean coast, home to just over 2 million people. Today, the once bustling streets and high-rise buildings have been reduced to rubble. But underneath the wreckage lies a vast, sophisticated web of tunnels longer than London's underground. This extensive network is a key weapon in Hamas' arsenal, from which they smuggle weapons and people for their w*r against Israel. The tunnels began as a lifeline for families divided by impermeable borders. When Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in 2007, they poured billions of dollars into this underground infrastructure, waiting for the day their enemy would meet them in this airless, subterranean battlefield. How did Gaza's tunnels go from a primitive supply network to the world's largest underground w*r zone? (gentle instrumental music) Our story starts in Rafah, a city in the south of Gaza with a tumultuous history. In a matter of decades, it changed hands four times, from the Ottomans, to the British, to the Egyptians, to the Israelis. In 1979, things changed once again when Israel and Egypt signed a peace agreement. As part of the deal, Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula. The new border between Israel and Egypt split Rafah in half. One part returned to Egypt, the other remained under Israeli control. And in the middle, a massive, impenetrable wall. - Right now, we are standing in the urban area of the town of Rafah. The immediate problem that the line, as you see it over there, should run across the city, and cut the town into two parts between Israel and Egypt. - Suddenly, neighbors who had grown up side by side lived in different countries. Families separated, unable to visit one another. But Gaza's people weren't about to let a wall keep them from their loved ones. Armed with shovels and determination, they dug the first tunnels beneath Gaza. Simple passageways carved out of sandy soil, connecting homes on either side of the border. These early tunnels were modest and easy to build with openings hidden in basements. On one side, a family in Gaza, on the other, a family in Egypt. In between, a secret passageway that allowed them to visit. For a brief moment, the tunnel stood as a testament to the enduring power of human connection. But it didn't take long for bad actors to exploit the system. With the wall cutting off access to Egypt, Gaza faced severe shortages of everyday essentials. Seizing the moment, enterprising smugglers turn the tunnels into underground trade routes, moving car parts, gasoline, and cigarettes into Gaza, all with a hefty markup, of course. When supply is low and demand is high, profits soar. And while the smugglers were cashing in, they were also filling a critical gap, helping your neighbors get the supplies they so desperately needed. For many Gazans, these tunnels became a lifeline. One Palestinian poetically called them, &quot;The lungs through which Gaza breathed&quot;, the only escape from the suffocating blockades that Egypt and Israel imposed. Egypt and Israel were well aware of the tunnels, but for a long time, the two countries just looked away. They weren't going to interfere with the smuggling of cigarettes or with the family reunions that the tunnels enabled. Everyone, from the people of Rafah to the governments on either side of its wall, understood that this underground network kept Gaza's economy and morale afloat. But everything changed with the First Intifada. In 1987, tensions between Israelis and Palestinians reached a boiling point. Palestinians, frustrated by decades under Israeli control, began protesting. But the grassroots movement escalated quickly. Protests turned to riots, screams turned to stone throwing, Palestinians took up arms, and the clashes between the IDF and the Palestinian crowds soon turned deadly. Gaza was tightly controlled by its neighbors in Israel and Egypt, and still weapons kept appearing in the streets as if by magic. The tunnels had become a pipeline for the w*r against Israel. Israeli authorities tried to destroy the tunnels where they could, but the network grew increasingly sophisticated, and no one in Gaza was going to give up their lifeline to the other side. In 1993, Israel signed a peace deal with the Palestinian Liberation Organization, creating a semi-autonomous Palestinian government for the first time. The Jewish state asked the newly created Palestinian authority for help in locating and destroying the tunnels, an opportunity for the PA to demonstrate its commitment to peace by cracking down on weapon smuggling. But the PA failed miserably. Through a toxic combination of incompetence, corruption, and complicity, the PA left the tunnels intact, and for the next decade, the tunnel network only expanded, snaking underneath more and more of Gaza. By the time the Second Intifada broke out in 2000, the tunnels had become a critical component of Gaza's underground w*r machine. Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Fatah smuggled weapons at unprecedented rates. Underneath the ground, weapons makers assembled the bombs that would detonate Israeli cafes, and buses, and streets, claiming more than 1000 Israeli lives. Israel cracked down hard, determined to stop the terror. And at the end of the Second Intifada, more than 5,000 people were dead. The military launched operations in Gaza to stem the flow of weapons. Demolishing buildings suspected of concealing tunnel entrances, but these efforts often meant displacing civilians and destroying homes, drawing harsh international condemnation. Despite these efforts, the tunnel network endured, smugglers kept profiting, terror groups kept building weapons. The problem seemed insurmountable, so Israel tried a different approach. In 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in the hopes that granting Gazans self rule would finally reduce tensions, - But the move backfired, spectacularly. Without Israeli forces on the ground, Hamas and other groups expanded their tunnel operations unchecked. What had once been a covert network grew into an underground empire, a sprawling web of tunnels beneath Gaza streets, the most important weapon in the fight against Israel. And that fight was now Gaza's first priority, because in 2006, Gazans voted for Hamas to lead them. - Now to be clear, these people weren't all terror supporters. In fact, exit polls showed that a shocking 40% of Hamas voters supported the peace process, and over 1/3 thought that the best path forward was the Two State solution. They saw Hamas as an antidote to the spectacular corruption of the Palestinian Authority. But Hamas and its rival party, Fatah, were unable to share power. Their attempts at a unity government ended in a civil w*r. By 2007, there was only one ruler in Gaza, Hamas, and they had one goal, targeting Israel. - So they poured their considerable resources into expanding the tunnel network. Billions of dollars earmarked for aid went instead to building a fully equipped w*r machine, with tunnels carved from solid rock more than 20 stories underground. For many Gazans, the tunnels still served a practical purpose, alongside weapons, they continued to deliver essential goods like food and medicine. But Israel and Egypt had imposed blockades to curb the flow of weapons and weapons making materials, and the blockades meant the demand for smuggled goods skyrocketed. Smuggling was lucrative, particularly for those who controlled the operation. Known as snakeheads, these individuals invested heavily to build the tunnels and then rented them out to groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. In return, they earned a cut of every shipment. The prophets were staggering. By 2010, snakeheads could rake in up to $200,000 a day. It was a fortune in a region plagued by poverty. But for the ones doing the digging, the story was starkly different. Thousands of Gazans had once worked in Israel, an economic lifeline for a region plagued by poverty and unemployment. But that lifeline soon dried up. Hamas had refused to give up on its goal of eliminating Israel, launching more and more attacks on Israeli cities. And so Israel rescinded the work permits that had allowed Gazan men to feed their families. Without other options, Gazans turn to the backbreaking, dangerous work of digging tunnels. But the burden often fell on children who were small and nimble enough to chisel away at the tight crevices in the bedrock, dozens of feet under the ground. A veritable army of kids risked their lives every day just to bring home a few dollars. - For many children in Gaza, digging tunnels has been a grim rite of passage. But the work was deadly. Cave-ins, electrocution, and exposure to toxic gases were constant threats. - By Hamas' own admission, at least 160 people had died digging tunnels by 2010. Yet the practice continued. Perhaps the most heartbreaking part is that these children understood the dangers before they ever picked up a shovel. - But with no other options, the risk wasn't enough to stop them. For many, it was their only chance to put food on the table. - The tunnels offer a devastating glimpse into Gaza's increasing desperation. For many, they provided essential income and supplies. But for Israel, the tunnels represented an existential threat. Eliminating them became a national security imperative. The Israeli government wasn't interested in cracking down on the smuggling of food, cigarettes, and other goods. It mostly cared about the terrifying prospect of the tunnels being used to launch attacks within Israeli borders. This wasn't just paranoia. - In 2006, Hamas fighters emerged from an underground tunnel and kidnapped an Israeli soldier named Gilad Shalit. For five years, they held him in a two-room complex lined with explosives, 50 feet underground. So the Israelis built a 20-foot high, 10-foot deep border wall equipped with sonar sensors to detect underground activity. But Hamas adapted, digging tunnels deeper, sometimes hundreds of feet below the surface, rendering the wall ineffective. In 2014, the IDF destroyed over 30 tunnels in a major military campaign. And on the other side of Gaza's border, Egypt flooded the tunnels with seawater from the Mediterranean. But the problem persisted. For every tunnel Egypt and Israel destroyed, Hamas just built more, deeper, stronger, and more sophisticated. Israeli engineers developed high tech detection systems and implemented a systematic process for locating and destroying tunnels. Dubbed the Steel Dome, this initiative aimed to neutralize the underground threat. In 2021, Israel announced significant progress, claiming to have destroyed 62 miles of tunnels. But Hamas was quick to counter, asserting that much of the 350 mile network remained intact. - These are no longer the narrow, rudimentary tunnels of the 1980s. Today's tunnels are fortified with concrete and steel rebar, designed to last. Some even resemble luxury living spaces, complete with toweled floors, air conditioning, plumbing, and ventilation systems, and they've grown in scale. Some wealthier Gazans have even used them to smuggle in luxury cars. This vast underground network is more than a military asset. It's an entire infrastructure hidden beneath Gaza's surface. Building hundreds of miles of deep, fortified, and well-equipped tunnels doesn't come cheap. Estimates suggest that constructing Gaza's underground cost nearly $1 billion. That's an extraordinary sum, especially in a region devastated by poverty. So where did the money come from? Much of it was stolen from the very people Hamas claims to represent. Israel approved construction materials to enter Gaza for civilian projects, like rebuilding homes, roads, and schools. But instead of improving life on the surface, Hamas diverted these materials underground, redirecting them to expand their network of terror tunnels. The cost to Gaza civilians was staggering. Homes crumbled, schools and hospitals were left unfinished. Communities in desperate need of support saw their resources vanish into the ground, literally. When Israel discovered this blatant misuse of resources, they stopped sending construction materials, a logical step to protect their own security. Unfortunately, this also made life harder for ordinary Gazans who were caught between Hamas' ambitions and the resulting restrictions. - Gazans lacked basic supplies. But they did have a sprawling, fully operational underground military base, complete with communication systems, storage facilities for weapons, training areas, and even weapons manufacturing sites. Hamas can move personnel, vehicles, and arms anywhere in Gaza without exposing themselves above ground. For over a year, they've been waging w*r from below the surface. But the most critical and dangerous function of the tunnels is their ability to shield Hamas from Israeli surveillance and airstrikes. The subterranean tunnel network presents a serious challenge to the Israeli Air Force. Many tunnels are buried so deep that surface attacks have no impact. The sandy soil, which made the tunnels easy to dig in the first place, now absorbs much of the force from the strikes. And then there's the simple but crucial advantage of concealment. No satellite, drone, or advanced technology can detect targets hidden beneath layers of earth. This isn't a side benefit of the tunnel system, it's a core feature. Hamas values the tunnels because they give them the ability to operate in complete secrecy, outmaneuvering even the most advanced military technology. - Meanwhile, Hamas officials refuse to let ordinary Gazans shelter inside, leaving them exposed to Israeli airstrikes. Hamas leaders shelter beneath schools, hospitals, and homes, turning Gazan civilians into human shields. The international community is quick to blame Israel when civilians are caught in the crossfire. - Gross violations of the human rights of civilians. - We believe that w*r cr!mes are being committed there. - But they conveniently omit the fact that Hamas intentionally places its terror infrastructure directly beneath civilian populations for this very reason. Hamas has been explicit about its willingness to sacrifice civilians. - So Israel is left with only bad choices. Should they sacrifice young soldiers to the booby traps inside tunnels and homes, or should they target Hamas' infrastructure with drones and bunker busters, knowing that civilians and Israeli hostages might be inside? When Israel has chosen the latter, it has been at a very high price for civilians. When Israel has chosen the former, it has been at a very high price for its soldiers. Meanwhile, Hamas exploits its remaining tunnels to move undetected and ambush IDF soldiers. This has dragged the conflict into a prolonged w*r, and that's part of Hamas' strategy. By forcing Israel into a drawn out conflict in a civilian heavy area, Hamas is betting on fierce international backlash. So far, it's working. Israeli citizens are fiercely critical of their government. While the rest of the world claims Israeli tactics are tantamount to genoc!de. - Madam Speaker, we are witnessing the Israeli government carry out a genoc!de in Gaza. - This w*r is unlike any of the world has ever seen before, but Israeli military is clear in its purpose. It's not waging a w*r against Palestinian civilians, it's not waging a w*r against Gaza, it's fighting Hamas, an internationally recognized terror organization that for years has treated its own people as cash cows and human shields. For everyone's sake, they must be defeated. Only then can the people of Gaza live the safe, dignified, prosperous life they deserve." />

          <attvalue for="3" value="A look into how and why international laws and principles are being applied and ignored in the Israel-Gaza conflict.&#10;&#10;The events of October 7 sent shockwaves across the world and brought to the forefront once again a conflict that has been ongoing for 75 years. The Israeli government’s response to Hamas’s attack was prompt – it embarked on a war of magnitude in Gaza, claiming it needed to take out Hamas and rescue the captives. At first, the consensus of Western powers seemed solid: Israel has the right to fight back against Hamas. But more than five months later, Israel’s military was facing criticism worldwide, including allegations that it is committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and even genocide.&#10;&#10;This documentary will explore whether Israel is breaking international law and, if so, why are Western powers, in particular the United States, silent.&#10;&#10;Edited by: Jameel Hodzic&#10;&#10;Subscribe to our channel http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe&#10;Follow us on Twitter   / ajenglish  &#10;Find us on Facebook   / aljazeera  &#10;Check our website:  https://www.aljazeera.com/&#10;Check out our Instagram page:   / aljazeeraenglish  &#10;Download AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile&#10;&#10;#aljazeeraenglish #palestine #documentary" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] it's an extremely cynical moment for international law it's an extremely devastating moment for the Palestinian [Music] people there are rules under international law and no matter which way you look at this Israel is in violation of those rules as of the 7th of October there is not one Norm of international humanitarian law that has not been violated I never imagined that in my lifetime I would see a genocide taking place in real time before my eyes the fact that it is being protected by most western governments takes it to a level that I just never imagined would be possible I come to Israel with a single message you're not alone you are not alone Canada will always be a friend of Israel and defend its rights including its right to [Applause] exist and Israel has a right to defend itself in fact it has the duty to defend its people as your friend we will stand with you in solidarity we will stand with your people and we also want you to win if one looks at our political leaders today and all of our mainstream politicians they are the most mendacious the most mediocre the least talented group of politicians that I can remember during my almost 60 years on this Earth it it is astonishing just How Deeply corrupt materially and morally they are because many of them be through donations to their political parties donations to them personally donations to their organizations like the labor friends of Israel the conservative friends of Israel the Democratic friends of Israel the Republican friends of Israel and the multiple and Myriad other organizations like that they provide an extremely good living for that person and for those political parties thank you for having me and uh I'm looking forward to having a thorough discussion about where everybody goes from here every day in the depth and bread of cooperation the West is intimately involved in Israel's genocidal campaign in Gaza for months we have seen us officials affirm time and again that there are no red lines for Israel using exactly that language uh when of course we know that international law draws many red lines and yet the US has come out in Stark opposition granting Israel full authority to proceed and to create As Much Death and destruction as it sees fit battle it's America's battle I'm shocked by the lack of action of the International Community I'm shocked by the hands raised by the US ambassador in the security Council voting against Asis fire vetoing Asis fire I'm shocked by the lack of action of principled States who need to take again a principled concrete stand against this aberration and start thinking of [Music] sanctions what we've seen is that the laws of war are used against weaker parties but if your ally is the United States and if your ally can veto any Security Council resolution and if your allies are the European States then the chances that the IC will bring you to Justice are very very slim the international court of justice is a court that renders guilty the losers in a conflict it is a court of the victors and a court that has double standards for the allies of the powerful and for those that it thinks of as its enemies The View that South Africa's submission to the international court of justice is some sort of anti anti-semitic screed and blood liel this is nonsense that you couldn't make up and the nonsense that is being enunciated constantly not just by the Israelis but that is then parroted by the US government the UK government the German government the French government Etc and this is being done to defend the indefensible to defend the slaughter of tens of thousands of innocent civilians to to defend attacks on Health Facilities on residential homes on places of worship on places of work we are seeing a genocide taking place in Gaza well truth the matter is if there weren't an Israel we'd have to invent one the truth of the matter is that I believe that you as I went home and said got in trouble it's the time but it's true you know you don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist you don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist it's the International Community and it's powerful member states like particularly the the us but in general Western countries which is still pilot and it's evident in The veto power that some member states can exercise within the UN three of those member states are from the West it tells us something no African countries has a VTO power in the United Nations system it's the entire system which is not fully representative of where the world is today but I would like to see this changing we need to think of better mechanisms not only inside the law but how the law is applied to ensure that there is no double standards so it's both a changing of the laws to so so that they uh address the current circumstances but also the institutions the judicial institutions that apply the law so that they don't apply it with double standards and we will continue to actively engage in the hard work of direct diplomacy on the ground until we reach a final solution the destruction of over 70% of Gaza the killing of over 30,000 Palestinians including 13,000 Palestinian babies and children the injuring of uh around now 70,000 Palestinians and the destruction of almost all of the civilian infrastructure in Gaza international law prohibits this completely we have to remind the world that there are at least in theory rules which Israel must abide by and which it is violating the IDF is doing anything they can in order to minimize the uh culties when it targets the the military targets but again we are in a war in a war civilians got H you will never see the IDF Target shoots down a civilian you will never see a group of children walking on the beach of Gaza and Israel Target them specifically or an old lady crossing the street and Israel shoots the old lady Israel does not Target civilians Israel targets military targets Israel targets terrorists and when these terrorists surround themselves with civilians with this little children with this old lady with this old people these civilians might get hurt but it's not on the fault of Israel it's on the fault of the one who surrounded himself with these civilians the one that use them as human Shields [Music] the argument of the human Shields of Palestinians in general being uh eager to sacrifice their own children as human Shields has been used and dismissed over and over the first one to dismiss this argument was Richard uh Goldstone the the head of the first Commission of inquiry over the first war in Gaza and it has been disproven over and over where is the evidence [Music] Israel's instruction to the Palestinians first to move South and then to move west and then to move north but basically that instruction which has displaced 1.8 million people tells the Israelis that any civilians that remains in that area or Israel assumes that any civilian that remains at that in that area is either a participant in hostilities and therefore can be killed or a human shield namely someone that is being used to Shield a legitimate military Target and that allows Israel to relax the repertoar of Le lethal violence that it uses against these people and in a court of law that can be used to justify the wholesale killing of civilians Israel does more than even it's required it drops fly uh over Gaza to tell the people to vacate the area it makes phone calls to residential um civilians to vacate the area uh Israel calls to vacate the area once Israel took this precautions it's allowed to take down the building [Music] if civilians prefer to stay they take the uh their own [Applause] responsibility this is a complete Distortion of international law if you consider also the fact that Israel is an occupier which I think is the relevant legal framing here Israel has obligations under occupation law um not only to end the occupation which has now been ongoing for 56 years but also to protect the occupied people and we also know that Israel has no right to claim self-defense in accordance with article 51 of the UN Charter with respect to attacks emanating from a territory that it occupies and this notion was upheld by the international court of justice in its 2004 ruling on the legality of the wall and so regardless of which way you look at this there is absolutely no legal defense to committing a [Music] genocide andal and Mazon and [Music] M we have the president of the state saying there's no innocent civilian or there's no uninvolved civilian in the Gaza Strip so these kind of remarks do point at it intent and the if if it gets to a court of law then these kinds of remarks become very important in terms of the genocidal aspect of this war a lot of people in Israel will not feel bad for the Palestinians but yet the leadership in Israel feels for the Palestinian people and they allow whatever the minimal uh humanitarian Aid to be provided to the population in Gaza [Music] [Music] [Music] the law does create a vision of a certain kind of justice that we want to Aspire for we want to Aspire towards a world where human rights for all are protected the immense scale of suffering in Gaza there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks which is what is currently on the table does human rights law give us the tools to achieve human rights I'm not sure because of the interests of powerful states because of the double standards that are applied in the international Arena and therefore if it gets to court often the human rights do not win the day and so we need to think of other mechanisms to achieve these human rights [Music] the problem is not the law the problem is with the enforcement of the law and in in the Middle East and in the global South I would say uh the problem is that law is closer to political convenience than to Justice as a European I'm very sorry to say 500 years of colonization has left a huge imprint in our DNA in general Western people are not able to assess objectively what is what is being done through the non-application of international law or through the discretionary application of international law it's terrible to see the dismantlement of international order premised upon international law piece by piece [Music] manen it's unclear absolute Victory will look like when you've destroyed already 70% of Gaza when the overwhelming majority close to 2 million Palestinians are displaced um it seems to me that absolute victory means the the total decimation of Gaza to the point that it's completely uninhabitable and the depopulation of Gaza which Israel has told us time and again uh in this current moment that that is their goal that their goal is the depopulation of Gaza and um the settlement of Gaza by Israeli settlers of course in total violation of international law Israel does not Bridge the international law Israel keeps strictly very very strictly all the rules of law according to the international law why a country should be above scrutiny I mean no one should be the international law is there to be applied universally and not just for cherry picking because this this forms as I often say human rights protection into protectionism and this is unacceptable for me the the idea that the law will lead to Liberation or emancipation or Palestinian self-determination is a fiction human rights is not necessarily the the tool I think the tool needs to be more political in the sense of divestments in the sense of sanctions in the sense of boycotts to use this kind of Arenal of nonviolent weapons to pressure Israel to bring about changee freeee [Applause] [Music] Israel about 12 or so years ago realized having been so close to apartate South Africa the very real threat that BDS posed to the existence of the Israeli State as a racist occupying State and they created a ministerial Department called the department for strategic Affairs specifically to counter the BDS movement and what was the strategy that they hit upon it was to ensure that any criticism of Israel any criticism of its occupation any criticism of its behavior in the occupied territories was made equivalent to anti-Semitism and they have been remarkably successful at doing that there is no other argument than accusing us of anti-Semitism so as to deflect the attention from what matters the most from what our analysis insists upon for decades now I'm not surprised that Israel recurs to any strategies it can to uphold its goals to reach its objectives but I'm surprised that International Community joins this action because today you are not just attacked by Israel for being an anti-semitic if you just ask for the application of international law to Israel Israeli actions it's many many Western countries who do so and they betray also what anti-Semitism has really been The Surge of anti-Semitism in the United States of America and around the world is sickening you know we see it across our communities in schools and colleges and social media they surface painful scars from Millennia to hate of hate to genocide of the Jewish people every time I get accused falsely accused of anti-Semitism I respond I don't stay quiet I don't get intimidated I become louder and louder and by doing so I think I also Inspire other people to do the same I'm Jewish my mother was one of 20 odd survivors of the Holocaust so to describe me as anti-semitic given my history of anti-racism and my work on genocide prevention my invoking of the Holocaust of which my mother's family were victims it's simply an absurdity the so-call Western world is prepared to sacrifice the entire architecture of international law that has been put in place post World War II specifically to prevent there being another genocide like the Holocaust we are prepared to rent all of that aunder so that Israel can continue to murder 247 Palestinians on an average day 48 of whom will be women and 117 of whom will be children we're prepared to throw it all out that's the point of Crisis that our politics are at now and it is up to all of us who recognize that to actually create a counternarrative to the nonsense that is spewed by our politicians to maintain their own place in this appallingly corrupt and malfunctioning political system we have we continue every single day to wake up and insist on freedom and life in the face of genocide and there's simply nothing more dignified that anybody can do in such a hopeless and desperate moment I don't believe it's going to be sustainable to continue to prevent Palestinians from their right to Freedom [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Chinese soldiers preparing for battle. This is what Beijing wants to show the world. With each military drill, China is drawing ever-closer circles around Taiwan. China has a clear goal: to gain control over the island. China will surely be reunified. Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that? Yes. That’s the commitment we made. The United States is building up its military presence in the region. And is practicing how to sink Chinese ships. We're not going to come to an agreement over Taiwan. Wait for the unification to be achieved. Peacefully, I hope. Not peacefully, I dread. But why are these two superpowers so fixated on Taiwan? What's in it for China and the U.S.? And how do people in Taiwan feel about it? It's Taiwan's location that makes it a geopolitical flashpoint. Taiwan has 23 million inhabitants – and its main island lies only 130 km away from China's mainland. These tiny islands right off the coast are also under Taiwanese control. And Chinese military drills around the whole of Taiwan are getting bigger and more frequent. In recent videos released by China's People's Liberation Army, Beijing has threatened to encircle the island. It sees Taiwan as part of its territory and says it's ready to use force, if necessary, to get it back. We'll talk more about the history and Taiwan's status later. For now, you need to know that in the late 1940s, there was a civil war in China between Communists and Nationalists. The Communists won and took control of mainland China. And the Nationalists fled to Taiwan. That laid the groundwork for today's tensions. The U.S. has an ambiguous policy towards Taiwan. Since the late 1970s, it has recognized Communist Beijing as the only legitimate government of China. But it has informal ties with Taiwan and is seen as the island's protector. Okay. Let's go back to the map to understand why the U.S. and China can't quit Taiwan. In some ways, Taiwan's strategic importance is about three chokepoints around the island. To the west, there's the Taiwan Strait. It's a key trade route for both Beijing and Taiwan – and also for everybody else. Almost all the world's biggest container ships pass through here. To the north, the Miyako Strait. It runs between Taiwan and these Japanese islands. And in the south, the Bashi Strait. It runs between Taiwan and the Philippines. For China, these two straits on either side of Taiwan are key strategic gateways to the Pacific Ocean. Taiwan is in the middle of the Chinese coastline, which is very important. This is Victor Gao. He is a former Chinese diplomat and vice-president of the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing think-tank some say is close to the Chinese Communist Party. Taiwan Island faces the Pacific directly, and if Taiwan is occupied by a foreign country, for example, it interrupts the continuity of the Chinese coastline and also prevents the Chinese access directly to the Pacific Ocean. The U.S. says it has no troops permanently stationed in Taiwan but the island plays an important role in U.S. strategy. To understand why, let's look at the military bases in the region. Here are some of China's main naval bases close to its coast. And the U.S. has some of its key bases in South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. If you connect the dots, you'll see the U.S. bases form a chain. Taiwan sits at the heart of what we call in the United States the 'first island chain'. David Sacks is an expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank in New York City. In the past, he worked at the American Institute in Taiwan, which serves as the de facto U.S. embassy on the island. If you look at the first island chain, these are all formal treaty allies of the United States, or close partners, in the case of Taiwan. And with that the way it is, the United States can project power close to China's shores, protect its allies and its interests. Conversely, it's very difficult for the Chinese military to project power outside of the first island chain and threaten the United States physically or our interests in the Indo-Pacific. To strengthen this 'island chain', the U.S. is expanding military cooperation with Japan and the Philippines, which are also wary of what they see as China's expansionist goals. For example, just last year the U.S. gained access to military bases in the north of the Philippines. Right next to the Bashi Strait, one of those Chinese gateways to the Pacific Ocean we mentioned. Here you can see American and Philippine troops conducting exercises in the waters nearby earlier this year. They even sank an old Chinese-built ship that the Philippine navy used in the past: a clear message to Beijing. And obviously, China is not happy about the U.S. 'island chain' strategy. Come on! We are not living in the 19th century. We are not living in the imperialist century. Using this outmoded way of thinking as if you can set up a chain to block, for example, China from accessing the Pacific Ocean, is ludicrous. Beijing is rapidly modernizing its navy, in part to be able to break through the chain of U.S. allies. For example, with the 'Fujian' aircraft carrier. Here it is on sea trials earlier this year. It's China's third aircraft carrier and the biggest ship in the Chinese navy. The number one objective here is to keep the United States out of the region during a conflict. So, what we call 'anti-access/area denial': Prevent the United States from being able to defend our treaty allies and partners. So to sum up: Taiwan's location makes it essential to both sides as they try to gain the upper hand in the region. But the rivalry is also about money. Big money. Economically, the small island also has an outsize importance for both China and the U.S. – even though neither officially recognizes Taiwan as a country. Both China and the U.S. have significant trade links with Taiwan. And much of that business comes from just one company: TSMC – Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. It produces microchips. Taiwan makes 90 % of the most advanced ones in the world. Both the U.S. and China are dependent on them. And so is everybody else. There's a good chance TSMC's semiconductors are in the device that you're using to watch this video right now. They are in new cars, fridges, and fighter jets. Everywhere. They're needed to develop new AI models. And U.S. leaders worry that losing Taiwan to China could permanently shift economic tides against them. We don't assume that a region under Chinese hegemony would be open to U.S. trade and investment. I think that China would reorder the region. They want the United States to basically supply them with raw materials that are turned into manufactured goods in China and then sold all over the world. And there isn't really a role for the United States or other industrialized countries in that. The Chinese economy is already larger than that of the United States if we use purchasing power parity. China produced more than 30 million cars in 2023. The Americans probably produced less than half of that. So why should anyone believe, they can have some benefit of picking a fight with China? No, there is no benefit. China does not look at Taiwan from an economic or commercial perspective. So why is Taiwan so important to Beijing then? To understand, let's dive back into history. China lost control over Taiwan during what it calls the 'Century of Humiliation' – these caricatures of China being carved up by various foreign powers might explain why. From the mid-19th until the mid-20th century, China was plagued by invasions and internal disputes. This is important, because that notion of humiliation still plays a big role in Chinese state ideology even today. In 1895, Japan took Taiwan from China and made it a colony. After World War II, the Allies forced Japan to give it back. But at the time, China was in the middle of a civil war: The government of the Republic of China, or ROC, was led by Nationalists under Chiang Kai-Shek. Mao Zedong led Communist forces against them. In 1949, the victorious Communists marched into Beijing and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland. The defeated government of the Republic of China fled to Taiwan. That's why there are two governments that call themselves 'China': one on the mainland, the People's Republic of China, or PRC. And on Taiwan, the Republic of China, or ROC. The PRC government in Beijing sees Taiwan as a breakaway province and says there is only one China. Even though they have never actually been in charge in Taiwan. Most of the world accepts this One China policy, including the U.S. They don't recognize Taiwan as an independent country. Wait. So why is the U.S. supporting Taiwan then? There is also a history to that. After the Civil War, the U.S. initially saw the Nationalist government in Taiwan as the only real China, rejecting the Communist government on the mainland. U.S. soldiers were even stationed in Taiwan under a common defense pact. The change came in the 1970s. The U.S. sought closer relations with Beijing. That meant closing the U.S. embassy in Taiwan and pulling out U.S. troops. Still, informal ties persisted, like that de facto embassy. And the U.S. still guarantees to sell Taiwan weapons. But they have a deliberately ambiguous policy on whether they would defend Taiwan. It's meant to prevent China from invading and Taiwan from declaring independence. But that strange limbo has been the status quo in Taiwan for decades. And it's created realities on the ground. Taiwan developed from a Nationalist authoritarian regime into one of the strongest democracies in the region. There are elections, a free press, and civil liberties. Taiwan was first in Asia to legalize same-sex-marriage. This year a progressive party was reelected for a third term, vowing to maintain that tense status quo. DW's Taiwan correspondent Yuchen Li can give us a sense of things on the ground. Here in Taiwan, the atmosphere is very different from what you might read in the headlines. The tension has become part of daily life. One key reason is that people in Taiwan have been living under the threat of the Chinese Communist Party for many decades. The majority of the Taiwanese prefer to maintain the status quo with China, but how to do so is a rather polarized debate. If China wants to bully us, at least we still have the U.S. and Japan. They are our friends. I've always been skeptical of America. But we have no choice, if we can't get stronger or have enough forces. It's tricky. We should have a friendly relationship with both of them. It's always been like this. Ever since the founding of the country, we've been caught up in this drama. But one thing is clear for many Taiwanese – Taiwan's voice is usually drowned out. Amid the U.S.-China rivalry, many feel that Taiwan is only 'a pawn' in the game, and no matter what comes next, the island should have the right and autonomy to decide its own fate. But there is one more factor that stands in the way of that. Taiwan represents something for both superpowers. Taiwan has embraced the U.S. worldview, which promotes democracy and capitalism. China is a one-party system and a socialist market economy. And a major Chinese Communist Party narrative centers on Taiwan. Remember the Century of Humiliation we mentioned, when China lost Taiwan? Well Chinese President Xi Jinping sees bringing Taiwan back into the fold as an important step in overcoming that humiliation. This is part of the so-called 'national rejuvenation', a revival of the Chinese nation as a great power. With Xi Jinping, I think, you did see some impatience. Xi Jinping has clearly put himself forward as a leader of, you know, world historic importance. He views himself in a very similar way, I think, to Vladimir Putin, that he's just not a run-of-the-mill leader. He's transformative. No one, no country, no single human being will be able to block the peaceful reunification of China or the non-peaceful reunification of China. So, we should all call on the United States: &quot;Don't play with fire!&quot; But for the U.S., supporting Taiwan also means keeping up key alliances in the region and promoting democracy. If China were to invade and annex Taiwan, we would see that democracy extinguished, and it could send chilling effects to democracies around the world. You would have deep questions being asked in South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines on whether they can rely on the United States for their security. Because of where Taiwan is and what it represents, neither China nor the U.S. isable back down. And the rest of us are stuck watching the superpower rivalry play out." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Good evening and welcome to Washington Week. I want everyone to know that I take the Trump Muk breakup drama seriously. In part because Donald Trump gave his former best friend Elon Musk, access to enormous amounts of secret government data, and there's no predicting what Musk could do with it. But the world at large is in a state of seemingly permanent tumult, and so it's a good time for a general checkup. My guest tonight is Thomas Friedman, a 3-time Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and foreign affairs columnist for The New York Times. Tom, thanks for coming in for our seemingly annual, annual checkup, um, uh, the, uh, I, I, I want to ask you about this Elon Musk, uh, business, um, and maybe we can put it into some serious context. Before I, before we, we jump to that, I want to Read something that my colleague Charlie Warzel writing in The Atlantic this morning had to say, uh, the sun rises every morning. Spring turns to summer, water is wet. Donald Trump and Elon Musk's relationship has ended with a post about Jeffrey Epstein. And then, of course, uh, you know, he, he tweeted, these guys really do escalate quickly. um, Trump, Musk tweeted, time to drop the really big bomb. Real Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have Nice day, DJT, um, So Put this into some kind of context that makes sense for ordinary people. What is going on here? Well, I confess, Jeff, on the way over, I thought you'd asked me about this and the first thing that popped into my mind was the Iran-Iraq war. What do we say about the Iran-Iraq war if only both sides could lose, OK, so, uh, there's no hero in this story. Um, what it really is, is the latest manifestation to me of the central truth of the Trump 2 administration. Trump one was surrounded by buffers. Trump too is surrounded by amplifiers and therefore stuff that used to begin at the Mar a Lago bar and then get muffled in the Oval Office, now goes from the Mar a Lago bar right to the Oval Office, right to you and me, and whether it's what he feels about you know, Musk or his role. He wants him in the government. But to me the whole Musk phenomenon is part of a much deeper and more disturbing phenomenon from an American citizen point of view, which is nothing here is modeled. Nothing here is stress tested. Everything is a riff. The country is being run like the Trump Organization today, not like the United States of America. And so as a result of that, Jeff, there's no second order thinking. All right. What's second order thinking? I'm going to put on tariffs, OK, 10% across the board, including Canada and Mexico, even though I'm violating an agreement I signed with them when I was president last time. Second order thinking is, oh my God, you mean the Ford F-150, only one third of its parts are made in America. Um, and the other 2/3 now are going to be tariff. I will bet any amount of money, no one told him that. And that's true now of everything. And so, you know, for the first trimester of this administration, do you think the 1st 3 months, all of this was kind of entertaining, but now he's running up against a wall. It turns out he can't solve the Russia-Ukraine war overnight. It turns out tariff wars aren't easy to win. It turns out Musk is not going to, you know, do the revolution and the government for. Turns out courts sometimes don't like what you do. So I think the second, you know, uh, 3 months are going to get very interesting as he runs into this reality, and I don't know where it's going to go, but it leaves me disquiet. That's interesting. I was thinking as you were saying this, I was thinking about John Kelly, General John Kelly, being, uh, and along with General Mattis and others being those buffers or filters, uh, there's literally no one in the White House or in the whole system who does anything but amplify. Is that fair to say? I mean, I, I just don't Treasury Secretary, I, I, I just don't see it, you know, I mean, yeah, you hear these stories that the Treasury Secretary had to wait, you know, for, um, uh, one of the other, you know, economic guys that Peter Navarro to be out of the room for him to come in to try to change the tariffs. This is crazy stuff. Now, I happen to be in China, uh, twice in the last 6 months. I've watched a lot of this from China actually and, and when you see it from China, I mean, they say a couple of things. One is, you know, we are never going to put our president in a situation like Zelensky. in the Oval Office where he can be embarrassed, number one, the second thing they say, Jeff, is that this isn't cute. We just saw Donald Trump tear up a trade agreement that Donald Trump made with America's two closest neighbors and allies, Canada and Mexico. What is the value therefore of a trade agreement with him now and um you know, the Chinese, uh, uh, these are, these are you like them or hate them. These are serious people, you know, and they are not spontaneous. No, exactly. So when Trump put 10 47, um, uh, 44% tariff on them, they said, uh, you're talking to me? You talking to me? Do you realize that we control 90% of the rare earths that make the magnets that go in every car you make. Do you realize that? Which he didn't, which is why Ford and GM and Stantis had to announce this week we may actually have to curb some production because we're running out of Chinese magnets. Right. The stay stay with, uh, stay with this Musk question for a minute and, and, and this, this, this, this issue of Musk as a, as a radical isotope in a kind of way. He's been given access to the government secrets across the board in order to cut your government agencies through the Doge operation. Um, that seems like an operational security nightmare if he goes rogue surprising to you? I mean, how, how, where does this, where does this relationship go? Can they bring it back from the brink? Is there anybody who's trying to bring it back from the brink, or is this just more chaos? Well, you know, I think the best way to understand this is not with the analogy of Political science, but world wrestling Federation. And, and those, uh, uh, in World Wrestling Federation, there are breakups and comeback and new teams and whatnot. I put this all in the area of entertainment, you know, not in, in something serious. We're dealing with two extremely unstable characters, but what really is, is more important is what's the wider world audience saying? What's the wider world audience saying? They're saying, you know, for, for all of our lifetime, Jeff, sort of post-war America. If I had an extra $1 and I'm a foreigner, I'm going to put it in America. If I have an extra, you know, brain power and, and a, and a brainy person, I'm gonna study in America. And if I have a little extra dollop of trust, I'm going to trust America. Now you take all three of those things away, and you end up with a, a very different relationship between America and the world. OK, so I have to ask you, and by the way, it's interesting. right? Miami is Miami because it's a safe place for people's money. Harvard is or was Harvard because people want to come from around the world and so on and the United Nations is headquartered in New York, you know, you know, I mean, everybody, for, for a reason. We were the, we were the, we wrote the the rules of the road for the post-war international order. The question is, You're an ally or an adversary, and you're looking at, at, at this, uh, clown show, by the way, on the weekend that marks the 81st anniversary of D-Day, noting just for the record, um, you, you put yourselves in the shoes of an ally and adversary. Are you thinking that this is a midlife crisis America's having a nervous breakdown, or is this some kind of weird terminal illness. I don't know which. All I know is I'm completely disoriented. If I'm an ally and I'm completely disoriented if I'm the foreign affairs columnist for The New York Times because I've never covered this world and you know, um, uh, our friend, you know, Freed Zakaria wrote a book, um, uh, uh, 15 years ago or so called the post-American world, and Fred's book was really about a change in relative power, you know, between that there'll be the rise of Brazil and India and other countries, so we won't have as much power as we had before. What really, if I were writing a book today, Jeff would be called the post-America world. OK, that's what I'm really worried about because America stood for some things. It stood for universal values. It stood for stability. It stood for the rule of law. It was a loyal ally. We were always against the dictator versus the people seeking freedom. What really worries me that at the end of my, you know, career basically. I'm, I'm dealing with the post-America world, America, I grew up and loved and was devoted to and as someone who lived abroad like you have, know how important that America is to the whole world. American ism and stability makes the world go around. You take us out of the equation. It's not like anybody else comes in. I'm sorry. You have, you have a no superpower world, you know, but, but come back to this, is this, do you think that this instability that we're experiencing emotional, political, all the instabilities that we're experiencing. Could it be temporary, or is this Can we not come back? reputationally to start. Well, the thing I'm worried about most is that, and it may seem like a simple thing, but you know, uh Donald Trump came in and he told all the Democrats on the board of the Kennedy Center, you're gone. Now traditionally every president sort of left the other party's people there and then he put in his people. So when you enter into a kind of zero-sum politics now in America. When you fire the head of the NASA, after you appointed him because he made a donation, a tiny donation to a Democrat, you're into a kind of politics that I grew up with in the Middle East. What was that rule or die. OK, you're either in power or zero sum, OK? I'm on top or I'm in and, and so there's a book about African dictators called It's Our Turn to Eat, you know, and we're just gonna eat everything. So then, no, no, if you're a Democrat, and, and guess what, we do have, God willing, if we still have elections, rotations in power, did they come in now and treat all the Republicans in these traditional bipartisan forum, you know, the same way. And if that happens, we're really off to the races and then the whole thing just starts to what country does that remind you of that, you know, you, you, you, you, I mean, so many dictatorships just in general that I've covered over the years. That's what you come in, you wipe out all the other guys' people. Well, that's not how we do things in this country, right, right. Let's talk about a country that's not democratic for a second, um, you know, the, the, I, I want you to watch this. It's the latest analysis by President Trump of the current state of play in in Russia's war against Ukraine, and he's talking about Putin here. He got hit. He's been doing hitting, so I understand it, but he got hit hard. And I don't think he's playing games. I said, President. Maybe you're going to have to keep fighting and suffering a lot because both sides are suffering before you pull them apart before they're able to be pulled apart, but it's a pretty known analogy, you have two kids, they fight, fight, fight. Sometimes you let them fight for a little while. You see it in hockey, you see it in sports. Not Henry Kissinger, but he's trying to impose his own realpolitik understanding of what is he misunderstanding from your perspective, Jeff, do you know how flat out crazy that is. I mean, that's like saying, well, you know, I mean, Hitler in Poland, they fight, they fight, they come back, you know what I mean? Um, yeah, Trump came in and said I can end this war, all right, there's one way to end this war. You say to Vladimir Putin, um, if you don't stop the war, um, uh, and, and we agreed to the ceasefire terms I dictate. We are bringing Ukraine into NATO in 30 days. Which part of that sentence don't you understand? Do you want to mess with me? Test me. That's how you end this war. What you just heard of Donald Trump, that sounds like a commentator on Fox TV. He's not the commentator. He's president of the United States. Well, he hit him and he hit them and he hit this guy invaded a country. He's basically tried to rape a country. That's what Putin did, OK, and the Ukrainians with incredible bravery stood up and defended basically the Western. On something that's very important because if Ukraine were able to join the European Union, Jeff, then you have a Europe that's really whole and free. That's actually a big deal for Europe and for us, and this guy is talking about it like it's some schoolyard fight and they're morally equal. It's nuts and it's, it's disgusting. Right. Is there any issue from a foreign affairs columnist perspective. Is there any issue in which Trump is not transactional. Have you ever seen have you ever seen a sign of a, um, what we would think of as in a bipartisan way, American idealism. Out of Trump? Yeah, um, none comes to mind. What I would say, I, where I thought you might be going is, um, uh, you know, some things are also true even if Donald Trump believes them, and by the way, his transactionalism sometimes can also be an advantage, for instance, I'm glad he's sitting down with the Iranians. Let's see what you got. I'm glad he told the Syrian president, um, uh, I'm gonna give you a reputation to live up to. I didn't mind him talking directly to Hamas. If I can get the hostages out, so there is that. transactional side of him that I think could be an advantage, but it's not grounded in any moral, you know, framework of what we stand for as a country. What we've always stood for if it's just a kind of free floating thing. It becomes very, very dangerous in, in his non-sophisticated analysis of the current state of play, uh, in, in Russian and Ukraine. He didn't really talk about the drone attack that Ukraine launched on Russian. aerial assets deep inside Russia, does that change? This war, um, you know, you know, Joe, I'd say two things, and again, it's part of the craziness of this moment. Let's start at 30,000 ft and then come down to the battlefield at 30,000 ft, you and I are having this discussion on the eve of the greatest technological revolution in human history. We are very close to a birthing a new species, not a new machine, a new artificially intelligent species. Um, and it's going to be with us under sometime, sometime, while Trump is president, it is not going to change one thing, it's going to change everything. We are not talking about that at all. So that's, I would say number one. Under that technological revolution, um, and you know, one of the things they say about AI, it'll actually be mankind's last invention. Because once we invent that, it will invent everything else. That's going to be a big deal under that though, we're seeing a revolution in military affairs. Basically Ukraine spent $20,000 to to knock out, you know, $20 million planes, $20,000 that was probably because they couldn't get Costco online, you know, from Kiev, and they had to buy them from Amazon, you know, um, so the, the, the asymmetric warfare world that we're entering now, um, wow, I mean if you're the US Navy and you're sitting 12 aircraft carriers and you just recovered from the fact that the Houthis, you know, you lost an FA Hornet because you had to swerve your cafeteria in the in the plane fell off the back because you were getting out of way of not a sterling moment naval history because you're avoiding a Houthi missile, a bunch of guys in flip flops, basically, um, in a country that's based water starved, the asymmetry we're going to be dealing with right now, um, uh, I think we have, we, these, these events are really disturbing and and going to require a huge revolution in how we think about military as I'm listening to you about AI, AGI, and, and drone warfare. I, I'm just thinking that the, the, the preoccupation this weekend in America is the emotionally febrile relationship between this ketamine taking billionaire and our reality TV star, president, and it's like there's something that's so deeply unserious about, and I think, I think it's been. two of our country that basically everything became politics. Um, and so we don't have just ESPN now. We have ESPN, you know, sort of politics sports network and it's, it's, it's a testament to the the underlying strength of our country, Jeff, that our economy goes on, we still invent amazing stuff, and we think we can afford this, and, and you know what Jeff, we, we can't afford it until we can, right" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="we can break Donald Trump's trade war with the world into a series of repeating patterns step one make a maximalist threat in a few moments I will sign a historic executive order instituting reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world step two let it simmer to create leverage us tariffs rattling investors sparking dramatic losses global financial markets are tanking again step three pull back that President Trump has announced that there will be a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs and step four no matter the outcome claim a historic win which justifies the cycle we have many meetings planned today and tomorrow and every country wants to be making deals he's the closer he gets deals done that we could never get done this is the art of the trade deal we can use two key US trading partners China and the UK to answer the question does this strategy even work then there's a third case which might suggest maybe the strategy has its limits let me explain donald Trump has a history of finding and taking the most aggressive line possible in attempting to resolve even the most delicate and complex issues rocket Man should have been handled a long time ago this is Donald Trump a few minutes ago i too have a nuclear button but it is a much bigger and more powerful one than his the US will take over the Gaza Strip my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal and we've already started doing it so there's something called the madman theory of politics which is sometimes applied to Donald Trump but originally to Richard Nixon people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook well I'm not a crook i've earned everything I've got yeah that Richard Nixon but before he was swept out of office by the Watergate scandal Nixon's most pressing problem was how to end the Vietnam War and this madman theory was about cultivating an image of Nixon so willing to go to extremes that he would even use nuclear weapons if necessary when Americans are risking their lives in war it is the responsibility of their leaders to take some risks for peace trump has adopted a version of this as step one of his playbook step one starts off by asking for the moon and requesting that the counterparty builds and finances a staircase to the moon so let's consider Trump's approach to China china china china's been ripping this off for many years trump's position is that China cheats at trade that they manipulate their currency unfairly subsidize their industries and maintain artificially low labor standards allowing them to flood global markets with cheap goods no one can compete with so he threatened tariffs the US imposing a 10% tax on all Chinese goods additional 10% a 34% tax additional 50% the total rate of 145% you try to use every single kind of point of leverage that you have against somebody you make very broad demands of people and suggest that you're very firm in these demands that you're not backing down yes step one is all about making it seem like you're ready to go to infinity and beyond and really when you're talking about 145% tariffs they might as well be infinity tariffs tariffs under 50% will tend to squeeze profit margins tariffs above 50% will tend to end all trade and that leads to step two which is to simply wait and watch carnage panic bloodbath doesn't even begin to cut it chinese markets deep in the red now Hong Kong stocks plunged the most in almost three decades china sells more product to the United States than any other country in the world almost half a trillion dollars worth in 2024 alone meaning every single day Americans are buying more than a billion dollar in Chinese goods if that source of revenue dries up well that's real pressure but it's pressure that acts both ways there has been an acknowledgement that this is creating problems with the US economy so we come to step three which has tended to arrive just when things start to look really bad in China's case Trump's tariffs slowed traffic at US shipping ports on the West Coast to an absolute crawl that's lost money and lost jobs businesses unsure whether to stockpile Chinese goods or abandon them altogether they paid the steepest price and China's counter tariffs only added to the worry that this was all making for a very shaky economic future so China and the United States have agreed to drastically reduce tariffs on both sides for a 90day period and this paved the way for step four which is to claim any outcome as a big win even if the only measurable outcome of a trade deal the White House celebrates as historic is a partial roll back of tariffs that Trump had himself initiated and then caused the agreement does include vague language about future talks and cooperation but these are aspirational there are no enforcable commitments no clear timelines not that that matters much especially for those who are predisposed to seeing Trump's actions in a favorable light it's incredible what President Trump has done over the weekend he brokered that IndiaPakistani ceasefire uh he got Zalinsky and Putin to go to the table and then also the US and China trade deal well I've been busy but I've enjoyed it because we're getting things accomplished we're getting things done the pattern often is to do something that makes things dramatically worse for everybody so let's imagine we're at 0 he'll take something and make it 20 and then the thing he declares as a win is something like -5 so it is substantial uh how much they came down with these tariffs at this point and how much they got done this weekend is a massive surprise he's firing on all cylinders maybe we finally get the markets are responding positively to this this trade deal being done it's a framework there's still more negotiation to go but it's a step in the right direction so it's an improvement from where he put the parties but it's actually typically not an improvement from where we started now not all of Trump's trade deals go this way what makes the strategy work is that he does sometimes extract concessions that he probably wouldn't have gotten otherwise let me show you what that looks [Music] like the way Trump defines trading relationships the US currently rips off the UK because it runs a trade surplus with them if it were the other way around Trump would call it unfair and impose tariffs but it's not and Trump imposed tariffs anyway the United States can no longer continue with a policy of unilateral economic surrender among Trump's tariffs that would come to affect UK goods a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum and a 25% tariff on cars which was a particularly big blow considering the number one UK export to the United States is cars the classic bully strategy is you push around the small guys and if you're the United States you know most economies are smaller what Trump knew from the start though is that bullying works so once the threat was made and the economic damage made clear the two sides made a deal this morning I'm thrilled to announce that we've reached a breakthrough trade deal with the United Kingdom credible country and it was more than a breakthrough according to the White House this was once again historic a great deal for America the deal was certainly lopsided the United States main concession was simply to undo some of the tariffs Trump had just imposed the universal 10% tariff on UK goods that would stay in effect but the tariff on cars and the tariff on steel and aluminum would largely be dropped or at least reconsidered the design is other countries come here offer concessions and we decide whether they're acceptable or not and then the US concession is that we won't do what we threaten to do so this was a great deal in the same way give me your wallet or I'll shoot you is a great deal if you're mugging someone and the wallet in this case is what the White House refers to as a $5 billion opportunity created by the UK granting American ethanol and cattle farmers higher sales quotas and lower tariff rates basically more market access for American companies but let's be clear even the White House is careful to call this only an opportunity because access is not the same thing as a sale what the UK didn't change for example are its strict food safety standards which have kept American chlorine washed chicken and hormone treated beef out of British markets so American industry players are pretty cautious calling the so-called historic deal an important first step in expanding markets but also acknowledging more work is needed to remove the arbitrary barriers that have excluded American grown food from grocery stores in the UK and so here's the prevailing takeaway though hailed by the leaders of the two countries as significant analysts said it did not appear to meaningfully alter the terms of trade between the countries as they stood before the changes introduced by Trump this year meaning this is no trade deal there just isn't enough in it to call it that at best it's a framework for a deal among industries that don't even form a major basis for US UK trade to begin with us agriculture products um ethanol American beef those aren't big imports for the UK these aren't like major big ticket items that are really going to have a large-scale effect on the US economy these are the things that we can point to as being legitimate concessions that don't really make a whole lot of a difference [Music] at this stage I should state something pretty plainly that my point here isn't to show you how little Trump has accomplished because his administration can and does argue the exact opposite they all want to make a deal because we have something that they all want but what I think I can show you is how steep a price the US may pay for whatever it is Trump believes he has accomplished markets are tumbling as investors are really digesting worse than expected tariffs wall Street reacted with fear and pessimism we know Trump's tariffs imposed on nearly every single country in the world caused the American stock market to suddenly lose trillions of dollars in value and we know this is both a symptom and a cause of an awful lot of economic uncertainty with the profit outlook dimming what firms will do is they'll start layoffs or some costcutting measure they're certainly not going to expand and add that new fleet of trucks or that new warehouse and that too will bleed into the real life economy of everyday people but there's also an additional cost one that you can't easily measure in dollars and cents at least not right away the notion that you take a single issue and anchor in a kind of take it or leave it way um in a bullying kind of way to extract a few concessions falls apart and the reason why it falls apart is what it does is it eviscerates trust what does he mean by that well consider for a moment how America's closest ally now appears to see things when one polling firm asked Canadians in February how they viewed the US nearly a third saw it as an enemy that was nearly on par with the number of people who saw it as a friend and it's worth just pausing on that for a moment because that is an extraordinarily harsh judgment on Americans in a relationship that arguably spent the next several months getting worse we know now that feeling has had an impact on how Canadians shop how Canadians travel and where this country's leaders look for long-term relationships our old relationship based on steadily increasing integration is over consider once again the UK they just agreed to a free trade deal with India one of the biggest tariff reductions slashing Indian taxes on British cars from 100% down to 10 which gives the UK a potential alternative to the US for one of its most important exports and consider the case of China which was forced to pivot after Trump's first term i am the chosen one somebody had to do it so I'm taking on China over the last several years China forged stronger economic ties with countries like Japan South Korea and Australia as the number one buyer of soybeans worldwide it buys more today from Brazil than it ever has and its imports from the US have dropped significantly it is China not the US who is right now the largest trading partner of most countries on planet Earth and I think that in the long term there is that risk to the United States of America that the other countries are going to realize US is no longer magnanimous is quite mechavelian it's quite transactional and so the rest of the world has to reorient as well and act accordingly when you are at war inconsistency chaos surprise attacks are exactly what you want but when someone is your business partner are they people who are arbitrary capricious and random there's no question on some level what Donald Trump does just works the US has unquestionable leverage constantly using it keeps Trump at the center of attention and his supporters admire that show of strength even when the results are fuzzy but experts tell us Trump also risks sending the world a message that undercuts and erodess the very thing he relies on the signal the US is sending is that we're no longer a reliable economic partner and if that signal were to get louder and take hold in a more permanent way the world might inch closer to a very different future one that doesn't always revolve around the United States [Music]" />

IT IS LEGAL AND TRUMP ACKNOWLEDGED USING IT HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; ONLY FOR VERY UNIMPORTANT PAPERS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: HE WAS PRESSED IF HE UNCOVERED EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING SIGNED WITHOUT BIDEN'S KNOWLEDGE. &gt;&gt; BUT NO. I UNCOVERED THE HUMAN MIND. I WAS IN A DEBATE WITH THE HUMAN MIND AND I DIDN'T THINK HE KNEW WHAT THE HELL HE WAS DOING. &gt;&gt; Reporter: BIDEN BRUSHED OFF SCRUTINY OF MENTAL COMPETENCE WHILE IN OFFICE. OVERNIGHT THE FORMER PRESIDENT BLASTING THE INQUIRY AS A DISTRACTION. LET ME BE CLEAR, I MADE THE DECISIONS DURING MY PRESIDENCY. ANY DECISION I DIDN'T IS RIDICULOUS AND FALSE.

THE SESSIONS COULD LAST UP TO 30 HOURS AND ALWAYS WITH DRUGS INCLUDING ECTASSY AND KETAMINE. DURING THE RELATIONSHIP WHICH STARTED IN 2021 AND ENDED WHEN THE MUSIC MOGUL WAS ARRESTED HE SUPPORTED HER AND WIRED HER TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. COMBS PLEADED IN THE TO SEX TRAFFICKING AND RACKETEERING. IN COURT A DRAMATIC MOMENT PLAYED OUT AS THE JURY WAS EXCUSED FOR LUNCH. THE JUDGE TURNING TO THE DEFENSE TEAM SAYING I WAS CLEAR THERE SHOULD BE NO FACIAL EXPRESSIONS TO THE JURY. COMBS WAS NODDING AND LOOKING AT THE JURY DURING THE CROSS-EXAMINATION OF THE WITNESS. THE JUDGE SAYING IF IT HAPPENED AGAIN HE WOULD CONSIDER REMOVING COMBS FROM THE COURTROOM ALL TOGETHER. SHE COULD BE ON THE STAND FOR DAYS. PROSECUTORS SAY SHE WAS COERCED WITH DRUGS, LIES, THREATS TO TAKE PART IN COMBS' SEX PARTIES. &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE GOSK FOR US.

SOMETIMES YOU ARE BETTER OFF LETTING THEM FIGHT FOR A WHILE AND PULLING THEM APART. &gt;&gt; Reporter: PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID PUTIN TOLD HIM HE WOULD RETALIATE AGAINST UKRAINE FORS IT OVERT DRONE ATTACK ON RUSSIAN BOMBERS. TRUMP SAYING HE ASKED PUTIN NOT TO. NEW IMAGES SHOW TWO VALUABLE RUSSIAN SPY PLANES TARGETED AND POSSIBLY DAMAGED. THE DRONE BELTED OFF OF THE PLANE'S RADAR AND RUSSIAN BOMBERS ARE ON FIRE AND RARE ACCESS TO THE TURKISH DRONE MANUFACTURER SUPPLYING UKRAINE. THEY SAY DRONES ARE CHANGING WARS AND STRENGTHENING THE UNDERDOG. &gt;&gt; IT HAS GIVEN NATIONS AN EDGE THEY WOULD HAVE NEVER HAD. &gt;&gt; THE WAR HAS COST RUSSIA ALMOST 1 MILLION CASUALTIES. UKRAINE'S NUMBER, 400,000 SOLDIERS. TOM. &gt;&gt; BACK HERE AT HOME TO OUR SERIES THE COST OF DENIAL. THE FRUSTRATION KNOWN AS GHOST NETWORKS. WHEN PATIENTS CALL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS LISTED IN THE INSURANCE COMPANY'S NETWORK ONLY TO FIND A ROADBLOCK AFTER ANOTHER. &gt;&gt; GUY AND MICHELLE ARE BATTLING A SYSTEM THAT IS FAILING THEIR SON. HOW MANY HOURS A WEEK DO YOU SPEND FIGHTING FOR YOUR SON'S CARE? &gt;&gt; DEPENDING ON THE WEEK 10 TO 15 HOURS A WEEK. APPEAL AFTER APPEAL. PHONE CALL AFTER PHONE CALL. &gt;&gt; Reporter: LITTLE GUY AS THEY CALL HIM HAS AUTISM AND NEEDS MULTIPLE THERAPIES. &gt;&gt; WE THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, IT HAS TO BE COVERED UNDER INSURANCE. &gt;&gt; IT WILL BE PIVOTAL FOR HIS LIFE. LIKE A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF LIFE THAT HE WOULD HAVE IF HE GETS THE CARE RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; AS MICHELLE SHOWED US TRYING TO FIND THAT CARE SPENT HOURS ON THE PHONE, WRONG NUMBERS, INCORRECT INFORMATION AND WAIT LISTS OF SIX MONTHS OR MORE. WE TRIED TOO. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLGIST UNDER PEDIATRICS. THIS IS THE CURRENT NUMBER LISTED. MAKING CALL AFTER CALL TO NETWORK PROVIDERS LISTED BY HER INSURER AND FROM BLUECROSS BLUESHIELD. &gt;&gt; YOUR CALL CANNOT BE COMPLETED AS DIALED. &gt;&gt; Reporter: OUT OF SIX PROVIDERS ON THE LIST ONLY ONE COULD MAKE AN APPOINTMENT IN A MONTH. THE OTHER FIVE HAD NON-WORKING LANGUAGE OR WENT LIKE THIS. &gt;&gt; ARE THEY OFFERING PEDIATRICS. &gt;&gt; NO, MA'AM. &gt;&gt; Reporter: HAS THAT BEEN THE CASE ALWAYS? &gt;&gt; SINCE THE PRACTICE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. &gt;&gt; Reporter: FOLLOW UP CALLS MADE BY &quot;NIGHTLY NEWS&quot; FOUND OUT OF 21 SERVICE PROVIDERS LISTED 20 DIDN'T TAKE PATIENTS GUY'S AGE OR HAD NO AVAILABILITY FOR MONTHS. IT IS SUCH A COMMON PROBLEM THERE IS A TERM FOR IT, GHOST NETWORKS. INSURANCE COMPANIES SHOW A ROBUST LIST OF PROVIDERS ON PAPER, BUT NOT IN PRACTICE. WHEN BLUECROSS BLUESHIELD DECLINED TO BE INTERVIEWED BUT SAID IT IS WORKING WITH THE FAMILY TO ADDRESS GUY'S NEEDS AND THAT THE NETWORK MEETS REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED UNDER STATE LAW. BECAUSE OF THE SPECIALIZED SERVICES A NUMBER OF THE PROVIDERS IN THE AREA ARE BOOKED AND IT CAN BE ING TO GET APPOINTMENTS IMMEDIATELY. &gt;&gt; IT IS INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING. THERE IS NOBODY HERE THAT CAN HELP. &gt;&gt; Reporter: GHOST NETWORKS EXIST NATIONWIDE. A NEW STUDY BY THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE FOUND 86% OF THE LISTED IN-NETWORK MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS STAFF CALLED WERE GHOSTS. &gt;&gt; IF YOU PUT OFF GETTING CARE THE DIAGNOSIS IS BEING DELAYED. THAT IS DANGEROUS TO THE PATIENT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THEIR ATTORNEY FILED TWO CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AGAINST GHOST NETWORKS AND ONE AGAINST BLUECROSS BLUESHIELD WHICH MOVED TO DISMISS. &gt;&gt; WE WANT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO ACT RESPONSIBLY AND GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER TO HAVE ACCURATE LISTS. &gt;&gt; Tom: GUY IS NOW TWO. MICHELLE SAYS HE IS SHOWING SIGNS OF PROGRESS AND RECEIVING THE CARE HE NEEDS. PAID FOR THROUGH SEVERAL OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS. &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT GOING TO STAND FOR IT. NOT FOR GUY. &gt;&gt; FOR THE VIEWERS AT HOME, IF THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN A GHOST NETWORK SITUATION, WHAT SHOULD THEY DO? &gt;&gt; FIRST, GET THE CARE THAT YOU NEED AND THEN GO BACK TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND FILE FOR AN EXEMPTION OR APPEAL IF YOU HAVE TO SEEK CARE FROM AN OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDER AND REPORT THE GHOST NETWORK TO THE STATE'S DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE SO THAT THEY CAN INVESTIGATE. TOM. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR THAT. IN 90 SECONDS WHY SOME OF THE WORST AIR IN THE WORLD WAS IN THE MIDWEST TODAY. NEW CLUES IN TO LUIGI MANGIONE'S &gt;&gt;&gt; STUNNING NEW DETAILS IN THE LUIGI MANGIONE CASE. IN COURT DOCUMENTS PROSECUTORS UNVEILING HANDWRITTEN DIARY ENTRIES MADE BY MANGIONE IN THE MONTHS LEADING UP TO THE MURDER OF UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO BRYAN THOMPSON. &gt;&gt; Reporter: TONIGHT THE SHOCK OF LAST WINTER'S MIDTOWN MURDER OF UNITEDHEALTHCARE CEO BRYAN THOMPSON GAINING NEW CONTEXT AS WRITINGS AND A LETTER TO THE FBI THEY SAY WERE COMPOSED BY THE MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING HIM, LUIGI MANGIONE. TO SAVE YOU A LENGTHY INVESTIGATION, I WASN'T WORKING WITH ANYONE. I APOLOGIZE FOR STRIFE OR TRAUMA BUT IT HAD TO BE DONE. IN AN ENTRY DATED A MONTH AND A HALF BEFORE THE KILLINGS MANGIONE ALLEGEDLY WRITES SAY YOU WANT TO REBEL AGAINST THE DEADLY GREED-FUELED HEALTH INSURANCE CARTEL. DO YOU BOMB THE HQ, NO. BOMBS EQUAL TERRORISM. BUT ONE SHOULD WHACK THE CEO ADDING IT IS TARGETED, PRECISE AND DOES NOT RISK INNOCENCE. THE POINT IS -EVIDENT IN THE NEWS HEADLINES. &gt;&gt; HOW MUCH INFLUENCE DO YOU THINK THE LATEST REVELATIONS WILL HAVE ON THE OUTCOME OF THE CASE? &gt;&gt; IT ABSOLUTELY A WIN FOR THE PROSECUTION. THEY WERE HANDED SOMETHING TO GIVE AN AVENUE THEY WERE ABLE TO PURSUE A TOP COUNT CONVICTION FOR TERRORISM ON THE MURDER CHARGE. &gt;&gt; THE DEFENSE CLAIMING AUTHORITIES HAVE PREJUDICED MR. MANGIONE IN THE MEDIA MORE THAN ANY DEFENDANT IN RECENT MEMORY. NO COMMENT FROM UNITEDHEALTHCARE AND MANGIONE'S LEGAL TEAM. &gt;&gt; UP NEXT, A WARNING ABOU &gt;&gt;&gt; WE ARE BACK &gt;&gt; WE ARE BACK WITH CODE RED AIR ALERTS IN THE MIDWEST. THAT IS CHICAGO WITH EXTREMELY HAZY SKIES AFTER WILDFIRE SMOKE FLEW IN FROM CANADA. TODAY CHICAGO AND DETROIT RANKED IN TOP FIVE CITIES WITH THE WORST AIR QUALITY ON THE PLANET. TAKE A LOOK AT THE HUGE FIRE AT A BUS FACILITY IN PHILADELPHIA. THE FLAMES SPREAD TO 40 BUSES SENDING THICK SMOKE INTO THE AIR. IT IS STILL UNCLEAR HOW IT STARTED. OVERSEAS, A TERRIFYING MOMENT IN BALI WHEN THE BOAT SANK AFTER IT DROPPED OFF AND PICKED UP PASSENGERS AND SUDDENLY A LARGE WAVE HIT IT AFTER IT RELEASED THE ANCHOR. THE COMMUNITY HELPED AND JUMPED IN TO GET EVERYBODY OFF. A NEW WARNING ABOUT WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS AND HOW THEY MIGHT IMPACT PREGNANT WOMEN. IT IS UNCLEAR IF DRUGS LIKE OZEMPIC AND WEGOVY MIGHT HARM UNBORN BABIES DURING PREGNANCY. WHEN WE COME BACK WE WILL TELL YOU WHAT IT MEANS TO LIVE LIKE BRAUN. IS&gt;&gt;&gt; FINALLY TONIGHT, A STORY OF HOPE AFTER A TRAGIC LOSS. IF YOU HEARD SOMEONE SAY LIVE B BEHIND THE MANTRA. AS THE FIRES TORE THROUGH THE PACIFIC PALISADES, THE LEVY FAMILY RUSHED TO THEIR HOME TO FIND IT ENGULFED IN FLAMES. EVERYTHING THEY OWNED WOULD BURN TO THE GROUND. THE FAMILY'S 18-YEAR-OLD SON, BRAUN, JUMPING IN TO ACTION AND STARTING A SUPPORT GROUP FOR CLASSMATES THAT LOST THEIR HOMES. &gt;&gt; HE NEVER FELT THE SADNESS OR BAD FOR HIMSELF. HE WENT IN TO ACTION. THAT WAS LIVING LIKE BRAUN. ACTION. &gt;&gt; FOR BRAUN, GIVING WAS LIVING, TRAVELING TO COUNTRIES IN AFRICA AND SOUTH AMERICA WITH HIS FAMILY AND WORKING WITH KIDS WHO HAD BARELY ENOUGH TO SURVIVE. &gt;&gt; KIDS GRAVITATED TOWARDS HIM. HE HAD A WAY OF MAKING PEOPLE HAPPY IN ANY SITUATION. &gt;&gt; Reporter: BRAUN WAS WALKING HOME AND AN ALLEGED DRUNK DRIVER CRASHED RIGHT INTO HAD HIM TAKING HIM FROM HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU PRAY OR TALK TO YOUR SON, BUT IF YOU DO IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN SHARE ABOUT WHAT YOU TELL HIM OR WHAT YOU WANT HIM TO KNOW? &gt;&gt; I TELL HIM ALL OF THE TIME HOW MUCH I LOVE HIM. I TELL HIM HOW MUCH THAT I LOVE HIM AND MISS HIM. &gt;&gt; I LOVE YOU FOREVER. &gt;&gt; SOMEHOW THE LEVYS HAVE CARRIED ON, URGING LOVED ONES TO KEEP THE SON'S MEMORY ALIVE BY ENCOURAGING THEM TO LIVE LIKE BRAUN. SINCE THE PASSING THE LIVE LIKE BRAUN MOVEMENT RAISED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN JUST ONE WEEK, CREATING SCHOLARSHIPS AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS WHO LIVED THE LIFE OF GIVING. &gt;&gt; HE HAS A FULL LIFE AND SUCH A BIG IMPACT ON SO MANY PEOPLE. THAT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE IT WASN'T A LIFE TOTALLY NOT WORTH LIVING. &gt;&gt; LIVE LIKE BRAUN. THAT IS &quot;NIGHTLY NEWS&quot; FOR THIS THURSDAY. REMEMBER, TONIGHT AND ALWAYS WE'RE HERE FOR YOU." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="welcome welcome one and all you beautiful people to the late show i am your host Steven Colbear my fellow Americans my fellow Americans and all the ships at sea I hope you've stocked your family shelter with portable water and dehydrated turkey chili because ladies and gentlemen a full-scale flame war has broken out between the world's most famous besties Donald Trump and Elon Musk or as they're known by their celebrity couple name two huge Jagovs here's where we stand anything new anything you guys heard anything anything new keep me up to date here's where we stand musk spent all day yesterday slamming Trump's big beautiful bill to his 200 million followers on Twitter what's most impressive only half of those are his kids now Trump here's the thing this is very This is I was impressed by this trump held his return fire until today in a press conference with German Chancellor Gard Knockver i don't know Jim Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate and you know which was a lot of money for electric vehicles and uh you know they're having a hard time the electric vehicles i'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here he said the most beautiful things about me and he hasn't said bad about me personally but I'm sure that'll be next but I'm I'm very disappointed in Elon i've helped Elon a lot yes I've helped him a lot i've helped I've No it's true i've helped Elon a lot during the campaign and I helped him declutter his bank account of 288 million dusty dollars he would hand me every dollar i would hold it and I would say &quot;This one sparks joy.&quot; And in the pocket in the pocket it goes safe and sound with daddy musk was clearly stung by the crack about electric vehicles so he immediately fired back live tweeting &quot;Without me Trump would have lost the election.&quot; and Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 5149 in the Senate yeah you think we've forgotten that buddy buddy have you been to a Tesla dealership lately cuz nobody else has now as soon as Trump was done meeting with Chancellor Brownfiger he he clapped back elon was wearing thin i asked him to leave i took away his EV mandate that forced everyone to buy electric cars that nobody else wanted that he knew for months I was going to do and he just went crazy i'm sorry went crazy elon has always lived the geographic center of insanitude he's not the mayor of crazy town he's the governor of off his Medania also also also I want to point out he says that nobody wanted electric vehicles when Trump himself sold them on the lawn of the White House this is knowing no one wanted them in fact in fact CNN pointed out that Trump himself bought a Tesla that day and it's still parked there at the White House so now Donald Trump is a Tesla owner who hates Elon Musk he's never been more relatable i can't believe it game sees game next Trump escalated the by threatening Musk the easiest way to save money in our budget billions and billions of dollars is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts i was always surprised Biden didn't do it to which to which Elon Musk replied &quot;Go ahead make my day.&quot; Oh you two have already made mine cutting Elon Musk's contracts with the government isn't just petty it's dangerous because as one user pointed out the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft transports astronauts to and from the International Space Station so Elon snarked &quot;In light of the president's statements about cancellation of my government contracts SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.&quot; Okay okay okay so to any astronauts currently in orbit don't get too attached to your current bone density then then I got to say I got to say Yeah you got to say it elon gave us a fun one time to drop the really big bomb donald Trump is in the Epstein files that's the real reason they have not been made public have a nice day DJT oh oh them oh oh oh oh i mean is is is this Twitter war a cheesy gordita crunch wrap supreme because it's dripping hot messy filth and I am eating up every sloppy bite bring it daddy like but by the way Elon a little late on that intel donald Trump was a sexual predator that prayed on young women which is something I've only decided to tell you because he hurt my feelings i am the hero of the story wow trump's going to have to get one of those bumper stickers for his Tesla that says &quot;I bought this before Elon told everyone I was on Epstein's plane.&quot; So let's recap sounds good let us come let us recap together the most powerful man in the world and the richest man in the world each with their own missiles are throwing hay makers at each other like real housewives on the girls trip this this this this could easily get out of control but thankfully a cooler head has stepped in to calm things down kanye tweeted &quot;Bro please no hug emoji we love you both so much.&quot; Yay yay has entered the chat it's Kanye Elon and Trump the easiest game of Mary kill ever cuz cuz obviously I'd kill myself you know you know things are bad when the rational voice mediating your dispute is Kanye West that's like walking into an intervention organized by Captain [Applause] Morgan keep drinking people like you more when you're a little spicy so then I need like a sponge bath at this point i need a towel then as if things couldn't get any juicier Elon Musk retweeted &quot;Trump should be impeached.&quot; That thunder is that thunder oh my Oh oh my sweet lord i I agree with Elon Musk siri what is the current temperature of hell working on it okay but I got to say Elon damn man you were best friends with the guy last Friday did that meaningless key he gave you mean nothing you know what you know what you know what folks i'm just glad Jeff Epstein isn't alive to see any of this would have broken his heart on the sidelines on the sideline steve Bannon has weighed in saying Elon Musk should be deported by Homeland Security okay that's that's that's you knew that was coming i guess you knew that was coming though they are a bit short staffed over there short because many of them are still growing we just learned the Department of Homeland Security's new official overseeing terrorism prevention is a 22year-old 22 how could he possibly know how to stop terrorism when he doesn't even know how to fix a cassette tape with a pencil that's a skill reserved for those of us whose birth year begins with a 19 now this this bull work of national security who I believe cannot legally rent a car yet is Thomas Fugate a former Trump campaign worker who once worked at the Hardright Heritage Foundation where he served as an intern hear that terrorists you mess with him and he will refuse to pick up your dry cleaning on the way to Starbucks fisher macchiato goodbye let's take You know what let's be fair yeah let's Let's take a look at this little fella oh boy okay ter terrorists terrorists cover your drinks now it would be it would be understandable if the idea of a young adult still on his parents' health insurance being in charge of stopping terrorism unnerves you but some folks uh in the news some real news folks found his LinkedIn and he has worked at okay internship uh internship uh another internship and oh landscape business owner okay well that's entrepreneurial what was his portfolio performed lawn care work around my neighborhood my duties consisted of mowing the yard weed whacking the weeds then clean up of debris you mowed your neighbor's lawn you damn fetus you know you know what you know what i'm pretty sure we actually have a picture of your White House interview is that We got a great show for you tonight our guests our CEO of Reo and the creator of Andor Tony Gilwood and when we come back New York [Applause] [Music] [Applause]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="let's fast forward back into well not the present where Sykes and Pico are are drawing with their crayon on a handkerchief so tell us tell us more specifics about about the the borders they decided to to create and why they why they did it in that way okay so there there's a couple of things going on one of them is oil they know there's oil there you got to remember that the British Empire is a naval imp everything is based on ships so if you're going to have oil powerered ships and you don't have access to oil your Empire is finished so they're freaking out when Royal Dutch buys shell there was really only one other major oil corporation on the planet at the time and it was Standard Oil and that was that of course belonged to the United States and so there basically there were these two big oil companies and the British didn't own either one of them now having said that the British had a great relationship with the Netherlands and and the British had a great relationship with the United States so it wasn't like they were owned by two rival States it wasn't like it was France and Germany that owned the oil companies it just that the British were concerned what if something down the road changes or shifts you know there's a bad election in United States or the Dutch decide they're more German and they want to go that direction and so the British decide they have to have their own oil resource so the way they the you know the way you look for oil back then was you walked staring at the ground and you were hoping to find like black Shale or black sandstone a porous rock that that you know like a sponge because if it's sitting on top of an oil field it'll literally suck the oil into it and turn black or because there was so much oil on the planet at time you could literally step in a puddle of oil and then that would be a big indication that there was oil um when the United States found oil in in Pennsylvania they found it at a place called oil Creek in other words there was a really big hint there was probably oil there and the reason the creek got named oil is the creek was cutting through the oil field and then oil floats so there was this Sheen oil on top of the creek and they like ah I bet there's oil here let's dig so you right that was how you found oil you just mostly you kept your eyes open but the problem is the planet is huge and so even though the British Empire own a giant chunk of the planet the idea of sending out armies of people to look at their feet and comb the whole planet to look for oil seemed daunting so the British decided to do something really extraordinary read history books and look for conversations about oil in the history books and they they found those conversations about oil in the Middle East um a thousand years ago the cities in the Middle East lit up their streets at night using oil using petroleum um the the the Roman Empire had in the seventh century and then again in the eth century were using flamethrowers using petroleum to fight the Arabs um at one point Arab armies carried around glass balls with a wick in it and inside it was oil and they would light them and throw them like little naal hang grenades uh Na that was the the name of the soldiers so uh the British knew there was oil they just didn't know where and so they moved in grabbed Kuwait by this point the British already had a presence in the Persian Gulf the Arabian Gulf um and that was in the United Arab Emirates they created the tral coast um they had already established a relationship with Oman so grabbing was just taking a chunk of land away from the the Ottoman Empire and and and basically creating a base with the idea of looking for oil in southern Iraq or in Iran they made a deal with the Persian government and the deal was amazing they got 86% concession so normally when you make a deal like that you get a 50/50 right you're the British company you're doing the work but it's you know it's the Iranian oil so they should get their share 5050 is pretty normal but the G the rulers of Iran were really how should we say into opium eager to get that British opium more than they were eager to advance their country and so the British got this really amazing concession from them and uh that began to shape the way they thought about oil I'm sorry thought about the Middle East having said that they found oil I'm pretty sure the Anglo Persian oil company found oil in like 1908 we should double check my date um so the short after they get the concession they find it shortly after they find it in Iran the Ottoman Empire finds it in what is today Northern Iraq and the British are eager to get a deal with the Ottoman Empire for that oil but the Ottomans decide that Germany is their future and so the the Turks make a deal with the Germans and of course in that moment the British are thinking okay the Ottoman Empire is you know we have to destroy it Germany can't have this oil Germany can't uh have this kind of access to oil and the reason is quite simply that they were worried that the German Navy was going to eventually eclipse the British Navy and the British and the Germans were in a an arms race every time the Germans built a ship the British would build two ships and that would force the Germans to build another ship to try to cancel the two ships the British just built which would then force the British to build two new ships and they were bankrupting each other at the at the rate that they were building ships it was inevitable that both economies were going to collapse and that's one of the reasons why World War I had to happen the they had to they had to just resolve the arms race one way or another somebody just simply had to to come out on top and of course the British come out on top the there is nothing wrong or evil about what the Germans did any more than what the British or the French did in World War I they're not the bad guys they were all bad right it was just a bunch of evil States attacking each other it's not like World War II where it's easy to sort of lay blame on the Germans in any case Sykes and Pico get together because they want to talk about what the future is and that future will not include an Automan Empire the British and the French had decided that they were simply going to take out the Ottoman Empire it didn't hurt any that uh there's an Arab Uprising and the Arabs are actually in the act of defeating the Ottomans because they're trying to break away and create their own independent state um and so the British and the French well the British really not the French assist the Arab uprising but not because they cared about Arab aspirations but because an enemy of an enemy is a friend um and then their their first goal of course was to undermine that Arab State and they did they successfully undermined it that Arab state did exist briefly its capital was Damascus um it had a flag shockingly similar to the Jordanian and Palestinian flag uh the stripes were weren't the exact order right it wasn't uh black white uh green it was if I remember green black green white but almost the exact same flag um and there that's where the jordanians and the Palestinians got their flag it was inspired by that Arab that first attempt at creating an United Arab state from from Syria in any case Sy and Pico before that Arab State existed before World War I is resolved are sitting down and talking about how they're going to carve up the Middle East when they made the plan there was still a Russian Empire so GRE the Italian Empire the Russian Empire the British Empire and the French Empire were going to be the participants in this giant carve up event so one one piece that needed to be carved up was the Ottoman Empire they were going to leave a piece behind that was going to become turkey but they were going to give a big piece to Italy in the South so antalia area that was going to go to Italy in the West ismir Was going to go to Greece so the Greeks were going to have the western shore of what is today turkey um and then the French were going to end up with Syria Lebanon and what is today Iraq the English were only going to take what is today Palestine Israel and Jordan um and the reason why the British were okay with that is then the French would get the oil that was in Iraq because the British were planning to get the oil that was in Iran the Russian Empire was going to invade Iran take the northern half of Iran and the British Empire was going to invade and take the southern half and that would get them access to oil that they could feel secure with the Russians though during World War I decide they're going to go communist have the Bolshevik Revolution and declare that they're no longer they no longer have imperialist aspirations and that they won't work with capitalists anymore and the British Empire realizes if there's no Russia to invade Iran from the north there's no way the British can manage Iran by themselves they need to divide and conquer they can't do it just conquering so the British ta have the French and take Iraq and they they're like you know we're sorry but we need to secure our oil fields you guys just have to figure it out on your own why do the French just agree to that the the French were in such awful shape at the end of World War I um the British Empire was the hegemonic superpower France was in Number the number two slot I think that at that point the French were just grateful that the British were willing to even cut them in because the French had nothing to do with the destruction of the Ottoman Empire it was the uh the the Arab uprising the British did do the invasion at galipoli but that also didn't right the the Turks won at galipoli it's okay though because the British were using Australians and nobody loves Australians so you know they're they're it's amazing that the British I like that but they are it's it's really amazing in any case uh the I think the French were just happy to have anything at that point they were grateful also they they will figure out eventually it's too late for them but but there is oil in Northern Syria it was nothing like what was in Iraq so they were probably hoping that they'd find something okay and what happens with Egypt and and Saudi Arabia okay so um Egypt had a different trajectory in 1798 Napoleon bonapart invades Egypt and after securing Egypt he actually invaded Palestine and his goal was to uh move the Jewish population out of France to Palestine he wanted to to uh ethnically cleanse the Jewish population from Europe and you know people see it as oh he loved the Jewish people well if you Lov them so much why didn't he want them to stay in France he clearly didn't love them as much as I think some people think um and any case Napoleon is defeated the British sink his Navy uh they catch his Navy in a in a bay and sink it and it's a disaster and the French have to escape Egypt and you know Napoleon was thinking he was going to basically to China he was going to he was going to start this new massive Empire with Egypt as his base of operations and the British ruin it for him so he decides you know okay I'll just conquer Europe so he Retreats back to France what what that did though was it inspired somebody so there was an Albanian General who was part of the Ottoman Army his name was mhmed Ali or Muhammad Ali depending on whether you're an Arab or a Turk he was an Albanian so I I guess we should ask the Albanian is what they say um he goes wow what Napoleon did was actually really cool I bet I could do something like that myself he takes his ottoman Army that he's in command of that he invades creit takes it over and then waits for the ottoman arire to respond it doesn't and then he's like well let's go and he invades Egypt conquers Egypt and then he takes his army into Palestine goes up through Syria and he actually invades what is today turkey before the the Ottoman Empire goes whoa what are you doing please stop right he's just an ottoman General who goes Rogue he didn't speak any Arabic um he knew Turkish and Albanian his soldiers mostly speak Turkish and Albanian you know like this is this is such an odd thing to be doing but this is what he does he's he's a Visionary and he thinks in Grand terms he negotiates out a deal with the Ottoman Empire where he'll give back a bunch of Syria and turkey in exchange he'll become basically the governor of an autonomous Egypt and he starts a whole dynasty of kings of Egypt that are they didn't take the title initially but you know it's effectively what they became um who are going to be the governors of a semi-autonomous Egypt and to to mix the two histories the SS the Saud the Saudi family had actually created a state so if you look it up it's the first Saudi state in the 1700s that Saudi State lasted something like 80 years years what happened was their Capital was DEA which is right next to Riad um in 1818 the Ottoman Empire was really upset with this first Saudi State because it it had become quite large it conquered what is today the UAE it had Bahrain uh it had essentially all of what is today Saudi Arabia and that was at the expense to some degree of the Ottoman Empire not all of that land was Ottoman territory but a bunch of it was and so the Ottoman Empire asked mhmed Ali basically for uh a favor and they said you know uh technically you're part of the Empire can you go put down this the Saudi State and he does he takes an army into Saudi this the first Saudi State he goes to daa he destroys Dura and the first Saudi state is is terminated it doesn't stick I I think it was six years later 1824 that's the year in my head um a Saudi state is formed that second Saudi state will eventually also fail and then a third Saudi state is formed out of nudged its idea is it wants to recreate the first Saudi State this big almost the entire Arabian Peninsula size State um but when we were talking earlier I was telling you about the fact that uh there was this attempt to create this Arab state in Syria when that Arab state was being created it was created by hais so West people who were living in Western Saudi Arabia it was a hashimite kingdom um the British go to the souths and they say we're going to undermine and destroy this hashimite state but it would be helpful if you did as well now they the SS don't react to that they're they're not directly uh responsive to the British but eventually they do and they'll go and they'll conquer hez they'll put it together and they create the third Saudi State as a result the British and the Saudi royal family had a cordial relationship they the British saw the SS as somebody they could work with somebody that maybe that they had enough in common with that they didn't feel like they were a threat in the case of Egypt the British did something really strange so the French built the Suez Canal but when the French built the sus Canal they charged Egypt for it now you go okay well they built it well let me rephrase a French company went to Egypt and then hired Egyptian laborers at way under labor value prices and then had them almost as slaves dig the sus canal with high mortality rates and then charge the Egyptian government for them and you know at some level you go really this is just another little imperialist scheme well the to do this the Egyptian state had to borrow money from Banks so that's what they did well in 1882 the British government decided that they were going to use the the debt Egypt owed it as an excuse to invade they invaded and conquered Egypt um there was actually a whole Defense Force set up in Alexandria to try and stop what you a possible European Invasion the Defense Force fails and the British take over Egypt and they make it a protectorate inside the Empire and they eventually Force thewi out of power but then they replace him with a king and so Egypt becomes an in independent Kingdom from the Ottoman Empire at that point" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="one sure sign that the narrative the tide is turning on Israel's war on Gaza when a former Israeli prime minister describes the war as genocidal enough is enough medics getting the story out the doctors and nurses filling in the vacuum in the news coverage and taking a look under the hood of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the agenda never has been to provide humanitarian aid to the Palestinians an organization that does not do what its name implies more than 600 days into its horrific war on Palestinians in Gaza even Israel's most loyal allies from foreign governments to news organizations have been forced to confront reality from Berlin to London Paris to Ottawa support for Israel is turning into disapproval verging on condemnation over the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in the strip starving Palestinians have been lining up for food aid supplied by an organization that is the brainchild of the American and Israeli governments and looks more like a PR exercise than a humanitarian response the external political pressure along with rising dissent within Israel over the Netanyahu government's waging of this war is having an effect on the media narrative there and fracturing a consensus that goes all the way back to October 7th 2023 try as the Israelis might it will take more than a trickle of humanitarian aid to silence their critics more than propaganda to hide the war crimes it is committing when they talk about Israel and its genocidal ways in Gaza European politicians choose their words carefully particularly German ones like the chancellor Friedrich who went on the state funded broadcaster where he said finally and more than once that Israel has gone too far we have been hearing more and more international criticism germany's is probably the most significant one because of the historical baggage that guilt of the Holocaust that brought Germany to just accept and support whatever crime Israel has been committing so the fact that even Germany can no longer whitewash Israel's crime is extremely significant at the same time the foreign minister said &quot;But you know what we will not ban the weapons to Israel we reject an arms embargo so the European government is saying &quot;We condemn a killing spree but we will give the killer a sharper knife.&quot; Telling Israel &quot;What you're doing is morally wrong and might lead to negative consequences but we're not going to implement those consequences yet.&quot; With the European governments you can see stronger statements at the moment but statements basically bounce off Israel's iron dome of impunity from mers of all people it is truly too little too late and I await to see whether Palestinian solidarity activists students who have been calling out this genocide and facing brutal policing in some cases deportation i look forward to Meltz welcoming all those people back to Germany and telling them that they were right all along chancellor Meritz added Germany's name to a growing list of Western countries including France the UK and Canada that have criticized Israel over this war threatened it with sanctions but have not yet acted that effectively buys the Israelis time which they are using to keep punishing Palestinians cloaking their war crimes under the cover of organizations like the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the GHF after consistently blocking aid from getting into Gaza and attacking the agencies trying to help Palestinians including the UN's the Israelis teamed up with American military contractors mercenaries to create the GHF whose first foray into Gaza proved disastrous crowds of hungry Palestinians were herded like animals into an aid depot in Rafa humiliating scenes worthy of a concentration camp the crowd surged overwhelming those contractors shots were fired at least three Palestinians were killed the government media office in Gaza called it a deliberate massacre a full-fledged war crime committed against civilians suffering siege induced starvation people in Gaza are literally starving especially children because their bodies are not able to to withstand that that level of malnutrition even some of Israel's staunchest allies are now coming out to criticize Israel for its starvation campaign because this war has gone on for far too long we cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve it's not because they're having these big epiphies that that mass slaughter of Palestinians is wrong there's a great liberal centrist tradition of standing on the right side of history only when the relevant moment to do so has significantly passed we are seeing that grand liberal tradition be repeated now by Kama Emanuel Macron Mark Carney and other leaders who are only willing to condemn but indeed not stop Israel's activities at this point i think future proofing of reputation to say &quot;Oh but we did indeed speak up might very much be in play here.&quot; But those of us who have been paying any attention at all for the last year and a half plus are all too aware that these very governments have been funding and ideologically enabling uh Israel's actions throughout its war on Gaza Israeli officials from Benjamin Netanyahu on down have routinely dismissed allegations of war crimes as inherently anti-semitic the anti-semitic decision of the international court in the H is a modern driver that argument is more difficult to make now since more and more of those accusations are coming from Israelis including a former prime minister what is it if not a war crime ehood Ol first made that argument in a liberal Israeli paper Harets before repeating it on CNN golan a former army chief of staff turned opposition leader is another who has strayed from the path there have also been shifts in coverage in the Israeli media although limited and more common in the print sector than the broadcast side they are notable in that they reflect what is occurring politically almer is one of the earliest founders of Netanyahu's party Lioot so he's known left-wing pro Palestinian peace he's the guy that carried out one of Israel's most atrocious wars on Gaza Operation Gas so to see him now condemning what Israel is doing in Gaza as a war of annihilation as genocide it is extraordinary it speaks basically of how far Israel has gone this moment is ripe for the likes of Yer Golan and and other opposition figures in Israel because Netanyahu is facing increased pressure and leaders around the world will be happy to scapegoat Netanyahu as the perpetrator of this genocide in Gaza rather than face the reality that this was a genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian people by the state itself and so this moment presents an opportunity to put all the blame on Netanyahu both internally and internationally israel is now panicking realizing that their strategy of repeated atrocities to exhaust the global attention did not work that's why you had saying our propaganda is collapsing our legitimacy is over and you had Israel Hom saying the world is talking less about us and more about Gaza and their solution is not to end the genocide but to propagandize more to whitewash the genocide even more to double down on the failing strategy that didn't work without a doubt there are media outlets and journalists who are reassessing their position regarding this war and Wet is a good example they're showing more pictures of what's going on in Gaza speaking through the angle of starvation referring to it more and more overall however Israeli media coverage that allows for empathy for Palestinians remains the exception not the rule [Music] [Applause] 600 days into this war there have never been more lives at risk in Gaza where day after day GHF aid depots have produced nightmarish scenes of desperation and violence politicians overseas out to salvage their legacies could be enough to save some of those lives but as Israeli journalists well know there will be no saving of reputations on the Israeli airwaves the moral standing of news channels that too many citizens there still use as their primary source of information if you're only consuming Israeli media in Hebrew you will know less about what the Israeli army is doing in Gaza than probably any given citizen in the rest of the world the Israeli media has been a collaborator with this genocidal mindset and actually promoting it and by concealing the Holocaust of Gaza from the eyes of the Israeli public when the day comes that the criminals responsible for this genocide will stand on trial i think next to them on the bench the Israeli media should be located there's a reason that um experts in genocide studies and humanitarians are using terms like final solution for this stage of the genocide in Gaza we're seeing images of children burnt trapped in schools the reports we're hearing from the imperiled hospitals has prompted certain world leaders to speak up but that shouldn't lead any viewers to think that this is because there's been some sort of uh dramatic aberration by the Israeli military this is a continuation and an escalation in Gaza after so many many months of this kind of genocidal warfare throughout Israel's war on Gaza health care workers have become key voices in the reporting of this story and over the past couple of weeks the dispatches coming out of hospitals there have grown more and more desperate minakshi Ravi has been tracking this story gaza's health care system and the Palestinians who work in it have been systematically targeted by Israel for nearly 20 months now at least 94% of all hospitals in the strip have been damaged or destroyed more than 1,400 healthcare workers have been killed with thousands of doctors and nurses arrested the few who have made it out of prison say their Israeli captives reserved specific brutal torture for medics international doctors who have traveled in with aid groups now say their mission goes beyond medicine the main thing is to come here to bear witness because you're not seeing what I'm seeing because there's been a complete block to all media i am getting very sick and tired of having as as are all my colleagues of having to go onto the the news programs because journalists aren't allowed in etc to to point out what is happening here physicians returning from Gaza have also been outspoken on how dire the situation there has become the starvation the particular nature of the burns and injuries they are seeing and the targeting of Palestinian medics people need to understand that civilians their families uh healthare workers are are being intentionally and deliberately killed and I just want to say that the IDF have said in their statement regarding this uh attack in Kunis they've said that the IDF evacuated civilians from this area you don't ask the perpetrator of of of genocide we have to Dr hassan we have to ask the Israeli government if you also in addition to that response mentioned that Amn A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A amnesty international doctors without borders human rights watch the international court of justice would all beg to differ this past week American trauma surgeon Dr firo Sidwa delivered testimony to the United Nations Security Council i'm not here as a policy maker or a politician i am a physician bearing witness to the deliberate destruction of a health care system the targeting of my own colleagues and the eraser of a people these doctors are not isolated voices they have formed a network of sorts a valuable one to fill the void in reporting on this story caused by Israel's refusal to let journalists into Gaza and its killing of so many Palestinian reporters more than 200 of them thanks Mina in our lead story we touched on the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the GHF formed just months ago it is an American Israeli coalition that includes ex CIA and military personnel it is a shadowy group that started distributing aid in the southern end of the strip this past week there is not a single international aid organization that has endorsed or cooperated with the GHF instead from the UN to Oxfam to Medsan Frontier warnings have been issued that the GHF is militarized privatized and politicized an exercise in quote aidwashing when a pretense of aid is designed to cover up something else entirely one of the news outlets tracking the GHF closely with reporting from Palestinian journalists in Gaza is Drop Site News its co-founder Jeremy Scill joins us now jeremy let's start with the name of this organization now handling aid in the war zone the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the GHF out to do what its name implies not in any way shape or form i mean f first of all let's just get one basic fact straight the amount of so-called aid that it's distributing is is a pittance relative to what is needed in these starvation conditions in Gaza that are being enforced as an act of war by the USbacked Israeli regime it's incredibly cynical to use the term humanitarian in this name because Netanyahu himself has been very clear that this is a scam a scheme that is intended to kind of quiet some of the criticism that Netanyahu has received primarily from Republican senators who have said &quot;We don't like the appearance of starvation in Gaza so if you can create the facade that you're actually doing something then we're going to make sure that the weapons keep flowing and our support for your war of annihilation continues i mean Richard you couldn't get uh a a sort of uh starker symbol of what the agenda is here that you have a circumvention of an existing program that was effective that you have American mercenaries deployed on the ground that you have Israelis opening fire at desperate starving Palestinians and that it's all actually out in the open that the intent of this is to be uh just sort of a facade of humanitarianism to enable a genocide the GHF's aid distribution got off to a bad start this week the images that have come out of this the Palestinians in those caged pens lining up for food when you looked at those images what went through your mind well look I've been speaking to sources on the ground we have reporters inside of Gaza and my understanding is that there was almost no coordination whatsoever with uh local aid organizations to even inform people where they would be able to go to pick up these parcels or what would be inside of the parcels people just heard through text message WhatsApp word of mouth there's going to be aid dropped in this location and so because the population is starving and you have acute malnutrition among thousands of children people started to trek through incredibly dangerous terrain and they arrive at these sites and and it was very chaotic in some cases they were using biometric identification systems or interrogating people in others they forced or almost like cattle Palestinians into barbed wire fencing apparatus um on the first day that they started getting uh this aid distribution underway um we heard from sources inside of Gaza that a man had been kidnapped when he was interrogated by Israeli intelligence they got his family on the phone they were supposedly looking for some relative that the family hadn't been in touch with uh since the start of the war and when he didn't provide information that they were demanding from him they disappeared him that family has no idea where he is we've heard of at least a dozen or so more uh other people that were snatched when they went to go and get aid also the Israelis uh opened fire at one point they say that it was warning shots um but Palestinians were killed you know Israelis compare Palestinians to animals and this is part of what the plan is they want to essentially bait them into a cage shut the door behind them and then they either get killed in this killing cage or the ultimate plan which they call Trump's plan is to take that cage filled with Palestinians of Gaza and ship them to another country what we are witnessing here right now is is a a completely disgusting trap that Palestinians are being forced to as part of what Netanyahu has described as the final stage of his war to conquer Gaza now its backers say that the GHF is specifically designed to bypass the UN its relief agency ENROA why do the Israelis and the Americans involved in this say that that's even necessary the bypassing of established tried and tested systems of aid distribution richard it's because the the agenda never has been to provide humanitarian aid to the Palestinians um UNRA was established uh around the same time as the state of Israel was imposed on Palestine and and the reason that Israel has always stood against UNRA is because it is perhaps the most powerful symbol that uh that makes it clear that Palestinians have a right of return to their land have a right of return to their homes what we saw from the the the the moments after the October 7th operations happened inside of Israel was a very intense campaign to try to demonize the United Nations as a whole but UNRA specifically and the Israelis began planting stories that said that scores of UNRA employees had participated in the October 7th attacks and perhaps the the chief launderer of this narrative in the media was the Wall Street Journal and those stories were actually published with a by line uh of one of the reporters who herself was a uh a former IDF soldier and they they essentially portrayed UNRA as a Hamas front organization the United States and other countries responded to this propaganda and they admitted that they didn't even do their own independent review by moving swiftly to try to defund UNRA when the United States and major US media outlets began serving as conveyor belts for the lies of Israel about UNRA this was a devastating uh series of events and UNRA has been fighting for its life and so by creating an alternative pathway that circumvents international bodies that essentially seeks to to disintegrate UNRA what Israel is doing is saying &quot;We want to always be in control of the calorie intake of Palestinians we want to be able to shut off the water we want to be able to shut off the food we want to be able to block the medicine.&quot; The intent of this is to create the appearance of some alternative that would be viable to UNRA while at the same time ensuring full spectrum domination of Israel over the lives of Palestinians in Gaza you and Dropsite have done extensive reporting on the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation how difficult has it been to do that how transparent is this organization what kind of challenges are you facing in trying to tell this story you know as someone who's done a lot of reporting on mercenary organizations um and CIA front organizations it looked like what we would call a cutout that it's not actually intended to be what the public is being told but that it was set up for an alternative purpose sometimes intelligence agencies or governments set up fake companies uh to try to cover their employees as they do espionage other times they try to set up a company that has some legitimate front to it but the agenda is different i think we can safely say that the fact that there's very little information that's been released that we know the connections to both Israeli and American intelligence that this was intended to be a cutout uh that would serve the purpose of uh allowing Netanyahu to continue his war of annihilation while claiming that they're actually giving aid to people um in Gaza but Israel has been very effective with its propaganda in part because of its allies in the Western media particularly American and British news organizations that have promoted these lies or have not pushed back hard enough in demanding evidence so you know at some point uh all of these governments and officials are going to come out and pretend like they were always against the genocide we're seeing more and more media outlets coming out and taking that position we're seeing more and more academics and scholars taking that position you're seeing former Biden administration officials taking that position well history is full of people who want to be right uh through hindsight courage means speaking out in real time and so this should serve as a very serious lesson for journalists and governments when it comes to Israel you cannot ever believe the first draft of what they say you know Ronald Reagan used to say trust but verify in the case of Israel you have to assume it is lying and then check the facts jeremy Scill Drop Site News always great to have you on the show thanks again for speaking with us here today thank you Richard" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="The shores of Greenland. This remote island in the Arctic has a problem now. We need Greenland for national security. ... One way or the other, we’re gonna get it. Geographically part of North America, Greenland has close ties to the United States. But politically it’s part of Europe -- as a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. This wasn’t an issue before. The U.S. and Denmark are NATO allies and have long cooperated on the island. Until now. Donald Trump refused to rule out military force to take control of the island. Denmark’s prime minister has been racing across the continent trying to shore up support from allies. What does Trump’s longing for Greenland mean for its people? Do you want Greenland to be bought? No, not at all. Why is this island in the far north suddenly so important? You can think of Greenland as a giant aircraft carrier sitting in an amazing position. Only fifty-seven thousand people live in Greenland which is the world's biggest island. Greenland’s towns and settlements are scattered along the coast, including the capital Nuuk. The island is right between the US, Canada, the European Union and Russia. And on the shortest route between the European part of Russia and the US. That’s why, here... ...the US built one of its most important radar stations – at Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base. The US facility was set up during the Cold War to detect missile launches from the Soviet Union – and prepare to strike back. The job was to build a giant airbase for our largest long-range bombers high on the north-west coast of Greenland at a tiny settlement called Thule. Built with the permission of the Danish government, the base would push our defense line two thousand miles to the North. Today it remains the northernmost US military base in the world. And don’t get fooled by this footage. Winters there are brutal. Despite this significant US base... ...Greenland is actually a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. How did this happen? We will get to that. Denmark is a small European country of 6 million people. And its capital, Copenhagen, is further away from Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, than Washington DC. Denmark only has a light military footprint in Greenland. Danish troops patrol on dog sleds across the inland... ...and a few navy vessels monitor the shores. It’s American power and not Danish power that provides security. Because the Greenlanders know that our base there is ultimately what's going to guarantee their security, and the Danes know that, as well. This is Scott Barry Zellen, an American researcher at the University of Connecticut, specializing in Arctic geopolitics. And so, the fact that Greenland has a strategic role to play and a forward military presence for the US military already means that they are part of our security system. But Donald Trump is taking it to the next level. He says the US must have control of Greenland because of Russian and Chinese cooperation in the Arctic. You look outside, you have China ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We're not letting that happen. That has stunned Europeans. In Denmark, we're also requesting, well, what is it actually the US want us to do? Marc Jacobsen is researching Arctic security and diplomacy at the Royal Danish Defense College, which is under the oversight of the Danish armed forces. What we know is that they want Denmark to increase surveillance of Greenland. It’s important to remember that Greenland is half the size of Europe. So even if Denmark used all its military budget on increasing surveillance of Greenland, we would never know everything what's going on there. Surveillance is especially important between Greenland, Iceland and the UK in this area called the GIUK Gap. This naval chokepoint is a crucial part of NATO strategy to detect and contain Russian ships, especially submarines moving between the Arctic and the Atlantic. Denmark is now investing in new ships and drones to deploy in the far north. It wants to keep sharing defense responsibility for Greenland with the US. That cooperation started after Nazi Germany occupied Denmark in World War 2. The Danish ambassador in Washington agreed that the US should occupy Greenland... ...and construct military bases on the island to prevent a German invasion. More than ten thousand US fighters and bombers landed in Greenland on their way to the war in Europe. Greenland proved such a strategic asset, that in 1946 the US wanted to buy it from Denmark for a hundred million dollars in gold. The offer was rejected but both countries kept it secret at the time. Not long after both countries became founding members of NATO. Denmark agreed US troops should stay. And in 1951, the two countries signed a treaty on common defense of Greenland. It is still in effect today. That’s why Trump’s threat to take Greenland is such a big deal. We're now the greatest threat to Danish unity. Not the Russians, not the Chinese, but America, their NATO partner. And this tension is not only about security. In February 2025, a US-Senate committee held a hearing revealing much broader interest in the island, for example from the US mining industry. Greenland's entire coastline holds what is indisputably one of the world's greatest collection of minerals in one jurisdiction. Throw a dart at any portion of the coastline and you will undoubtedly hit a potential world class target. Just look at this map of mineral resources, provided by Greenland’s government. Precious metals, base metals, industrial rocks, and rare metals – including rare earths. This is just a hint of the resources in Greenland. But most of it remains largely untapped. It's important to remember that there's very little mining activity in Greenland. All these stories about Greenland's riches in terms of mineral resources, it's still far on the horizon. There are just two active mines in Greenland. And only about a hundred people currently work in Greenland’s mining sector. Exploration is very challenging. Take this mineral deposit site in the south of Greenland, for example. It is said to be among the world's top rare earth deposits outside China. But in 2021 the Greenland government stopped exploration here. Because the site also contains radioactive uranium and is close to populated areas. But it’s not just environmental concerns. Extracting resources is a lot costlier here than in most other places. There are no roads linking Greenland’s settlements. And the terrain is rough, with deep fjords, glaciers and icy mountain ranges. The climate is harsh. But it is changing due to the climate crisis. Whether you're for or against it, ice just melts. It's melting faster, it's melting more rapidly, and it's creating opportunity as ice retreats in time to have greater accessibility to interior natural resources. And it’s also affecting the ocean around Greenland. This visualization from NASA shows the reduction of ice pack in the Arctic between the nineteen-eighties and twenty-nineteen. But instead of a wake-up call, many companies and countries see it as an economic opportunity. They are waiting for new shipping routes to open in the Arctic. Three of them in particular: The Northwest Passage through the top of the Canadian archipelago. The Northern Sea Route along the Russian coast. And the Transpolar Sea Route. These routes could cut shipping time between Asia and Europe. Because for most destinations they are much shorter than the current route via the Suez Canal. For now, navigation across the Arctic is limited and relies on expensive icebreakers. So, both mining as well as new shipping routes remain something for the future. Right now, fishing is the mainstay of Greenland's economy. But that is not enough. That's why Denmark has to chip in. Every year Denmark sends a grant of about 500 million euros to Greenland's government. It's about half of its budget – nearly ten thousand Euros per resident every year – a major factor for the island’s economy. That money runs everything and without it you end up with impoverished native villages, without economies that implode socially. But it's not charity. Denmark gets something out of it as well. Because we have Greenland, we kind of get a lot to say with the great powers such as the US, but also Canada and Russia. It means a lot politically. Denmark kind of punches above its weight in international politics. Whether Denmark likes it or not – most Greenlanders do not see their long-term future with Denmark. Inuit people have lived on the island for thousands of years. They survived by subsistence hunting of whales and seals. Their culture was based in the middle of nature. Modern Danish colonization started in 1721 with the first Danish settlements. Over the next 200 years, Christianity and the Danish language were pushed on the Inuit, their families were torn apart. And that trauma left a legacy. Only after World War 2, a slow process of decolonization started. Step by step, Greenland became an equal part of the Kingdom of Denmark, elected its own parliament and government. Today, it is a semiautonomous territory. This means that it governs its own domestic affairs. Denmark is still responsible for security and foreign policy. But Greenland has the right to declare independence if it decides to do so in a referendum. And the government of Greenland says that’s its goal. Polls suggest a clear majority support such a step. Of course, in the future I prefer an independent Greenland. We are our own people. We are not Danes, we are Greenlandic people and we want to be free. And what about Trump’s plans for the island? Do you want Greenland to be bought? No, not at all. Why not? Because it is our land and we have our culture, language and we are starting to get our own way of life. I don't really like this idea of being part of the United States of America. But what I do like is to work with them for example. This is a common opinion here. Because building the island’s economy is the biggest challenge on the way to independence. That is why Greenland is looking for partners. It has representative offices in Iceland, the EU, the US, and China. It has also signed cooperation agreements on mineral exploration with the US and the EU. So, it is trying to keep its options open. For Greenland, the US is an increasingly important business partner and had long guaranteed its security. So, Trump’s interest could easily lead to a wider discussion about Greenland’s future. I would certainly think that some Greenlanders will want to talk about it. Just because this kind of attention by the White House, this kind of attention by the world, it's like a once in a generation opportunity. Internationally, it will be relevant how Trump proceeds. For US allies in Europe, the issue of Greenland is part of a growing recognition that the Trump administration could even pose a threat to their security. Greenland strategically, through the lens of Trump grand strategy, is this idea of strengthening North America as their primary security focus for the government. So, it's the America first on steroids and America first in diplomacy. That’s why Denmark is seeking support from other European countries. It's been very clever from the Danish government to not make this an issue between the US and Denmark but between Europe and the US because we are way stronger together with the other European states. But the outcome of this dispute will be closely observed all around the world. Especially if Trump forces Denmark or Greenland into a deal. Trump is really talking about doing to Denmark what Putin is doing to Ukraine and what China wants to do to Taiwan. And so, all that might be a transition to a new world order that Russia, China and America might now all share the same strategic vision of spheres of influence being reestablished. In a world increasingly determined by the whims of great powers, will Greenlanders even get a say in determining their own future?" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="rabbi David Feldman thank you so much for sitting here with us today and we're filming this interview at a time where student activists across the US are being arrested for their pro Palestine activism with claims that they're being anti-semitic what's your take on all of this well accusing people who stand up for the oppressed people who say something when they see crimes taking place uh this is not this is not anti-semitic you know doing what's right and speaking up for the press is not anti-semitic in any way um when these people when these students it's not only the students it's so many other people are being attacked with the with this false accusation of anti-semitism uh this is disturbing because in in the time as you say in the time that we we see this genocide going on in Gaza so many people tens of thousands of people are being mass murdered innocent people uh this is something that us people in the free world should say something this is injust this is unjust for the people of Palestine that that this voice is attempted to be silenced but it's not only doing injustice for the Palestinian people this is doing injustice for the Jewish people as well because when you conflate Judaism and Zionism you conflate anti-Zionism with anti-semitism you're making a statement as if all Jews support all what's going on and as if all Jews are accountable to what's going on but we always need to know better than that and we try to educate people to understand that anti-ionism has nothing to do with anti-semitism because Judaism and Zionism are not the same judaism is a religion zionism is a political movement should never be conflated yes and New York is one of the hot spots shall we say of Judaism with over 2 million Jews living in this city and as you say some of them are anti-Zionist but meanwhile some of them are support the state of Israel and you know identify as Zionist and sometimes we see them confronting you because of your stance what's your take on them well f first of all as you say New York is a very good example uh yes there are a lot of Jewish people in New York many of them support Israel but there's a massive community who is anti-ionist and people might not know because the mainstream media would never show you that like for example there was a couple of years ago there was a huge mass uh anti-ionist rally a Jewish anti-ionist rally in front of the Israeli consulate on 2nd Avenue Manhattan and then CBS would announce that there is a traffic jam on Second Avenue and they would not say what the reason is in other words they purposely intentionally ignore what is going on so many people have no idea but there there is a massive uh religious Jewish anti-ionist community who are outspokenly uh against Israel um but but uh what's what what's important to understand is that these not not everyone comes out in each and every occasion as you say intimidation is massive uh pressure is enormous uh I I I always tell this story uh I had a very close friend of mine comes over to me once and and tells me I'll do everything I can to support you to support your activities but there's no way I can come out in person i run a huge business i come out in person they take a picture of me I close down the business the same day but uh but still the the anti-ionism is is is strong our communities are very strong and you can you can imagine if it wouldn't have been for those massive communities but that will be behind us we would not be able to be out there in these numbers and this uh so frequent and do so much yes you have huge numbers behind you but also we're seeing Zionist groups like Betar recently becoming more emboldened and seeking to confront you can you speak on the activities of Zionist groups such as Betar well Betar to begin with I'm not sure how large they are how strong they are uh they might be very uh uh wild they might be very uh aggressive uh we didn't see them in large numbers uh but yes they are very aggressive they're coming out uh in public intimidating harassing demonstrators happens to be peaceful demonstrators you know these these demonstrations taking place in New York City that that we all attend uh these are not dangerous demonstrations and uh these people will always claim that the pro Palestinian solidarity movement is dangerous uh and so on yeah and sometimes they approach you they tell you things like &quot;You should go to Gaza you won't be safe in Gaza.&quot; How do you respond to that oh that's that's that's a good point what they say is &quot;Yeah go visit Gaza.&quot; And they always they also say you know go to the Arabs they will kill you first and I always respond to that and usually these these arguments end up with nothing because they they they don't know what's going on whatsoever and and I try always to tell these people and people who who are willing to listen and some people are willing to listen and I tell them you know why are you so scared from these Palestinian people they don't hate you they don't want anything they just want their freedom we can live in peace with them we lived in peace with them before Zionism came they were always respectful for Jews and they still are but in the same time they are deeply upset and against the crimes being committed to Palestine which doesn't make these people anti-Semitic doesn't make these people dangerous for Jews while in the same time yes those people are vehemently opposing this uh occupation of Palestine now when when you find when you find people on the street uh protesting the genocide in Gaza this is not about protesting the Jewish people this is not about protesting the Jewish religion this is about crimes and they which which they are opposed to and we as Jewish people share their uh frustration and we share their pain of people who are disturbed when all of this is taking place what about what do you say to those who maybe agree with what you're saying but also say that um Jews Jewish people need a strong Israel to be safe this is this is one of the arguments that the the Zionists are using that uh Jewish people suffered in the Holocaust uh we were in we are in exile for the past 2,000 years it's about time for us to have a safe haven uh and most of the time this is being uh religion is being used into these conversations they are trying to use religion some concepts of the Jewish religion to justify this claim but what one needs to understand is basically two points first of all this is not Judaism according to Judaism we are forbidden to create this so-called safe haven for the Jewish people according to the very basics of Judaism there's a concept of Jewish exile which is a divine decree which we are forbidden to end by any physical means even if we find that this building is a safe haven would be in our favor according to our religion this is forbidden we accept the decree of God whether it is comfortable or it isn't we accept the word of God that we should not end this exile by any physical means and we leave this up to God for him to end our exile this is exactly what Judaism teaches us that it's only God god himself that will bring the ultimate redemption where all humanity together will serve the one God in peace and brotherhood zionism is forbidden safe haven is Zionism but I have to add this other point all of this would be true even if this would have been the safe haven for the Jewish people even if this would have been the favor of Jews um but it happens to be that the state of Israel is the greatest danger for the Jewish people while we lived in Palestine in peace it is the occupation of Palestine which has destroyed this peace and and in in addition we have to I have to add that coming back to the previous point even if this would have been in the favor of the Jewish people we should never oppress another people we should never harm another people because it might be in our interest certainly very interesting points you're making there philosophically and religiously very interesting arguments but uh Zionists often use religious arguments to justify the existence of Israel how do you respond to those claims and also uh Zionists equate Judaism together with Zionist Zionism and how what's your take on that zionists are conflating Judaism with Zionism because they need Judaism to support their movement of Zionism but what happens here is something very ironic and very hypocritical you have a movement of Zionism which is officially a secular movement it's not only secular because the founders of Zionism and the people to Zionists today are not only secular they basically many of them hate Judaism they hate God and his religion for example I have a friend of mine uh who grew up in Zionist education grew up in Jerusalem and he told me that what he was taught is that we the Jewish people have two enemies now guess who the two are in who the first is the first is the religious Jew and the second is the Arab now both of this is wrong the religious Jew is not is is is basically the Jew uh but this is how they hate religion the Jewish religion and they hate religious Jews and and and which which just shows you how far away they are from Judaism but that movement the movement of Zionism who is secular and who refuses to follow Judaism they misuse this very same religion they refuse to follow and they misuse it to justify crimes which are forbidden in this very same religion because killing and stealing oppressing an entire people all of this is forbidden in Judaism and as I said before the whole concept the idea of Zionism to build a sovereign homeland for Jews is in total contrast of Judaism now see seeing a secular movement misusing the religion doesn't make sense in the first place but what my response to those people is we can only explain and educate that while you are misusing the Jewish religion the Jewish religion in each and every way is in total contrast to this movement of Zionism and when we take a take a look at what's happening right now overall in the Middle East with President Trump taking office he ran as being a president for peace and he promised that he can bring peace not only to the Middle East but to Ukraine and many other regions how is your take on how his administration their policies have been so far and do you have hope for peace now I I I'm not a politician now i'm not sure exactly uh what can be done in each and every conflict around the world uh but when it comes to Zionism it comes to Palestine uh what we are presenting is we are presenting the view of Judaism of our religion and yes we do uh see the approach that our president of the United States has has taken uh we always say to politicians we appreciate when politicians or individuals extend the hand for the Jewish people we definitely appreciate but we try to educate and to explain that supporting Israel is not in favor of the Jewish people supporting Israel is is is doing so much harm to the suffering people of Palestine and so much harm for the Jewish people we do everything we can to explain to educate that Judaism is not Zionism and in this climate when some are afraid of speaking out as you said they're worried about losing their businesses how important is it for Jewish voices like yours to speak out for Palestine well it it is extremely important for us to speak up for many reasons first of all the people the oppressed people of Palestine deserve that people in the free world should speak up and without Jewish people coming out the rest of humanity is being intimidated of being anti-Semitic this is one of the reasons why it's so important for Jewish people to c to come out and to uh help people overcome this propaganda and and understand that this is a human uh cause this is a righteous cause this is a cause that uh needs to be addressed uh and we all share this uh this very important cause mhm and in addition to this this is so important because we have to break this stereotype people should should know that not all Jews take part in this no Jewish people who are right-minded people disagree with all of this the state of Israel does not represent us is certainly doesn't represent our religion if there is a group of people supporting these crimes you know that's that's their that's their own decision but this is not the voice of the entire Jewish people when you speak to Jewish people who are kind of on the fence they're not Zionists but maybe when they see you they see that there's an alternative path they can take can you speak to those conversations maybe not some who are set in their ways but some who you can actually change their perspective there there are many people especially since October 7th so many people are waking up so many people are seeing something new that they didn't realize until now you know until now everything was like okay but now they they are waking up to see that something is wrong and and these people are willing some of them are willing to listen in my experience the Zionist propaganda is so strong and so massive that even if you would find some people who are not supposed to be Zionist who people who in essence are not Zionists but the movement of Zionism has managed to confuse the masses the Jewish people are in danger it's those enemies of ours who seek to destroy us all and they want to drive us into the sea from the river to the sea people are so uh h um disturbed by this slogan from the river to the sea and I speak to people and I try to explain them what do you think is the second half of this slogan from the river to the sea kill all the Jews and people say yes people believe that from the river to the sea Palestine wants to see all Jews killed which is which is so ridiculously wrong it doesn't make any sense and I always explain to people Palestine doesn't want to see Jewish people dead they don't even want to see all Jews expelled from Palestine that's not what they are saying all they want is total freedom for their people and freed their land and we have we we spoke to so many uh political leaders of the Palestinian groups so many religious leaders so many individuals layman people nobody says otherwise but unfortunately people following Zionist propaganda are so misled to the point that they even lose their mind to be able to figure out what's in the best interest for themselves let's let let's put the oppressed people of Palestine aside which is something that everyone should think about but even for their own interest like they they are fighting for the Jewish people and by doing so they are endangering all Jews like by supporting what Israel is doing this is not in favor of the Jewish people but I'm pleased to see that people are listening and we we do this already for decades but especially since October 7th people are opening their minds and you know they see that they have to rethink what they were programmed until now and they slowly open their minds and can you give a bit of a more personal perspective your family ha uh escaped Europe back in the days they escaped genocide so being a sort of a survivor of genocide what kind of responsibility does that put on you on your shoulders to speak out when it's happening we always say it's because it's our communities who suffered in the Holocaust it's our families who suffered in the Holocaust that's a lesson for us that we should not want to see this happen to anyone when we are seeing what's happening in Gaza this reminds us of the stories that our elders told us just a couple of decades ago uh uh one a number of my teachers were Holocaust survivors uh and and you know they they they were telling stories terrible stories and unfortunately we we hearing similar stories now this is something that should the the the Jewish history and the Holocaust should be a lesson for Jewish people how to refuse this genocide taking place in Gaza so turning to the future of Jewish and Palestinian solidarity what do you need what do you think needs to happen in the US so that more Jewish people support the Palestinian cause like you do basically they need information they need education they need to uh realize not only that what's being done to Palestine is wrong but even more importantly they need to know that Palestine is not the enemy of the Jewish people and they never were uh there there's a massive propaganda that is ingrained in their minds from their very young age but this needs to be uh corrected mhm and once this will be corrected we can we can get quite uh we can proceed further and going forward some people are very unhopful for the future of Gaza what do you see happening now that the ceasefire has been broken again the Netanyahu government seems to be uh seems to want to keep pushing to exterminate the Palestinian people from the land what do you see happening i'm not sure exactly what's going to happen in Gaza i hope for the best but generally speaking with Palestine uh I I I I see I see a better future why because we see at least since October 7th even before people are waking up the general public is changing their views public opinion is shifting uh maybe we have to give credit to Netanyahu for waking up the people i always say uh it's so sad when we have to pay this terrible price for people to wake up so many people so many tens of thousands of people need to be murdered for people to finally wake up but this is what's happening but while they're waking up on one end but also on the other end here in the US there's a lot of crackdown against pro Palestine demonstrations as we mentioned earlier people are getting snatched of the street do you have any worries for you for your community because you're standing up for Palestine could something happen to you well it can happen it can happen but but to be to be clear here this is not showing uh that that it's not being successful on the other on the other way around we see this a success if there is no response to the pro Palestinian solidarity movement other than physically cracking them down then this is an achievement in other words there's no other uh reasonable response and how has this response been has there been threats against you against your community well we have threats from time to time we have physical attacks from time to time it's okay it's okay you know we we expect this to happen we expect that the other side is strong and aggressive uh but again this is encouraging because this is all they can respond with uh they have no logical or reasonable or religious argu proper religious argument to make so in the face of threats you're actually saying that this means that your activism is working because now people are getting worried and they're taking backlash against you but we're also seeing backlash to students such as the Turkish student who was recently arrested Romesa Mahmud Halil a student from Colombia who perhaps you demonstrated with very closely what's your message uh to these students out there who are maybe worried and who are looking for guidance on what to do in this time well all we can say is yes it's difficult yes it's challenging but in the same time we all of us know that what we are doing is right uh I cannot necessarily advise people exactly what to do what not to do that's the choice of the individuals uh in the face that we can face uh backlash but we are doing we are speaking up for humanity we are doing a righteous deed we please God by our acts and this is what needs to be done now who should be those doing it that's up to the individual and can you talk about a bit about your experiences when you went to Gaza or when you've been to other countries in the Middle East how were you received by the people there perhaps like you can explain it in a way for other Jewish people who've never been what would their experience be if they went this is a this is a very important question because our personal experience is shocking for general Jewish people we visited Gaza and this was after the beginning of the siege this was in 2009 uh Gaza is the most affected people from this conflict from this war and people were questioning before we went whether it's going to be safe because after all you know these people should uh be dangerous to people who harmed them but this wasn't the case they knew exactly who we are who we were they knew that we're not enemy they had no problem with us as Jewish people we visited we met Ism Khan who was the prime minister of Gaza at the time and uh he said to us privately in a meeting and then publicly in a press conference he said &quot;We have nothing against the Jewish people neither against the Jewish religion we are against the occupation.&quot; This makes simple sense i always take these stories back to our communities and I tell people Palestine is not dangerous to the Jewish people i visited Gaza i visited many other Muslim countries frequently I visit Muslim or Arab conventions and guess what i came home alive it's not dangerous at all people need to know this and people who only follow mainstream media or Zionist media generally speaking they don't have even a chance to interact with any Palestinian or Muslim to to have personal experience which is it's very unfortunate because their information is being built on fabricated propaganda versus facts on the ground" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="Support our work: https://democracynow.org/donate/sm-de...&#10;&#10;In his first live interview since his release from ICE detention, Columbia University student and Palestinian activist Mohsen Mahdawi recounts the traumatic experience of his arrest and incarceration. Mahdawi, a green card holder who was born and raised in a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, was arrested in Vermont on April 14 when he appeared for what he was told would be a citizenship interview, and spent more than two weeks in U.S. immigration custody, where he was held in retaliation for his speech in support of Palestinian rights. Mahdawi's detention has led him to reflect on the &quot;interconnectedness between injustices,&quot; as multiple members of his family in Palestine have been &quot;unjustly&quot; incarcerated in Israeli jails. &quot;Now I can feel their pain,&quot; says Mahdawi. Despite the U.S. government and pro-Israel groups' attempts to silence his calls for an end to genocide in Gaza, he adds, &quot;I share my pain with the world.&quot; &#10;&#10;Democracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on over 1,500 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

first live interview welcome to Democracy Now congratulations on your freedom Mosen thank you Amy it's a pleasure to be with you and good morning to your audience as well so if you can start off by telling us what happened why you ended going ended up going back to Vermont uh for this final what you thought immigration interview what happened i mean I was waiting for this uh interview which is my naturalization uh process to receive a citizenship for over uh over over a year um and the reason I had to go to Vermont because my residence my uh permanent residence is in Vermont uh therefore um I went to basically what I thought should be um a normal um you know u naturalization interview um I expected at the same time that there might be a trap set up for me just seeing and witnessing what happened to other students including Mahmud Khalil and Romesa um and therefore I was prepared for that interview that I might come on the other side with full rights or no rights we interviewed um Vermont Congress member Becca Balant um at the time because you had written to her she's the sole Congress member in Vermont as well as to Senators Peter Welch who visited you in prison and Senator Bernie Sanders you wrote them all because you were so concerned about what would happen this is exactly right i mean uh I prepared for many different on many different levels part of why I stayed in Vermont is because of the support that I received from uh official representatives such as the senators and the congresswoman who I'm very grateful for but at the same time also uh I I had to arrange with my lawyers uh in order to have everything drafted ready to go just prepared for the worst case scenario so I prepared with the lawyers contacted my uh representatives and contacted my community members who are very close to me and we saw the aftermath of this is I was able to stay in Vermont something that other students did not have the luxury to do they were uprooted from their communities and from legal support so what happened you go to the naturalization interview what day was that uh it was on the 14th of April and you went with your lawyer i went with one of my lawyers an immigration lawyer we go into USCIS office this is the immigration office where I'm supposed to have my interview and uh everything looked kind of normal there were some signs um the officer who interviewed me inside was waiting for us and after being in the lobby for a few minutes the lobby was emptied from any other uh applicants so I it was only myself my lawyer and my friend and they looked at them and they said this is the calm before the storm and so you had your interview did you sign any documents yes I went through my regular interview for citizenship uh to the point I thought that I am going to receive the citizenship that same day because I was I I was asked the questions that I had to answer i answered the questions correctly and then I was asked if I am willing to take the pledge of allegiance when the officer asked me if I am willing to do so I said of course and he asked me to sign a document saying that I am willing to actually protect and defend the constitution of this country and shortly after that moment just within a minute uh the DHS agents storm the office separate me from my lawyer and they say that I am under arrest masked i mean were they masked they were masked uh they had hoods on uh you could not you could not recognize them and they had guns on them as well and they masked around you did they handcuff you yes directly actually there there was not any space or room to show us documents or to explain anything and they said &quot;You're under arrest.&quot; So I gave them my my hands and I said &quot;I am a peaceful man i am not going to resist.&quot; And so you were taken where was your lawyer they prevented my lawyer from being with me so I was taken through the back door to into the lobby outside of that building into an unmarked SUV and my lawyer did not know what's happening with me in fact at that time all of what was going in their head is to basically execute the premeditated plan that they had in mind which is to ship me to send me to Louisiana they had the tickets the airplane tickets printed and ready the agents had the tickets ready so they drove you to Burlington well the airport the Yes so before they took me to the airport they took me to a building to process me and the processing which we expected to take place at the in St albins at the prison did not actually take place there so we I was surprised very surprised they processed me in a different building separate building only 10 minutes away from the airport and then they drive me to the airport and they hand me to two other agents who are supposed to fly me on a commercial flight and what happened at that moment um I asked the agents I said &quot;Are we going to Louisiana?&quot; And they said &quot;Yes.&quot; And I asked which direction so I clarified that it's going to stop by New York City then to Louisiana we went into the airport um and uh we realized that the flight was uh basically we were late the flight was about to take off it the the airplane was being taxied during that time I also uh was not feeling well so I had to use the restroom for a brief time and the moment I get out of the restroom while we're walking towards the gate we see the airplane being taxied away so your stop in the bathroom saved you from this plane i don't know if that is the the reason but some people think that this might be the reason when you got to the airport you saw the plane pulling when you got to the gate you saw the plane pulling away yes and what did the lat allow time for for your lawyer i mean um if you think of it that has changed the path of my legal uh my legal fight for justice it allowed my lawyers to fight on fair ground and to free me within 16 days something that other students as you saw weeks and months they've been in detention so you were held in detention in a prison in Vermont correct with other migrants that's right um in this prison in fact uh basically ICE rents a section of the prison and the section where I was it was a mixture of three quarters of people who have committed crimes before and one quarter of migrants who come in and out and I was uh my sill was uh C38 the first cell in that section where the migrants are so I saw waves of uh of uh the migrants those are not just migrants those are the people who feed us who plant our food who harvest our organic delicious Vermont produce like the dairy workers the dairy workers as well so I I was able to uh meet the first wave which is farm workers who you know worked on farms and the second wave was farm workers who worked on the dairy uh on in on sorry in dairy farms describe the conditions of your uh detention and what that brought to you um what that reminded you of uh fabric is of injustice you see them everywhere um I was prepared for worst case scenario so to be honest with you being in this prison uh was not as bad as I thought mentally um but the difficult parts was realizing this interconnectedness between injustices it reminded me of my uncles and specifically my uncle Abbid at some point when a guard shined the light through the squared window in the door and the light was so strong in my eyes and they remembered my uncle who had bloody eyes permanently um and then I thought where was your uncle my uncle was imprisoned in the Israeli prisons and now he he he he's no longer alive he was in two years ago that's correct he was born raised and died in a refugee camp the same refugee camp where I was born al yeah yeah and I had this realization when I was there i am now interconnected to three generations of my family my grandfather who was unjustly imprisoned my father and my uncles who were unjustly imprisoned and my cousins who were also unjustly imprisoned and now I can feel their pain you also lost your brother as well as other members of your family talk about where you were born talk about your family in the West Bank and in the Gaza what I am doing here in America this is exactly um the question that I hope for the government to ask and to look into rather than just labeling me uh what I've been protesting for is related to my firsthand life experience uh as a child um I buried my own brother when I was 8 years old he was 6 years old and my brother faced serious issues he was paralyzed because the Israeli army prevented my father from taking him to uh receive medical care the camp was under siege and then in the second inif when it started in 2000 I was 10 years old and I witnessed my best friend getting shot and killed in front of my eyes and the pain of injustice that you feel when you see just a kid who you loved so much be his life being taken away in a second is a painful experience but that wasn't it too my uncle on September 12 2001 after September 11 my uncle there was killed on the hands of the Israeli army as well where in Tamoon in fact between between uh between Al Farah refugee camp and Tammoon um the same town that five people were killed it's only five miles away actually 5 kilometers away about 3 miles away from the refugee camp the five people were just killed in the last day so it hits home um everything that I am seeing and I am witnessing i mean in the second and follow also I lost two cousins i was shot in my leg when I was 15 years old and some people would say oh what was happening and why those people were killed this does not what matters is that children live in pain in suffering in trauma and we have to see that for what it is and we cannot just justify the killing the murder the continuous occupation the apartheite the genocide we cannot justify it anymore we either have to be pro peace or pro war there is no third option enough is enough so so many people are suffering and for me many family members in the West Bank since October 7th for cousins in Gaza more than 30 of my extended family and I come here to Colombia and what I do I share my pain with the world and I say this is so painful the war must stop children are suffering the trauma is unbearable and what they do the American government and the extreme groups the pro-Israel extreme groups they want to silence me they don't want me to grieve they don't want me to share the pain they don't want me to share the loss they don't want me to ask for justice it doesn't matter if I'm doing it in the most peaceful nonviolent way or not they want to silence me you were president of the Colombia University Buddhist Association for two years what made you become a Buddhist i discovered Buddhism when I came to America and um what made me become Buddhist is the the practice of meditation and empathy that helped me with my pain and the trauma that I buried as a child so when I came to America for the first time in my life I was provided with a level of safety to feel safe and when you have that level of physical and emotional safety the trauma starts surfacing and Buddhism has helped me to center to calm my emotions and to be able to connect with the other even my oppressors even people who cause me harm and this is how I started my journey and dived deeper into Buddhism um until I led the Buddhist association at Colombia over these last few months the protests that have taken place across the country calling for the release of the detained students uh like yourself um have been massive and on April 20th protesters gathered at Union Square to call for your release the protest was organized by Israelis for peace uh this is Josh Drill an Israeli American master student at Columbia University to deport someone like Men sends a chilling message that peaceuilders are not welcome here it derails the very path we so desperately need and it actively stops Israelis and Palestinians from meeting as a peace collective we cannot allow this to happen we cannot allow this deport these deportations to happen they threaten our future at that protest I also spoke to the New York City controller Brad Lander who is running for mayor right now this is somebody who grew up in a refugee camp in the West Bank uh saw a friend be killed by an Israeli soldier and yet rather than turn to vengeance when you pick up a rock or a gun turn to Buddhism and becomes a peace activist and comes here and goes into synagogue speaking about empathy controller running for mayor Brad Lander also Zoran Mandani who's running for mayor has come out in support of you what was that like how did you experience that in prison um it might be uh too cheesy to say that I have never felt as much love and support as much as I felt when I was in the cell i was not able to see the full spectrum of support and uh of love and of protests but I um I heed about some of the action that was taking place and I have to say I was deeply moved by seeing the everybody who has mobilized and protested but more specifically by the Israeli and Jewish community in New York City and in America really like moving and raising their voices against my detention um also Judge Crawford noted his court had received more than 90 statements and letters i understand now it's well over a hundred from Vermont community members academic experts and professors many of them Jewish vouching for your character what did that mean to you Mosen it meant that I am heed that I am being seen that my advocacy and work for peace and for justice did not go for nothing all of this is the Trump administration uh went after you um saying you promoted anti-semitism what did Secretary of State Marco Rubio uh claimed in a memo that the New York Times obtained that your actions could quote potentially undermine the Middle East peace process your response i am not sure if they actually have a peace process if they have a peace process let them show us what the plan is what we are doing is we are protesting and we are standing against war we're asking for um America and for the rest of the world to abide by international law and human rights as a first step this government has been violating the basic principles of human rights and the basic principles that international law was established on they're violating this country's own laws the Lehey laws and if they are accusing the former senator of Vermont exactly and and uh what they what they are doing they're gaslighting the American people and they are pointing the wrong direction um my response to this is listen to the peacemakers who we have Palestinians Israelis Jews Muslims Americans everyone and see the fact and the reality for what it is what they're trying to do they're trying to distract from the real issue and the real issue is funding and supporting a genocide and dehumanizing Palestinians and seeing them as less of a value don't deserve equal rights as everybody else mosen Madawi can you talk about your dreams for the future starting with next week class Day is Monday i don't know if it was time for the 100th anniversary of Malcolm X's birthday but that is Monday May 19th graduation is Wednesday what does it mean for you to be here in New York graduating with your classmates this is uh a long waited for a journey this is the seed of hope that my uncle the has planted in me when I was 11 years old and when I was in deep level of pain after the loss and horror and the trauma that I felt and he said to me he said after the Nakba the 1948 we lost everything but our minds and our souls and he said education and hope is your only way and your path moving forward because we have nothing left and in honor of my uncle's spirit I continued studying really hard until I made it to this point despite of all of the obstacles with the Israeli occupation and now what it means to me it means that I can share this light of hope not only with my uncle's spirit that might be hovering above us but also with the children who are living in painful conditions in Gaza the children who lost their parents who lost their friends their family members who have been terrorized with all of the pain and the destruction and the bombing i tell them that there is a way moving forward and that way is education education is light education is hope and education is the path to move forward you're not only hoping to graduate next week walking with your classmates um but then you want to go on to SEIPA to the Colombia School of International and Public Affairs graduate school where you've been accepted the judge in Vermont says you should be able to be here in New York to continue your educational activities yes um this is also to fulfill the dream that I have the dream of peacemaking of conflict resolution this is the whole point I came to Colombia and this is the whole point why I am going to study at SEAL um the American government as it seems to me they don't want me to continue my education they didn't want me to graduate and they don't want me to get my master's degree i also have to share that what happens at Columbia University matters for the rest of America the Columbia University administration as I have been witnessing it has been participating in the deterioration and destruction of the democratic system they are not listening to their students the students have like the majority of the student body have voted to divest from war any entities that are supporting the apartheid and the genocide colombia University administration is not listening and in a matter of few days I will be walking and I would be walking with a conflict mixed feelings the feeling that I love this university that has given me tools to express my thoughts and to yearn and to achieve my dreams for freedom and for justice and the other feeling is that I feel deeply disappointed by the Columbia University administration and I know that it's going to continue to be a struggle while I am going to be finalizing my master's degree as you and Raa Ourk the Tus University student um and Baranssuri the Georgetown scholar are released uh others remain detained like Mahmood Khalil a judge in Vermont among those determining his fate what is your message to those still behind bars and those whose names we don't know i say um the same message that don't give up and don't give up on the idea of justice justice is inevitable it's a matter of time and don't give into despair what we are seeing with my release with Rome's release and with Dr uh Khan release those are light of hope and you will be next and we will be able to celebrate you very very soon the same message that the Gazan people have been sending to us we're gaining strength from them to see all of the destruction almost no buildings left in Gaza no schools universities that I'm going to graduate no no more universities for students to attend or to graduate from in Gaza a painful reality they are sending us a message that there is so much more to hope for than giving up on the idea of justice and surrendering to fear and to violence so I say stay strong and we will celebrate under the sun in a matter of very short time democracy Now is funded by viewers like you please give today at democracynow.org/give org/g" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="if Israel hypothetically decided we want to be in full compliance with international law what would it have to do in general there needs to be an end to racial discrimination and the domination by one racial group over another from the river to the sea taking center stage today is Ralph Wild a professor of international law at University College London he is probably best known for serving as senior counsel and advocate to the League of Arab States before the International Court of Justice wild argued before the court that Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territories is illegal and must end immediately ralph Wild thank you so much for joining us on Center Stage you argued in front of the judges of the International Court of Justice on behalf of the Arab League that Israel's presence on Palestinian territory is unlawful and must end immediately and that legal presentation got quite a lot of attention online it was described in some corners of the internet as a master class so we'd like to get the benefit of that for people who don't have a grounding in international law but who still want to know what the law says and what the law doesn't say can you sum up your arguments before the ICJ for us so the question that the court was addressing ended up being focused uh on the situation uh of the territories uh captured by Israel in 1967 which is of course only 22% of Palestine so within that uh limited framework the issue was what are the legal consequences of Israel's presence in that territory so we're talking about the Gaza Palestinian Gaza Strip and the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the court was considering is the presence in and of itself lawful does Israel have a legal right to even be there and also in the way Israel conducts its presence the way it behaves in Palestinian territory including the way it treats the Palestinian people is that lawful and the court determined uh uh that in the negative on both questions that Israel has no legal right to be there in the first place and must therefore withdraw and also that the conduct of the presence the conduct of the occupation is also violating international law so the opinion of the ICJ was that Israel and Israelis cannot be on Palestinian land that's right illegal on the land occupied since 1967 which is not the entirety of Palestinian land yes is that now binding international law that everyone must respect it was already the position in international law um the court was interpreting the existing law and determining what that law means so it amounts to an authoritative determination of what that law means by the uh the most distinguished uh jurists uh globally i want to make sure I get this right the binding versus non-binding because when I interview people who speak in defense of Israel and I bring up this advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice invariably they tell me &quot;Oh that's not minding.&quot; Yes the inference being it doesn't need to be respected well the law needs to be respected the law that the court determined uh uh the meaning of which the court determined in the advisory opinion needs to be uh complied with you opened your presentation your statement by saying &quot;Palestinians have been denied self-determination through and I quote a more than centurylong violent colonial racist effort to establish a nation state exclusively for the Jewish people in the land of mandatory Palestine.&quot; When you say racist is that a legal determination or is that a political statement in international law uh racial discrimination is unlawful and in general and then the uh a particular regime of uh domination by one group over another in a system of government and authority uh on the basis of racial domination is also unlawful as apartheite you use the word apartheite yes in your arguments the court in its advisory opinion did not what is the finding there the court uh clearly established that there was a violation uh of the relevant areas of international law uh without expressly referencing a partite as a a violation but nonetheless uh covering that uh without mentioning it in terms likewise when it came to um aggression in my reading of the opinion they did call it discrimination though discrimination and then they didn't specify whether it was racial religious or ethnic but in the way I read the opinion it's one of those three it's relig discrimination on one of those three grounds so the the the way that we can understand the court's decision is based on the arguments that were put before it which were all rooted in not only uh religious um discrimination which is also um uh the the situation but also discrimination on the grounds of race now if I try to cross-examine you I'm not going to be very successful i'm not a topflight international lawyer but what I can do is I can I I have read Israel's uh legal arguments that were put forward by uh Israeli the Israeli ambassador it's one-sided because it overlooks well dominating the other the Palestinians are not occupying uh Israeli land so uh the the by definition if the court's going to be considering the question of domination it it isn't going to be need needing to address any issue of the other side peacemaking has been scuttled on various occasions by the Palestinians themselves irrelevant to the issue of whether Israel has a right to dominate the Palestinian people it's a nonsear that's a uh introducing a consideration that has no bearing on the question of whether one uh racial group has a right to dominate another israel has a duty to protect its own citizens again uh irrelevant to the question of occupying Palestinian territory yes a duty to protect but not a duty to protect which involves the indefinite subjugation of an entire other of the racial group israel has valid long-standing historical ties to the land no legally no legally no i mean that's the claim it it doesn't have any legal foundation in in the League of Nations um uh uh covenant that was part of the Versail treaty the Palestine mandate um uh was supposed to be provisionally recognized as an independent state a state for everyone a single state for all the people on that land not a state for a particular racial group so the idea and Jew Israel is a a Jewish state by definition and there is no legal basis for a specifically Jewish state on that land in international law what is or would be Israel's strongest argument before a court of law for what to dominate the Palestinians to there is no argument for for for committing genocide i mean what what would be the what needs to be justified these come up often when I interview people who speak in defense of Israel let me let me Okay self-defense self Thank you okay you took the words out of my mouth this is the first thing that comes up yes so so let's go back to 1967 so why is Israel there there was a war between Israel and three of its uh uh neighbors israel started that war and it was a war started preemptively uh illegally because states cannot uh uh use force lawfully in non-immed immediately imminent anticipatory self-defense as a result of that illegal war Israel captures the territory it has no right a state has no right to retain control over territory simply for security purposes and the right of self-defense therefore is inapplicable to that kind of action states have to deal with security threats nonforcibly when it comes to the extr territorial use of force unless they are at risk of an actual or an imminent attack and Israel was not in 1967 it used force anyway and of course the clue is in the name it was over in six days there was no longer any threat in so far as there was a threat it was it was removed at that through that action well they they of course would disagree that there was no longer any threat but what about in the context i don't think Israel would disagree that after the six- day war there was no then immediate threat of attack from the three Arab states so Israel should have withdrawn at that moment on the seventh day there should have been a retreat because there was no legal basis to maintain the control over the West Bank and the Gaza Strip what about in the context of Gaza today and I'm taking you beyond obviously uh the the remit of the ICJ's advisory opinion but Israel today yes says more than ever that it is acting in Gaza in self-defense following the attacks uh by Hamas in Israel on October the 7th so Israel has been using force in Gaza since 1967 continuously and on on uh the on October the 6th two years ago Israel was already exercising military authority over Gaza and as I say illegally in that situation when a state is using force illegally if there is violent resistance to that illegal use of force the state's use of force does not somehow then become lawful as a means of defense to that defense there is no defense against defense if Israel hypothetically decided we want to be in full compliance with international law what would it have to do in general there needs to be an end to racial discrimination and the domination by one racial group over another from the river to the sea it needs to be a the return of all of the Palestinian people who were forcibly displaced and and have been displaced from that land um over for for a century um that that's also a legal require displaced since when you're talking 1948 or 1967 no return since even before 1948 certainly from uh you know the Nakba and 1947 1948 and onwards a legal right of return uh in international law that is vested in all of those people and their descendants the the remaining uh uh non-Jewish Palestinian people who were not forcibly displaced in 1948 uh but who are treated in various ways as secondclass citizens within Israel around 17% of the citizenry of Israel um that's unlawful and that illegal discriminatory treatment that constitutes apartheite needs to end there needs to be equality and then when it comes to the extension of Israeli rule into the remaining 22% of mandatory Palestine the West Bank and including East Jerusalem and and the Gaza Strip there needs to be a complete withdrawal immediately um uh the removal of all settlements and settlers and the provision of compensation to the Palestinian people for all of the um uh the harm that they have suffered um since 1948 this part gets lost u in discussions about the advisory opinion it does mention compensation in so far as it addresses the occ uh the 67 onwards yes the requirement of compensation as well as withdrawal so land that has been taken again according to international law as it is laid out in this advisory opinion land that has been taken from Palestinians by Israel since 19667 needs to be returned to them and where that is not materially possible they need to there is no excuse for not um uh returning uh the control of the land so Israel doesn't have the option to maybe uh withdraw from some of the land and retain some of the land and then just provide compensation that's not uh ac legally permissible what I mean by compensation is compensation for all of the other loss suffered by the Palestinian people as a result of the unlawful occupation there are 15 judges at the International Court of Justice that um rule were that rule on these opinions 15 judges had to decide say yay or nay essentially they could provide a dissenting voice but my point is this decision was not close it the judges were overwhelmingly yes um in favor of saying that Israel's presence in Palestinian territory is illegal and must end this was not close it was not and likewise there was an overwhelming uh support in the UN General Assembly affirming the the the finding of the uh um the ICJ uh in all key respects so the UN General Assembly which represents all the countries in the world one country one vote passed a resolution at the UNGA demanding that Israel respect this advisory opinion and that means demanding that within a year Israel leave Mhm occupied Palestinian territory cease all settlements and remove all settlers that was voted in September of 2024 so we're we're about The clock is ticking yeah the clock is ticking nobody thinks this is about to happen and there are no signs that this is about to happen states were also told in the advisory opinion and in the general assembly resolution that the illegality uh involved in the occupation has important consequences for them because of the fundamental nature of the rules of international law that are being violated in international law in a decentralized legal system where there is no global sovereign who can enforce uh the law unlike in a national legal system the role of individual states becomes much more important as agents of enforcement if you are any third party not Israel any other country in the world yes whether it's the Fiji Islands France or Venezuela how are you supposed to put yourself in compliance with that opinion and with international law first and foremost they must take positive steps in so far as it's possible to bring the illegality to an end and then they also have negative obligations uh not to recognize the illegal situation and also not to provide any aid or assistance to it concretely what does that look like positive steps to bring the situation to an end would include sanctions against Israel aimed at influencing Israel's behavior uh non-recognition involves uh states uh uh for example uh not doing anything when it comes to their diplomatic relations with Israel uh which involves expressly or implicitly um uh recognizing not only that Israel isn't sovereign over this territory but even that Israel doesn't have any right to be there in the first place so states should not be engaging in diplomatic relations with Israel and so that includes for example uh the current practice of affirming that somehow a right of self-defense would justify Israel's continued presence any state who affirms that position is violating the duty that they have not to recognize the validity and the legality of Israel's presence in that territory but you're not saying that countries for instance are required by international law to shutter their embassies in Israel that's not what we're talking about they should not have uh embassies uh or any diplomatic representation to Israel on occupied territory for example in in East Jerusalem they shouldn't even have diplomatic premises in Jerusalem at all because the status of Jerusalem as a whole not just East Jerusalem but also West Jerusalem still is to be uh determined and Israel is not sovereign in West Jerusalem hence most states who recognize Israel as a state do not have their embassies to Israel in Jerusalem even in West Jerusalem because of that legal requirement that they cannot recognize uh a an invalid claim uh to sovereignty over that city what's international law good for if it doesn't protect people from abuses and doesn't work in the way it's supposed to or was was invented and was dreamed of so it's a limited system the new and the importance is not to make overblown claims for its potential but not to throw the baby out with the bathwater and say that it is worthless the better approach is modesty in the expectations um one has for um the significance of international law which I think then should have consequences in terms of um the extent to which time and effort should be spent uh utilizing um legal avenues of redress as opposed to other avenues which may include forcible revolutionary avenues news explain actually in international law um the Palestinian people have a right to resist a right of uh to defend themselves from their uh uh subjugation and oppression and to do so violently if necessary people are not of course cannot be expected to um simply put faith in a system that is not protecting them and be prevented because of the existence of that system the ability to take matters into their own hands including through violent means so that's the challenge if global society wishes to promote peace then it has to enable justice you're saying if international law isn't strong enough or effective enough in guaranteeing people's rights people will fight for those rights international law permits that actually so for example if we think about another situation the right uh of self-defense that a state the people of a state might have so if we think about the discussions around uh for example Russia's uh uh war in Ukraine um international law permits the rise of self-defense if the situation is dealt with peacefully and through the application of international law then of course the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian state would not have a right to use uh force against Russia the same logic applies to a non-state self-determination uh uh grouping of people the Palestinian people in an analogous situation so there is an argument that Israel makes and the US sometimes makes it too you're not going to like it which is in essence international law is getting in the way of resolving the Israel Palestine conflict it is because it is getting in the way of diplomacy politics and dealmaking and that's where a solution is going to be found in those arenas not in international law so says Israel so stop the lawsuits and engage in dealmaking yeah but I think the question is what is international law preventing when it comes uh to to the issue of um ending the uh uh subjugation of the Palestinian people nothing but what international law is preventing is for Israel um stealing more of Palestinian land and that's why Israel doesn't like it people within Israel or supporters of Israel are against international law because international law is against um Zionist domination uh on a on a racist basis of the Palestinian people and the theft of Palestinian land so of course they're against international law when it comes to deal making when we drill down on the question of these supposed deals what they usually involve is a further loss of um the land of of the uh the um the 22% of Palestine that was left after the proclamation of the state of Israel in 1948 that Israel somehow wants even more of that land like extending from 78% into some of that 22% and the idea idea being that the Palestinian people in rejecting that are somehow impediments to peace did you have any strong personal or political views about Israel Palestine before you became invested in this um as an international lawyer i think I approached the situation with an open mind but also perhaps with a um a fairly typical European bias through my ed the education that I'd had which had not taught me anything about the situation um and and in general or indeed it's more specifically the British role in it whereas I had been taught about the shower about the Holocaust and um the onesided nature of my education I think led to a situation where I um had to educate myself and what I uncovered was shocking in terms of the uh consequences for the Palestinian people of the establishment of the state of Israel and the role of the UK in that and the role of other western states in supporting it ever since ralph Wild thank you

          <attvalue for="3" value="Benjamin Netanyahu is doubling down. Despite growing international anger, in the last hour he has declared that all of Gaza will be under Israel's control by the end of its offensive. &#10;&#10;It's now two days since Israel partially lifted its 11-week blockade, allowing some aid trucks back into Gaza. But the UN says it still hasn't been given access to even that small amount of aid, to distribute it. And Israel has continued to pound the Strip, killing at least 82 people.&#10;&#10;Since Israel ended the two-month ceasefire on 18 March, more than 3,500 people have been killed and almost 10,000 injured. That's according to medical sources in Gaza. &#10;&#10;More than 700 of those people were killed and more than 2,000 injured in just the last week, as Israel ramped up its offensive against Hamas, launching a new ground operation at the weekend. &#10;&#10;A warning, some images in this report are distressing.&#10;&#10;(Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe) &#10;&#10;-----------------------  &#10;&#10;Follow us:&#10;Facebook -   / channel4news  &#10;Twitter -   / channel4news  &#10;TikTok -   / c4news  &#10;Instagram -   / channel4news  " />

          <attvalue for="7" value="bread is life but life turns to death so quickly in Gaza it was midm morning when the drone struck the people in the bakery queue now people were gathering not for sustenance but to try to save the injured a daily occurrence in Gaza as common as eating bread in most parts of the world we were waiting for bread and they suddenly attacked us with two missiles what happened and why I don't know this is injustice find a solution for us or kill us all at once at Jabalia Hospital they were receiving the dead and injured for an Israeli attack on a house a few hours earlier day after day scenes like these have finally provoked some of Israel's allies to say enough but that it seems has done nothing to dampen the Israeli government's determination to continue their attacks we started a structured plan for the next phase hamas will pay the price for its defiance and face overwhelming firepower we will expand our maneuvers capture more territory and destroy terrorist infrastructure until Hamas is defeated the international community is especially concerned about the prospect of starvation soup kitchens have run out of everything and after six weeks of all aid being blocked the tiny amount the Israeli government is now allowing in hasn't yet reached the hungry my daughter wakes up and tells me &quot;I'm hungry i want to eat i don't know what I can do for her i came to the soup kitchen to fill my pot there were crowds of people all hungry they need to eat all we want is food we're really hungry there's no bread and she says she wants some we now crave a simple loaf of bread at the KM Shalom crossing point into Gaza Israelis who would send aid in and those who would stop it were shouting at each other i'm here as part of the T Savesa movement and we're here to block the aid that's going in directly to Hamas in Gaza the military arrested a few of the anti- aid protesters such passion to stop even a grain of wheat from getting to Israel's enemies and no pity for those who suffer as a result well earlier I spoke to Simcha Rothman he's a member of the Knesset for the National Religious Party that's part of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition now this is an extreme right-wing party their leader has called basically for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza and they are very reluctant to allow in any aid israel until now has more uh protection of human life and children in Gaza come on these children are dying of hunger because you have not been allowing aid in this is extreme they are not dying of hunger and in any conflict that that England was involved in the past in this kind of environment were more innocent civilians killed and suffering hunger and everything else mr smudri your leader has said that the people of Gaza should leave that the aim is to get them to leave it's a combat zone when there is a combat zone when there is a terrorist organization who is hiding behind civilians you should let them run away and if you are blocking them you're aiding and abading a terrorist organization using them as human shields that's not a moral thing to do and if if the United Kingdom want to be a humanitarian country that cares about human rights and human lives they would help the Gazans who wants to leave the area leave and not aid kamas to use them as human shields i've got an idea why don't you let them come over the border into Israel why don't they flee into our enemies because they are the children are your enemies they are they are our enemies and according to international treaties about about uh refugees in the time of war you don't let them uh uh um conquer your country with refugees well that is the kind of voice Benjamin Netanyahu is hearing from within his own coalition parties without whom his coalition would collapse and on the other hand these increasing cries from his European allies to say that there is no military purpose to this new onslaught and not allowing in enough aid will create an absolute humanitarian crisis worse than we have seen so far so everyone now is waiting for the Americans for President Trump he has said he wants this war to come to an end will he now put more pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu and say like the Europeans this really can't go on any longer lindsay thanks very much well aid agencies have warned that the extremely limited supply of aid allowed in via the Keram Shalom crossing this week is a drop in the ocean following Israel's 78-day blockade the total of 98 trucks which Israel says it allowed through on Monday and Tuesday is just a fraction of the 500 a day that were going in before October 2023 which the UN says is the bare minimum needed i spoke to Cla Monira emergency coordinator for the medical organization Doctors Without Borders who's in dear Albala in central Gaza i asked her to describe the humanitarian situation there well it was a humanitarian catastrophe when I arrived and that was more than three weeks ago now and it's been getting worse and worse every day the last few days have been um beyond words because thousands of people are forced to leave their homes and they're literally just living on the streets where they're not safe either so give us some examples if you can of the kind of desperate situations you're seeing in terms of children in terms of food just give us some examples it's already a desperate situation for this hospital trying to operate but the people inside um are suffering from the most horrific thirdderee burns that you can imagine as a result of air strikes and this is children i'm talking about children that lost their limbs as well so they're um they're in agony israel says it has these 93 trucks that entered Gaza yesterday what is your understanding of where those trucks are now we know that some trucks have entered but these trucks cannot be delivering aid to the people because we're being forced into doing this in a way that's not safe so we're not having access to unhindered aid to supply it impartially to the population we're being told where to provide this aid we're having to use roads that are not safe and the population are being drawn to this they're being pushed out of their homes and then their homes are destroyed and it's just another tool in the ethnic cleansing that's been going on here for now 19 months you believe that's what it is ethnic cleansing yes we can see that the Israeli authorities they are not providing the conditions for life that is needed for the Palestinian people the destruction of homes and infrastructure the blockade of aid that just continues and then even the targeting of hospitals which is against uh international humanitarian law um all of these conditions israel denies that's what's happening and they're saying that this aid plan that they've got with the US so private contractors transporting the aid but then aid groups distributing it that's what they say is happening um they say they're trying to prevent Hamas looting the aid do you see any justification to that argument we can't see any evidence of that on the ground what we know is when we can bring the aid in we monitor that very carefully and it goes to the people that need it we I see in our hospitals are women and children um that are absolutely desperate and that are coming to us for help so we can see when we have control of this aid we can give it to people in the way that it's meant to be done according to humanitarian principles do you feel angry do you feel um desparing how would you characterize your your feelings about what you're seeing on the ground i I just can't believe that the world is standing by watching this and yes it's an outrage um it's beyond belief and beyond words and the fact that I'm here seeing the suffering of people at a scale I've never seen before and the world is doing nothing then yes it's very hard to process and to believe that um it could be stopped cla Monira thank you very much for joining us thank you you're welcome well joining me now is the Labour MP Dame Emily Thornbury who's chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee do you think there has been a change in the government's position and how much is it because of pressure from people like you i think there is a change in the government position and I think it's right that they have changed it so they have now talked about no longer negotiating a trade agreement with the Israelis um there is talk of uh of sanctioning Bengavir and Smatri which has got to be a good thing um they're the two far right even more far right than the rest of the farright government in Israel ministers who are really I think driving some of the worst things that are happening um so things like that are definitely a change and I think the unequivocal condemnation from the prime minister in conjunction with the president of France and the new prime minister of Canada was very powerful um not powerful enough it hasn't stopped it i think the only thing that will stop it in the end is President Trump has to pick up the phone and has to tell the prime minister of of uh Israel Netanyahu that this is enough stop this is what the Israeli I mean the Israeli people wanted 70% of the Israeli people want the war to stop you Netanyahu was on his own and it needs to be clear to him that he has no friends in this is it regrettable that starvation has finally drawn a response that the bombing by their tens of thousands to death didn't I think that it had to stop a long time ago i mean if you remember when there was the ceasefire that started at the beginning of the year the previous president made it quite clear that that was an agreement that was ready to go last summer and there was no excuse really for it to continue from last summer until January you know there was a there was a there was a there was a peace agreement both sides had agreed to it and then Netanyahu was the one who said &quot;No we're not going to sign it and wanted to continue with the war.&quot; And the trouble is is that we have a leader in Israel who just wants a perpetual war as far as we can see there's no down ramp for him he just wants to keep going and and the side effect for him obviously is that he remains in power whilst that happens and do you think Britain should and will recognize a state of Palestine in the coming months i think it's about time it really is high time that we recognize the state of Palestine i think that what should happen is that there's going to be a conference in New York in June it's uh it's being held by the Saudi Arabians and the French we're going and I think that what we should do is with the French we're both we're both the signatures to the Sykes Pico agreement which 100 years ago set out the boundaries of the Middle East as we see it today and so for the two countries who essentially were involved in that founding document of current Middle East to to recognize Palestine would be powerful it's not enough by itself but I think it would be the beginning of we recognize Palestine and then we we work with um you know many international allies and we put together a piece and we say to the Israelis with the Americans absolutely crucially with the Americans have to sign up to this too this is the way forward there is no other way forward this is what the international community says you have no alternative Netanyahu and your government you don't have any other idea nothing that you're prepared to tell us nothing that is by any stretch of the imagination acceptable so this is what we have to do and for the Israeli people to be safe and secure you have to have you have to be at peace with your neighbors and you will not be at peace with your neighbors without there being a Palestinian state if Britain recognizes a Palestinian state in the coming months it will be doing what Hamas wants it to do what will be the answer from Netanyahu and others who say you're on the side of Hamas well I don't really care what what what what what Netanyahu says what what I care about is doing the right thing what I care about is doing the right thing and what I care about is trying to get us a peace we have to get a peace and we have to get a peace that lasts and and I' and as far as I'm concerned this is the only way forward that I can see you know we have to make sure that there is now a ceasefire that aid is allowed in we cannot allow anyone else to die this is just completely and totally unacceptable and then once we get the pause we need to push on we need to push on with a peace that will last a peace which is fair which means a Palestinian state and an Israeli state and that is the only way forward and frankly I have never I've listened to many many people on this issue my select committee is doing an inquiry into it and we have yet to hear a coherent case for anything other than that and it is about time it happened emily Thornley thank you very much" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="Disponible jusqu'au 15/10/2027&#10;En Israël, la droite ultranationaliste religieuse gagne du terrain, un an après les massacres du 7 octobre. Ses représentants sont au gouvernement depuis 2022, son discours infuse dans la société et les médias. &#10;&#10;Yekutiel Epstein est un Israélien de 17 ans. Il se revendique du courant de pensée du rabbin Meir Kahana, un Israélo-Américain radical dont le parti Kach a été interdit dans les années 90 en Israël pour racisme. Longtemps marginales, ses idées reviennent en force aujourd'hui, plus de 30 ans après sa mort. Sur le terrain, les réseaux sociaux et jusqu'au parlement israélien, Yekutiel Epstein et ses alliés de l'extrême droite poussent pour étendre la souveraineté israélienne sur l'ensemble des territoires occupés et pour en expulser les Palestiniens. En ligne de mire se dessine pour cette droite le rêve d'un Grand Israël, bien au-delà des frontières de l'Etat actuel.  &#10;La société israélienne, encore profondément meurtrie par les attaques du 7 octobre, est divisée et anesthésiée. Depuis la Cisjordanie, où il va à l'école, ou les abords de Gaza où il espère bientôt construire une colonie, Yekutiel Epstein incarne cette vision du monde, où la religion sert des intérêts nationalistes et violents.&#10;&#10;#israel #documentaire #arte &#10;&#10;Abonnez-vous à la chaîne ARTE    / @arte  &#10;&#10;Suivez-nous sur les réseaux !&#10;Facebook :   / artetv  &#10;Twitter :   / artefr  &#10;Instagram :   / artefr  " />

Had they come into the kibbutz, or was that the first day that people... &gt;&gt; This is the first day. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Yeah. (voiceover): I met Israel Lender in Kfar Aza, near the border with Gaza, in the weeks after the Hamas massacre that left around 60 of his neighbors dead. &gt;&gt; This is my house. You see now they covered all the... glasses that was broken. From here, they can see all the streets. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: So they came here, they went on your roof? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: So they could have a view of the rest of the kibbutz. &gt;&gt; Yes, yes, yes. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: He told me Hamas gunmen stormed his house shortly after sunrise, and turned it into a sniper's nest. He hid with his wife in a nearby room for 36 hours. &gt;&gt; The door was closed, the windows was closed, and the glass was open. So I could hear everything. (distorted speech and gunfire) (indistinct shouting, radios beeping) (indistinct shouting) &gt;&gt; (speaking Arabic) &gt;&gt; (screaming) (boom echoing) &gt;&gt; Terrible. You can't, you can't, you can't... think about it. ♪ ♪ You can't believe it. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Mm. &gt;&gt; You can't believe it. You can't imagine it. What they did here... &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Mm. &gt;&gt; Nobody can do. They build a big wall. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; They said to us, 40, 40 meters in the ground, with the sensors that nobody can-- and six meter up. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: They said &quot;This will protect you.&quot; &gt;&gt; Yeah. We believe that this can protect us. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: They just broke through. They came through. &gt;&gt; They came through. ♪ ♪ &gt;&gt; (speaking Arabic): &gt;&gt; SWAINE: On the morning of October 7, more than a thousand fighters from the Palestinian militant group Hamas broke through the 20-foot-high barrier that has long-separated Israel from the Gaza Strip, a densely populated enclave that is home to more than two million Palestinians. The 37-mile long barrier was completed in 1996 and is outfitted with cutting-edge surveillance tools, a deep underground concrete layer to block Hamas tunnels, and remote-control machine guns above ground. After a billion-dollar upgrade in 2021, Israeli officials dubbed it &quot;the Iron Wall.&quot; &gt;&gt; (speaking Hebrew): (explosion booming) &gt;&gt; SWAINE: But in a matter of minutes, Hamas was able to breach the fence in around 30 locations-- the start of what would become the deadliest assault in Israel's history. At least 1,200 people were killed; 240 were taken hostage. ♪ ♪ The attack triggered a catastrophic war in Gaza that has killed thousands of Palestinians so far. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas, which has controlled the territory for years. &gt;&gt; Broadly, the fighters entered at 6:40 A.M. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Uh-huh. And that's the same incident, just from the other side of the street. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; SWAINE (voiceover): Soon after the Oct 7 attack, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; began investigating how the so-called Iron Wall could have failed so spectacularly. Our team of reporters analyzed hundreds of videos, photos, and audio recordings from before, during, and after the attack. With &quot;Frontline,&quot; we spoke with witnesses on the ground. &gt;&gt; We got hit with the first RPG. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: And examined maps and planning documents recovered from Hamas fighters. We took the visual evidence from October 7 and mapped it across southern Israel and inside the Gaza Strip, sometimes using the position of the sun to estimate when key events occurred. What we found was a fragile barrier that gave Israel a false sense of security. leaving it blind to its own vulnerabilities and to the meticulous plan taking shape on the other side of the fence. (indistinct shouting) &gt;&gt; SWAINE: The attack began at dawn, around 6:15 A.M. Videos recovered from Hamas fighters show them setting off from Gaza, and heading toward the fence, which has long been resented by Gazans who've been penned in by it. (Hamas fighters shouting in Arabic) &gt;&gt; SWAINE: People along the road cheered them on. (explosion booming) (shouting in Arabic) (rockets firing) &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Around 6:30, as fighters made their way to the fence, Hamas began firing a barrage of thousands of rockets at targets across the barrier. ♪ ♪ In just the first five minutes of the attack, there were red alerts for more than 30 communities near the Israeli side of the wall. In Kibbutz Erez, less than a mile from the barrier, Ben Sadan, a member of the community security, had just woken up for an early morning bike ride. &gt;&gt; (speaking Hebrew): &gt;&gt; SWAINE: So over there, we can see Gaza. &gt;&gt; (in English): There. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Yeah. And the, the security fence... &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: You can see it running along there, and there's the towers with the machine gun. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's the border. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Yeah. &gt;&gt; On the left side, it's Gaza. On the right side, Israeli. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: And I think some of the earliest rockets came over just around here. &gt;&gt; All around, all around. (in Hebrew): &gt;&gt; SWAINE: From this hilltop, the next wave of Hamas's attack became visible. Reconnaissance fighters on paragliders, soaring over the wall under cover from the rockets. Videos we obtained show them landing in communities inside Israel, the culmination of a plan that had been years in the making-- and that, as we discovered, had been brewing in plain sight. &gt;&gt; When I first saw this video, I was like, &quot;Oh, this is video from day of. How did they get this produced out so quickly?&quot; And then, once you look closer... (clicks tongue) Oh. It's obviously a training video. ♪ ♪ &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Our investigation found multiple videos recorded by Hamas detailing their planning measures. Some were posted on social media before the attack, visible to all. We found videos of militants training for attacks on mock-ups of Israeli compounds. Videos posted soon after the attack showed they had also been practicing the use of paragliders. Hamas had also been expanding their training camps, activity that was visible in widely available online maps. But this evidence was largely ignored or dismissed by Israeli intelligence and the military, our investigation found. ♪ ♪ Michael Milshtein is a former head of the Palestinian department for Israel's military intelligence. He has been strongly critical of their missteps leading up to October 7. Israel knew about, about the whole plans, because, you know, Hamas didn't hide them. It was on public, on their internet sites, on their TV, everywhere. From the operational tactic point of view, October the 7th, we-- Israel, IDF-- didn't... face any, any surprise over there. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Were there specific warnings that something like this could be coming? &gt;&gt; Well, according to reports in the Israeli media, there was very focused reports about the whole plan, the, the whole offensive plan, that promoted... and actually the data, the reports itself, were known, even to senior ranks, senior figures in IDF intelligence. But the basic assumption, the basic assessment in the intelligence, was that those are only trainings or theoretic... theoretic attempts. But we are not speaking about something which is very feasible. ♪ ♪ (Hamas fighters speaking Arabic) &gt;&gt; SWAINE: The heart of Hamas's operation on October 7 was the stage that their videos call &quot;the blinding plan,&quot; aimed at severing the connections to Israel's surveillance and security system. ♪ ♪ Israel uses seven &quot;Skystar&quot; surveillance balloons to monitor hotspots along the Gaza fence. The balloons carry a long-range, 360-degree camera. But the model of camera that Israel uses on the balloons is relatively old and is no longer made. On the morning of October 7, we found that three of the seven balloons had been shut down for maintenance. (indistinct shouting, weapons firing) Video from the attack shows one of the remaining balloons. A source told us it had been cut loose by the militants. The balloons are part of a system that includes surveillance and weapons towers. Visuals and other data from the towers are fed into monitoring centers inside Israel, including one near Re'im. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how many combat soldiers they are. If they don't know where the enemy is, they can't fight the enemy. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Rotem Horowitz spent two years monitoring the camera feeds at Re'im before completing her military service last spring. Three of the balloons were out of service on the day, they weren't working. &gt;&gt; Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: The cameras needed to be repaired, but they're old and out of production. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So... &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Is that a big problem? &gt;&gt; I personally think it is. They were first brought into use in 2006, and... ever since then, it's kind of been the same system. It doesn't work very well during rough weather, like, only when weather conditions are perfect. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Do you remember people sending up warnings that, you know, these balloons are getting out of date, some of them aren't working, they're not working in bad weather? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know that the surveillance operators on the balloon have... as long as I've been there, you know, I served there-- we've been complaining about how the balloons see and, like, in general, their quality. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Mm. &gt;&gt; Ever since I can remember. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: The balloons are supplemented by surveillance towers containing HD cameras, laser and infrared sensors, and radars, and can see people for almost six miles away, according to the manufacturer. Other structures, called Sentry Tech towers, are topped with Samson weapons stations, which feature machine guns and sensors. They're positioned every few hundred yards along the barrier and outside key military facilities, and are nicknamed &quot;Roeh-Yoreh,&quot; Hebrew for &quot;Sees Fires&quot;. Once the sensors send an intruder alert, IDF personnel can fire the 50-caliber machine guns by remote control. &gt;&gt; We have to really make sure that we can firmly see a weapon and a threat before we can actually do anything with it. So usually, like, if someone's getting close to the fence, we use it to kind of-- not shoot at them, but shoot near them to kind of, like, scare them away. Like, &quot;Don't come close.&quot; You know, we're not going to touch them if they don't come close. The moment they're showing they're a threat and they're coming close, that's when we start to act. &gt;&gt; (speaking Hebrew): &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Video from one of the sentry towers on October 7 shows it firing on a group of Hamas fighters as they approached the fence near Kissufim. But that's not what happened elsewhere. Hamas fighters had come prepared to evade the towers, and documents recovered after the attack reveal a deep and detailed knowledge of Israeli defenses. In this one, they specifically note the locations of surveillance systems. Fighters also carried with them open source satellite imagery annotated with coded locations of key structures along the wall. Armed with this information, Hamas carried out their blinding plan using unmanned drones equipped with cameras, to drop explosives on installations like this surveillance tower in the community of Be'eri. Of the sentry tech towers marked on the map, we verified videos of at least two of them being attacked. This one, located near Kfar Aza, was attacked twice by Hamas drones. Incendiary explosive devices with fuses were dropped on the camera and weapons system. Some of the training videos we found posted online show that these drone maneuvers had been well-rehearsed. (bomb bursting) Other videos from the 7th show towers being attacked with rocket-propelled grenades and gunfire. It's hard to tell just from the video evidence how badly damaged the installations were. Hi, thank you so much for your time, I really appreciate you coming and seeing us tonight... (voiceover): But retired Colonel Dany Tirza, the former head of the Israeli military's fence administration, told me Hamas's blinding plan drastically undermined Israel's ability to respond to the attack. &gt;&gt; That was a real failure, because they succeeded to cut the command system. The command system of all this area... &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; ...was built on one control system, and they succeeded to cut it. And therefore, we couldn't use helicopters, because according to the Israeli system, the helicopters cannot shoot if there is not someone on the ground that show them where are your forces, where are the other side forces. So they came, but they couldn't shoot, because they didn't know who and what is going on there. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: In 2021, when the latest upgrade... was unveiled, some of the political and military leaders made very firm, quite bold, claims for the barrier. They said, &quot;This will protect &quot;the residents in the south. Hamas will not get in.&quot; And... Was that a mistake, to promise those things? &gt;&gt; Of course it was a mistake. We really thought that we are building a very good infrastructure that will help to save the lives of the Israelis. Unfortunately, it didn't work. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: He said the attack exposed a fundamental misconception about the fence. &gt;&gt; It was built against people that will try to cross it. It wasn't built against army or against a lot of people that are coming in one time. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Were you surprised-- you, personally-- surprised at how quickly they were able to blast through and make it into the bases and beyond? &gt;&gt; I myself was not surprised that they crossed it so quickly, because defense is not built for such fighting. It was built for another thing. If you want to stop an army, you are doing it with army tools. If you want to stop one, two, three terrorists, you're doing it with soft tools, like what we did. We didn't thought that there will come a terror army from the other side, that were crossing at the same time, big groups, and we were not prepared for it. ♪ ♪ &gt;&gt; SWAINE: The Israeli government says Hamas broke through the fence in around 30 locations. We obtained videos from 14 of them. ♪ ♪ The videos show trained Hamas fighters using a range of explosives and munitions to blow holes in the fence and its concrete barriers. (explosion blasting) (indistinct yelling) ♪ ♪ It took them only minutes. ♪ ♪ By around 6:40 A.M., Israel's Iron Wall had largely crumbled. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ In the weeks that have followed, Israel's military and intelligence establishments have come under intense criticism. A spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces, Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner, agreed to speak with me at a military base in Tel Aviv. Hamas has published several training videos which appear to show fighters in the months before practicing specific tactics that were then used on the day, blowing up fences, paragliding, and so on. Did Israel not see this? &gt;&gt; I mean, we're looking at what exactly transpired before the 7th of October, and there will be a time when the IDF will be doing that soul searching that is required, and the IDF will review that, and those that need to take responsibility will have to take responsibility. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: What do you think October 7 says about the integrity of that barrier? &gt;&gt; So, the barrier itself is a concept that was perceived to be a strong line of defense. And any line of defense can only withhold a certain amount of pressure. I think the question is not necessarily what is the barrier, but what was the threat assessment? And these are the types of questions that we will be asking. These are the types of questions that, that the answers to the residents of those towns of the Kibbutzim, we owe them... clarification, and, and... accountability for the failure of not the fence, but the whole concept of operations. And this, I think, is what the IDF will be looking into when we... when the war is over. ♪ ♪ (Hamas fighters speaking indistinctly) &gt;&gt; SWAINE: The Hamas fighters that broke through the fence that morning were bound for the military bases and communities along the border. (gunfire) ♪ ♪ One group headed for Kibbutz Erez, where Ben Sadan and the rest of his security team had already armed themselves. And watched with dismay as the fighters kept coming. &gt;&gt; (speaking Hebrew): &gt;&gt; SWAINE: And they're carrying weapons? &gt;&gt; SWAINE: What kinds of things are they carrying? &gt;&gt; SWAINE: How many of them were there, and how many of your men were there? &gt;&gt; SWAINE: He told me the combat lasted for three hours. After these few hours of fighting, what happened next? ♪ ♪ &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Sadah and his team had avoided the potential massacre. &gt;&gt; Breaking news out of Israel... &gt;&gt; Chaos erupting in Israel... &gt;&gt; SWAINE: But other communities were overrun. &gt;&gt; Hamas militants currently attacking citizens... &gt;&gt; Shooting at people on the streets, attacking troops... &gt;&gt; SWAINE: At 7:01, the first Hamas gunmen broke through the gate at Kfar Aza. &gt;&gt; We are in kibbutz Kfar Aza. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: More than 250 others would follow throughout the morning. &gt;&gt; You can see this massacre. It smells of death here. ♪ ♪ &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Some of the fighters wore body cameras, and the videos recovered later show the rampage through the kibbutz. &gt;&gt; (speaking Arabic) (distant weapons firing) ♪ ♪ &gt;&gt; So this is my place. &gt;&gt; SWAINE: Yeah.

          <attvalue for="7" value="It’s morning on January 19th, 1991, and a pair of F-15C Eagles are on an escort mission over Iraq as part of operation Desert Storm. Captain Cesar “Rico” Rodriguez and his wingman, Captain Craig “Моle” Underhill are clearing the skies ahead of a formation of 36 aircraft tasked with striking targets near Baghdad. Behind them there are waves of F-16s making their runs, diving with 2 thousand pound general purpose bombs. They release them and the ordnance drops straight onto the Iraqi ammunition depots. Giant explosions rise from the desert. They're expecting anti-aircraft missiles and the F-16’s pull hard up releasing chaff and flares at the same time. But instead of missiles the Iraqi Air Force has dispatched 2 pairs of the most advanced fighters at their disposal, MiG-29 Fulcrums. Outnumbered, the Iraqis have been keeping their distance, searching for an opportunity to strike when they are told of two F-15s... Perfect targets. It’s their chance and a pair of Fulcrums races to intercept. In the F-15 Rico gets a message from his AWACS controller, Mark White. “Rico, you have two hostile contacts, one bearing 0-4-0 for 3-5, second is 3-4-0 for 6-5.” “Roger, we’ll take the 0-4-0.” Rico chooses the most threatening target and they turn to engage. The F-15s' front-facing radars detect the contact and it appears on their screen. &quot;Contact.&quot; But it's not the only warning. On another screen a “29” appears. It’s his Radar Warning Receiver or RWR, a device that tells him when enemy radars can spot him. &quot;I'm being painted. MiG-29.&quot; &quot;I see it.&quot; Rico and Mole brace for action. The two pairs of enemies, both fourth-generation fighters, have each other in their sights and heading towards each other in a supersonic joust. Rico selects an AIM-7 Sparrow missile. But the Iraqis have a plan. They dive far below the F-15s, attempting to use the ground clutter to conceal themselves from the radar. But it doesn't work. Aboard his F-15, Rico sees the single fuzzy contact split into two well-defined targets. “I got you. It’s two versus two.” Rico selects one of the contacts, and locks it in. Aboard the Fulcrum, the pilot sees his radar warning receiver light up with the wail of a lock alert. But the Iraqis have yet another ace up their sleeve. They bank to the side and suddenly the warnings go silent. Rico’s finger hovers over the weapons release button when the radar contacts suddenly vanish from his screen. &quot;I lost it.&quot; It’s a blindspot in the F-15’s radar, objects moving perpendicular to them are invisible, and the MiG-29s are exploiting it perfectly. Rico is frustrated, but it’s a known tactic. The enemy reappears on radar 12 nautical miles away. &quot;Contact.&quot; He locks it in one more time, but doesn't fire. The AIM-7 Sparrow needs him to maintain lock throughout the missile’s entire flight. And he knows the enemy are going to reenter the blind spot before the missile has a chance to catch them. Once again, the enemy disappears. &quot;Lost it again.&quot; The MiG-29s keep maneuvering across the sky toying with the F15’s radar, &quot;Contact.&quot; constantly blinking in and out from Rico’s screen, keeping 12 nautical miles of separation. &quot;Lost it again.&quot; Rico can see what they’re doing, the Fulcrums are dragging them along. Over at the AWACS, Mark White keeps an eye on the situation. As the F-15s make their move, they leave the airspace that Mark is responsible for. And following protocol, he hands over Rico and Mole to another AWACS controller. Rico and Mole keep up the chase across the sky when suddenly their RWR beeps with alarm and starts filling with detections up ahead. It’s an entire field of S-125 Neva surface-to-air missiles set up to defend Baghdad. The enemy is trying to pull them into a killing field. “They are dragging us into the city’s anti-air.” “What are we going to do?” Rico checks in with the strike force and listens to the F-16s making their runs. If he and his wingman fly away, then the F-16s will be definitely intercepted by the MiGs. He makes a daring choice. “Hold position. Keep pushing the bandits away until the strikes are done, then we can get out of here.” They hold their altitude and deliberately continue heading towards the enemy trap, buying the strike force the time it needs. The RWR clicks every time the enemy radars scan the F-15s and they hear them getting more frequent by the second. But the Iraqis still have a cunning plan. They know the Americans can see the missiles. They are not the trap. They are the distraction. A third MiG-29 charges towards the F15s from their left side, out of view from the F-15’s front-facing radar and with its own radar turned off so as to not appear in the F-15’s RWR. Despite the fight no longer in his area of responsibility, in his AWACS, Mark White continues to take glances at the developing situation. He sees the new enemy approaching the scene and immediately realizes the danger. But for some reason the F-15s are not evading the incoming contact. They keep flying straight even as the bandit gets within 18 nautical miles. White gets nervous. It’s well within the range of the R-27 missiles. 16 miles and there’s still no reaction from the F-15s. He thinks about saying something on the radio, but he worries that if he disturbs them in the middle of battle he could make the situation worse. 15 miles and still no reaction. 14 miles. White decides to act. “Pop up contacts. 3-3-0 degrees for 13 miles.&quot; It’s right in the nick of time. Rico hears the call and instantly drops his fuel tanks and pulls hard towards the new contact, with vapor covering his wings. The moment his nose points towards the incoming Fulcrum it appears on his radar &quot;Bogey, 8 miles out.&quot; Just 8 miles away, well inside the range of each other’s missiles. At the same time, the Iraqi pilot, flying blind without his radar, is informed the Americans are right in front of him. “You’re in range.” “Engaging.” He turns on his radar and Rico appears on his screen. With this act, the ominous &quot;29&quot; appears on Rico’s RWR. The two cutting edge fighters are now aware of one another and they are approaching at supersonic speeds. Rico selects the target on his display and locks it in, but he doesn't fire. The Rules of Engagement are that all contacts detected within 10 miles must be identified visually in case it’s a friendly F-117 Nighthawk. Even with the &quot;29&quot; on the RWR and the imminent danger, Rico holds fire and orders Mole to run friend or foe identification on the contact. But there’s no time. The Iraqi selects Rico’s aircraft and locks him. Rico’s RWR screams with a lock alert. “I’m getting spiked!” He immediately turns upside down and dives releasing radar-reflective chaff. “I’m getting low! The terrain will confuse its targeting system!” But it doesn’t work. The RWR continues screaming in his ear, warning him of impending doom as he races down from 30,000 feet at the speed of sound. Rico whips his head left and right, desperate to spot the enemy. Mole locks the target, his finger hovering over the weapons release button as he runs an identification procedure with the help of intelligence aircraft. The seconds feel eternal as they finally clear him to engage. He's given the all-clear and presses the button. “Fox one!” The AIM-7 Sparrow shoots off from under the F-15 in a plume of smoke. Rico sees it streak across the sky, the smoke trail passing between his tails. He follows the smoke trail with his eyes and finally sees the MiG-29 aiming his nose down towards him. But it never gets to fire. The Sparrow rushes in and strikes its square on the nose. There's a giant flash and the MiG-29 disintegrates, tearing apart into a black smudge of oil and parts. &quot;Splash one.&quot; A wave of relief washes over Rico as he pulls out from the dive at just 500 feet high. But over at the AWACS, White can see it’s not over. “Second group, north, ten miles!” Rico scans the skies. He considers turning away. By now the strike package of F-16s is already heading home, so they have no reason to hang about. But the enemy is too close for comfort. They could be shot from behind. They need to fight. Rico turns north and the enemy appears on his screen. It’s just beyond 10 miles, so he’s clear to shoot it down. He runs an identification procedure. It’s hostile. He selects the contact on his radar screen and locks the target. In the enemy plane, the Iraqi hears the lock alert and he breaks into a sharp evasive maneuver. But it makes no difference. Rico’s lock holds strong as his finger hovers over the button. &quot;He lights up as a diamond on my scope.&quot; &quot;Say again?&quot; “It goes from a solid radar contact to a diamond, which tells me he's friendly.” Mole’s systems have identified the contact as a friendly aircraft. In that moment, Mole is overtaken by a cold sense of dread. But Rico is confident. It has to be another MiG. But he needs to prove it with his eyes. The two prepare for the fight. Rico elects to identify the target and Mole gets ready to take the shot. Rico races towards the enemy which is coming straight towards and above him. He keeps low, letting the bogey get closer. Then he pulls up, engines burning at full throttle. He can see the belly of the bogey right in front of him, but it's still hard to tell what it is with the bright sky as background. He holds his F-15 in its path until… Rico’s F-15 roars within 50 feet of the bandit. And as he does he finally gets a good view of the enemy’s top side, with its green camouflage which is proudly displaying the Iraqi flag. &quot;It's a MiG-29!&quot; Rico makes a wide turn left as he soars over the MiG. Looking down through his canopy he sees the MiG performing a flat turn left, holding his altitude. In that instant he spots an opening, and the fancy shooter-eye formation goes out the window. It's a dogfight. He turns upside-down and pulls hard on the stick, cutting into the MiG’s circle. He’s crushed by 10 Gs of force, pushing the F-15 to its limits. He sees the MiG roar past in front of him and he pulls hard left to follow. Rico sees the MiG flying away, but he knows he has the advantage. The MiG pushes down, trading altitude for speed. Rico follows him, spiraling down towards the desert floor as the paths of both jets converge. Rico sees a MiG scream through the merge. He’s getting closer. He pulls hard, feeling the blood rushing down from his head as he does everything to bring the Fulcrum into his sights. Far above, Mole can see his leader tangling with the enemy and spots an opportunity. “I can come in.” “Stand by.” Rico can feel it. This one is his. He sees the MiG coming back and they roar past one another. He almost has him, but they can't keep up this trajectory as they are rapidly running out of altitude. Rico pulls with all he has, powering through 10 Gs of force. Through the crushing Gs he sees the beautiful sight of the Fulcrum moving into his sights. Rico selects an AIM-9 Sidewinder and starts to pull aiming ahead of the MiG for the best chance of impact. But the Iraqi pilot sees it and in a desperate last ditch attempt he turns upside down and pulls hard towards the ground. Rico is ready for the Iraqi to try something but he is shocked to see the MiG dive straight for the sand. He doesn’t even think of following and pulls up to the left, letting the MiG go. The Iraqi pilot starts to pull up and he is crushed by extreme G forces as his plane continues towards the ground. The sand fills his windshield as he pushes the afterburners to maximum, his MiG screaming as it pulls beyond its G limits. He is doing everything to bring the nose up. But it's not enough. And the MiG 29 Fulcrum and its Iraqi pilot crash into the desert sand. Rico’s heart races as he comes down from the adrenaline high. He's won. Mole appears two miles off his right. &quot;Tactical, right side.&quot; And Rico can finally afford to relax. &quot;Let's go home.&quot; Cesar Rico Rodriguez would tally up 3 victories total in his career, making him tied for the top spot of MiG victories for pilots after Vietnam. We hope both pilots like our film. &quot;It was close today. Two same-generation fighters.&quot; &quot;True, not like when our F-16s ate Hawks for breakfast. Watch the full film here.&quot;" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="- The Mossad has executed some of the most audacious spy missions on earth, going deep undercover into hostile territory, catching terror masterminds who seem untouchable and duping militant groups into buying rigged electronics through a ruse so elaborate no one suspects a thing until they explode without warning. The Mossad waits until terrorists feel safe, and then it reminds them that they aren't. - We are a global production company. We write the screenplay. We're the directors, we're the producers. We're the main actors. The world is our stage. - So how has the Mossad managed to take down some of its most elusive targets? Successful spies are masters of tradecraft. Strategies that help them gather intel without getting caught. It can take months or even years. But a good spy is patient. A good spy can wait over a decade for the payoff, and then when the target least expects it, the Mossad sends a little message. We're watching. We're waiting. There is no escape. No one is out of reach. Not even a ghost. Even when he was alive, Imad Mughniyeh was a ghost. And not the friendly kind. He'd always been extreme. As a teenager in Beirut, he controlled a savage gang that prowled the streets enforcing Islamic law, mostly by beating up drug suppliers and female escorts. But he had bigger ambitions. By the time he turned 21, he was second-in-command of a new shadowy terror organization, Hezbollah. Within months of assuming the position, he masterminded two blasts that claimed hundreds of lives. - 191 Marines dead in the explosion at their headquarters at the Beirut Airport. - He oversaw some of the most barbaric abductions the West had ever seen. And his reach extended well beyond his home turf. Mughniyeh ruthlessly targeted Israelis and Jews around the world. Israel had to eliminate him. But Mughniyeh was crafty, really crafty. All Israel had to identify him was one washed out photo. For over 20 years, no spy agency could catch him, not even the Mossad, which employed some creative strategies to lure him out of hiding like assassinating his brother, another Hezbollah operative. Mossad waited for Mughniyeh at the funeral. But Mughniyeh was too crafty to show up. His brother was buried without him, and the Mossad seemed to be out of luck. He was a ghost, a puff of smoke that no one could pin down. Until Hezbollah made a mistake. In 2004, Israel took out Ghaleb Awali, a senior Hezbollah commander. In a touching show of sentimentality, Hezbollah's propaganda department memorialized him in a short film. Bad move. Because the Mossad got their hands on the video, analyzing every frame for new information. They didn't expect to spot a ghost on camera, but there he was, standing next to Hezbollah's leader, Imad Mughniyeh in the flesh. It was the first sighting of Mughniyeh in decades. Now, Israel knew what he looked like, and they knew that if he was near Nasrallah he was probably somewhere in Lebanon. Where? And how would they get to him? As they pondered ways to reach Mughniyeh, Mossad pulled off a huge win. They hacked into the Iranian government system, which kept files on its allies and proxies, including Mughniyeh. And that's how the Mossad found out he'd been living in Damascus under an assumed name since 2006. It was the breakthrough they'd been waiting for. It was also a problem because Syria was a target country, an enemy state where undercover operations are especially dangerous. Organizing an assassination attempt would require lots of reconnaissance trips into Syria. But Syrian security was vigilant and sophisticated, and everyone knew what they do to a captured Israeli spy. It was too risky for Israeli agents to make the trips into Damascus. So the Mossad did something highly unusual. They ask the Americans for help. But the CIA has a strict policy of not picking fights with neutral countries. And at the time, Syria and the US had diplomatic relations. They couldn't just carry out an assassination on Syrian soil willy-nilly, or could they? Turns out they could. The US had their own reasons for wanting Mughniyeh gone, including the fact that he'd been sending men into Iraq to carry out strikes against American troops. So the CIA agreed to help under two conditions. One, the Israelis could target Mughniyeh and only Mughniyeh. That meant that if anyone else was in the vicinity, the whole operation was off. And two, US agents would help find Mughniyeh, but the Mossad would be the ones to take him out. The Israelis agreed. It was time for an exorcism. As American agents tailed Mughniyeh, they found the pious family man had a weakness. Syrian security services had supplied him with three women to be his special friends. He would drive to see them on his own, a surprising lapse in security for someone who was otherwise totally obsessed with staying out of danger. Because Mughniyeh was no dummy he knew he was a target, and he and his bodyguards were careful to check often for detonators inside and under his car, but they didn't think to check the case holding the spare tire in the back of a slick silver SUV. Bingo. This was it. If the Mossad could get some kind of blast material into the tire cover, Mughniyeh was going down. For months, Mughniyeh had a constant tail, watching and waiting for the right moment when his car was unattended. One night, while Mughniyeh was getting cozy with one of his lady friends, Mossad agents swooped in. They exchanged his tire cover for a new one, which had a special device that would eliminate Mughniyeh without causing any other casualties. The weapon was ready. Now they just needed everything else to fall into place. For weeks, Mossad operatives waited on edge. They almost detonated the charge 32 times, stopping at the last minute when Mughniyeh got into his car too quickly or when he got too close to another person. They didn't forget their agreement with the CIA. The target was Mughniyeh and only Mughniyeh. The 33rd time was the charm. On chilly February evening, Mughniyeh left the meeting with Syrian intelligence and other Hezbollah officers alone. This was it. As they drew closer to his car, the agents detonated. Mughniyeh was finally gone. After 30 years, they'd gotten the ghost. This wasn't Israel's first time executing a daring mission in enemy territory. They'd done it before and they would do it again, but the results would bring some unanticipated scrutiny. Dubai is the so-called playground of the rich in the Middle East. It's home to some eye-wateringly tall skyscrapers, improbable indoor ski hills, and the pristine turquoise waters of the Persian Gulf. It's also where some of Earth's most notorious militants conduct their business. Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh was one of these militants. Israel had wanted him for two decades, ever since the '80s when he and an accomplice had kidnapped and murdered two Israeli soldiers. Mahmoud was cold as ice. He admitted that his only regret was that he hadn't shot the gun himself. 20 years later, Mahmoud was coordinating weapon shipments for Hamas, running the network that moved Iranian weapons into the Gaza Strip, weapons that Hamas used to attack Israelis. It was time to get rid of him. The question was where and how? Mahmoud spent a lot of his time in countries like Syria, China, Iran, and Sudan. Not exactly Israel's buddies, but Mahmoud was a frequent flyer to another destination, Dubai. In 2009, the Emirati government was none too friendly to Israel. Dubai was risky, but it was the best of bad options. Tons of foreigners passed through the Emirate, which meant Mossad operatives could easily pose as tourists. And Dubai security wasn't as sophisticated as Iran's or Syria's. The Israelis figured that no investigation would get very far. Mistake number one. In 2009, Mossad deployed a hit squad to spy on Mahmoud and learn his habits. They entered the UAE undercover using false identities and foreign passports, passports that in some cases belonged to real people who had no idea that the Mossad had borrowed their documents. A few months later, they broke out those same foreign passports and returned to Dubai, this time to eliminate Mahmoud by poison. The mission was a failure. All the poison ended up doing was making Mahmoud feel a little unwell. The good news was that he never realized it was the Israelis that were the source of his illness. The bad news was that he was still at large and the Mossad was determined that the next time they tried to eliminate him, nothing could go wrong. So in January 2010, Israel's hit squad landed in Dubai for the third time, using the same foreign names and passports as before. Mistake number two. The hit squad wasn't sure where Mahmoud would stay, so they broke into small teams and checked into different hotels. Some paid in cash, but other agents paid with debit cards issued by one specific company, a company that was run by an Israeli. Mistake number three. Because the team was scattered around the city, they had to communicate with each other in real-time, so they used cell phones. But cell phones are very easy to track. So they didn't call each other directly, instead, the agents called a central switchboard in Austria, which connected them automatically to each other. Mistake number four. Any well-trained spy knows the part of successful tradecraft is switching up their look, new wigs, different hats, glasses, and even a costume or two. The hit squad had this technique down pat. They came prepared with disguises. Some posed as tennis players. One guy even entered a bathroom bald as a cue ball and left it with the head of luxurious hair. But even if they could evade the attention of other people, there were silent eyes watching them all the time. Dubai's hotels were absolutely chock-full of security cameras. Cameras that saw and recorded everything. Mistake number five. Just six hours after Mahmoud landed in Dubai, the hit squad broke into his hotel room. It took 20 minutes to accomplish the mission. After locking the room from the inside, the hit squad hightailed it outta the hotel and onto the flights. Mahmoud lay in bed after what looked like a heart attack. At first, the hotel security officers who found him thought they had just stumbled on a random tourist who had the misfortune to croak on vacation. The authorities didn't know it was Hamas' weapons guy. They only knew Mahmoud under the false name he traveled under. His body went to the morgue, and nobody thought about it again. Until Hamas started to get suspicious. You don't just ignore Hamas when they call. So when Mahmoud stopped picking up his phone, they knew something was off. One of their agents searched police stations and morgues until he found Mahmoud. And now the Dubai authorities were in for a nasty surprise. That random tourist not actually a tourist. That heart attack wasn't a heart attack at all, but the work of the Mossad. Dubai Security Services were furious at Hamas for using Dubai as a base for illegal activity, and at the Mossad, which had just assassinated someone in their city. They scoured airline passenger lists, looking for anyone who had traveled to Dubai around the same time as Mahmoud. A series of foreign names kept appearing and reappearing. Authorities crosschecked these names against hotel guest lists. And those silent eyes, Dubai's huge network of security cameras, gave them another piece of the puzzle. The faces of the agents. With the names of the agents in hand, investigators looked at data, a lot of data. Data like debit cards that were traced back to a company headed by an Israeli, phone calls that were all mysteriously routed to the same switchboard in Austria. Information that made it glaringly obvious that a group of people seemingly scattered around Dubai had actually acted in unison. Dubai's lead investigator was able to cobble together all the security footage to retrace the footsteps of the hit squad, almost to the minute. This grainy, silent movie wasn't gonna win any Oscars, but the evidence was irrefutable. Dubai wasn't the only angry government. Had the Mossad used real passports or had forged them? To the countries involved, it didn't really matter. They felt manipulated. And Israel couldn't afford to alienate their allies. The diplomatic fallout from this episode was intense. - France condemns this assassination. Murder is no way to carry out international relations. - The Dubai passports incidents also constitutes a clear and direct breach of confidential undertakings between Australia and Israel dating back some years. - On paper, the mission was a success. They'd eliminated Mahmoud temporarily interrupting Hamas' flow of weapons, but the operation was a bust. The Mossad had burned a number of agents and exposed its tradecraft secrets, which weren't even that sophisticated to begin with. It was a mortifying episode, but a useful one, because Israel learned a lot about what not to do. And though it took over a decade, they eventually put those lessons to good use. Remember this video from June 2024? I'm not a betting guy, but I'm willing to put money on the fact that over the next few years, Israeli secret agents are going to go on some pretty wild missions. After all, the Israeli government has vowed to take down every single person who planned the attack of October 7th. Turns out that was a pretty safe bet. Here's the story of how a broken air conditioner almost foiled Israel's operation to get rid of a top October 7th Mastermind. Ismail Haniyeh had been involved with Hamas since he graduated from university. By the time the terror group wrested control of the Gaza Strip in a bloody coup, he was in charge. For a decade, he ruled Hamas with an iron fist. But by 2017, he traded the Gaza Strip for Qatar, one of the richest countries in the Middle East. As millions of Gazans struggled to put food on the table, Haniyeh lived in the lap of luxury with a net worth of $4 billion. What a leader, right? As for why Haniyeh was enjoying the good life in Qatar, well, it's complicated. Qatar has hosted Hamas' leadership since 2012 at the request of the United States, which wanted an easier way to talk to the terror group. Israel agreed to respect this arrangement. That meant attacking any Hamas operatives on Qatari soil was absolutely out of the question. And Israel was not about to repeat the Dubai debacle and risk alienating its most important ally, the United States. If they were going to get Haniyeh, they'd have to wait for him to leave Qatar. Problem was, Haniyeh spent most of his time in Turkey, Russia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, highly dangerous countries for Israeli operatives. And when he was visiting Iran, Haniyeh wasn't exactly couch surfing. He stayed in one of Tehran's most heavily guarded hotels, the guest house of the Islamic Republic's notorious military, the IRGC. The IRGC is powerful, dangerous and sophisticated. But even they weren't immune to Israel's tradecraft. In May 2024, an unexpected event sparked one of the Mossad's most ambitious assassinations. On a cool spring day, Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi's helicopter unexpectedly crashed into a remote mountainside. No one in Israel or most of Iran was shedding any tears over Raisi. He was a monster, responsible for executing several thousand political prisoners in Iran. But right away, Israel realized they had a golden opportunity. The helicopter crash meant Iran would hold the state funeral, and shortly thereafter, the inauguration of a new president. And as a key figure in Iran's terror proxy network, Ismail Haniyeh would undoubtedly attend both events, which left Israel with just weeks to plan the assassination that would finally take Haniyeh out. Someone working for the Israeli smuggled the device into the IRGC guest house carefully positioned in Haniyeh's room. Some news reports say the device was placed soon after Raisi's crash, while others claim it was placed a couple months later, just moments before the detonation. We still don't know who or how or when, but we do know this, as the inauguration festivities wound down and Haniyeh made his way back to his room, a team of agents was waiting on tender hooks for go time. And then, the AC broke down? July in the Middle East is hot. Even the bad guys need to stay cool. So when Haniyeh left to get his air conditioning fixed, the team feared he was switching rooms. A twist of fate which would have led to a very different ending to this. But after a while, Haniyeh came back, but he didn't have long to enjoy the room because in the early hours of July 31st, 2024, a boom shook the IRGC guest house. And the man who had mastermind of the 10/7 attacks, the man responsible for tens of thousands of de*ths was finally gone. But the w*r was far from over. Since that horrific day in October, Israel had been fighting on multiple fronts. At first, they focused on Hamas, but as Hezbollah rockets reigned down on Israel's northern communities driving 60,000 Israelis from their homes, it was clear that the situation couldn't continue. It was time to take down Hezbollah. Back in 2014, Taylor Swift had just dropped her hit single, Shake It Off. Russia was hosting the Winter Olympics. And Israel, usually known for its high tech, was in the business of making clunky walkie-talkies for a very special customer. That customer was Hezbollah who were in the market for walkie-talkies for their fighters. They're the perfect method of communication on a battlefield, instant and secure. So Israel seized on the opportunity. Their plan was simple. Copy a popular Japanese design Hezbollah liked, replace some of the battery components with tiny blast devices, and convince Hezbollah to buy them. Easy-peasy. Using a complex network of shell companies, Israel sold 16,000 walkie-talkies to Hezbollah operatives. And then, for 10 years, they sat back and waited. Like KGB sleeper spies from the Cold War, the walkie-talkie seemed innocent. In reality, there were deadly weapons ready to activate at a moment's notice. Fast forward a few years, a female Mossad agent had a bright idea. Why not do the same with pagers? Rig some unassuming looking pagers, and voila, you have a handheld, remote controlled, exploding device. Pagers are the dinosaurs of communication devices. For the most part, they're a museum piece. - That belongs in a museum! - But for a terror group like Hezbollah, pagers had a lot of appeal. Pagers don't have much function other than receiving a message. But their limited utility also means that they can't be electronically hacked, perfect for a group that doesn't wanna be tracked. Initially, the Mossad said, nah, not enough people in Hezbollah were using pagers to warrant the effort it would take to make and distribute them. But over time, Hezbollah's higher ups were getting antsy about using cell phones, which could be hacked and tracked. It was too big a risk. So Israel jumped. They even got a team to flood Arab social media with fake news. about Israel's amazing ability to hack cell phones, trying to fool Hezbollah into looking for more secure alternatives like pagers. The Mossad knew that Hezbollah would be suspicious of new technology companies trying to sell them products. So Israel had to work within their existing supplier system. But the suppliers couldn't know either. Everything had to seem above board, which meant Mossad had to go deep. Hezbollah got its devices from a Taiwanese technology company. So Israel set up a shell company based in Budapest, which bought a licensing agreement from Gold Apollo to manufacture a new line of beepers. This new product line was bigger, more rugged and more durable, and it came with a little surprise embedded in the battery. - What a surprise. - Israeli engineers spent months testing and tweaking the pagers, which were designed to maim rather than kill. The blast radius was tiny. Only the person carrying the beeper would be injured. It was the most targeted attack the world had ever seen. The Mossad left nothing to chance. They tested which ringtones would be most compelling and how long it would take for someone to check their beeper after being paged. To convince Hezbollah that the pagers were a worthwhile investment, Israel tapped again into the power of social media, creating slick ads that played on YouTube. Even legitimate customers were interested, but the Israelis dissuaded them by quoting absurdly high prices. Of course, these customers had no idea they were really talking to the Mossad. Meanwhile, the sales team made Hezbollah an offer they couldn't refuse. The first batch of beepers were free, and they'd offer a discount if they bought in bulk. Hezbollah fell for it, hook, line, and sinker. By the fall of 2023, they'd handed out thousands of pagers to their operatives, but Israel was on borrowed time. One of Hezbollah's top technicians was starting to get suspicious that the walkie-talkies Hezbollah had bought 10 years earlier might actually be incendiary devices. He was asking one too many questions. So Israel shut him down permanently with an airstrike. And mid-September 2024, the now or never moment came. Israel's military intelligence learned that Hezbollah had asked Iran to examine the pagers, worried they might contain explosives. It was time to act. Five days later, in the middle of the afternoon, an encrypted message went out to the rigged pagers triggering the hidden detonators. Seconds later, a wave of explosions sounded all across Lebanon. The country was in shock, but Israel wasn't done yet. A few days later, they activated the walkie-talkies. 10 years of waiting were over. Hundreds of Hezbollah's fighters were taken out of action. Their communications network was shattered. And in one of the biggest blows to the terror organization, Israel capitalized on Hezbollah's weakness to finally assassinate its elusive leader, Hassan Nasrallah. It was the stuff of spy thrillers. So unlikely, it seems impossible. But that's the Mossad's MO, they have to remain adaptable, they have to think outside the box, they have to strike when they're least expected. Not every mission succeeds, but when they do, they remind Israel's enemies that Jews fight back, and that the Mossad is always watching, working overtime to protect their tiny nation." />

getting in and out of fortified camps the ancient Romans used tunnels the Mongols used them Ivan the Terrible used tunnels to dig under the walls of the city of Kazan and bring it down so the tunnels under Gaza are not a new military challenge but they remain one of the world's most difficult it's actually difficult to believe that with all the modern technology and inventions that go into powering our 21st century War Machine something as ancient and simple as a tunnel could still pose such a big challenge to the world's most advanced armies in 2001 Osama Bin Laden outlasted a Relentless us bombing campaign by hulling up in the tunnels and caves of torab Bora even 15,000lb bombs and 100 air strikes in a day failed to break through let's look at the first world war armies on both sides were digging and counter digging Switzerland for example built an entire series of military fortresses under the Swiss Alps but the West also realized that regular soldiers could not fight at their best inside tunnels in 1914 the British army started getting in Miners and training them for military tasks Britain created special Bantam troops these were soldiers who were shorter and thinner than average in fact smaller size was one natural advantage that Asian armies had when they faced Western Invaders Invaders who were bigger in size strength and number tunnels became almost a symbol of resistance against a stronger enemy Japan used tunnels extensively to defend Pacific Islands against Allied invasion years later the Viet Kong fighting the US in Vietnam used tunnels to evade their enemies and launch surprise attacks and these were extremely effective attacks they cost the US heavily despite the fact that America had its own underground Warfare specialists in Vietnam they were known as the tunnel rats but the tunnel rats were up against a vast underground Network and an enemy that was agile inventive and determined the vietcong's network of tunnels was incredibly sophisticated they had armories hospitals mes hols manufacturing centers and storage facilities all underground and there were different varieties squads siiz tunnels which were generally less than 6 ft deep and 100 ft long there were company-sized tunnels which were WI rer but did not have too many compartments and then there were Battalion siiz tunnels which could be as deep as 50 ft underground and sometimes had up to four different levels many key connecting parts of these tunnels were as narrow as possible the walls were angled it was almost impossible for an American Soldier to fit through many of these tunnels and they were extensively booby trapped they were hard to spot from outside they had camouflaged airshafts disguised entrances almost imp pregnable even the B-52 bombs that the Americans dropped could not destroy many of the Vietcong tunnels and all of this 60 years ago so it's not difficult to imagine the level of sophistication that may exist in the tunnels beneath Gaza the tunnels under Gaza were built before Hamas had even formed and they were built by Smugglers who used them since the 1980s for smuggling goods under the the Egypt border most of the Earth in Gaza is rich in clay except near the coast which means that it's easy to dig through and does not need complex supports now over time the Palestinians realized that the tunnels could have a military use and they extended the underground Network Hamas expanded and utilized the tunnel system that they inherited with an eye to strategy and since they were operating beneath territory that they controlled they didn't have to worry about noise or vibrations alerting the enemy so the tunnels expanded quickly so much so that when Israel attacked Gaza in 2014 the IDF was stunned at the extent of the tunnels which was reported at the time to have surpassed 100 kilm Israel began setting up specialized units for underground Warfare fairly early starting with the combat engineers known as yaham set up in the '90s this unit was almost doubled in size after the 2 14 Gaza W that's when Israel really came face to face with the complex challenge of the modern Hamas tunnels now Israel has a commander unit called samur or the weasels they tunnel Warfare Specialists trained in undercover assault techniques leading the IDF when they enter the Gaza tunnels now the first thing to crack for Israel are the entrances to the tunnels these could be in the tens of thousands in Gaza most of them are hidden they're inside homes garage es shops warehouses under rubbish dumps and now probably under heaps of rubble now what Israel has been doing is using drones for 24/7 surveillance they're using Advanced software to analyze movement patterns and they're also using human intelligence from informers on the ground to build up a map of these crucial entrances they don't know it all but they're hoping that they know enough most of the Gaza tunnels have several entrances at each end so that if even some are discovered and blocked others will stay usable underground the tunnels are all interconnected so that even if one entire section is blocked off that may not make a big impact it's this interconnected underground web that Israel needs to map underground where GPS doesn't work satellite signals cannot reach Israel will have to fall back on magnetic sensors and INE movement trackers plus they can't use lights because that would give away their presence so night vision goggles are crucial and the US has been shipping hundreds of these to Israel preparing for just this battle underground in the darkness Israel's underground units won't have radio communication with the surface so again they may have to rely on Old School methods like field telones that's technology from over a 100 years ago Israel soldiers will have to stop at every Junction of the tunnel to map their positions secure the area and leave some troops to defend against counterattacks every time they find a shaft they'll need to figure out if the area above is controlled by Hamas or has been taken by Israel because an attack could come from above at any moment now imagine repeating this 50 times 100 times yes Israel has drones and robots but their movement is limited and signals underground may not be effective and then there will be the obstacles underground booby traps IEDs smoke bombs to suffocate Intruders may be triggered by motion sensors or light sensors Hamas has had years to set up hidden cameras underground detection devices to alert them of intruders and wires and cables that may trigger explosions if they're cut this means the entire section of the tunnel could collapse with one wrong move trapping Israel's forces it's not only Hamas who may use toxic gases underground Israel might also use chemical agents such as tear gas then there's the option of using water to flood the tunnels it's been used in the past Egypt for example poured sewage water into the smuggers tunnels going into Gaza from its side of the Border but this is such a huge tunnel complex that some experts have said there's simply not enough water in Gaza there's been a lot of Buzz about Israel's sponge bomb a device that creates rapidly expanding foam when triggered which hardens to form a kind of plug that will block a tunnel but the chemicals in this sponge bomb are dangerous ones and there have been reports of Israeli soldiers blinded after mishandling the bomb the simplest solution to many people may simp simply seem to be blowing up the tunnels but such a massive engineering feat during an active war is next to Impossible the whole of Gaza May quite simply [Music] collapse first there's the question of size there's no room underground to maneuver machine guns and rifles then there's the darkness The Flash after firing an ordinary pistol will leave Israeli troops temporarily blind especially especially if they're using night vision goggles then there's a question of space standing in a tunnel only one person can fire at a time at most two if one person kneels and the other person stands you're likely to be so close to the enemy that using something like a grenade could harm your own side as well the most likely option for the Israelis will be the smaller caliber weapons with sound suppressors that will prevent muzzle flashes again they'll be falling back on age-old weapons like knives tried and tested over Generations in hand-to-hand combat in this Arena every step could mean death" />

YES, LAUGHED ABOUT TOMORROW'S. &gt;&gt; ANNIVERSARY OF D-DAY, THEREBY TAKING. &gt;&gt; HIS NEW. &gt;&gt; PLACE IN HISTORY AS THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY TO. &gt;&gt; LAUGH ABOUT. &gt;&gt; D-DAY. &gt;&gt; A DAY WHEN NO ONE IN THE TRUMP FAMILY WAS KILLED. BUT 2501 AMERICAN SOLDIERS WERE KILLED. &gt;&gt; STORMING THE BEACHES OF NORMANDY. &gt;&gt; ON THIS COUNTRY'S MOST HEROIC. &gt;&gt; AND HISTORY CHANGING SINGLE DAY. &gt;&gt; OF WARFARE, U.S. ARMY GENERAL.

JUNE 6TH, 1944, FOR THE D-DAY INVASION. &gt;&gt; OF FRANCE AT THE. &gt;&gt; ENGLISH CHANNEL, WHICH WAS FRANCE BEING. &gt;&gt; THEN. &gt;&gt; CONTROLLED BY. &gt;&gt; NAZI GERMANY. &gt;&gt; THE SUCCESS OF THE D-DAY INVASION WAS THE. &gt;&gt; BEGINNING OF THE END OF. &gt;&gt; WORLD WAR TWO, AND. THE BEGINNING OF. &gt;&gt; THE END OF THE REIGN OF TERROR AND GENOCIDE IN GERMANY. &gt;&gt; BY ADOLF HITLER. WHO MANY GERMAN GENERALS. &gt;&gt; HAD ALREADY. &gt;&gt; BEEN PLOTTING. &gt;&gt; TO. ASSASSINATE BEFORE. D-DAY AND AFTER D-DAY. &gt;&gt; GERMAN CHANCELLOR BROUGHT UP. D-DAY ANNIVERSARY. &gt;&gt; AS AN EXAMPLE. &gt;&gt; OF THE. &gt;&gt; KIND OF ALLIED EFFORT THAT IS NEEDED. NOW TO SAVE UKRAINE. &gt;&gt; WE ALL ARE. &gt;&gt; LOOKING FOR MEASURES AND FOR INSTRUMENTS TO BRING THIS TERRIBLE. &gt;&gt; WAR TO AN END. &gt;&gt; AND MAY I REMIND. &gt;&gt; YOU THAT WE ARE. &gt;&gt; HAVING JUNE. &gt;&gt; 6TH TOMORROW. &gt;&gt; THIS IS. &gt;&gt; D-DAY ANNIVERSARY, WHEN THE. AMERICANS ONCE ENDED A WAR IN EUROPE. AND I THINK. THIS IS IN YOUR. &gt;&gt; HAND, IN SPECIFIC. IN OURS. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS NOT A PLEASANT DAY FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS NOT NOT A PLEASANT. &gt;&gt; WELL, NOT A GREAT. &gt;&gt; IN THE LONG. &gt;&gt; RUN. MR. PRESIDENT, THIS. WAS THE LIBERATION. &gt;&gt; OF MY COUNTRY. FROM NAZI DICTATORSHIP. &gt;&gt; SO THAT'S TRUE. &gt;&gt; AND WE KNOW WHAT WE OWE YOU. BUT THIS IS. &gt;&gt; THE REASON WHY. &gt;&gt; I'M SAYING. &gt;&gt; THAT AMERICA. &gt;&gt; IS. &gt;&gt; AGAIN. &gt;&gt; IN A VERY. &gt;&gt; STRONG POSITION. &gt;&gt; TO DO. SOMETHING ON. &gt;&gt; THIS WAR. &gt;&gt; AND ENDING. &gt;&gt; THIS WAR. &gt;&gt; SO LET'S. &gt;&gt; TALK ABOUT WHAT WE. &gt;&gt; CAN. &gt;&gt; DO JOINTLY. &gt;&gt; AND WE ARE READY TO. &gt;&gt; DO WHAT WE CAN. AND YOU KNOW THAT WE GAVE SUPPORT TO. UKRAINE AND. THAT WE. ARE LOOKING FOR MORE PRESSURE ON RUSSIA. &gt;&gt; THE EUROPEAN UNION. &gt;&gt; DID AND. &gt;&gt; WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT. &gt;&gt; THAT. THAT VULGAR LUMP OF A MAN WHO JUST LAUGHED ABOUT D-DAY, KEPT. &gt;&gt; A BOOK. &gt;&gt; BY ADOLF HITLER AT. &gt;&gt; HIS BEDSIDE. &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO HIS FIRST WIFE. &gt;&gt; THAT HITLER. &gt;&gt; RAEDER IS. &gt;&gt; THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED. &gt;&gt; STATES TO SAY THAT. D-DAY WAS. NOT A GREAT DAY. DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; SAID THIS WAS NOT. &gt;&gt; A GREAT DAY FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; THAT'S BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HAS NO IDEA WHAT HITLER. &gt;&gt; HITLER WAS DOING. &gt;&gt; TO EVERY. &gt;&gt; GERMAN SOLDIER. &gt;&gt; TO EVERY. &gt;&gt; CITIZEN OF GERMANY. THE GENERALS WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO THOUGHT THAT HITLER WAS INSANE BY THAT TIME. AND SO THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR HAD TO EXPLAIN TO THE IGNORANT PRESIDENT THAT IT WAS NO FUN LIVING UNDER THE MADMAN DICTATORSHIP OF ADOLF HITLER, AND THAT D-DAY WAS THE BEGINNING. &gt;&gt; OF THE. &gt;&gt; LIBERATION OF GERMANY FROM. NAZI DICTATORSHIP. THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUFFERING THE WORST. &gt;&gt; ON D-DAY. &gt;&gt; WERE NOT IN BATTLE. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE IN HITLER'S DEATH CAMPS. &gt;&gt; AND D-DAY. &gt;&gt; MEANT THAT SOME. &gt;&gt; OF THEM WERE GOING TO SURVIVE. SOME OF THEM WOULD NOT STARVE TO DEATH. BY THE TIME GENERAL. EISENHOWER'S TROOPS LIBERATED THE DEATH CAMPS, SOME. OF THEM WOULD NOT HAVE ALREADY BEEN PUT TO DEATH. SOME OF THEM WOULD HANG ON. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN. SPEND A. LIFETIME HEARING. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE MAKE REFERENCES TO D-DAY, PEOPLE WHO WERE ALIVE AT THE TIME, PEOPLE WHO REMEMBER IT, AND PEOPLE BORN LONG. &gt;&gt; AFTER D-DAY AND. &gt;&gt; NEVER SEE SOMEONE SMILE. &gt;&gt; OR LAUGH. &gt;&gt; ABOUT IT, SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT THAT MAKES THEM LAUGH. THAT'S THE KIND OF DISRESPECTFUL. &gt;&gt; IGNORANT BEHAVIOR THAT. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN ONLY GET. FROM A HITLER READER LIKE DONALD TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP SUFFERED IN SILENCE. FOR THREE DAYS AFTER ELON MUSK ATTACKED HIM, CALLING DONALD TRUMP'S REPUBLICAN BUDGET BILL. A DISGUSTING ABOMINATION. BUT TODAY, ALMOST. EXACTLY THREE DAYS LATER TO THE HOUR ON, ELON. &gt;&gt; MUSK ATTACKED HIM AND. &gt;&gt; SAID AND. &gt;&gt; ISSUED HIS. &gt;&gt; FIRST TWEET AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. THAT BEGAN WITH THE WORDS I JUST. &gt;&gt; CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; TODAY, PROMPTED BY A REPORTER, DONALD TRUMP, FINALLY BROKE HIS COWARDLY SILENCE. AND THEN THE INSANITY. REALLY STARTED. &gt;&gt; LOOK, YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS LIKED ELON, AND IT'S ALWAYS VERY SURPRISED YOU SAW THE WORDS HE HAD FOR ME, THE WORDS. AND HE HASN'T SAID ANYTHING ABOUT ME. THAT'S BAD. I'D RATHER HAVE HIM CRITICIZE ME THAN THE BILL BECAUSE THE BILL IS INCREDIBLE. &gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP GOT. &gt;&gt; HIS WISH. ELON MUSK DECIDED TO CRITICIZE HIM DIRECTLY. &gt;&gt; ELON KNEW THE INNER WORKINGS OF THIS BILL BETTER THAN ALMOST ANYBODY SITTING HERE. BETTER THAN YOU PEOPLE. HE KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. HE HAD NO PROBLEM WITH IT. ALL OF A SUDDEN HE HAD A PROBLEM, AND HE ONLY DEVELOPED THE PROBLEM WHEN HE FOUND OUT THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CUT THE EV MANDATE, BECAUSE THAT'S BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND IT REALLY IS UNFAIR. HE KNEW IT BETTER THAN ALMOST ANYBODY, AND HE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM UNTIL RIGHT AFTER HE LEFT. AND IF YOU SAW THE STATEMENTS HE MADE ABOUT ME, WHICH I'M SURE YOU CAN GET VERY EASILY, IT'S VERY FRESH ON TAPE. HE SAID THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THINGS ABOUT ME, AND HE HASN'T SAID BAD ABOUT ME PERSONALLY, BUT I'M SURE THAT'LL BE NEXT. &gt;&gt; WELL, HE GOT. &gt;&gt; THAT RIGHT. ELON MUSK. &gt;&gt; THEN LIVE TWEETED WHATEVER. &gt;&gt; KEEP THE EV SOLAR. &gt;&gt; INCENTIVE CUTS IN THE BILL. &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH NO OIL AND GAS SUBSIDIES. ARE TOUCHED. VERY UNFAIR. BUT DITCH THE MOUNTAIN OF DISGUSTING PORK IN THE BILL. ELON MUSK DID NOT ACTUALLY IDENTIFY THE SO-CALLED PORK IN THE BILL. HE ALSO. DENIED THAT HE KNEW WHAT WAS IN THE BILL, SAYING THIS BILL. &gt;&gt; WAS. &gt;&gt; NEVER SHOWN. &gt;&gt; TO ME. &gt;&gt; EVEN ONCE, AND. &gt;&gt; WAS PASSED IN. &gt;&gt; THE DEAD OF NIGHT. &gt;&gt; SO. &gt;&gt; FAST THAT ALMOST NO ONE IN CONGRESS COULD EVEN READ IT. ELON MUSK TWEETED THAT OVER A VIDEO OF DONALD TRUMP SPEAKING IN THE OVAL OFFICE. MINUTES BEFORE ELON MUSK TWEETED IT. AND THEN ELON MUSK TOLD DONALD TRUMP WHAT ELON MUSK BELIEVES DONALD TRUMP OWES HIM. WITHOUT ME, TRUMP WOULD HAVE LOST THE ELECTION, DEMS WOULD CONTROL THE HOUSE, AND REPUBLICANS WOULD BE 5149 IN THE SENATE. SUCH INGRATITUDE. AND THAT. &gt;&gt; IS A. &gt;&gt; PERFECTLY REASONABLE POLITICAL ARGUMENT. PERFECTLY REASONABLE POLITICAL CASE TO MAKE ABOUT HOW THAT ELECTION WAS WON AND LOST. WE'VE ALL SPENT OUR LIVES HEARING HOW MUCH MONEY MATTERS IN POLITICS. &gt;&gt; MONEY IS EVERYTHING. &gt;&gt; IN POLITICS AND IN CAMPAIGNS, AND THAT MAKES IT ENTIRELY LIKELY THAT WHEN THE RICHEST. PERSON IN THE WORLD DECIDES TO. &gt;&gt; MAKE THE BIGGEST. &gt;&gt; POLITICAL CONTRIBUTION IN. &gt;&gt; HISTORY, IT WOULD MAKE A. &gt;&gt; DIFFERENCE, A DECISIVE DIFFERENCE. DONALD TRUMP IN THE OVAL OFFICE, WITH THE GERMAN CHANCELLOR BESIDE HIM, HUMILIATED HIMSELF BY DESPERATELY INSISTING TO THE WORLD THAT HE WOULD HAVE WON WITHOUT ELON MUSK. &gt;&gt; I WOULD HAVE WON PENNSYLVANIA EASILY ANYWAY. &gt;&gt; WE'LL NEVER KNOW. WE'LL NEVER KNOW IF DONALD TRUMP COULD HAVE WON THAT ELECTION WITHOUT ALL OF ELON MUSK'S MONEY. THE BIGGEST POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR IN HISTORY. &gt;&gt; IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE. &gt;&gt; HAPPENED IF ELON MUSK SENT THAT MONEY IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. WE DON'T KNOW. AND THEN ELON MUSK THREATENED TO CREATE A NEW POLITICAL PARTY, A POLITICAL PARTY THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY PULL VOTES AWAY FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. IS IT TIME TO CREATE A NEW POLITICAL PARTY IN AMERICA THAT ACTUALLY REPRESENTS THE 80% IN THE MIDDLE? THERE AREN'T 80% IN THE MIDDLE, OF COURSE, BUT THERE ARE ENOUGH ELON MUSK FOLLOWERS WHO COULD TURN AGAINST REPUBLICANS AND GIVE THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO THE DEMOCRATS NEXT YEAR, ALONG WITH THE SENATE AND THE PRESIDENCY IN THE ELECTION AFTER THAT. THAT'S SOME OF. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS. &gt;&gt; AT STAKE IN THE MOST INSANE PUBLIC OUTBURST THAT HAS. EVER OCCURRED BETWEEN A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND. &gt;&gt; HIS BIGGEST. &gt;&gt; MONEY CONTRIBUTOR. DONALD TRUMP THEN TOOK TO HIS SOCIAL MEDIA SITE AND POSTED, ELON. WAS WEARING THIN. &gt;&gt; I ASKED HIM. &gt;&gt; TO LEAVE. I TOOK AWAY. HIS EV MANDATE THAT FORCED EVERYONE TO BUY ELECTRIC CARS THAT NOBODY ELSE WANTED, THAT HE KNEW FOR MONTHS I WAS GOING TO DO, AND HE JUST WENT CRAZY. EXCLAMATION POINT. SO THERE'S DONALD TRUMP SAYING I ASKED HIM TO LEAVE. THAT'S DONALD TRUMP SAYING HE FIRED ELON MUSK. THAT'S WHAT WE WERE REPORTING ON THIS PROGRAM LAST NIGHT. WHITE HOUSE SOURCES INDICATING, BY THE WAY, NONE OF THEM BELIEVABLE, JUST AS DONALD TRUMP WAS NOT BELIEVABLE THAT ELON MUSK WAS FIRED. WE WILL NEVER KNOW. DID DONALD TRUMP FIRE ELON MUSK BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR? ELON MUSK IS A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR. BUT DOES ELON MUSK FEEL THAT HE WAS FIRED? MAYBE DONALD TRUMP WAS ALSO CLAIMING IN THAT IDIOTIC TWEET THAT YOU WE WERE ALL FORCED TO BUY ELECTRIC CARS. WE WHO HAVE I AM AMONG THEM WHO HAVE NEVER PURCHASED AN ELECTRIC CAR. AND THEN DONALD TRUMP SAYS THE OTHER GUY IS CRAZY, PUTS IT ALL IN CAPITAL LETTERS. THE OTHER GUY IS CRAZY. CRAZIEST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. SAYS THE OTHER GUY IS CRAZY. TO WHICH ELON MUSK SAYS. &gt;&gt; WHAT I'VE. &gt;&gt; BEEN SAYING ABOUT ALMOST EVERYTHING DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID. &gt;&gt; SINCE HE. &gt;&gt; FIRST OPENED. HIS MOUTH IN 2011 ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE. ELON MUSK SAID SUCH AN OBVIOUS LIE. SO SAD. AND SO. &gt;&gt; THERE. &gt;&gt; WE ARE, DAY 136 OF THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. ELON MUSK CALLING DONALD TRUMP WHAT I HAVE BEEN CALLING DONALD TRUMP SINCE 2011 ON THIS PROGRAM A LIAR. DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN A LIAR EVERY SINGLE DAY OF HIS POLITICAL CAREER, AND ELON MUSK HAS PROBABLY KNOWN THAT, AND ELON MUSK HAS DONE ALMOST AS MUCH LYING ABOUT POLITICAL ISSUES IN AMERICA AS DONALD TRUMP. AND SO IT'S WAR BETWEEN MUSK AND TRUMP. STEVE BANNON, A TRUMP LOYALIST WHO WAS FIRED FROM THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE BUT SERVED A LONGER RUN IN THAT WHITE HOUSE THAN ELON MUSK DID, SAID PEOPLE, INCLUDING MYSELF, ARE RECOMMENDING TO THE PRESIDENT THAT HE PULL EVERY CONTRACT ASSOCIATED WITH ELON MUSK AND THAT MAJOR INVESTIGATIONS START IMMEDIATELY ONE INTO HIS IMMIGRATION STATUS, HIS SECURITY CLEARANCE AND HIS HISTORY OF DRUG ABUSE, TWO INTO HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO TRYING TO FORCE A BRIEFING OF HIGHLY TOP SECRET WAR PLANS WITH CHINA AT THE PENTAGON THREE AND INTO HIS INVOLVEMENT WITH ATTEMPTING TO GET PRESIDENT XI TO THE INAUGURATION. SO NOW TRUMP WORLD WANTS TO INVESTIGATE ELON MUSK. DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCED A COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS INVESTIGATION, APPARENTLY TO FIND OUT HOW OLD JOE BIDEN WAS WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. BUT THE BIDEN INVESTIGATION NEWS DID NOT TURN OUT TO BE THE INVESTIGATION NEWS OF THE DAY, BECAUSE TRUMP CHEERLEADERS NOW WANT TO INVESTIGATE ELON MUSK. DONALD TRUMP THEN POSTED THE EASIEST WAY TO SAVE MONEY IN OUR BUDGET BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IS TO TERMINATE ELON'S GOVERNMENTAL SUBSIDIES AND CONTRACTS. THAT WAS DONALD TRUMP'S WAY OF TRYING TO SHUT UP ELON MUSK. THAT WAS DONALD TRUMP'S BIG SHOT AT ELON MUSK. THAT WAS HIS BIGGEST SHOT, SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND DONALD TRUMP'S BIGGEST SHOT OF THE DAY AGAINST ELON MUSK AND HIS WAR AGAINST ELON MUSK DID NOT WORK BECAUSE AFTER DONALD TRUMP THREATENED TO CUT OFF ALL OF MUSK'S GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, ELON MUSK THEN WENT TWITTER NUCLEAR PRIME TIME TO DROP THE REALLY BIG BOMB. REAL DONALD TRUMP IS IN THE EPSTEIN FILES. THAT IS THE REAL REASON THEY HAVE NOT BEEN MADE PUBLIC. HAVE A NICE DAY. &gt;&gt; D.O.J. EXCLAMATION. &gt;&gt; POINT. &gt;&gt; AND JUST TO TOP THAT. &gt;&gt; OFF, ELON MUSK SAID YES TO A FOLLOWER OF HIS WHO SAID PRESIDENT VERSUS ELON, WHO WINS? MY MONEY'S ON ELON, TRUMP SHOULD BE IMPEACHED AND JD VANCE SHOULD REPLACE HIM. YES, SAID ELON MUSK TO THAT IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP. AND SO THEY. &gt;&gt; HAVE. &gt;&gt; BOTH FIRED THEIR BIGGEST SHOTS AT EACH OTHER. THE QUESTION FOR DONALD TRUMP, WHO SPENT THE LAST THREE DAYS IN FEARFUL SILENCE ABOUT ELON MUSK, IS CAN HE CRUSH THE RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD? &gt;&gt; OR SHOULD. &gt;&gt; HE BEG FOR A TRUCE WITH ELON MUSK? THE EPSTEIN FILES ARE, OF COURSE, THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE FILES ON DONALD TRUMP'S OLD FRIEND, THE PEDOPHILE JEFFREY EPSTEIN, WHO KILLED HIMSELF IN PRISON. TWITTER IS NOW FILLED WITH THE VIDEO OF THAT DANCING FRIENDSHIP WITH THAT PEDOPHILE. THANKS TO ELON MUSK PUSHING THE VIDEO OF THE TRUMP EPSTEIN FRIENDSHIP ON TWITTER, YOU CAN EXPECT TO SEE MORE AND MORE OF THAT ON TWITTER. AND SO WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S COMING NEXT. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL BE HUMILIATED. AND WE DO KNOW THAT ELON MUSK WILL CONTINUE TO SUFFER HUGE FINANCIAL LOSSES, AS HE DID TODAY. WITH THE TESLA STOCK PRICE CRASHING, LOSING 152 BILLION IN MARKET VALUE THANKS TO ELON MUSK'S MADNESS TODAY, WHICH WILL WIN HIM NO. FANS AMONG GOOD AND DECENT PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE DONALD TRUMP AND WHO WILL NEVER BUY A TESLA AGAIN BECAUSE THEY WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT ELON MUSK DID WITH THE MONEY THAT THEY PAID HIM FOR THEIR TESLAS. THEY WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT ELON MUSK DID DURING HIS WORSHIP DONALD TRUMP PERIOD. GOOD AND DECENT PEOPLE WILL NEVER FORGET BILL GATES DESCRIPTION OF ELON MUSK AS THE WORLD'S RICHEST MAN, KILLING THE WORLD'S POOREST CHILDREN. BECAUSE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT ELON MUSK DID AND WHAT HE'S CONTINUING TO DO TONIGHT. AND THOSE CHILDREN ARE DYING TONIGHT BECAUSE OF ELON MUSK. AND SO TWO MAD MEN ARE AT WAR, AND WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. BUT WE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT IT HELPS DERAIL THE MISSION OF NONSTOP CRUELTY THAT THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="democracy depends on a free press Please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org/g This is democracyow democracynow.org the Warren peace report I'm Amy Goodman with Narin Sh We turn now to look at how criticism of Israel is growing in Europe as the UK pauses trade talks and the EU reviews its relationship with Israel That is this is British Prime Minister Kier Star speaking Tuesday But first Mr Mr Speaker I'd like to say something about the horrific situation in Gaza where the level of suffering innocent children being bombed again is utterly intolerable The recent announcement that Israel will allow a basic quantity of food into Gaza a basic quantity is totally and utterly inadequate So we must coordinate our response because this war has gone on for far too long We cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve Kier Starmer the British Prime Minister long an ally of Israel The British foreign secretary David Lami also condemned Israel's actions in Gaza in a speech to the House of Commons Prime Minister Netanyahu end this blockade now and let the aid in Regrettably Madame Deputy Speaker despite our efforts this Israeli government's egregious actions and rhetoric have continued They are isolating Israel from its friends and partners around the world undermining the interests of the Israeli people and damaging the image of the state of Israel in the eyes of the world Therefore today I'm announcing that we have suspended negotiations with this Israeli government on a new trade free trade agreement The comments of the British Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister came days after as many as 500,000 people took part in a massive march for Palestine in London to mark the 77th anniversary of the Nakba Meanwhile the European Union has announced its re reviewing its relationship with Israel We're joined now by two guests from Brussels Lynn Boland is with us a Irish member of the European Parliament chair of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Palestine And joining us from London British MP former Labor Party leader Jeremy Corbin welcome back to Democracy Now Um MP Corbin if you could start off by responding to the shift We just were in Gaza talking to a British doctor who's there helping uh the children and the people of Gaza saying that what Kier Starmer has done does make a difference Now uh you were certainly opposed to uh the prime minister It's so much of the support of Israel What is causing the shift in the British government's position it's pretty clear that the huge demonstrations in Britain and the outpouring of uh public condemnation of Israel's bombardment of Gaza has eventually forced the British government into a slightly different position in that they've now suspended as you reported the trade talks with Israel They claim to have suspended all arm supplies to Israel but we question that because we believe that parts for the F-35 jets are still being sold to Israel And we're also questioning the amount of arms that have been sold over the last few months But there's no doubt that the uh position of the Palestinian people being starved to death bombed to death in Gaza has forced the British government into a different position We are keeping up all the pressure we can in order to get aid in but also to end the occupation because that is clearly what the ICJ position is end the occupation of Gaza and of the West Bank Well let's bring in uh Lynn Bolan Uh Lynn you're a member of European Parliament Uh could you talk about and also chair of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with Palestine if you could talk about the significance of this review Uh the European Union is of course Israel's largest trading partner but what do you think could come of this review given that there is no unanimous position uh within the European uh Union on Israel well I think for first and foremost I' I'd echo what Jeremy is saying is that the the only reason why the EU has announced this review and there isn't even a an overall like there isn't even a majority at the EU council level to review the trading agreement is because of the people power and the pressure that is coming on politicians right across the European Union and I'd encourage people to continue to do that Um but I would say that the time for review is long since passed So what we're calling for is to spend the agreement pending the review The review can take place They can do the the research If they haven't seen what everybody has seen on their phone is that Israel is not upholding uh human rights and article two of the trading agreement it should be suspended But we're calling for them to suspend it then carry out your review and come back with your findings But what we're fearing is that the announcing a review is like kicking it down the road It's I suppose addressing the people pressure but actually not doing anything concrete um to address the situation So we're also calling on MEPs right across Europe uh who are frustrated by the lack of of Europeanwide action to call on their national governments to end trade with Israel For example in Ireland we have what's called the occupied territories bill um which would cease trade obviously just with the occupied territories but it would be a significant uh message sent out that at least Ireland wants to be compliant with international law and we're encouraging MEPs across Europe to do similar initiatives in their countries And so Jeremy Corbin if you could talk about what sanctions the UK has already imposed on Israel and against whom and talk about the new inquiry You've been calling for a new inquiry into Britain's relationship with Israel If you could tell us what that's about Sure On June the 4th I'm introducing a private members bill into the House of Commons calling for an independent inquiry into the whole process of policymaking in relation to Gaza the West Bank and uh Britain's arm supplies to Israel particularly during the period since October uh 2023 This is similar to the inquiry that was headed by Sir John Chilcott eventually to inquire into policym surrounding the Iraq war My purpose in doing this is because the government has obfuscated on many many occasions over the past 18 months over the level of arms supplies over trade over aid over uh credits and so on to Israel and also particularly about the manufacturer of Israeli weapons in Britain particularly in Sheffield and other places where parts with the F-35 are made So a group of us in parliament have been raising this consistently The issue of arm supplies goes something like this Britain was a was and remains to some extent a supplier of arms to Israel David Lammy the foreign secretary suspended 30 arms licenses out of 300 that were in operation without ever specifying what these 30 licenses were And to be honest I still don't know what those 30 arms licenses are He claims they were over supply of weapons that could be used for crimes against humanity But we later discovered that many weapons have continued to be supplied And yesterday we published a report from Progressive International and other groups which is outlining the whole case for suspending arm supplies and pointing out the dishonesty of the British government over the past 18 months on this And that report is being circulated to MPs and will be part of uh the case I'll be making to the British Parliament on June the 4th The question of suspending the trade talks is an interesting one and a very interesting development because to some extent it is running in tandem in parallel rather with what the European Union is doing because Britain is no longer a member of the European Union We welcome that suspension There has always been the legal case against buying settlement goods because of the illegality of the settlements But it has been very hard to trace what are settlement goods and what isn't But actually a consumer boycott is gathering pace The members of the cooperative society a very big retailer in Britain with a huge me membership base across the whole country voted by 70% last week to request their board to suspend all purchases from Israel So no Israeli products would be stopped in co-op stocked in co-op shops And there's a lot of pressure on to the other big wreathers to do the same So there's been an enormous shift in public opinion And it's caused by utter revulsion at seeing emaciated children starve to death or dying on the operating theater where there's no anesthetics or even antiseptics to treat their terrible conditions they're suffering People can stomach no longer the sight of Palestinian children being starved and murdered by the Israeli occupation of Gaza MP Corbin the UK sanctioned violent western uh West Bank settlers but the British foreign minister Lami stopped short of targeting Israeli officials Can you talk about the um significance of those sanctions and uh what you think has to go further the sanctions themselves against individual violent um settlers are important and a good a good step forward So far the only sanctions apply to um Beny Netanyahu and Benny Gance who have um arrest warrants out from the International Criminal Court And Britain as a signary to the Rome Convention is required to carry out those arrest warrants should either of those individuals turn up in UK territory What David Lammy stopped short of doing was what many of us requested which is a wider sanctioning of officials in the Israeli government who've been a party to the decision making on the bombardment of Gaza Their names are well known but also of uh Israeli Defense Force um high command who are also obviously very much part of the decision-making process on which buildings to bomb and which buildings to blow up not that there's many buildings left in Gaza that are still to be blown up And so we are continuing that pressure So there's a big move in parliament on military equipment on demanding aid get in rapidly rapidly rapidly to Gaza um and also sanctions against Israeli officials And so changes are happening but it's desperately slow And already over 60,000 have died in Gaza Can I also ask you about your response to what happened in Washington uh all these young uh embassy and consular uh staffers uh from different uh consulates uh and organizations gathered at the Jewish Museum and uh a young man uh opened fire killing two of those who worked at the Israeli embassy Your response it's absolutely shocking Nobody should be shot Nobody should be killed at any event anywhere around the world That is not the way to solve the issue And so we have to be resolute in demanding peace for all and also recognize that um in the case of Britain and also in the case of the USA the big demonstrations in support of the Palestinian people are of Christian Jewish and Muslim and people of no particular faith And one of the biggest groups on our demonstrations in support of the Palestinian people is actually the Jewish block Uh Lynn Boland finally before we end uh if you could also respond to events here Washington DC the killing of these two uh Israeli embassy staffers and then the fact that within the EU it's France that's leading efforts for the official recognition of Palestine if you could talk about the significance of that France meeting Saudi Arabia next month apparently in uh uh New York Foreign Secretary Lammy has said he's also in talks with Fr France and Saudi Arabia about officially recognizing Palestine Um please Yeah And and just to echo I suppose what Jeremy has said and send my condolences to the family of the two who who were shot dead last night Um nobody should be losing their lives Um what we want to see is peace We want to have a a longstanding peace uh in Gaza in Palestine for the Palestinian people and Jewish people to be able to live in peace Um in regards to President Mcron and leading the the case for the recognition of the state of Palestine look it is very welcome Um Ireland and Spain recognized Palestine I think it was about a year ago You know Sweden some years before It is it is important It's a really significant step and I'm sure it be very much welcomed by the Palestinian people But for me the urgency within the EU now is ending the blockade is demanding the ceasefire And demanding the ceasefire means that EU countries need to stop supplying weapons to Israel So Jeremy was talking about Britain's role in in arming Israel We have countries within the EU who are significant weapons providers to the Israeli state if they wanted this conflict and this war and genocide to end tomorrow then they need to stop supplying weapons to to Israel Um and the F-35s is a critical part of that Um we also need to see the aid getting in and the aid needs to be delivered and and supported through UNRA Um and we're fighting very hard back at any push to to militarize the aid agenda And we're seeing Israel talking about setting up compounds where you know women would have to to to go to areas putting themselves in vulnerable positions people with disabilities children having to go and that Israel would decide who is deserving and who isn't deserving of aid Uh this cannot be tolerated What we need is UNRA to be allowed to do their job lift the blockade let the trucks in and deliver the aid to the people who so desperately need it those children 14,000 children who are at risk of dying from starvation in the next 48 hours That's where our focus should be Absolutely Recognize the state of Palestine But right now the people of Palestine need food They need medicine They need water And they need to stop the bombs dropping on them Democracy Now is funded

          <attvalue for="7" value="it was high times for Elon Musk with his chainsaw snorting ketamine injecting it into his veins getting his participation trophy in the Oval Office and now it has turned so quickly so uh rapidly that Russia is offering political asylum to Musk put up this headline newsweek is reporting that Russia offers political asylum to Elon Musk over Trump feud this is a very interesting development and goes into what we have been talking about since before the election or during the election that you have MAGA who is behind a personality cult that believes in really nothing other than just getting into the oval and making sure women can't get abortions bullying some gays deporting some immigrants rich people don't pay taxes that's their whole ethos and then you get over to the technocrats and they have really dark nefarious plans like this world domination linking up with Putin and all of these things so it's very interesting we've always suspected and reporting showed that Musk had a lot of conversations with Putin prior to entering the um race prior to giving Donald Trump $300 million for his campaign musk was having a lot of patty cake phone calls with Putin interesting that Putin's the first to come offer him a a lifeline in my opinion no one is more aware of the nefarious acts that Donald Trump and Elon Musk committed to get Trump elected than Putin and Trump may be able to uh hide behind executive privilege because of the Supreme Court but undoubtedly Elon Musk based on all the court rulings has been doing a lot of illegal [ __ ] and his protection from that is Donald Trump so if he makes an enemy out of Donald Trump he is the person that would be in charge of pardoning him so it surprises me zero that Putin would sound off in this whole thing you know what's interesting you when you just said Pumps when you said uh the presidential protection immunity from the Supreme Court you know the autopsy on all of this is going to be all of this shortsided [ __ ] that people that know better acted on impulse in their decision making and didn't act on a a stable decision that has longevity they chose the sprint and not the marathon and people in government should always choose the marathon you know the the marathon choice that benefits the most people when you talk about philosopher Maslo high uh um um Maslo and his hierarchy of needs the collective good collectivism is so much better than the shortsighted impulse that um all of these MAGA people including the Roberts court and Musk and all of these people but I'll tell you who's been playing the marathon putin all right next up we have uh Musk is this is really interesting when I read this I thought &quot;Oh my god I have something in common with Elon Musk because I always in my mind when I'm really like fighting to have just a a tinge of serenity I always think and I tell pumps this all the time we go to lunch every day together trump is not a spring chicken pump he is obese which exacerbates him not exceeding life expectancy he has a terrible diet you know he won't release his medical records and then I was just shocked as [ __ ] to be strange bedfellows with Elon Musk put up this tweet oh and some food for thought as they ponder this question trump has three and a half years left as president but I will be around for 40 plus years insinuating you know that Trump's not a spring chicken that that he's not going to be around very long and so it's interesting when you when you're in the bargaining stage of how am I going to get through this Trump [ __ ] and then Elon Musk has the same thought it's kind of terrifying it's kind of interesting right i look at this and I think this is a signal from Elon Musk to Republicans you have to pick sides who are you going to pick trump might be president but I have all the money so if you want me to fund your campaign come to me i mean that's the gauntlet he laid down pretty good argument if you're if you're an evil if you're into evil [ __ ] i mean it's a pretty good argument for him to say &quot;Okay are you going to go follow the lame duck who's 80 years old who has dementia?&quot; Because that's we're going to start getting that next elon's going to start leaking Trump cognitive decline you know we're we're at the pedophile stage and we're going to keep escalating right and so it's it's a pretty good argument i mean obviously the counterargument to the MAGA base that Elon Musk is an illegal immigrant just really hits MAGA hard right where they live that's like their their you know G-spot illegal immigrant being cruel to them i mean that is like the money shot okay next up Sammy Sage our friend over at the um uh network Betches put up a tweet that I think is very interesting bigger picture we're really watching Trump Bannon Miller versus Musk Till Vance and then Sammy Opines who would Putin prefer so let's talk about that pumps we have Trump Bannon Miller Musk Teal Vance and I think Putin would prefer the latter okay tell me i have my argument i think he would prefer the former i mean I get the whole SpaceX thing but Trump is so easy to manipulate look what he has done through his useful idiot Donald Trump donald Trump spews propaganda donald Trump can't even say who started the war he won't go in and say &quot;I'm going to back Ukraine.&quot; He's leaving NATO trump is the easiest mark Putin has ever done trump was step one he was the Trojan horse inside the horse are those other three and so we talked about this during the campaign trump is marching in and he has all of these evil technocrats inside the Trojan horse putin is actually playing four and 5D chess and he knows that if he can get in there is an active coup what Musk was doing in all of those government agencies was coupish coupesque or flatout coup i don't have all of the information but that's what it looked like to me and I think that getting in getting into the federal government was step one and now they're going to try to destroy Trump because Putin wants younger more nefarious less American loyalist on his side and you've got Peter Thiel a German you've got um and no disrespect to Germans or South Africans um uh uh what's his face musk and then you have JD Vance who in my opinion this is just my opinion is the biggest closet case on the planet hates himself for it can't defend his wife and he's able to go out to Peter Tal in Silicon Valley and it's just high times for the pink mafia they can turn Grinder off and it's just you know gay [ __ ] from top to bottom that's my personal opinion with sociopath eyeliner makeup wearing JD Vance okay so take that one step further let's say that Musk with all his power and money convinces the Republicans to go ahead and start impeachment proceedings because I think on a daily basis we think see things that Trump could become impeached for start with he's threatening the star the Star League contract of mess because they're mad at each other i mean every single day the corruption all that do you think the po personality cult then gets in behind Vance because Vance has zero RZ and what they like about Trump is he has Riz they tell me okay no I don't think they do but I think that like Vance is primed they have him exactly where they want him vance is owned by Peter Thiel and he is groomed for this moment and he's younger and Trump didn't really want Vance i think he wanted somebody else to be his VEP i can't remember who it was and Peter Teal was the one that pushed Vance and so Vance I feel like if they get Trump impeached Vance is going to go in with this presidential immunity again shortsighted politics the sprint not the marathon i think they're going to go in and [ __ ] [ __ ] up like nobody's business like full authoritarian tilt donald Trump isn't ambitious enough on a daily basis and he's the dementia and all this [ __ ] to be like super hardcore he likes to dick around on Twitter and truth social and then they're like &quot;Hey sign this hey sign that.&quot; And they're moving very quickly but they're not doing it through you know legislation i don't know i just have a really bad feeling about the technocrats and JD Vance really bad well no wonder look at what's happening with uh Palentar with all of our information okay and then we have um our favorite representative Eric Swallwell weighing in and he says &quot;Absolutely telling that at JD Vance taking a walk on defending real Donald Trump against Elon.&quot; And then the next tweet okay so JD Vance I'm sure pumps under pressure from Steven Miller did what I feel like is the bare minimum jd Vance puts up on Twitter &quot;President Trump has done more than any person in my lifetime to earn the trust of the movement he leads i'm proud to stand behind him.&quot; And Kylie leave this up let's analyze this he he praises the cult leader president Trump has done more than any person in my lifetime that that works to earn the trust of the movement that he leads i'm proud to stand beside him this is really interesting because this is right to the cult this is um Pumps always points out that certain things sound really cultish what's interesting about JD Vance's response is it's not an outright attack on Musk that would be being the best soldier right would be to say Elon Musk has betrayed our dear leader um Donald Trump was so good to him you know he he gave him cart blanch with all of your taxpayer money uh but this is this was a real um lackluster beta male kind of response in defense of the dear leader i also think the movement he leads it's interesting it doesn't say the American people it says the movement he leads that tells me it's a signal to people outside MAGA this is a guy only for MAGA maybe I'm a guy for everybody that's what it screams to me the movement he leads is an interesting choice of words perhaps I agree with you wholeheartedly when I saw that this morning I was just like this is really interestingly worded and I want to say this about JD Vance jd Vance is evil but he's not a dumbass he is a master gaslighter and manipulator of the highest order and he is abundantly aware of the propaganda and the way he crafts it when he speaks to the movement that Trump leads which makes him even more psychotic he knows there's no dissonance with him he knows what he's doing is intentional lying propagandizing gaslighting and manipulation he knows it trump genuinely believes that he's the greatest man on the planet could probably pass a lie detector test there's no question and he looks in the mirror and he sees I mean hot man looking back at him he thinks he's the smartest mfer that's ever ruled the roof jd Vance we talked about this and our our longtime IHIP News listeners will know that we have always flagged him as a real evil [ __ ] that is connected to the people who have the worst intentions for this country one of them being Peter Teal who says on tape that democracy doesn't work because you have to beg people to try to get them to agree with you and while he's saying this in this clip he's like and I don't like to make fun of people's appearances but I mean it is like he is greasy oily and just has this real evil like a effect to him yeah he does and he also says that only author you know he says authoritarianism and capitalism those two go together like hand and glove he doesn't think women should be allowed to vote so this is just all right up JD Vance's alley okay so here's what we'll do we need to do a whole story on Peter Thiel maybe this would be a great little weekend watch because he had a lover that committed suicide be- because of allegedly Peter Thiel was pretty abusive towards him which would surprise no one so maybe we just need to do a little deep dive into Peter Thiel because it is I've done it in the past he believes in this like dark enlightenment [ __ ] and he is bffs with JD Vance i mean this is I think Sammy Sage in her tweet we have what we have are these three versus these three and this is really really interesting i hope that the Democrats can get some Fortune 500 CEOs on board to usurp all of this and get everybody impeached but that's just my wishful thinking and I'm in the bargaining stage of my grief process probably all right that's all we have for today please um subscribe and buy our book and we'll see you all later [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="imagine an unsettling hypothetical with me russia launches a hypersonic missile from deep inside their borders and it's aimed straight at Washington DC to get there it'll have to fly through the Arctic past Greenland then over Canada in order to eventually slam into its target now here's the question how well can the US defend against this attack if it doesn't have Canada's help donald Trump is pitching a new missile defense system made in America to protect America i'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome missile defense shield to protect our homeland all made in the USA he has invited Canada to join but on his terms Canada's two choices as he sees it either pay $61 billion for protection and just for reference that's almost three times Canada's entire annual defense budget or join the US as the 51st state they have a very small military they rely on our military we basically protect Canada but when it comes to missile defense specifically every single expert we spoke to said it's not that simple and if the US were to try to go it alone it would be creating all kinds of problems for itself what I would say and if I were advising your nation's leadership is just present the facts canada brings a lot when we think about what threats the US is most worried about Russia North Korea China Iran they're all on the other side of the world meaning two things the US needs to be able to shoot down long range cruise missiles hypersonic weapons intercontinental ballistic missiles and they need to consider what direction those projectiles might come from could they reach the US by flying over the Pacific or Atlantic oceans sure but that's hardly the shortest distance you can shave off around a quarter of that trip if instead of going east or west you go north if we look at a map of the world or an a globe and you look at straight from the north you can see the most direct path for let's say Russia and China is going to go right through the Arctic it's basically the path by which any attack that comes to North America is going to fly over now from space satellites can see a missile launch pretty easily by picking up the sudden blast of heat but actually tracking the flight path of something hurtling through the air at several times the speed of sound while the Earth is spinning and the satellites are moving themselves that's a lot harder so you need groundbased radar in your detection toolkit too so if we go back to our example of Russia targeting Washington with a hypersonic missile let me see if I can see it here so let's say it's launching from right on the the Kazakhstan border and that rocket that missile flies over the Arctic Circle and towards Washington DC most likely the first groundbased radar that'll be able to track it in real time would be in Canada's far north meaning Canada isn't just a bystander in a conflict like this it's the front line if you look at just how high latitude a lot of these islands are uh it can provide potentially also an early warning an earlier warning for potential strikes if there are radar sites or other systems in there and we can put some rough numbers to this point about early warning let's go back to that scenario where a hypersonic missile is traveling from Russia to Washington DC and let's make some assumptions first that the missile is traveling at Mach 8 that's eight times the speed of sound and it's traveling at about that speed the whole way in reality these kinds of missiles have different flight phases where they can travel at different speeds but let's just keep it simple so it's hurtling through the air and then up through space at almost 10,000 km an hour which is almost 3 km per second we're looking here at a total approximate flight time of about 56 minutes a conventional groundbased radar in Canada's north might be able to start tracking that missile about 32 minutes into its flight so tminus 24 minutes to impact flight times for a lot of these systems is basically measured in tens of minutes right and every minute counts but now imagine that same radar is placed much further south say near the Canada US border at that point you might not be able to effectively track that missile until it's only about six minutes away which is just moments before its terminal stage of plummeting towards Earth from space at maximum speed if you're aware of a threat or a potential threat 2,000 miles away vice 200 miles away as a leader of a country you can pick up the phone and have a conversation with the leader of another country for deterrent effects that gives us more decision space it gives us more options we want to be able to call out bad behavior and say &quot;We know what you're doing and we have a a prepared response for you.&quot; Now you might be thinking okay but the US isn't just the lower 48 states right there is northern radar coverage in Alaska for example even in Greenland for that matter and that's true but those radar stations only really cover a relatively narrow slice of Arctic approaches meanwhile Canada's northern land mass spans roughly 25% of the Earth's circumference at the Arctic Circle giving it the capacity to detect threats from many angles if you look at the nature of the width that Canada has in the north in the Arctic it's a pretty significant gap if we didn't work together with the United States to cover this area so yes Canada's geography makes it invaluable to American missile defense but of course it's not just about land it's about what this country has built and is building on that land canada understands missile defense it's been part of NORAT the North American Aerospace Defense Command since it was established back in 1958 and by the 1980s Canada became a key player pouring serious money into building out a chain of radar stations stretching from Yukon to Labrador you have done a lot for uh since 1958 with NORAD you know you funded 40% of the uh the north warning system or the systems up front now those systems as far as we know haven't actually ever had to deal with an incoming missile threat but that's kind of the way it's supposed to work missile defense almost being more about deterrence than actually having to intercept threats all the time and that's not to say they haven't been useful in other ways too just one example recently spotting both Russian and Chinese bombers flying near Alaska aircraft capable of carrying dozens of cruise missiles some of what NORAD does which is to warn of any incoming air threats and aerospace threats that is going to be part of Golden Dome because in order to be able to defeat a variety of missiles you have to be aware that they're incoming we are over 60% of the northern uh northern approaches is covered by Canada or more depending on how you calculate it our sensors are pretty vital for being able to detect threats coming from that axis and that's especially true when you consider how Canada is investing tens of billions of dollars into new radar systems on its own with the goal of taking its threat spotting power to a whole new level what we need to be able to do is see around the curvature of the Earth as far away as possible because that's most likely where the launch points are going to be yeah this is where things get a bit more sophisticated most traditional radar systems can only see as far as the horizon like looking straight ahead on a flat road but there is another special kind of radar that can see beyond the curvature of the Earth these over the horizon radar systems work by shooting highfrequency radio waves up into the sky and bouncing them off the upper atmosphere back down to the surface this lets you see threats from thousands of kilometers away the US currently has one of these systems looking out over the southern horizon monitoring threats from Central and South America it's also investing in at least two more to keep an eye on the Pacific but what it doesn't have is one looking north canada though is building two such systems right now we've just recently let a contract uh to build the first set of them for the foreseeable future it is probably the main system that we're going to invest in according to the Canadian government these new systems include an Arctic over the horizon radar and a polar over the horizon radar both intended to provide early warning radar coverage and expected to be fully operational by 2031 and 2033 those are expected to give Canada even more lead time over and above the detection capabilities that we calculated earlier with an over the horizon radar capability now you're able to see several thousand miles and so it may be a T-fold difference in timing that you gain on awareness of the launch platform and worth restating these radar systems don't just detect incoming missiles from further away it's their ability to see everything else like a plane flying over the ocean which might be carrying a hypersonic missile or a space-based threat orbiting before it drops down into national airspace or even a missile armed warship deep in the Arctic Ocean over the horizon capability is not just for missiles it can see maritime all the way to space so that's a significant contribution to overall domain awareness for potential threats to North America our adversaries are increasingly emboldened we cannot and should not look first to others to defend our nation now technically these systems are still part of Canada's commitment to NORAD so right now the US gets access to this tech too but under the NORAD agreement each country owns the assets it contributes so when Canada builds and funds a radar system it controls how it's operated who can access the data how alerts are managed meaning despite Trump's claims Canada clearly does have something to offer besides money or its sovereignty as the NORAD commander and Northcom commander the last thing I wanted to be doing was shooting down missiles over North America you're much better off deterring in the first place or going after the archer not the arrow and so Canada offers a lot when it comes to maritime awareness airborne platform and subc now look it is important to remember that Canada is still not the superpower here right canada does absolutely rely on American money and might for protection but it's also true that defending this continent requires Canada's eyes and ears there's just too much ground to cover millions of square kilometers which makes missile defense in North America a very complex problem to solve so when Trump drops ultimatums like pay or become the 51st state Canada would seem to have at least some room to say &quot;Well hold on let's talk [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Iran's most famous ski destination is tol Resort it overlooks the capital tyan you can get there on a 7 km chairlift from the tyan suburb of tajrish and on the way up the chairlift if you turn around at just the right time you can see something interesting a giant walled off area filled with lush green trees in amongst the trees is the Palace of the former Sha of Iran his majesty liked skiing hence the convenient chairlift these days it's where the president of Iran holds big events and meets with world leaders right on the edge of the palace grounds is a concrete building five stories high and if you happen to be on the chairlift at 1:37 a.m. on the 31st of July this year you would have seen the Western corner of that building explode windows were shattered and exterior wall crumbled and Rubble fell onto the Terrace below now that explosion was no accident it was the result of a bomb a bomb that killed an extremely high-profile Target Hamas leader Ishmael hania has been assassinated in the Iranian Capital tyan this attack appears to have been meticulously planned and carried out flawlessly probably by Israel as is its usual practice the Israeli government has declined to make any official comment the mozard simply never comments at all but if that's true it's wild killing a Hamas leader inside the compound of the Iranian president while he's under the protection of the Iranian revolutionary guard is an extraordinary statement the Iran supreme leader said Revenge was our duty and that Israel had prepared a harsh punishment for itself by killing a dear guest in our home there's some debate about the mechanic of how they pulled this off which I'll definitely be getting into later in this episode but no matter the methods they used the risk involved in this assassination operation is Extreme if it was Israel that did this why did they do it in such an extraordinary manner well the answer is fascinating and it tells us a lot about the incredibly complex political situation that Israel has found itself in where it feels the need for Revenge but only in a way that doesn't alienate its allies today the unbelievable assassination plot against Ismael Hanah and what it tells us about the escalating conflict between Israel and its enemies the world is on the brink of a fullscale war in the Middle East I'm Matt beon and this is if you're [Music] listening the Israeli intelligence agency mad was once considered to be one of the most terrifying ruthless spy agencies in the world known for its daring and brutal missions the kidnapping trial and execution of Nazi Adolf Aman the Israeli bombing of the Syrian nuclear reactor assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists the purpose of these plots was to communicate to Israel's enemies that there was nowh they could hide without mad finding them and yet for nearly a decade Ismael Hanah leader of Israel's number one enemy Hamas has been living in Qatar for safety security the Israelis would like to kill him he's not alone a bunch of Hamas leaders live in qat it's a weird setup billionaire gas princes the US Military and Hamas all living next door to each other on the Arabian Peninsula and they're not hiding there either they live out in the open Ismael hanas spent years there and nothing happened to him you might think that sending your spies to assassinate your greatest enemies would be easier to do in a country that you share a bunch of allies with but it's not and the reason for that goes back to a series of mad operations that went terribly terribly wrong Israelis once saw their foreign intelligence Service as Invincible not anymore throughout the '90s and 2000s mad bungled a few really high-profile missions the Mad used to have the image of working like a Swiss clock and now it is almost like a Swiss cheese but the biggest of all their screw-ups came in 2010 and that's because they screwed up in a very particular way this is the Spy story that could well spell the end of old fashion Cloak and Dagger Espionage this time the operation was in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates the target hamas's top weapons supplier a man named Mamud almu the Palestinian resistance fighter was known to mosad for buying weapons from Iran and notorious also for kidnapping and killing two Israeli soldiers in 1989 it was called operation plasma screen I assume mad had run out of intimidating operation names and had moved on to household appliances it involved more than 20 mad agents all traveling on non-israeli passports that's really necessary for the operation to work at the time more than two dozen countries including the UAE did not accept Israeli passports so while the CIA and MI6 can print Jack Ryan and James Bond new passports whenever they like Massad agents have to use foreign passports without those foreign passports there's no operation plasma screen not to mention operation DVD player operation Lazy Boy recliner and operation universal remote so how do you get hold of foreign passports well apparently Israel developed a system if you're in Israeli with two passports be that second passport British or Australian you can be approached by an official the official asks you if you need that second passport in the short term and if you say no you're asked if out of Duty to the country whether you'd be prepared to have your passport details borrowed borrowed best no one asks what they're being borrowed for operation plasma screen would require more than 20 of these borrowed passports using fake passports more than once is risky they'd have to get the job done with as few visits to Dubai as possible on visit one the agents followed elabo around Dubai observing his patterns on visit 2 they slipped poison in his drink but he inconveniently failed to die and went home to Syria thinking that he was just sick 2 months later alive and well he headed back to Dubai spies traveling on the same set of passports followed him again M arrives from Damascus midaf afternoon and is watched by several operatives the man in the baseball cap goes by the name of Australian Adam Corman virtually the entire operation is captured on CCTV Israeli operatives follow alabu from the airport to the hotel when he goes to his room two spies with tennis rackets manage to slide into the lift with him hate it when people do that one of the tennis players watches which room he goes into the operatives book a room opposite and still more agents move in and when the Hamas man leaves to go shopping he's followed every step it's quite funny watching these surveillance teams go about their business you can see them changing disguises into business suits pushing on doors that say pull endlessly wandering up and down Hotel corridors like weird business ghosts meanwhile while four of them break into albo's room the Hamas official arrives back from his shopping trip and into the ambush of four assassins they use a special ultrasonic device to anesthetize him without a needle and lower him to the floor waiting for his heart to stop but they aren't out of the woods yet once a team like this starts working it is very easy technologically to trace them at each and every point of the whole of the whole maneuver unlike in the movies they don't have a guy in a van who hacks into the security system and erases the CCTV footage the whole thing is caught on camera their only hope is that nobody will ever bother to check it so they take off albo's clothes and Tuck him into bed it'll look like he died in his sleep in the absence of signs of a struggle for days police thought he' died of natural causes and with agents safely out of the country it seemed the perfect hit it was the passports that blew their cover after Hamas notified duai police that their man was dead it was simple for investigators to check immigration logs for anything suspicious they discovered that the same group of people had clearly been following al-mu in and out of the country Dubai Police say Mahmud al- mau's Killers tracked him from the moment he arrived in the country warrants are now being issued for their arrest which was a bit of a nasty surprise for the people who the passports belong to imagine waking up one morning only to find out that apparently you've traveled to an exotic Middle Eastern location and assassinated an alleged arms dealer the Australians Brits Irish French and Germans whose passports had been used were not very happy I'm angry why is this happening to me does this mean I can't visit my parents because someone used my name it's like a movie the governments of the countries the passports came from were also not very happy they were all friendly with Israel and here was their Ally using their passports for international assassinations such misuse of British passports is intolerable the fact that this was done by a country which is a friend only adds insults to injury this was not the act of a friend this is this is not the first occasion where there has been misuse of an Australian passport by Israeli agencies needless to say Dubai was angry too that is a deplorable and unacceptable method of operation it was extremely embarrassing and damaging for Israel Israel relies on the support of its allies well for its very existence they couldn't risk doing this again in a place like Dubai that's why hamas's headquarters are now in Qatar the Americans had an agreement with the qataris and the Israelis that you don't kill Hamas leaders in Qatar this has provided a challenge for Israel which previously pledged to eliminate Hamas leaders when those leaders aren't in Qatar they're other highly developed Western Allied countries like Egypt and turkey if you Aspire for a country that's pledged to eliminate Hamas leaders it might be easier for you to get them there logistically but diplomatically it's Kryptonite when those Leaders Travel to meet their allies in Iran though well the Palestinian militant group Hamas says its political leader isma hania has been assassinated in Iran so how'd they pull it off mad couldn't get is Hana in Qatar where he lived so they'd have to get him while he was traveling mad knew that Hana traveled regularly to tan mad also knew that he stayed in the guest house of the Iranian revolutionary guard Corps on the edge of the presidential Palace complex at the foot of the mountains it seems they had also managed to bribe two of the building's guards offering them cash and asylum in Europe in exchange for attaching a brick-sized bomb to the bottom of hania's bed they had the where and the how but they were missing the when you can't have a crew of Massad agents hiding in the hills of tyan endlessly staking out the building waiting for your guy to arrive but on the 18th of May this year something happened to help with that third thing I've seen vision of it already there's a huge plume of smoke coming from that site the Iranian president Ibrahim REI was killed in a helicopter accident we did a whole episode about it at the time give it a watch after this one the president's death opened up an opportunity for mad it knew that hania would be invited to the inauguration of the new president in July what happened next is still a little unclear there's at least three versions of the story The New York Times and the Jerusalem Post report that the bomb was planted soon after Rey's death and sat there for 8 weeks waiting for hania to visit for the event the Jewish Chronicle in Lon reports that in fact the bomb was planted on the afternoon of hania's arrival But whichever version turns out to be true we know that by the time hania turned in for the night on the 30th of July the bomb had been planted and it wasn't on a timer it could be detonated when the time was right luckily for Mad the building was unbelievably easy to spy on you can see it clearly from anywhere on the hillside that stretches up behind the palace you can see get from the chairlift on your way up for a ski or you could dress up in green camouflage and climb any of the several hundred trees surrounding the building which is what the Jewish Chronicle reports that Massad agents did hania attended the inauguration of Iran's new president met with the country's supreme leader and then went to the guest house the agents watched hania's car arrive they watched him go into his room watched him turn off the light waited a few moments and then pressed the button two assassinations 14 years apart the differences between them tell us a lot about Israel's position in the world in 2010 mad's operation in Dubai really irritated Israel's allies in Europe and Australia but in 2024 Israel needs those allies more than they've needed them in decades by carrying out assassinations in Iran they're operating in a way that is far more risky for their but much less likely to anger their friends what mad does though it's it's different from the CIA or MI6 CIA people they don't like they don't like this stuff you know it's it's messy while British and American spy agencies do assassinate people they do it in war zones and they tend to do it with military operations or drone strikes and they tend to tell the public about it why don't they do sneaky James Bond St sty assassinations because it was believed to be counterproductive you're just creating martyrdom you're creating that feel of persecution and in the long term that's negative and top it off it usually doesn't achieve anything all terrorists are replaced sooner or later the point of these assassinations is to create fear to terrorize your opponents to make your enemies constantly worry that you've planted a bomb under their bed that the places that they think are safe aren't really Israel's basically sending a message to the Iranians can kill any one of you anywhere anytime it's the same reason Russia kills people by poisoning their underpants or their tea or their door knobs isma hania was the chief negotiator in the peace talks aimed at ending the war in Gaza and now he's been replaced as Hamas Leader by a far more fanatical islamist Yaya sinoa hania's death potentially indicates an Israeli desire to prolong the war and it's part of a series of tit fortat attacks in recent weeks that could signal an escalation of the conflict the thing is though when Russia pulls stunts like this they're condemned by the Western World Israel thinks it's found the guard rails for how to carry out crossborder assassinations without losing friends but right now their friendships are quite stretched they cannot afford to make any mistakes [Music] [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="democracy depends on a free press please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org/give we begin today's show with the escalating feud between President Trump and Elon Musk the world's richest man who up until just recently was a top presidential adviser and Trump's top political benefactor the fight could have broad implications for Trump's presidency the Republican party and many government programs including NASA that rely on technology from Musk's various companies the feud became public Tuesday when Musk called Trump's so-called big beautiful budget bill a disgusting abomination because it'll increase the federal deficit by $2.5 trillion the tension then escalated considerably on Thursday during a meeting with German Chancellor Friedri Meritz a reporter asked Trump about Musk's comment this is part of his response but I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here better than you people he knew everything about it he had no problem with it all of a sudden he had a problem and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV mandate because that's billions and billions of dollars and it really is unfair he knew it better than almost anybody and he never had a problem until right after he left and if you saw the statements he made about me which I'm sure you can get very easily it's very fresh on tape uh he said the most beautiful things about me and he hasn't said bad about me personally but I'm sure that'll be next but I'm I'm very disappointed in Elon i've helped Elon a lot the feud then spilled into social media with the two billionaires launching personal attacks on their own social media platforms musk on X and Trump on Truth Social at 2:37 p.m thursday Trump wrote &quot;Elon was wearing thin i asked him to leave i took away his EV mandate that forced everyone to buy electric cars that nobody else wanted that he knew for months I was going to do and he just went crazy.&quot; At 3:10 p.m Musk wrote &quot;Time to drop the really big bomb real Donald Trump is in the Epstein files that's the real reason they have not been made public have a nice day DJT.&quot; Then Trump wrote &quot;The easiest way to save money in our budget billions and billions of dollars is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts i was always surprised Biden didn't do it,&quot; Trump said musk responded by threatening to decommission the Dragon spacecraft used by NASA musk also appeared to back the impeachment of Trump and took credit for Trump winning the presidency trump ally Steve Bannon went further calling for Musk to be investigated and deported he also called for Trump to seize Musk's company SpaceX to talk more about the fracturing of the Trump Musk relationship and what this could mean for the Republican party we're joined by Quinn Sabodian professor of international history at Boston University working on a book about Elon Musk titled Muskism he is author of Hayek Bastards: Race Gold IQ and the Capitalism of the Farright as well as Crackup Capitalism: Market Radicals and the Dream of a World Without Democracy professor Sodian welcome back to Democracy Now were you shocked by what you saw happen yesterday i mean who knows they could be holding a joint news conference soon and announced they're back in love yeah I mean they are people who always have their eye on the bottom line but they also are obviously titanically sized egos and I think that more than anything this is just a sign of uh how dangerous it is to put you know billions of dollars even the lives of astronauts the whole future of the American economy and the political scene in the hands of two sole human beings when you said threaten the lives of astronauts explain Well the Dragon uh unit that you mentioned is the only way for the astronauts in the International Space Station to get to and from um where they are now so were he to decommission it it might literally mean that they would be stranded out there kind of gravity style um so this is just one of the examples of many of the offloading of core government functions onto private service providers that Elon Musk has been so masterful at playing that we feel uh more and more exposed to from the uh the use of Starlink satellites in the field of battle in the Ukraine to the use of that same internet uh connection as leverage in his battle with the Brazilian government i feel like over time we'll only realize more and more how much we are at the mercy of someone who is acting with total impetuousness and sometimes not even with his own self-interest in mind let's go from the threat uh to lives in space to hear on the ground that Elon Musk taking on the budget calling it an abomination um when Trump said he knows that um the budget bill better than almost anyone else inside and out uh Musk's response was that is false i never saw it it was passed in the middle of the night um can you talk about the significance i mean this is the guy in charge of Doge how many thousands of jobs have been lost um and yet at the same time now he's viciously attacking the budget that was so narrowly passed and it could threaten its ultimate passage i mean I think it's worth sort of returning to the question of why Musk got involved at all with Trump right what he was doing with this Doge project and I think it's uh possible to kind of split it up into three categories i think first of all he was doing a kind of a bear hug strategy so I think especially on the trade war and his many many interests in China you know he has a a gigafactory there that has capacity to make a million Teslas a year he wanted to get out in front of any possible excessive economic nationalism that might be rolled out and then I think he was kind of making a hail mary move that you know he hadn't really clicked with the Biden administration and this could be a chance to maybe use a window of opportunity to boost his own aspirations especially in artificial intelligence where he was being outpaced by people like Sam Alman and Open AI and then third I think you could see it as a kind of moonshot strategy where I think he was trying to really even more plug in his own services especially SpaceX to in fact not only get to the moon but divert the whole project towards Mars so there was a lot of reasons why Musk would want to be involved but from Trump's point of view he's never really been a fiscal hawk right he's always actually run against austerity in certain ways and run against this mainstream obsession with the debt ceiling and the deficit that has so defined um uh GOP politics for the last couple decades so it was always kind of an odd fit and it's not surprising in that sense that Musk now feels that this budget is you know not hard austerity enough for his liking it's telling for example that he's posted multiple Milton Freriedman memes over the last couple of days sort of implying that this problem of runaway debt inflation should be top of mind at all times for the government but Trump has always profited by playing fast and loose with that kind of ideology and uh the question is why now has this led to a snapping point for Musk and I think there's a keep going if I could just say I think there's a a couple of things there i think um Trump invokes the EV mandate and that is a serious issue right what that is it needs to be broken down is the capacity of California to enforce a move towards electric cars over time a part of which is a regulatory credit system that allows um normal ice uh internal combustion engine vehicles to buy credits from electric vehicle manufacturers and this is now 40% of Tesla's net income in the last year it's went up a billion dollars in the last year alone and if that gets killed it really does kind of kill Tesla's margin and I think that Musk is starting to feel the heat from Chinese producers like BYD battery producers like CL and I think he sees here maybe the possible demise of the Tesla brand as he is hated more and more from both sides of the spectrum so there's reasons as he returns to his businesses to start to sweat about what he's actually signed up for um uh how about what this highlights around a rift within the MAGA movement and where JD Vance uh fits into this the vice president well it's always interesting to ask what exactly was going on with Doge right i mean if you want to get into the real kind of dangerous liaison sort of cortisanship I think that was happening inside of the White House it it seems that based on reporting Steven Miller was kind of stage managing along with his wife a lot of what was happening with Doge and if you look at what actually came out of Doge and this is a good time now for us to sort of do a autopsy or post-mortem on it as it winds down really he said he was going to do two trillion cut two trillion in cuts out of a $6 trillion budget very unlikely went back to 1 trillion scaled it back to 150 billion what did they end up taking out i mean it's basically culture war stuff right i mean it's ways to trigger the progressives and the libs get rid of US aid attack uh NE funding arts funding science funding um education energy these ended up being big wins not really for Musk's own bottom line cost cutting mentality but very much for the um culture war being waged by people like Miller and JD Vance and Russell VA at the office of management of budget so there is a way of looking at this as having been a success from their point of view they were able to use the credibility of Musk as a kind of supposed um you know brilliant Edison-like inventor and wonderful um you know efficiency creating cost cutter to actually get to some of their political goals but they never could bring that big number down why because entitlement spending still dominates um the state spending in the GDP and when you come close to that you come close to the kind of beating heart of the social contract and we saw the town hall meetings we saw the anger when things started to um encroach on the questions of social security and Medicaid and for me that was a very telling moment and it was one that I think took Musk by surprise too he's not used to the idea of needing to engage with a kind of consent and legitimacy mechanism where people feel like they paid into something and should now get something back he's used to interacting with a Twitter fan base a set of really boughtin Tesla investors for whom you know he always walks on water and he's a god reincarnate and when he just was confronted with the anger of average people who want to make sure that they can pay for their next meal um he didn't know what to do so I think that there's a kind of a there's a way to see this as a victory for the national conservatives they got to do some of their their um their easy wins against the pro progressives and the libs and now they're able to keep the door open for more protectionism and expansion of of spending as we see in the so-called big beautiful bill um finally does do you think Musk has access to all of the private information that his Doge um army downloaded from all the agencies is that possible i am not a a software programmer or I do not know how databases work that well but it seems at least likely that um part of what they were doing there when they were converting things done in old programming languages and updating them was also you know harvesting a lot of that data for use for we don't know what um feeding the machine of Grock or XAI is the most likely answer and finally let me ask you Steve Bannon who's on the anti-Musk side of the MAGA rift has been calling for Trump to nationalize Musk's businesses and for him to be deported right i mean uh Elon Musk comes from South Africa yeah i mean this actually isn't the harshest thing that Bannon has ever said he referred to Silicon Valley as an aparttheid state a few months ago um the idea of nationalizing SpaceX is an interesting one it would certainly run against the core um privatization ethos that Trump and the former GOP has been following for decades and decades so far I would chalk that up to just um saber rattling rhetoric for his podcast more than an actual policy proposal democracy Now is funded by viewers like you please give today at democracynow.org/give org/g" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] [Applause] [Music] relax heat [Music] [Music] hello and welcome to the West Asia Post i am Ready Francis coming to you from the heart of Beirut Lebanon and this is Won's weekly show where we bring you all things new from the most volatile region in the world from Gaza we are starting after back-to- back shootings further crippled the aid operation and further escalated the humanitarian crisis before we delve into that let's take a look at what's making the headlines across the [Music] [Music] region [Music] woo heat [Music] [Music] shootings and gunfires near aid centers have become the new norm in Gaza this is all happening while people are basically starving to death sometimes now why is this happening and why have the Israelis said that the routes to these eight centers are combat zones we tell you more [Music] gazms are starving there's almost no food the aid centers are deserted food items are selling at astronomical prices 1 kg of flour is selling at $300 one packet of butter costs $25 as per local reports a US-backed aid group is reopening two of its aid centers in the Palestinian enclave the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation says it is coordinating with the Israeli military for better coordination of aid distribution this development comes after the sites witnessed multiple shooting incidents killing at least 80 Palestinians and injuring hundreds according to the Hamas Run Civil Defense Agency the first incident took place early on Sunday morning when 31 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire another three people were killed by gunfire on Monday morning according to the International Committee of the Red Cross we only wanted to feed our children they're the ones who need food not us we're used to going without like during Ramadan that's why we rushed to the aid distribution site they tempted people with promises of help but in the end they opened fire why what did we do to deserve this again on Tuesday 27 Palestinians lost their lives israel denounced the claims as false reports claiming it only fired at suspects who drifted away from the designated route earlier today IDF forces fired warning shots half a kilometer from the distribution point at suspects who approached them and were endangering the safety of the fighters the incident is under investigation and also here we will arrive to the truth all three reportedly placed near an aid distribution center in the southwest of Gaza in the Tal Sultan area the facilities are part of a new US-backed aid system widely condemned by humanitarian groups aiming to bypass the UN which Israel has accused of failing to prevent Hamas diverting aid to its fighters but the UN and aid groups deny there is a significant diversion of aid to militants and say the new system which they have rejected allows Israel to use food as a weapon and violates humanitarian principles and won't be effective osher stresses once again um that after 80 full days of blockade on the entry of aid and any other supplies people in Gaza are starving this demands the urgent opening of all crossings and allowed unimpeded access for humanitarian organizations to deliver aid at scale through multiple routes and to all areas where people require assistance our partners tell us that more than 90% of families in Gaza lack the cash needed to buy what little food remains available in the markets israel has now banned Palestinians to travel on the roads leading to aid centers gazms now ask &quot;Is that practically possible?&quot; Thousands of Palestinians walk to the sites early each morning in search of a handful of food the scenes are desperate it remains unclear how aid agencies the new bagged aid system in Gaza will come to a common ground one that would revive Palestinians from famine iran and Israel are preparing for any eventuality if the Washington Tean nuclear talks don't get to a deal now Iran is focused on its uranium enrichment while Israel is carrying on air drills in our next report we discover how these arch enemies prepare for the battlefield take a look israel and Iran are gearing up for the battlefield gearing up for any eventuality if Washington's nuclear talks with Iran do not yield positive results independence means not waiting for the green light from America and the likes of America and not worrying about the red light from America and the likes of America un Atomic Agency has warned that Iran is stepping up the production of enriched uranium in the thick of its stocks with the United States it says Iran has increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% in less than 4 months the United Nations nuclear watchdog says that Iran's cooperation with the agency is less than satisfactory the the big difference here is that we are talking about 400 more or less 400 kg of uh 60% uranium it's a very high level of enrichment israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacted to the IAEA report saying that it was a clear warning sign that Iran is totally determined to complete its nuclear weapons program this is evident from the alarming scope of Iran's uranium enrichment activity such a level of enrichment exists only in countries actively pursuing nuclear weapons and has no civilian justification whatsoever the Islamic Republic accused Israel of providing unreliable and misleading information to the United Nations nuclear watchdog to be used in its new report in light of recent reports of an imminent strike on its nuclear facilities Thran is aggressively increasing the capabilities of its missile system ensuring that it has more nuclear capable weaponry in its arsenal recently Iran unveiled a new solid fuel ballistic missile called Kasimbasif which has a range of 1,200 kilometers thran had recently unveiled its underground missile city the country has drawn up detailed plans for five new missile bases these are heavily fortified underground military facilities that store maintain and can launch short medium and intermediate range ballistic missiles they form the backbone of the country's missile strategy designed specifically to protect key assets from detection or destruction during conflict this increased stockpile of weapons having a nuclear payload includes medium-range ballistic missiles such as Kuram Shahar Shahab 3 and Sil it also includes intermediate range missiles such as Imad and Gadr iran's defense minister Aziz Nasir Zadesh says Thran is ready to defend itself in case of an attack he added that Iran has no hostility towards neighboring countries but the United States bases in the region will be considered targets by Thran reports suggest Israel has been preparing itself to launch strikes on Iran's nuclear bases for months reports say US intel has gathered information regarding the movement of Israeli troops and ammunitions in the West Asian region israel has reportedly conducted air drills and is waiting for US President Donald Trump's not to attack Iran israel has even conducted strikes targeting Syria's coastal cities Flutakia and Tatus saying it struck weapon storage facilities containing missiles that posed a threat to international and Israeli maritime freedom of navigation according to a Reuters report Saudi Arabia's defense minister Prince Khaled bin Salman held a closed door meeting in Tehran with Iranian President Masoud Peshkan and foreign minister Abbas Arachi in April during the meeting the Saudi prince reportedly warned Iran that Trump had little patience for drawn out negotiations and that it would be better to reach a deal with the US than face the possibility of an Israeli attack if the talks broke down this situation raises a critical question will Israel proceed with unilateral strikes in Iran's nuclear program without approval from the United States still in Iran the Islamic Republic is recently facing tensions at its borderline with Pakistan now we have recently reported about the high tech wall that Iran is building along the Pakistani borders they recently removed the nationality from around 30,000 Pakistanis who had crossed over the wall now why is this happening on the borders between Iran and Pakistan we bring you the story spanning across Iran Sistan and Balojasthan and Pakistan's Baloasan the Iran Pakistan border is grappling with multiple challenges the highly poorest territory is susceptible to drug smuggling and terrorist activities despite maintaining a generally positive relationship both countries have often accused each other of harboring terrorists and failing to secure their respective sides of the border these concerns prompted the setting up of the Iran Pakistan border barrier that both nations agreed to in 2011 iran is securing its eastern front building high walls to safeguard its territory over the years Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatah Ali Kamini and top officials have sought to seal Thran's borders while maintaining designated crossings for legal trade and travel but despite the fortification project that is still underway the illegal crossber crossing is on the rise pakistan's passport and immigration department announced 34,000 undocumented Pakistani nationals have been repatriated from Iran over the past year 50,000 more were deported from Iraq many Pakistani nationals attempt to enter Iran illegally in an attempt to reach European and Persian Gulf countries for work and migration opportunities reports suggest as many as 135,000 Pakistanis have applied for political asylum in Europe and the United States over the past 2 years several countries including the UAE Italy the UK and other European nations have suspended student visa programs for Pakistani applicants pakistani officials point to the rising trend of Pakistanis overstaying while visiting Saudi Arabia Iran and Iraq for pilgrimage islamabad is now cancelling the passports of over 7,800 citizens who were deported from different countries for their involvement in beggar and other illegal activities abroad tensions along Iran's eastern border are part of a broader pattern of regional instability and conflict with Iran facing challenges from both within and beyond its [Music] borders now let's go to Turkey last week we reported about Razep Verdugan wanting to rewrite the Turkish constitution and this week we will report about his crackdown on opposition figures now he didn't stop at the mayor of Istanbul Imam Olu it's still ongoing take a look turkey's government continues its crackdown on the country's main opposition party amid growing political tensions five more mayors from opposition party CHP have been arrested the latest sweep includes three mayors from Istanbul and two more from the southern province of Adana the stumble Chief Public Prosecutor's Office issued detention orders for 47 people and detained another [Music] 30 the operation is the fifth wave of arrests against the government's political opponents starting with the jailing of Istanbul's mayor Erem Imamlu known as President Taib Erdogan's main rival in March imamlu's arrest on March 19 triggered the largest street protests Turkey has seen in over a decade despite his arrest CHP has declared Imamoglu as its main candidate for the 2028 presidential elections but his future in politics hangs in the balance as he is facing multiple ongoing trials and investigations erdoganal's administration rejects claims of political interference insisting the judiciary is independent prosecutors have opened an investigation into the leader of Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party on charges of threatening and insulting Estambul's chief prosecutor at least 11 mayors including Imamlu have now been removed from office as part of investigations into CHP municipalities istanul and a clutch of major cities fell to the CHP in 2019 with the opposition extending its control in last year's municipal elections chp won the municipalities of 36 of Turkeykey's 81 provinces in local polls it gained 37% of the votes nationwide compared to 36% for the president's party marking the CHP's greatest electoral victory since Erdogan came to power two decades ago the vote was seen as a barometer of Erdogan's popularity as he sought to win back control of key urban areas he lost to the opposition in elections 5 years ago the CHP's victory in Ankara and Estambul in 2019 had shattered Erdogan's aura of invincibility the sweeping crackdown against the opposition also comes at a time when Erdogan who has presided over Turkey for more than two decades as prime minister since 2003 and president since 2014 has been advocating for a new constitution that would put family values at the forefront the US is planning to withdraw all its troops from Iraq by 2026 but the question is will there be implications and is the Iraqi state ready to deal with the terrorist extremists threats we tell you when the Islamic State group seized control of swaves of Iraq territory in 2014 the US launched air strikes and provided support to Iraqi and Kurdish forces in the region as the extremist group surged into Iraq's second largest city of Mosul members of the Iraqi security forces fled stripping off their uniforms after 3 years of fierce fighting near Baghdad Mosul was finally liberated the military effort was spearheaded by Iraq's elite counterterrorism service bolstered by the return of American troops and the US Air Force the US spent $25 billion on training and equipping Iraq's security forces up to September 2012 alongside Iraq's own spending on fighter jets and other advanced materials it was only last year that US and Iraq agreed to end operation inherent resolve the US-led coalition's mission to combat ISIL the majority of 2500 US personnel in Iraq are scheduled to leave in the initial phase with a small number remaining until 2026 with reports of an increase in attacks by Islamic State sleeper cells fears of instability across the border in Syria and with Iran looking to shore up its resistance Axis in Iraq there are concerns that another complete US withdrawal will once again leave the country vulnerable sleeper cells are already activated in the region where the ISIS claimed its first attack on Syrian forces loyal to Ahmed Al-Shara reports suggest some Iraqi politicians want a US presence to continue at least till the ongoing US Iran nuclear talks reach a conclusion the pressing question is whether Iraq is ready to maintain its own

          <attvalue for="3" value="In 1965, Preston Haskell founded a company built on the belief that design-build could streamline delivery, improve collaboration and produce better outcomes for clients. At a time when the model was largely untested, he pioneered an approach that would become a new standard in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry. &#10;&#10;60 Years of Haskell | Built to Last celebrates the company’s 60th anniversary by revisiting its founding principles and vision for the future. Featuring interviews with nearly 20 past and present team members and rare archival footage, the film traces Haskell’s journey from a startup in Jacksonville, Florida, to an integrated delivery leader with projects across the globe. &#10;&#10;See how one founder’s vision continues to influence how the world builds. &#10;&#10;Check out our website to learn more and connect with us on social media. &#10;&#10;Website: https://www.haskell.com/  &#10;Instagram:   / haskellco    &#10;Facebook:   / thehaskellcompany    &#10;LinkedIn:   / the-haskell-company  " />

          <attvalue for="7" value="(gentle music) (instrument clacking) - For all of my life, I had wanted to start my own business, and I was encouraged to do so by my father. I had always wanted to make design-build the centerpiece of our company. The other contractor would hire an outside architect, or an engineer, and try to integrate those with his own company. We, on the other hand, had people in-house, all of the disciplines, repeatedly working on projects for Haskell and repeat customers, and making for a much more effective delivery process as a result. (gentle music) - Having the design professionals working side-by-side with construction was relatively unique. It's still unique today, in the sense of all the different practice areas that we have, so you can go to another company that may have integrated design team, but it might just be some architects, or it might be some structural engineers, or things like that. You don't have architecture, civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, process, packaging, automation, transportation, all these different services that we offer in our integrated package, along with construction and turnkey EPC, and all those types of delivery that we have is very unique. (lively music) - [Narrator] The Haskell company is different, solving facility problems through integrated thinking, excelling through trust, collaboration, and innovation. - Preston's expertise is always 10 years ahead of everybody else. He's a visionary and thinking visionary. - Preston's vision of having a permanent craft employee core of team members that would travel with us from project to project, that would know the Haskell way, that would complete projects of high quality, and safely, and know that they would have another job at the end of the current job, very unique in the industry. - Some of the proudest moments were probably the years I started with Haskell in the younger days, just being part of the Haskell building itself, starting with that project, was my very first Haskell job. It's a great structure that we built out there. It's been there a long time and just brings back memories for me, being my first job with Haskell, being on his home corporate office. - I was one of the first PCE employees with the Haskell company. I remember when they didn't even own a truck, and I went from carpenter to assistant superintendent, and enjoyed every last day of it, and most of the time, they used to call me Mr. Tilter, 'cause I was good at building the tilt panels. I thought of things that would help us and make the job go quicker, but I'd done everything to try to improve things for Haskell. (gentle music) (lively rhythmic music) - [Narrator] The Haskell company is aiming for new heights. The employees are a team, conscientious, eager, ambitious. They are motivated and extremely qualified to get the job, then get the job done. - The American Transtech Project was a turning point for Haskell. It proved, in the end, to elevate design-build as a system of delivery on a very sophisticated building. It was what I called an impossible project, and what others called impossible, but that's what Haskell does. Haskell does impossible things. - [Preston] We held such a meeting with 13 other companies to discuss the formation of a national society for the promotion of design-build and making sure that design-build was done right. If you'll raise your glasses. - Within industry, he's a titan of our industry. He is innovative, he's creative. He could be singularly responsible for bringing back the concept of the master builder, of bringing back architecture, engineering, and construction into one organization. (gentle music) - We not only did design-build expertly, we serviced the customer expertly, so in my opinion, we became experts in that delivery, but Haskell perfected that model by adding the unique flavor of customer service being first. If you didn't treat the customer right, all the rest of it didn't matter. - Haskell had a culture for achievement at the highest level, and by and large, the people at the Haskell company were selected carefully, and they were first-order people across the board. - I called Preston and just introduced myself, and said, &quot;Well, interested in learning more about your business,&quot; but he was very gracious, so I flew down to Jacksonville. Preston took me to the conference room on the second floor, and it was completely filled with financial statements, and marketing materials, and sample proposals, and he introduced me to his two top executives, and he said, &quot;They are here to answer anything you want all day. They're at your disposal.&quot; So this went on for the full day, and I realized this guy was so confident he'd share anything with me, because by the time I figured out how to copy it, he'd be off doing something even better and bigger. I went back to my home in Los Angeles, and I said, &quot;I think I've seen the future of the industry.&quot; (chiming music) - [Narrator] And that's why we're successful, 'cause we take the next step besides just completing a building. We help them solve their problem and they can trust us. (upbeat music) (rhythmic music) - Time, after time, after time, Haskell's been on the leading edge of adapting innovations, whether it's scheduling softwares, project management systems, 3D design technologies, laser scanning. It's amazing what we can do with a project virtually, these days, that we couldn't before. But that started a very, very long time ago. It started in the '70s and the '80s, and it continues even to this day, the adaption of the newest and best technology for the benefit of our projects and our customers. - About Haskell, about (audio fades). - When the organization and the executive leadership team started Haskell 2025, it was also about how do we innovate, how do we invent, how do we invest, how do we build technology to improve our operations so that we build better capabilities for our clients, and I think that's pretty much the difference that I see in Haskell versus other companies in this industry. - There's not many AEC companies that have a thing that looks like disrupt tech, we're one of the, probably, 5 to 10 in the country, and so I think it's a big deal both for our employees and certainly for the way the world looks at us. - Haskell is absolutely committed to innovation. What we like to refer to it is like we're constantly punching above our weight, so there's a lot of movement, and the more that we innovate and create within Haskell, the more we are going to create for the industry. Everything that we've looked at, from the disrupt tech perspective and how to make Haskell better, it's how do we deliver a better product to our customer. - [Guest Speaker] A lot of developments, including the pavilion, which has been a big success. - They are a tremendous group to work with. They're receptive to our... - When they came in and met with us for the first time, they gave us the most professional presentation. We felt the most comfortable with them. their people. - The Haskell company far exceeded the city's expectations, not only completing the job before the deadline- - One of the key foundations of Haskell and Haskell's success is how well we do in the field, and it's remarkable to see how we've progressed over time and how our sophistication and our ability to deliver in field operations, it's what our customers see. We build tangible products, and at the end of the day, when the customer moves into a new facility, the end product is what they see, and that end product is delivered by excellence in field operations. - We basically were ready to follow the client to, essentially, any country to support them with their business, and that's how we ended up evolving into APAC, so the Asia Pacific operation that you see us today in the Philippines, in Malaysia, and Singapore, the reason we are there is because a client needed us. - Getting back to (indistinct). - If you go pre-2014, I had no concept that I'd be in Asia, and then when we were doing the project, it wasn't like, &quot;Okay, I'll go there and live there for 10 years,&quot; that wasn't also part of the plan, but the challenge, and the adventure, and the opportunities, never regret the choice. And I hope, again, people realize that in our organization, if you have a little bit of courage, an appropriate amount of, I'd say, sense of adventure, you can create new things. - The operation overseas and in Latin America, it's a substantial part of what we do, it's an important part of what we do. The reason we are doing so much work outside the US really boils down to trust. Clients that are hiring us, they trust us, in large part 'cause they know us from working here in the States. That trust extends to us delivering complex projects, first-of-kind projects, or large projects outside the US. Our team has expanded as far as the diversity of the people that come to work for us, their backgrounds, their expertise. We hire from a lot of different universities now, we hire from a lot of different geographies, and by that I mean outside of the US, and those teams complement what we do very well, and we're naturally better because we have a more diverse team. (train rumbling) - So what I've seen in the time that I've been on the board is those tenured clients, they have a well-entrenched partnership based off of, you know, programs that they have delivered together as a partnership, and they've built on that in the years, and now, what I'm starting to see is new clients, new partnerships merging as new fields, new markets are really opening here in the United States and abroad. - We are definitely team-focused. We strive to do excellence in everything that we do. We're focused on service, service to the community, and I think that partnership, our clients value and come to respect, year after year, that's what I think they keep coming back. - If you can promise your customer date certain, delivery certain, quality certain, and deliver on that, everybody wins. - We don't view it as a transaction with our clients and our customers, we view it as, you know, we're an extension of their team, and we bring a lot to the table, bring a lot of experience and knowledge, and we deeply engage in understanding what they do, and when our values intersect with the values of our customers, then it makes it a lot easier, because we work as a team with our clients, we provide them a high level of service and wanting to make them better, we strive for excellence, and then most importantly, we build trust. - I remember we were taking on those huge projects in the mid-'90s that were $40 million-projects, and in the early 2000s, we were taking on huge projects that were $75- and $80 million-projects. - Our sales bill is $540 million. - And now it's three- and four hundred-, and close to billion-dollar projects. - Today, we have good people doing good work with good practices, and with good practices, you can execute a lot more growth. I think that's the most important thing that we've done is created structure and practices, business practices, that allow us to control risk, control safety, and execute the work more efficiently than we did. (rhythmic music) (projector whirring) (rhythmic music) (slides clicking) - In the HR world, we call it organizational health, and I would say we're extremely healthy, and so I think when people look at our organization internally and externally, when they evaluate, you know, the health of the organization, I would say they would say we're extremely healthy, we're extremely robust, and we have all those things that we need to continue to do to drive this organization forward. I think this team, the power of our team, the power of our people in this organization, the bright people we have here, it's limitless, we can be whatever we wanna be. - What has stayed constant here is the teamwork, the culture at Haskell, that everybody truly works together as a team, that we enjoy working together, we enjoy what we do, and we enjoy delivering good outcomes to our clients. That excitement, that teamwork, really hasn't changed. If anything, it's gotten stronger. - The most valuable asset we have in this whole industry, though every person in Haskell is important, our craft professionals are the ones that are in the biggest exposure and risk every single day. Putting 'em in the best protection, making sure they can return to their families every night, the same way, making sure that they can enjoy a quality of life that we all get to share every day, that is what's at the essence of what Haskell's safety values are all about. - Having our values of team excellence, service, and trust as our foundation of everything we do every day, always looking through the lens of our values and every act that we do every day will not change. Our purpose, really building purpose in our business of creating things that matter, need change, and having the ultimate goal of making sure everybody says, &quot;Hey, this is the best job I ever had,&quot; that won't change, either. And I really enjoy spending a good part of my time thinking about what the future of this company could be and what is in the best interest of 2,500 team members and all of their families. The Haskell company's given me personally, and my family, nothing but tremendous opportunity, and all the leaders along the way that I worked with and/or worked for, fostered that ability to empower team members to grow, to get better, to be able to advance in this organization. (gentle rhythmic music) - Once you came to Haskell, you found a home. You know, Haskell supported you and they had your back. If you needed something, they would always take care of you. If you made a mistake, they'd pat you on the back, give you a pep talk, and put you right back in the game. That, to me, is the family side of the Haskell company. - For 35 years, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, this has been my livelihood, this building, this job, is never far from my mind and trying to be proactive in making things run the way they're supposed to for everyone, everyone that come to this building, and everybody that works in this building, you know, that's a huge responsibility. I'm no different from anybody else that's been here over the 60 years. I stand on the shoulders, on the back, of all of those before me. There's people that's in this company here, that's around the world, that bear that Haskell company mark. - The Haskell culture, in my mind, is hire enthusiastic and bright people, and turn 'em loose. That's the culture. - I'm proud to be a Haskell team member 'cause this is where I found my start, and this is where I found my Haskell family, and this is where my passion for architecture is developed every day. I come to Haskell to be the best version of myself, and I appreciate every opportunity I have been given while I have been employed here. - This is just the tip of the iceberg, 'cause in 5 to 10 years from now, Haskell continuing on this trajectory of evaluating solutions, technologies, enabling innovation, enabling the employees to look at things in a fresh perspective and trying different things, and failing, and learning, is going to open so many doors, and it's going to really take us leaps ahead of the competition. (gentle music) - Jim O'Leary's gonna take this company and the team that he has, he's gonna take this company to new heights, I guarantee it. The Haskell story is still writing itself. It's getting better every day. Not a day will go by where I won't be cheering for Haskell's next great success. Can't wait to see what lies ahead. - The sky's the limit for Haskell. I mean, we could do anything in the market that our customer wants us to do. - I have spent 6 years working with the Haskell team and the leadership, and I couldn't be more excited to see what the next 10-plus years will provide to this company. (dramatic music) - You know, we use the term built to last, and that's what we've worked so many long years to get to. (dramatic music) All the things that we're doing for our customers across the world, integrating design in construction, being innovative and driving technology, having a diverse workforce, continually growing and achieving greater heights, it's never been in a better position to continue to succeed, and grow, and prosper. The opportunities ahead of us as a company are just phenomenal. In the next 10 years, the Haskell company will be more significant in our industry, we'll be a clear leader, a disruptor, it'll be creative, it'll be innovative, and it'll serve our customers greater than we do today. - Haskell, in the next 10 to 20 years, I think that's gonna be very exciting. I think we're gonna continue to see evolution, we're gonna see the company getting stronger with our service offering, we're gonna see more offices, more team members, we're gonna grow as an organization, and I think we're gonna continue to distinguish ourself from the rest of the contractors, we're gonna separate ourselves from the pack even further as we've been doing, you know, for the last, gosh, since 1965.

With haunting detail, he recounted treating pregnant women &quot;whose pelvises had been obliterated and their foetuses cut in two,&quot; and revealed that 83% of American medics in Gaza reported seeing children shot in the head or chest. &quot;This is not system failure - it has been systematically dismantled through violations of international law,&quot; he emphasised, condemning the man-made famine now killing more civilians than bombs. His testimony peaked with the March 18 mass casualty event at Nasser Hospital, where 221 trauma patients arrived in one morning - 90 dead on arrival, nearly half children - an onslaught no besieged health system could withstand. &quot;Parents memorise their children's clothing to identify remains,&quot; he said, exposing the war's psychological toll: nearly half of Gaza's children are now suicidal, asking, &quot;Why didn't I die with my family?&quot; Dr. Sidhwa implored the Council to enforce seven measures, including an arms embargo, calling their inaction &quot;a testament to collapsed conscience&quot; as Gaza's last doctors and a generation of Palestinians face annihilation. &quot;You cannot claim ignorance,&quot; he concluded, &quot;when children no longer want to live.&quot;&#10;&#10;Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe&#10;Follow us on X:   / ajenglish  &#10;Find us on Facebook:   / aljazeera  &#10;Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/&#10;Check out our Instagram page:   / aljazeeraenglish  &#10;Download AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile&#10;&#10;#UnitedNations #UnitedNationsSecurityCouncil #UNSC #Palestine #Gaza #GazaHumanitarianCrisis #Israel #GazaWar #IsraelGazaWar #GazaHospitals #GazaHumanitarianCrisis #GazaStarvation" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="i now give the floor to Dr Feroh Shidua Please Thank you Mr President Members of the council my name is Dr Fose Sidwa I am an American trauma and critical care surgeon based in Stockton California I come before you today to speak about the Gaza Strip where I have volunteered twice since October 7th first at European Hospital from March 25th to April 8th of last year and most recently at Nasser Medical Complex from March 6th to April 1st of 2025 Both are in the city of Kununas I'm not here as a policy maker or a politician I am a physician bearing witness to the deliberate destruction of a health care system the targeting of my own colleagues and the eraser of a people The constitution of the World Health Organization states that the health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security and is dependent on the fullest cooperation of individuals and states I have taken this to heart and it is the reason I volunteer in conflict zones from Haiti to Ukraine to Gaza In Gaza I operated in hospitals without sterility electricity or anesthetics Surgeries took place on crowded and filthy floors Children died not because their injuries were unservivable but because we lacked blood antibiotics and the most basic supplies that are readily available in any large hospital anywhere else in the world I did not see or treat a single combatant during my five weeks in Gaza My patients were six-year-olds with shrapnels in their heart and bullets in their brains and pregnant women whose pelvises had been obliterated and their fetuses cut in two while still in the womb Mothers sheltering in the hospital cooked bread on hot plates in the emergency department during mass casualty events as we dealt with the reign of fire and death falling around us everywhere Mr President the foundations of life in Gaza family health and community have been shattered The medical system has not failed It has been systematically dismantled through a sustained military campaign that has willfully violated international humanitarian law Civilians are now dying not just from the constant air strikes but from acute malnutrition sepsis exposure and despair Between my two visits to Gaza I witnessed a sharp decline in patients health driven not just by injury but by worsening hunger and malnutrition that left their bodies weaker their wounds slower to heal and their survival far less certain And let's not forget this is a man-made catastrophe It is entirely preventable Participating in it or not allowing it to happen is a choice This is a deliberate denial of conditions necessary for life food shelter water and medicine Preventing genocide means refusing to normalize these atrocities It means refusing to dehumanize the Palestinians to refuse to see them as calories counted or numbers of trucks moved We see now that this way of thinking has brought about a human dignity crisis with an entire people on the edge of survival On March 18th the ceasefire was violated by Israel That day I witnessed the most extreme mass casualty event of my career at Nasser Medical Complex 221 trauma patients arrived in one morning 90 were dead on arrival Nearly half were severely injured children No health system on Earth could cope with this least of all one that is besieged and starved of supplies Hospitals are meant to be sanctuaries Healthcare workers and first responders are supposed to be protected Children are supposed to be protected In Gaza these protections are simply gone Every day the distinction between combatant and civilian is erased Most of my patients were pre-teen children their bodies shattered by explosives and torn by flying metal Many died Those who lived often awoke to find their entire families gone Last year I published in the New York Times a survey of 65 American healthcare workers who had served in Gaza 83% of them reported seeing children shot in the head or the chest I personally treated 13 such cases in my two weeks at European Hospital According to the Warchild Alliance nearly half of Gaza's children are suicidal They ask &quot;Why didn't I die with my sister my mother my father not out of extremism but out of unbearable grief I wonder if any member of this council has ever met a 5-year-old child who no longer wants to live let alone imagined a society in which so many young children feel this way And what astonishes me is not that some children in Gaza have lost the will to live but that any still cling to hope My Palestinian friends mostly healthcare workers no longer speak of resilience or even survival Parents memorize their children's clothing in case they must identify their remains later They pray for one piece of bread to give them before they sleep so that their children might die less hungry if they are killed at night And meanwhile my Israeli and American friends express horror at what is being done in their names Many of us cannot understand how our governments continue to arm this senseless destruction But you in this chamber have the power to stop it Mr President I am here because I have witnessed what is happening in Gaza with my own eyes especially to children and I cannot pretend not to have seen it You too cannot claim ignorance I urge the council and especially my own government to act with urgency on these enforcable measures One demand an immediate and permanent ceasefire including a halt to all arms transfers to all parties to the conflict alongside targeted and lawful sanctions on Israel Two demand the reopening of all of Gaza's crossings and guarantee unrestricted medical evacuations including to hospitals in the West Bank and East Jerusalem where Palestinian patients can be treated by Palestinian doctors with safe return to Gaza assured Three guarantee sustained humanitarian access throughout Gaza allowing all essential supplies shelter food water fuel and medical supplies to reach all people in need Four strongly and explicitly reject the weaponization and politicization of aid embodied by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation whose executive director a veteran of the US Marine Corps publicly resigned on Sunday citing the foundation's lack of adherence to humanitarian principles We must affirm support for existing UN mechanisms back UNRWA and ensure NOS's with expertise in reaching and providing specialized care to those in need have unimpeded full access Five the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages Six the immediate and unconditional release of all healthare workers including Dr Husam Abu Sufi now held in Israeli detention for more than 150 days And seven without delay uphold the UN charter and act now to prevent genocide One day Gaza survivors may have a record of the empty promises made by the members of this council as their wounds deepened and their lives were lost If this council remains silent and fails to act now that record will stand as a testament to a global failure to provide urgent care and to the collapse of our collective conscience I'm pleading with you to do what you were entrusted to do to protect international peace and security and to prevent irreversible harm The steps I mentioned are the very least that is needed I'm asking my own government's representative to hear the voices of the majority of Americans who are calling for the same If this continues there will be no Palestinian doctors left no one to care for the sick and wounded There will be no Palestinians left to rebuild the health care system We are losing a generation before our eyes condemning people to die of hunger disease and despair Deaths that could be easily prevented Thank you I thank Dr Shida for his briefing Make sure to

          <attvalue for="7" value="Microchips run everything and the  best microchips are made by TSMC.  The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.  TSMC chips have put Western tech companies, and   militaries, streets ahead of China, and China  is not happy about it. TSMC is so important,   the world could go to war over it. I'm Matt Bevin and this is If You're Listening. TSMC's story starts in 1958  in, where else but, Dallas Texas. [Music]27 year old Morris Chang was  at work a microchip Factory belonging to Texas   Instruments. it's a company that made AM radios and  calculators and gear for the US oil industry, hence   Texas, and Morris had a problem. See the  factory was supposed to make microchips   to go in their products and it wasn't. See  microchips are incredibly difficult to make.   The process of manufacturing a microchip is so  complex and intricate it's hard to believe it  was ever developed. At the factory Morris was working in almost none of the chips they were   making were working correctly. Morris Chang was  a Harvard educated engineer. He fled from China   as a teen. He had worked hard to get where  he was and now it was time to prove himself.   He started fiddling with the factory settings  for how they made microchips - turned down the   temperature here, increased the pressure there,  combining these chemicals with those ones.   Within weeks the Factory's yield was  up to 20 percent and then 30 percent.   His bosses noticed how successful he'd been  and started promoting him. Texas Instruments   paid for him to get his PhD. They gave  him bigger and bigger responsibilities.   He was apparently a pretty tough boss. He had a short temper and getting screamed at by him became a bit of a   rite of passage at Texas Instruments. He was also famous for  the fact he was almost constantly smoking a pipe.   On top of electrical engineering he's one of  the world's best players of the card game Bridge.   Morris is just one of those guys who seems to  be really good at anything he puts his mind to.   Ten years later Texas Instruments was  doing so well they were looking to set   up more factories in other countries, so Morris  Chang and a colleague went on a tour of Asia. His colleague's name was Mark Shepard. The son  of a Dallas cop, he looks like an AI generated   generic Texas businessman. They made a stop in  the Taiwanese capital.   [DOCUMENTARY] Taipei the capital is a modern city with many Western habits including the mini skirt and a fear and hatred of communism.   Neither Morris nor Mark had ever been to Taiwan  before. Mark Sheppard made that abundantly clear by   throwing a tantrum in a Taipei restaurant after  he was served a steak with soy sauce instead   of barbecue sauce. Didn't they know he was from  Texas? Later, Mark and Morris met with Katie Lee - sorry,   Mark and Morris met with K T Lee, a minister from  the Taiwanese military dictatorship government,   and the meeting didn't go well at all. Minister Lee  accused the Texan of being an American imperialist,   which you know he was, but you don't just say that.  They all left in a big huff, but Morris managed to   convince both men it was in their best interests  to make a deal. For Texas Instruments, Taiwan was a   great place to get some cheap workers, and for  Taiwan building microchips for America might   provide protection against communist China. The  United States tends to try and defend places they trade with. [DOCUMENTARY] The move now in Taiwan's industry  is up market into higher technology.    Foreign investment and foreign technology are welcome. [MATT] And so the first microchip Factory in Taiwan was built.   Morris resumed his work back in Texas and  it was here that he gradually developed   an idea that would change the course of  his life and the future of the world. You see, just like Texas Instruments, all the  tech companies around at the time were expending   enormous amounts of time and effort figuring  out how to run good in-house microchip factories.   Morris Chang thought that was silly.  Microchips are probably the hardest   thing in the world to manufacture. They require  unbelievably complicated and expensive machines   running in the cleanest environment on Earth.  You see a microchip is a circuit board like   the green ones you've seen in pretty much  everything electrical, except    [DOCUMENTARY] ... the electronic circuits simply cannot be seen by the naked eye. [MATT] Back here on my shelf I've got an old 1950s ... hang on ... I've got an old 1950s microphone  amplifier. if I open it up you can see   it has about 60 transistors, little electronic  switches welded by hand onto a circuit board about   the size of a block of chocolate. If you were to  make a microchip of the type that's in your phone   or laptop in the same way you'd need a circuit  board about the size of an International Airport.   That's how incredible today's modern chips  are. The secret to how special they are is   that we can make them very, very small. To make  a microchip you need to use a laser to print   billions of transistors and connections onto a  thing the size of a thumbnail. [DOCUMENTARY] The circuits are a series of elaborate patterns etched into the surface of the silicon, layer by layer.   [MATT] You see? Super hard to make. Morris thought  all the tech companies should focus on   designing the microchips and outsource the actual  manufacture to a company that specializes in it.   It's like if everyone in town was trying  to learn how to do their own dentistry,   instead of just outsourcing it to an expert dentist. The results would be quite [PERSON SQUEALING] unpleasant. Morris suggested this to Texas Instruments over and over but they never budged.    Morris rage quit. [CARTOON RANTING] In the early 80s, years on from their first meeting in Taipei, the Taiwanese Economy Minister K T Lee gave Morris Chang another call. While Mark Sheppard may have put Morris out to pasture K T Lee saw him as the future. He made  Morris an offer. K T Lee was offering   him a blank check to build a company that would  make Taiwan the microchip capital of the world.   Make Taiwan the dentist, the place that all the  tech companies go to get their chips made. The Taiwanese government put in half the money. They  bullied wealthy Taiwanese businessmen to chip in too.   The plan wasn't to design a perfect microchip.  They were going to design the perfect microchip  factory. [PROMOTIONAL VIDEO] TSMC pioneered the dedicated semiconductor foundry business model. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was born with Morris Chang at its head. 40 years on from when it was founded, TSMCis making the smallest chips in the world and the labs they're made in are incredibly high tech.   Earlier this year the ABC's East Asia  correspondent Bill Birtles struggled   a bit with all the protocols for getting into a  Taiwanese microchip lab. [BILL BIRTLES] So you sort of step into it ... like a onesie. It's quite a process just  getting into one of these labs. [EXASPERATED SIGH] [LAUGHTER] [MATT] He put on a hat, gloves, special shoes and  got into an airlock where jets of air blew   off any particles that may have got stuck  on his clothing. The worry wasn't that he   would catch something from inside and bring it  out, the worry was he would bring something in.   [DOCUMENTARY] it looks more like a hospital than a factory  because a single speck of dust can ruin a chip. They are in fact cleaner than a surgical theatre.  Even the machines are specially made so that   they don't shed particles. Having dust specs in a  microchip factory is like having rhinos running   around in a car factory. These transistors  and connections are barely wider than atoms   and in the chip world, smaller means not only  that they take up less space but also it makes   them more energy efficient and more powerful and  TSMC can make these tiny chips more quickly than   anyone else. It's the most valuable company in  Asia and last year was the eighth-most valuable   company in the world. It's responsible for five percent of Taiwan's GDP and seven percent of its electricity consumption. [NEWS STORY] TSMC pumps out close to 60 percent of the semiconductor chips used around   the world and makes 90 of the most advanced ones. [MATT] it's kind of an extraordinary situation. You've got a resource that's needed for basically everything in the modern world all coming from one place, [NEWS STORY] ... making it the most valuable and  indispensable chip company in the world. TSMC is so essential to the global economy that Taiwanese  media calls it the &quot;sacred mountain&quot; protecting the   island from Invasion by communist China. But is it  actually protecting them or is it a giant target?   Let me tell you a little story. Centuries ago  a cluster of 11 small islands in Indonesia was   the world's only source of the spice nutmeg. Nutmeg  could be used not only for flavour but to preserve   meat and Europeans thought that it could also cure  diseases. it was worth more than its weight in gold.   That was fine for a while, but eventually the Dutch  decided that instead of buying it from Silk Road   Traders they would invade the islands, kill almost  everyone there and take the nutmeg for themselves.   Now imagine you were relying on the  Silk Road Traders. What happens if your   precious nutmeg falls into the wrong  hands? Taiwan? They've got the nutmeg, and China wants it. And tension is increasing between mainland China and Taiwan. Beijing has conducted massive military exercises close to the  island, raising fears that Chinese President Xi Jinping will fulfil his promise to take control  of Taiwan either with an invasion, or with blockade. To try and get around that the U.S, Germany and  Japan have convinced TSMC to start construction   on factories in their countries to ensure  the supply of chips to the U.S and its allies.   Just last year Donald Trump's former National  Security Adviser Robert O'Brien appeared at an   event for the Council on Foreign Relations. ROBERT O'BRIEN] I think the TSMC situation is a little provocative for China right now and doesn't provide security. In fact it counter-intuitively lessens the security of Taiwan. [MATT] He's saying that China does not like that Taiwan has such a precious resource and that it's provoking China to attack. O'Brien then said that Winston Churchill decided to sink the French Fleet rather than allow the Germans to capture it during World War II. So if China invaded Taiwan he suggested that the U.S should follow Churchill's example to stop Xi Jinping taking control of the TSMC factories. [O'BRIEN] Can we allow the you know  the equivalent of the Germans taking   the French Fleet, uh Churchill didn't allow  that. Could we allow that? [MATT[ Robert O'Brien's statement made headlines in Taiwan. He tried to clarify it saying that he didn't think that the   U.S should promise to blow up TSMC if China tried  to invade, but clearly some in America are afraid.   The ramifications of letting China take over that  company could be massive. They would control one of   the world's most valuable resources. America's fear  is that they could stop selling us the chips if   they liked or sell them at such high prices that it  makes non-Chinese companies unprofitable. After all,   it's happened before. That's what the Dutch did  with the nutmeg once they seized those islands.   In 2022 the world's most successful investor,  92 year old Warren Buffett, bought more than   four billion dollars in TSMC shares and then  in 2023 he sold them all at a loss. He said he   didn't like the company's location. He said the  risk of confrontation with China was too great.   Morris Chang is not afraid of a Chinese  invasion. He is now also 92. He retired   as CEO of the company he built in 2018, but still  appears at public events. He can't smoke his pipe   anymore, but he still plays Bridge, something  else he has in common with Warren Buffett.   The two men talk a lot about how much the  game has in common with business,   but as for TSMC it remains to be seen which  of the two has made the right bid [Music]   G'day Matt here. Just here to let you know that if  you want to listen to or watch more episodes of If   You're Listening you can do that right now on the  ABC Listen app. There's a lot of them, and there's   More? OK." />

          <attvalue for="7" value=" ... -Pour ce nouveau numéro, direction New York aux Nations unies. L'ONU et sa célèbre salle d'Assemblée générale. Sol vert et tribune en marbre vert. 193 États, théoriquement sur un pied d'égalité, avec le principe &quot;un État une voix&quot;. La communauté internationale mise en pratique avec la SDN puis l'ONU. Sauf qu'au fil du temps, certains dirigeants délaissent l'institution, ne venant même plus en septembre pour l'ouverture de la session annuelle. Comme si l'ONU n'avait plus la capacité de créer des consensus quand le droit international est bafoué, comme en Ukraine. La faute sans doute à un manque de réformes, notamment au Conseil de sécurité avec le principe du veto. Tandis que le monde se fragmente en plusieurs blocs. L'ONU est-elle à bout de souffle ? Sortons nos cartes. L'Organisation des Nations unies, 193 États membres, siège à New York. Son secrétaire général, le Portugais Antonio Guterres, a ses bureaux au 38e étage du célèbre bâtiment construit par Niemeyer et Le Corbusier. L'ONU succède à la SDN, première organisation de sécurité collective créée en 1919 par le traité de Versailles. Suite aux conférences de Moscou, Téhéran et Yalta, l'ONU est fondée le 26 juin 1945 à San Francisco par les vainqueurs de la guerre, États-Unis, URSS, Chine, France, Royaume-Uni, et 46 autres États, pour empêcher une nouvelle guerre mondiale. Suite à la décolonisation et la fin du bloc de l'Est en 1989, le nombre d'États membres a quadruplé, jusqu'à 193 États aujourd'hui. Sa charte définit 5 organes principaux. L'Assemblée générale, lieu des débats entre États, de l'Afghanistan au Zimbabwe, élit le secrétaire général pour 5 ans, 9 depuis 1946, qui gère et représente l'organisation. Le Conseil de sécurité est chargé du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationale. Y siègent 15 États, 10 non permanents, élus pour 2 ans par l'Assemblée générale, et 5 permanents : États-Unis, Russie, France, Royaume-Uni et Chine, les principales puissances nucléaires. Ces cinq-là doivent s'entendre pour rendre le Conseil efficace, chacun ayant un droit de veto. S'il est uni, le Conseil peut agir vite, ses résolutions s'imposant à tous les États. Enfin, deux institutions moins connues. La Cour internationale de justice de La Haye règle les différends entre États. Et le Conseil économique et social, 54 membres. S'y ajoute tout un système onusien : une trentaine d'agences et d'organisations apparentées pour gérer divers problèmes. FAO pour l'agriculture, à Rome. AIEA pour le nucléaire, à Vienne. UNESCO pour les sciences et la culture, à Paris. PNUE pour l'environnement, à Nairobi. FMI pour l'économie, à Washington. Ou le UNHCR pour les réfugiés, à Genève. Et l'OMS, qui fut leader dans la lutte contre le Covid. En tout, l'ONU compte 38 000 employés pour son secrétariat général, et 112 000 sur le terrain. Budget total de l'ONU : 50 milliards de dollars, dont 3 pour le secrétariat, et 6,5 pour les opérations de maintien de la paix, l'équivalent du budget de Paris. Les contributions dépendent du PIB des États. États-Unis premiers, puis Chine, Japon, Allemagne, Royaume-Uni, France. Depuis l'an 2000, l'ONU s'occupe beaucoup de développement, via les 17 objectifs du développement durable, et des droits de l'homme, via son Conseil et son Haut-Commissariat. Mais le maintien de la paix reste central. Le Conseil de sécurité peut tenter des médiations, imposer des sanctions, 31 depuis 1966, ou envoyer ses Casques bleus. Créés en 1956, ces soldats sont chargés de maintenir ou de consolider la paix. Parmi leurs échecs passés : Somalie, Rwanda et Bosnie. Et leurs succès, moins connus : Namibie, Cambodge, Salvador, ou encore Timor oriental. En 13 ans, 8 000 Casques bleus ont pacifié cet État d'Asie du Sud, après 24 ans d'occupation par l'Indonésie. Avec un objectif bien défini et des moyens suffisants, 2 missions de paix sur 3 ont rempli leur mandat. Regardons les 12 opérations actuelles. 90 000 Casques bleus répartis au Soudan du Sud, à Chypre, au Sahara occidental. Les pays du Sud fournissent la majorité des Casques bleus : Bangladesh, Népal, Inde, Rwanda. La mission la plus importante, la Minusma au Mali, jusqu'à 17 500 hommes, fermera ses bases fin 2023. La junte militaire malienne lui a retiré son consentement, et le Conseil de sécurité a voté sa fin. Pour pouvoir agir, l'ONU dépend de la bonne volonté de ses membres. Or, depuis dix ans, Occident, Russie et Chine se divisent, notamment lors des guerres, au Yémen, en Syrie, et en Ukraine. Une désunion qui bloque l'ONU. Voici le nombre de veto utilisés au Conseil de sécurité de 1946 à 2023. L'URSS puis la Russie en ont utilisé 148. Les États-Unis, 86. Le Royaume-Uni, 30. La Chine, 19. La France, 18. Lors de la guerre des Six Jours, du Koweït ou en Libye, les grands ont su s'entendre. Mais pendant la guerre froide et après, même les démocraties ont eu recours au veto pour défendre leurs intérêts. Ainsi, le veto britannique lors de l'attaque des Malouines par l'Argentine en 1982, ou les veto de la France au sujet de l'Algérie ou des Comores. Mais Paris et Londres n'ont plus utilisé leur veto depuis 1989, et la France demande depuis 2013 l'interdiction du veto en cas d'atrocités de masse. Les ambassadeurs soviétiques puis russes ont été surnommés les &quot;monsieur niet&quot;, à cause de leurs veto au sujet du bloc de l'Est, puis des conflits syrien et ukrainien. La Chine met souvent son veto au sujet du Tibet et de Taïwan. Et les États-Unis, au sujet du Vietnam ou d'Israël. Mais après le 11-Septembre, en février 2003, le gouvernement de George Bush est accusé de déroger à la règle. Soutenu par le Royaume-Uni et une quarantaine d'États, il se passe de l'autorisation de l'ONU pour intervenir contre l'Irak du dictateur Saddam Hussein. Les États-Unis, pourtant principal pays financier de l'ONU, n'ont jamais adhéré à la Cour pénale internationale. Sans oublier la tentation isolationniste trumpiste, avec la sortie de l'accord de Paris sur le climat, annulée ensuite par l'administration Biden. Mais depuis 2011, c'est la Russie de Poutine qui bloque l'ONU. Depuis la révolution en Syrie, elle n'a soutenu que 3 résolutions, utilisant 15 fois son veto, pour empêcher les sanctions contre Bachar el-Assad, des enquêtes sur l'utilisation d'armes chimiques, ou le maintien de l'aide humanitaire aux civils. En Ukraine, la Russie, toujours plus autoritaire, a empêché dès 2014 la désescalade en Crimée et dans le Donbass. Quant à l'invasion de février 2022, c'est une violation claire de la charte de l'ONU. À noter que depuis 2011, Moscou et Pékin ont mis 11 fois ensemble leur veto. La Chine a profité du désengagement américain des années Trump. Depuis 2019, elle est le 2e contributeur financier de l'ONU, après les États-Unis, et première en nombre de Casques bleus fournis. Elle a été élue à la tête de 4 organisations onusiennes qui réglementent des réseaux mondiaux. L'Union des télécommunications, la FAO, et les organisations pour le développement industriel et l'aviation civile. Elle prône ainsi sa vision des relations internationales, où les États n'interfèrent pas dans les affaires internes. Alors, faut-il réformer le Conseil de sécurité imaginé en 1945 ? La France et le Royaume-Uni ont deux sièges permanents, mais l'Afrique et l'Amérique latine, aucun. Et quid de l'Inde, du Brésil, de l'Allemagne, du Japon ? Or, la Chine ne veut pas d'un siège pour ses rivaux indien et japonais. Et les États africains sont divisés, entre le Nigeria, l'Afrique du Sud et l'Égypte. Aussi, depuis 30 ans, aucune réforme n'a abouti. Les grandes nations renforcent leurs organisations régionales. OTAN et UE pour l'Occident. UA pour l'Afrique. Organisation du traité de sécurité pour Moscou. Organisation de coopération de Shanghai pour la Chine. Mais l'ONU reste indispensable pour traiter ensemble les défis de demain : changement climatique, désinformation, pandémie, intelligence artificielle, sans oublier la faim et les réfugiés. L'ONU serait-elle devenue une simple agence supranationale traitant les problèmes mondiaux sans éviter les conflits ? C'est parler trop vite et oublier les 2 millions d'individus de 125 pays qui depuis 75 ans servent comme Casques bleus. Oublier que l'ONU est là pour rappeler que le droit international s'impose à tous. Néanmoins, l'ONU attend une réforme d'envergure. Déjà, le Liechtenstein a réussi à faire adopter une résolution : les membres permanents du Conseil de sécurité doivent justifier leur veto devant l'Assemblée générale.

          <attvalue for="7" value="It’s a symbol of Germany’s economic might. The chemicals factory of BASF in the city of   Ludwigshafen. BASF helped spread Germany’s industrial power around the world.  Now, it's axing 2600 jobs here. All the while,  it’s opening a new 10-billion-dollar factory... in  China. Germany has long been known as Europe’s   economic powerhouse. But this year, it’s the world’s worst performing leading economy.  German economic growth is down, its factories  are less productive, and hope for its future  success is waning. As Germany’s economic outlook shifts from   grand to gloomy, the model behind its rise is thrown into doubt.  Why should you change a winning team? The  success of really the last 20 years probably  has made a couple of people, you know, a bit  blind, a bit insensitive to how the global  economy has changed. If left untreated, Germany’s economic   pain risks spreading to an entire region. It's really the European Union where most   of the trade for Germany takes place. Exporting and importing at the same time. So if Germany's   economy is not doing that well, that is also experienced by the other countries.  In this episode, we will analyze the rise and  potential fall of Europe’s biggest economy.  The situation overall is not great. The  German economy is shrinking, and companies are  telling us, yes, they expect a  certain stabilization, but overall,   most companies arerem pessimistic.  We will look under the hood  of Germany’s economic success.  What is the German recipe for success so  far? That was to produce technologically  advanced products that are in  high demand all over the world.  We will assess the gravity of its problems. We can’t be naïve. We are experiencing a cyclical   downturn, but we also have structural problems that we are working on.  And we will ask ‘Is Germany’s  economic success model doomed?’  That’s all coming up on Business Beyond. To understand Germany’s problems today,   we have to dissect what made the country so successful in the first place.  During the 1990s, Germany’s  economy was struggling.  Reunification merged a successful capitalist  economy with a low-income socialist planned  economy. Absorbing the East meant West  Germany had to dish out big social security  payments. The consequences strained  Germany’s budget and its job market.  20 years ago, early 2000, the late 1990s, sick  man of Europe, we had actually only one big  problem in Germany and there was or maybe  two, and it was the aftermath of the  reunification and we had surging unemployment  To turn the country’s economic woes around,  the center left government of Gerhard  Schröder introduced reforms that greased  the wheels of the job market: they cut  employment benefits and created  more temporary and low paying jobs.  The first thing is it really led to labor  market reforms that lowered wages or made people  more willing to accept jobs at wages that  they would have otherwise not considered.  More people working in lower wage jobs  meant labor became cheaper. So German  companies were able to manufacture and sell  goods at a better price. At the same time,  other parts of the world  started buying more stuff.  When you look back over the last 20 years.  We had China joining the global economy. We  had also Eastern European economies  joining the European Union. We had many  emerging economies clearly catching up with  the developed world. So all these factors  together were creating a huge  demand for manufacturing goods.  Roadmarking machinery, custom made tunnel  drills, printing machines for stage designs and  specialized endoscopy devices. Made in Germany was synonymous with   precision and quality. The country went from laggard to leader. It inspired literature. And   flashy economic papers. It even won the world cup.  What is the German recipe for success so far?  That was to produce technologically advanced  products that are in high  demand all over the world.  It’s fastest growing buyer? China. The country’s emergence as a market economy   in the 2000s played into the hands of German engineers. German   exports to the country surged. That was a completely new market   and it was a huge market and it was really very profitable to go there and sell our products.  Thanks to Beijing’s boom, Germany became  the world’s third biggest exporter.  But, since then, the sunny  outlook has become cloudy.  As long as things go fine, it’s like: Okay,  big party. But at the moment, the world economy  hits a bit of a bump in the road. Like now,  the German economy suffers immediately.  The world bank says the global economy is  perilously close to falling into a recession. The  war in Ukraine and the continuing effects  of the pandemic mean it has significantly  downgraded its expectations for this year. Germany’s economic model made it extremely   dependent on appetite for German products around the world. And, right now,   that appetite is waning. Particularly in one of its most important markets.  After peaking in 2020, the share of Germany's  exports to China has been on a steady  decline. Remember BASF,   the German chemical giant? They  recorded a 76% profit loss in the  second quarter of 2023. The main reason?  Lagging demand from China. And BASF is no  outlier. So if something goes wrong in China,   it immediately means the demand for, say, German cars is falling. But the demand for German   engineering machine tools, you know, Siemens type big engineering projects is falling as well.  On the one hand, Germany is a giant exporter  of consumer goods. So products that are  ready to use like cars and medicine. On the other hand, the German economy also   depends on selling capital goods, so products that are used to produce other things.  And so the Germans export fewer consumer  goods to China, fewer capital goods to China,  and fewer capital goods to countries that  export consumer goods to China. So, it's  basically once you have a tailspin in  Germany, it hits three times where in other  economies it would just be the exports in  the narrower sense, the consumer goods that  would be hit. The global demand driving Germany’s success   is dampening. But that’s not the only problem.  Remember the energy crisis in Europe? It  really turned Germany’s industry on its head.  Let’s go back to the BASF plant in Ludwigshafen. On any given day,   the plant uses more power than Switzerland. Factories like these make Germany’s industry much   more energy intensive than that of its neighbors.  That wasn’t much of a problem when Russia  provided cheap gas to the country. But, with  the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Germany’s  era of affordable energy ended. And so did  momentum for G erman manufacturing. During the second quarter of 2022, sky-high   natural gas prices jolted BASF’s energy bill up by more than 700 million Euros.  So at the moment we are paying the price  of a delayed energy transition. We were too  heavily dependent, especially on Russian  gas. And this is why now we see fossil energy  inflation. And with this also a stagnation  of the German economy at the moment  BASF was forced to shut down its most  energy-intensive production lines.  Some 700 jobs will be affected. All the while,  its expansion plans for China remain intact.  Up until about a year ago, I think people would  incorrectly say that businesses care about  two things only when they decide on where  to locate, and that is taxes and wages. And  then since the year ago, they would  say it's taxes and wages and energy.  Germany has now made it out of last year’s  energy crisis. And prices have been falling. But  in some areas, lasting economic  damage might have been done.  So, yes, energy prices have come down again  since the surge last year. And in the first  week after the start of the war in Ukraine. But  energy prices are still higher than pre pandemic.   Plus, the future of energy supply and  the future of energy prices is highly  uncertain. And this explains why. You know,  and I guess, you know, it's understandable  why businesses, corporates are also looking  elsewhere to see, okay, is there another  region that might offer more stability, more  clarity, more energy security than Germany  currently can? Rising energy prices and falling orders   have hurt Germany’s gas-guzzling industry. It's producing less of the things that made it rich.  And that’s making a country known for its  efficiency lose momentum. Right now, Germans  work fewer hours, so are less productive,  than employees in other industrial nations.  We are in the process of deindustrialisation  because production is falling and I don't see it  easily coming back. If demand OUTSIDE Germany is falling – economic   engines INSIDE the economy become more important. Like how much people buy.   But here’s the issue: They aren’t buying enough.  The problem in Germany has been that private  consumption has systematically been to  too low. Relatively low wages helped jumpstart   Germany’s export machine 20 years ago. Now, they are making matters worse.  Wages cannot rise much more, wages don't  rise much more. Um, so, so the effect is that  private demand doesn't grow much in  Germany, which means that the German economy  is even more dependent on exports than it  would otherwise have been. So wages have to  be kept under control because it depends on  exports. So domestic demand falls, export,  you know, become even more  important as a proportion.  According to a study by the Knowledge from  Growth Institute, Germans’ wage expectations  this September were the lowest they have been  since the beginning of the survey in 1991.  But its not just low incomes suppressing  consumption. Germans’ wallets are also under  stress from rampant inflation  and high energy prices.  With low demand insi de the country, the export  sector will likely remain Germany’s biggest  economic engine. But, when it comes to the  goods its sells, analysts believe that Germany  has been betting on the same horse for too  long. All the while, the racetrack has changed.  I think we only just have to ask ourselves,  what is it that we're mainly purchasing on a  daily basis. Is it an app or is it really a  good. And I think most people will answer: Well,  indeed it is an app. It is music, it is a movie,  but it is not kind of a tangible manufactured  good. And this is where the German economy   is not that strong. And this is also where the German industry is hit the most.  As Germany’s traditional export industry  declines, the question is what big new thing will  replace it. So far there’s no clear answer. Except for software maker SAP, Germany’s tech   sector is essentially non-existent. And that’s no coincidence.  The German government has been frugal  concerning its future. For the past two decades,  it has invested significantly less into  its economy than its European neighbors.  I think, you know, we've done well. And when  we do well, we just, you know, think that  we have everything we need. Marianne Janik is the CEO of Microsoft in Germany.  Berlin’s prudence is linked to a cultural dislike  for public debt here in Germany. A relic of the  hyperinflation that gripped the  country during the Weimar Republic.  Fiscal policy in Germany is, you know, to put  it mildly, is repressive. Right. I mean, they  you talk about the black zero, the Schwarzer  null, but a zero means nothing in fiscal policy.  It's not good to have a zero because it means  essentially that you're not investing in the  future. Right. It's like you have to think of  your economy as a house that you buy over 30  years or longer, not as a household that  has to meet sort of weekly or monthly budget  constraints. That's not how you do it.  One crucial sector that has been underfunded  is IT. Only a third of all German households  have very high-speed internet connection. And  the country’s workforce is less digitally savvy  than that of many other European countries. We shouldn’t be defeatist, but we also shouldn’t   be naive. We have to change things. We have a big transformation   of our economy ahead of us. That’s Christian Lindner, Germany’s finance   minister. His government recently approved further budget cuts for investments in   digitalization. Germany being the   country where you just think about  efficiency, about cost reduction.  And this also, you know, doesn't help when  you have to evolve. You have to invest, of  course, in those digital infrastructures.  So we've done a little bit too well maybe.  Digitalization is one of Germany’s keys to  more economic growth. But, at the moment, 40%  of Germany’s small and medium-sized  businesses can’t find employees with necessary  digital expertise. For one, the country’s society is ageing, so   there aren’t enough workers to fill vacancies. But it’s also because those who CAN   work don’t have the right training. Because of the crisis, we are seeing growing   interest in training for digital professions. Dalia Das founded an IT bootcamp in Hamburg.   Retraining schools like this one are becoming more common. They offer   to bring employees up to speed. Germany is lagging behind in the digital   realm. If we don’t manage to include all social groups and make them more digitally savvy,   we are going to have problems. To bring its economy on a future-fit path,   Germany now plans to double its funding for AI and create new university labs for research. But   for progress in these highly advanced technologies, Germany will first need   to mend the craters in its digital foundation. There's a lot of research going on in Germany,   the entire IT sector. We are not very good at it so far, but there's   a lot of potential for development Germany’s traditional export market is waning,   and its tech sector is weak. So, experts say it’s important to explore new areas of growth.  We have to see there are huge opportunities  out there in many sectors and how can we  be successful in developing them? I think it's  mostly based on our ability to be innovative,  to research. Innovation begets economic growth.   But it’s not an area Germany performs well in. A 2023 study placed it 10th worldwide. Behind   countries like Singapore, Switzerland and Denmark.  But lack of innovation isn’t coming from a lack  of ideas. Germany registers more patents in  Europe than any other European country. The  issue is turning those ideas into GERMAN  businesses. The first hurdle is made up of paper. Lots of it.  Germany is infamous for its bureaucracy. It takes more than 120 days to start a new   company in Germany, compared to just 40 in Italy or Greece.  And construction permits take more than 50%  longer than the average for industrialized  countries. The second hurdle, also paper.  Let's look at Marvel Fusion for example. The  Munich deep tech start-up wants to produce  zero-carbon energy with atomic fusion. It’s  thriving and expanding massively. It recently  announced the construction of its first lab  worth 150 million dollars – in the United States.  This is Heike Freund, the COO of Marvel Fusion If I compare the European ecosystem to the   US ecosystem, especially when it comes to investments, more than 90% of all the investments   globally have been done in the US and not in Europe,   in the private fusion company space. Giant funding like the one Mar vel   Fusion needed is still hard to come by in Germany. Meaning many ideas get stopped in their tracks.  I believe we have amazing human capital  here. We have great talent here, we have a  great industrial ecosystem here. So, Germany  would have all the pieces here to develop  the next tech champions. But with that missing  funding gap, it's close to impossible to  commercialize those innovations  at the end in Europe.  At the beginning of this video, we asked  whether Germany’s economic success model is  broken. The experts we spoke to painted a  picture of a country whose prosperity is  threatened. Not only by short-term problems  but also by structural issues. *Aside* Even  Germany’s finance minister admits to that.  Subtitles: We shouldn’t be naïve. We are  experiencing a cyclical downturn, but we also  have structural problems that we are  working on. Talent, energy, infrastructure,  digitalization... Ample trade, cheap energy and strong   industry fueled Germany’s boom times. They lulled leaders into a false sense of security. Their   failure to pursue reforms is now coming back to bite.  It doesn’t make sense to keep things as  they are. Everything changes, so we have to  change as well. Now, Germany has to find a new economic   engine. That will entail breaking out of existing patterns.  So in the current situation, it will not be  possible to orchestrate a full overhaul of the  German economy and sticking  to the fiscal debt brake.  Investing in the future. We should be broad. And politicians   don't need to answer this question: “what are the sectors of the future?” But they have to create   conditions that allow for developments in many areas.  Improving energy supply. The current government has now made   a lot of decisions to increase the share of renewables much faster than in the past.   So a lot of barriers have been removed. There are now windmills installed a little bit faster,   but a lot of solar PVS on the roofs. That is increasing at the moment. So this is   going in the right direction. And boosting a dwindling workforce.  Pay them better and they will  come. It’s not a mystery.  At the same time, experts say that Germany’s  success as an export power shouldn’t be  buried completely. But it doesn't mean we have to throw   away our comparative advantage. For instance, in trade, I think the German government at the   moment is doing, in that case the right thing. They are saying, let's try and do new trade   agreements with Latin America, with other countries  So you sort of have a have an interesting  problem is that the slump in Germany will be  more accentuated because of its industrial  structure and its sort of position in the  international division of Labor. But the  inverse happens when the world economy picks up  again because then Germany  is the first one to benefit.  One thing is certain, the cushy years are  coming to an end. What Germany does with that  realization will determine the strength  of its economy in the years to come.  And Germany has been sort of the engine of  of the European economy. So people worry,  people ask. But on the other hand, you know,  I think it's a good thing that that we get a  little bit of attention as well that makes us  also reflect a little bit and get this reflection,  this perspective from the outside so that  we, as you know, German economy, German  companies, German industry start to reflect  a little bit what we want to stand for.  And that’s it from this episode of Business  Beyond. If you want to dive deeper into the German  economy, check out our recent video on German  carmaker’s troubles in the electric vehicle space." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="China is pushing for dominance – using axes and ramming ships. Because it wants to control the South China Sea. The Philippines and Vietnam are threatened most by China’s ambitions. And both struggle to counter them. The rivalry between China and the United States also has a huge influence on this regional conflict. The Philippines is getting closer to the US in the hope this protects it from China. While Vietnam is balancing between the two superpowers. In this episode, we will look at how China is expanding its control in the South China Sea. And how the Philippines and Vietnam are pushing back in such different ways. Let’s start with this: Chinese warships on patrol, as shown by state media. And sailors taking an oath to defend China. What's interesting about that is where they did it: here, one thousand six hundred kilometers from the Chinese mainland. A provocation for others around these waters: the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and Taiwan. Because many of them have competing claims on these waters. Looks confusing, right? Well, it is! Let’s talk about China’s claims because they’re the biggest. And Beijing has the military muscle to make their claims a reality. Vietnam and the Philippines are most affected. For decades, they’ve been slowly pushed aside in the struggle for control of the many islands in this sea. China’s efforts have already paid off here in the Paracel Islands. Beijing took full control in the nineteen seventies, pushing out Vietnam. Now their focus is on the Spratly Islands. China has been moving in here since the nineteen eighties. The Spratlys are basically disputed bits of land, rock or reef. So, it's actually more important what's around them. The South China Sea is a crucial maritime trade route. There are oil and gas reserves below the seabed... ...and rich fishing grounds. An important food and income source for many people living around here. China refers to it as the South Sea, which is the basis for the English name used internationally. But for Vietnam, it’s the East Sea. And the Philippines calls the waters close to its shores the West Philippine Sea. So even the name of these waters is in dispute. In recent years, China has managed to expand its dominance: by occupying these features in the South China Sea. Let’s zoom in on one example: Mischief Reef. It also has different names in the Philippines, China and Vietnam - but we will stick with the international names. Actually, the Philippines have special rights here under international law. That’s because states are entitled to exploit natural resources, like fisheries and oil within 200 nautical miles of their coastline. It's called their Exclusive Economic Zone. But China has its own interpretation. In the mid-nineties, it erected a number of huts here. It claimed they were meant for Chinese fishermen and ignored protests from the Philippines. Later, Beijing added concrete buildings. In 2015, Chinese dredging ships arrived. They took coral from the reef's core, pulverized it and piled it up to create an artificial island. So, Mischief Reef went from this... ...to this. Today it’s a Chinese militarized outpost. There are dozens of hangars for fighter aircraft, an underground fuel storage and a runway long enough for big military planes. China built up more islands in a similar way - four have airfields. Now, their combat aircraft could strike most countries in the region. And how does China justify all that? After World War II, Beijing published this map with dashes surrounding most of the South China Sea, claiming it has historical rights to it. And China still uses a similar version of it today, a nine-dash line, like in this submission to the UN in 2009. And what about the military installations on the islands? Well, China says they are not directed against its neighbors. This is Hu Bo, director of the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative, a think-tank in Beijing close to the Chinese government. The US has no official position on who should control what in this sea. But it says it cares about freedom of navigation here. The US has deployed ships and aircraft in the region—in response to China’s island buildup. And both countries sometimes come dangerously close to each other. So, their rivalry is growing here. And that has consequences for the main US ally in the region: the Philippines. This is the moment a Chinese coast guard member went at the crew of a Filipino naval vessel—with an axe. This sailor says he lost a thumb in the incident. He was headed to a Filipino outpost in the Spratly Islands. To this old navy ship, which might be the world’s most unique military assignment: the Sierra Madre. The Philippines ran it aground at Second Thomas Shoal in 1999 to claim control of the reef. Yes, they did that on purpose. And yes, since then the ship has basically been stuck there getting rustier. They say they did it to keep an eye on the ongoing Chinese construction of Mischief Reef, which is just twenty kilometers away. There are a few Filipino military personnel living on the grounded vessel. The navy delivers food and material to repair the rusting hulk. But China is trying to block the resupply efforts. So, that’s why we have recently seen so many standoffs here. The Philippines is filming the encounters and blaming China publicly. That’s part of their strategy. Experts call it: The transparency initiative or the transparency approach. Calling out China's actions as and when they happen. This is Charmaine Willoughby. She is an associate professor at De La Salle University in Manila. And focuses on maritime security in Southeast Asia. This has so far been rather successful for the Philippines because apart from us, there's practically no other claimant states that calls China's actions out. And Manila’s confidence to confront China stems from two things: First: the Philippines took Beijing to the International Court of Arbitration – and won. I still clearly remember the 12th of July in 2016. Practically everybody in the country was celebrating because we realized that international law is actually behind us. That’s when an international tribunal ruled that there is no legal basis for China’s historical claims in the South China Sea. China rejected that ruling. The second reason for the Philippines’ confidence is their big ally, the US—their former colonial power. After independence, the two countries signed a mutual defense treaty. If the Philippines was attacked, the US should help defend them. Given the growing tensions with China, the Philippines is turning more strongly to the US. The country has given the US access to nine military bases on its soil. They are part of the so-called first island chain—a line of American military bases that the US is using to project power close to China. Check out our episode on Taiwan for more on that. Many Filipinos would agree that this is largely the fight between the United States and China, and the Philippines is just caught in the middle. We've always gotten that from our regional neighbors that we have consistently been warned that, hey, don't be too close to the Americans. One country being cautious about how close it gets to the US is Vietnam. These are the outposts Vietnam controls in the South China Sea. One of them is Barque Canada Reef. This is what it used to look like. And this is it in 2024. Enough space to fit a runway for long-range military aircraft. So, Vietnam is kind of following China’s playbook. Vietnam has been ramping up its outposts a lot recently. The Vietnamese sense that now maybe it's a good time for them to really scale up without attracting a lot of attention from Beijing. Nguyễn Khắc Giang is a Vietnam analyst. He works for a Singapore state-funded think tank. The Yusof Ishak Institute. And he's based in Australia. The focus is now on the Philippines. So, they try to do it as quickly as possible before the Chinese will shift attention to the Vietnamese. In the past, China and Vietnam have repeatedly clashed in the South China Sea. But right now China isn’t publicly pushing back against Vietnam’s island building. Maybe because they’re doing the same thing. And maybe because both countries are governed by a communist party. Vietnam avoids publicly confronting China. They try not to provoke China because they know that they cannot really go head on head to China because of the asymmetry in terms of power. And that restraint isn't only because Beijing has a stronger military. Vietnam has a long land border with China. And China is its largest trade partner. So, Vietnam is vulnerable. That’s why it tries to strike a balance between China and the US. This is Vietnam making sure they are getting the exact same treatment during state visits. Vietnam’s balancing act is called “bamboo diplomacy.” Moving between the line like a bamboo swinging in the wind, but not really leaning on one side or the other. In practice that means: The country accepts security assistance including boats from the US—its former war-time foe. But Vietnam also regularly conducts joint patrols with China, close to their common border. But unlike the Philippines, Vietnam says it would not accept a foreign military presence on its soil. Or be part of a military alliance. Vietnam has been trying to walk a really fine line. It used to be a pawn in the geopolitical struggle between Soviet Union, China and the United States. And it was caught up really badly in the Cold War. And I don't think the Vietnamese leadership wants to really relive that experience anymore. China shows no signs of backing down. The Philippines and Vietnam have different strategies in dealing with Beijing. The future of the US-China rivalry will also shape the South China Sea dispute. And how the countries in the region will navigate these troubled waters." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="this is democracyow democracynow.org the Warren Peace Report i'm Amy Goodman we spend the rest of the hour with award-winning journalist and author Naomi Klene she has a major new piece out co-authored with Astra Taylor for the Guardian newspaper it's headlined the rise of end times fascism it looks at the apocalyptic fervor of the far right in it they write quote the most powerful people in the world are preparing for the end of the world and and they themselves are frenetically accelerating that is not so far away from the more mass market vision of fortress nations that's gripped the far right globally from Italy to Israel Australia to the United States in a time of ceaseless peril openly supremacist movements in these countries are positioning their relatively wealthy states as armed bunkers naomi Klein writes she's also professor of climate justice at the University of British Columbia founding co-director of the UBC Center for Climate Justice her latest book Doppelganger a trip into the mirror world naomi welcome back to Democracy Now it's great to have you with us if you can start off by talking about um your piece and what exactly you mean um uh by talking about um the end times fascism well it's very good to be with you Amy um this isn't the most cheerful piece I've ever written um with Astra Taylor uh a a a very uh close collaborator uh founder of the Debt Collective and we were trying to kind of map what is similar and what is different about the type of far-right politics that we're seeing today uh and I should say the piece is not only grim uh it also looks at what this can mean for a response to this particular form of fascism because we can't fight it if we don't understand it so I think a lot of very good scholarship attempting to understand authoritarianism today whether it's Trump or figures like Duterte or Modi um have looked at similarities between these far-right figures and say Mussolini or Hitler um and and have taken a kind of a checklist approach of looking at what is similar to the past right and I think there's a lot of value in that but the risk of it is that it doesn't uh it doesn't look at what is new and what is particular to our time fascism always is an attempt by the right to resolve a crisis of its own era right so in the 1930s they were attempting to resolve you know in Germany the humiliations of the first world war the impacts of the great depression um and to propose a unity in the face of that you for the inroup but our moment is different and one of the things that makes it different I mean if you think about fascism in the 1930s this is before the atomic bomb it's before they understood climate change and we are in a moment where our elites whether they admit it or not do understand that our economic model and I've written books about this and talked about it with you in the past is at war with life on Earth right um we and they are barreling down this road of more and more extraction of fossil fuels of all kinds of you know basically anything they can extract from this earth and turn into energy and money uh particularly now with AI which is a energy and re resource hog water uh uh LNG um critical minerals all of it uh so so we're trying to understand how this is informing the kind of fascism that we're seeing and also we're trying to understand what unites this kind of strange Frankenstein coalition that Trump represents where he's bringing together these uh you know the richest people in the world who have ever existed with you know many workingclass people so what binds the vision right and what we come up with in this piece or what we propose in this piece is that they all have given up on this world like they all they all have bought into a kind of apocalyptic fever right whether it's Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and their investments in outer space and sort of writing off this planet whether AI which is willing to sacrifice this animate world in order to build an artificial world or whether it's the more populist MAGA vision of the fortress nation state right which is thinking okay um we know more and more people are going to be coming uh we know that disaster is on the horizon and I've listened to a lot of Steve Bannon for for Wright you know when I was writing Doppelganger and it's all very survivalist right it's you know all all the all of the the commercials pretty much are selling you know gold because the economy is going to collapse um you know ready to eat meals for 90 days because you never know what's going to happen so it it it sees the nation and the inroup as being inside the bunker and then it's exiling the outgroup to all of these um lawless territories that you've been covering on the show so it's not the same vision but what it shares is this apocalyptic fever and then of course all of it is following a similar structure like narrative structure to the biblical rapture and of course you have people who believe in that within the Trump uh uh coalition who are you know Christian Zionists like Mike Huckabe and Pete Hegsth who believe that the actual end times is coming and they think it's all going to go down in Israel and uh all of the horror that you that you report on so well and so committedly on the show you know these are all good signs if you believe in the rapture right because it means that the end is coming and the faithful are going to be lifted up to a golden city in the sky so you know what we're looking at is like the the the religious version of that story the the fundamentalist religious religious version of that story where you literally believe you're going to be saved and taken up to heaven or and but also the secular vision where your wealth protects you or your citizenship protects you and you get your own version of that golden bunkered city you mentioned Gaza and you just came from the Jewish Voice for Peace conference in Baltimore um where several thousand people gathered from around the country um our latest headline u the Israeli military calling up tens of thousands of reser as Israel's security cabinet unanimously approved plans this weekend to expand its assault on Gaza where Israel's already killed over 52,000 Palestinians and that's by far um an undercount for in the last 18 19 months israel's killed more than 2400 Palestinians just since it shattered the ceasefire in March um uh this comes as Israel's devastating blockade and food aid has entered its third months palestinian health officials say 57 Palestinians have already starved to death according to UNICEF more than 9,000 children have been admitted for treatment for acute malnutrition so far this year and aid groups like Norwegian Refugee Council blasting a new Israeli proposal to take control and distribution and put US security contractors in charge if you can talk as you so often do about what's happening in Gaza and the West Bank and what um the centrality of Israel in uh President Trump and the current US government although it was also the past president Biden's worldview and approach to foreign policy so I don't think there is a single answer to to understanding what what the driving forces are and this is what we're trying to get at is that there's a kind of an overlap of these different um apocalyptic worldviews some of them are religious and some of them are secular right so I think that people who subscribe to this like literalist version of of the rapture believe that all of this is good news in the sense that according to the story that they believe in that that the Israelites have to return to greater Israel those are the preconditions for the return of the Messiah they have to rebuild the third temple so you have this um convergence of interest between the religious extremists and the Netanyahu government who are absolutely committed to rebuilding the third temple they really want to do it they want to destroy Alexa this is why so much attention is focused on it um but then you know does Trump believe that i don't think Trump believes that i mean what he views for Gaza is he sees resources he sees money he sees a private you know reserve exactly um but you know this is what something I've been saying from from from the beginning i I think the the the interests have been fairly consistent in terms of what the end goal is which is a depopulation of of Gaza pushing Palestinians out whether through death or whether through forced exile whether through through through ethnic cleansing and under the Biden administration there was a denial that that was what was going on and under the Trump administration it's all out in the open so you know this is what is going on now what the what the reason for that is I think differs but this is what part of what we're getting at in the piece Astroni is that there's a confluence of interest in terms of what Israel represents some of the um the the supporters of the Trump administration in the tech industry are talking about wanting freedom cities for instance these these privatized corporate cities um and they talk about this as tech zionism um they they have a lot of admiration for the idea that Israel was created they say you know from a book um the Herzel's books um and they say well why can't we start our own country our own private countries why do we have to you know why do we have to abide by the rules of the nation state um so you know I I think part of the support for Israel isn't just our classic understandings either of Jewish Zionism or Christian Zionism Although that's absolutely going on it's also this idea of a very technologically advanced startup country right um uh you know Israel has marketed itself that way and a lot of these tech companies want to do that in San Francisco you know they want to push everybody out who doesn't agree with them who's poor have more needs um and create their kind of corporate privatized utopia uh so you know I'm not saying this is a coherent agenda um I'm saying that there's a lot of uh overlapping stories that that follow a similar structure and um and and share similar goals if that makes sense i mean yes i mean the overall issue obviously is hard to make sense of and most of Trump's supporters are neither wealthy nor are they Christian Zionists so why are they backing this whole approach well it's not clear the extent to which they actively back it but I think that they see a kinship in the ethnostate right because a lot of Trump supporters are becoming increasingly Christian nationalist about the United States and this has been you know carefully fostered by figures like Steve Bannon um and so when they look at Israel they see a country that is openly an ethnostate that is fortressing itself in a sea of its enemies um you know and they want to do something similar and they're sharing technologies they're sharing um you know legal precedents tools um so there's a you know there's a kinship and it you know and we we're seeing this now with India with its attacks on Kashmir following a you know using similar techniques um uh that you know Israel has used in Gaza so there is a kind of a solidarity of the ethnostates um and they are sharing you know they're even trading trinkets of you know golden pagers and swapping chainsaws you know this is something that we I I I think you know when you're inside um the crucible of it here in the United States under Trump it's hard to see the extent to which this is an international project on the right and they are influencing one another and what does unite them you know this whole fortress mentality is this hatred of immigrants uh you you have President Trump just saying uh he doesn't even know he's not a lawyer so he doesn't know if he has to uphold the Constitution he said right i mean this is what I'm trying to get at um about the awareness that we are in an age of consequences that when you don't act in the face of the climate crisis for decades after when when scientists have been warning you that more and more of the world becomes uninhabitable and lo and behold people move uh to try to find safety in the face of in the face of wars in the face of economic deprivation and in the face of ecological disasters and so that fortressing of the nation state and this is what I think um you know Israel's come to represent just as a very small nation that is extremely fortressed right whether it's with the high-tech walls the iron dome Trump says now I want a not an iron dome but a golden dome right um that that here um that all of this is is whether it's stated explicitly a military parade that'll cost tens of millions of dollars even as he uh slices es and dices the government on his birthday in June so the pattern is protecting the in-group and exiling and cleansing the out groupoups right and so that I think is is is you know if there is support among the MAGA base for Israel it's less out of a love for Israel than more out of an identification like they are doing what we want to do here you write um many things in your piece um and I just want to go to one of them uh you say in talking about um Musk's apocalyptic vision you talk about and also um detailing the end times fascism this whole issue of the rise of the city state the corporate city state I think this is a new concept for many they're not going to know what you're talking about in southern Texas star base just this group of people who are mainly workers at uh uh SpaceX have just voted to make a city right there yeah and we've had sort of I mean the idea of a of of a company town is not entirely new right um and Disney had Celebration Florida and you know that there are lineages to to this right um colonial line lineages to this you know I I I live in Canada which started as the Hudson's Bay Company right so it was it was a company before it was a country so there there is some precedent for this but I think what this is I've been following this out of the corner of my eye Amy because this is where the libertarians have been going for a while um there was an Peter Teal has been obsessed with this idea it's increasingly being called exit so exiting the nation and just starting your own country where you can set your own tax level you can set you can make your own regulations or not or not and countries and and and these little corporate countries will compete with one another to try to attract capital right so in a way it's an extension of the free trade zone right where it's and this is this is a a in a way like a denationalized country within a country but Trump started to float this in 2023 the idea that he would create 10 freedom cities uh on the campaign trail I don't think his base much knew what he was talking about but now you have all these lobbyists who fully intend to take him up on it and we're starting to see the beginning of this with the SpaceX city so you also write um about El Salvador's terrorism confinement center the notorious prison secut where so many hundreds of people um have been sent from the United States and at the same time in the last 24 hours President Trump saying he wants to reopen the notorious Alcatraz an island in San Francisco if you can talk about the prison as a model for what Trump wants to put forward and particularly in relation as we see motivating so much um to immigrants well this is an incredibly bleak vision so repression is always a huge part of any kind of fascist project right you need to contain the out group you need to disappear the out group so this part of it is not new but I think what is so worrying to me is that Trump was elected promising all kinds of things to his base right he was he promised to eliminate inflation he promised to bring these great jobs home he's not delivering on any of that so the sadistic part of his project is really all he has to offer right i think one of the most chilling things I've ever seen in the United States was Trump sharing that video at his 100 day rally of just pure sadism of just looking at prisoners as entertainment being shaved being shackled being paraded and he's not delivering on the price of eggs and he's not delivering on the jobs by the way because he's he's throwing all in he's going all in on AI so the jobs that are coming back are seem to be mainly for robots um it's not actually for his for his base and so this scales up the need for the sadism and and these spectacles right and and I think that that's what something like Alcatraz represents he he's he's a TV producer first and foremost right he's producing spectacles and the less he the less he has to offer economically tangibly materially the more he leans on the sadism uh you write the governing ideology of the far right has become a monstrous supremacist survivalism our task is to build a movement strong enough to stop them what would that movement look like or what do you see it's is being formed right now you know what we're doing in this piece by laying out the bleakness of the vision and when I say bleakness you know I think it's beyond something we've seen before because there's always an apocalyptic quality to fascism but fascism of the 1930s and 40s had a horizon like after the apocalypse people were being promised a future a pastoral peaceful little piece of land um where they could live out their lives you know even though Trump talks about a golden age there really isn't a future that that the base believes in you know and this is what I've learned by by consuming far too much MAGA media amy um they envision a future of endless war right this is why they're bunkering down this is why they're buying ready to eat meals to last this is why they're buying gold and crypto they think the whole thing is going down so and why Elon Musk is trying to have so many children at least 14 at this point but he's actually explicitly texted it saying &quot;We've got to do this much faster as he proposed to one of the women he has children with uh saying uh we got to start using surrogates.&quot; So they don't believe in the future is the bottom line um and that is you know I I think I've been in a lot of progressive spaces in recent months where we've talked about building these very broad coalitions including with people who we don't entirely disagree with i've never encountered uh a potential coalition more broad than the idea of how about if we believe in this world how about if we believe in the future because we're up against people who are actively betting against the future right not just actively betting against it but fueling the fires that are burning this world actively fueling it so I think that if we have the courage really to look at the bleakness of what they of what they believe in um which is an apocalyptic future then we have our work cut out for us of being the people who actually believe in this realm in this world in the beauty of creation and in of each other naomi Klein I want to thank you for being with us

          <attvalue for="7" value="JEFFREY GOLDBERG: The end of President  Trump's friendship with Elon Musk was   never really a question of if, but  when. And now we know the answer,   except maybe we don't. For all we know,  they could be back together before summer. Meanwhile, in the real world, Russia's  war against Ukraine grows more dire,   Iran gets closer to nuclear breakout,  Israel slides further towards prices,   and at home, the rule of  law is in real danger, next. Good evening and welcome to Washington Week. I  want everyone to know that I take the Trump-Musk   breakup drama seriously in part because Donald  Trump gave his former best friend Elon Musk access   to enormous amounts of secret government data, and  there's no predicting what Musk could do with it. The world at large is in a state  of seemingly permanent tumult,   and so it's a good time for a general  checkup. My guest tonight is Thomas Friedman,   a three-time Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and  foreign affairs columnist for the New York Times. Tom, thanks for coming in for our seemingly annual  checkup. I want to ask you about this Elon Musk   business and maybe we can put it into some  serious context. Before we jump to that, I want   to read something that my colleague, Charlie  Warzel, writing in The Atlantic this morning   had to say. The sun rises every morning. Spring  turns to summer. Water is wet. Donald Trump and   Elon Musk relationship has ended with  a post about Jeffrey Epstein. And then,   of course, you know, he tweeted,  these guys really do escalate quickly.   Trump -- Musk tweeted time to drop the really  big bomb real Donald Trump is in the Epstein   files. That is the real reason. They have  not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT. So, put this into some kind of context that makes  sense for ordinary people. What is going on here? THOMAS FRIEDMAN, Foreign Affairs Columnist,  The New York Times: Well, I confess, Jeff,   on the way over, I thought you'd asked  me about this and the first thing that   popped into my mind was the Iran-Iraq war.  What did we say about the Iran-Iraq war?   If only both sides could lose, okay?  So, there's no hero in this story. What it really is is the latest manifestation  to me of the central truth of the Trump 2   administration. Trump 1 was surrounded by buffers.  Trump 2 is surrounded by amplifiers. And therefore   stuff that used to begin at the Mar-a-Lago  bar and then get muffled in the Oval Office   now goes from the Mar-a-Lago bar, right to the  Oval Office, right to you and me. And whether   it's what he feels about, you know, Musk or  his role, he wants him in the government. But to me, the whole Musk phenomenon is  part of a much deeper and more disturbing   phenomena from an American citizen point  of view, which is nothing here is modeled,   nothing here is stress tested. Everything  is a riff. The country is being run like   the Trump organization today, not  like the United States of America. And so as a result of that, Jeff, there's  no second order thinking, all right? What's   second order thinking? I'm going to put on  tariffs, okay, 10 percent across the board,   including Canada and Mexico, even though  I'm violating an agreement I signed with   them when I was president last time. Second order  thinking is, oh my God, you mean the Ford F-150,   only one third of its parts are made in America?  And the other two thirds now are going to be   tariffed? I will bet any amount of money no one  told him that. And that's true now everything. And so, you know, for the first trimester of this  administration, you think the first three months,   all of this was kind of entertaining, but now he's  running up against a wall. It turns out he can't   solve the Russia-Ukraine war overnight. It turns  out tariff wars aren't easy to win. It turns out,   you know, Musk is not going to, you know,  do the revolution in the government for him. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: It turns out courts  sometimes don't like what you do. THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Exactly.  And so I think the second,   you know, three months are going to  get very interesting as he runs into   this reality. And I don't know where it's  going to go, but it leaves me disquiet. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: That's interesting. I  was thinking -- as you were saying this,   I was thinking about John Kelly, General  John Kelly being -- and along with General   Mattis and others being those buffers or  filters, there's literally no one in the   White House or in the whole system who does  anything but amplify? Is that fair to say? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Yes. I mean, I just don't -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: The treasury secretary? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: I just don't see it, you know?  I mean, yes, you hear these stories that the   treasury secretary had to wait, you know, for one  of the other, you know, economic guys that Peter   Navarro to be out of the room for him to come in  to try to change the tariff. This is crazy stuff. Now, I happen to be in China twice in the last  six months. I've watched a lot of this from China   actually. And when you see it from China, I mean,  they say a couple things. One is, you know, we are   never going to put our president in a situation  like Zelenskyy in the Oval Office where he can   be embarrassed, number one. The second thing they  say, Jeff, is that this isn't cute. We just saw   Donald Trump tear up a trade agreement that Donald  Trump made with America's two closest neighbors   and allies, Canada and Mexico. What is the value  there for of a trade agreement with him now? And, you know, the Chinese, these are -- like them  or hate them, these are serious people, you know? JEFFREY GOLDBERG: And they are not spontaneous. THOMAS FRIEDMAN: No, exactly. So, when Trump put  the 147 -- 45 present tariff on them, they said,   are you talking to me? Are you talking to me?  Do you realize that we control 90 percent of   the rare earths that make the magnets that go  in every car you make? Do you realize that?   Which he didn't. Which is why Ford and G.M.  and Stellantis had to announced this week   we may actually have to curb some production  because we're running out of Chinese magnets. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. Stay with this Musk  question for a minute and this issue of Musk   as a radical isotope in a kind of way. He's  been given access to government secrets across   the board in order to cut government  agencies through the DOGE operation. That seems like an operational security nightmare  if he goes rogue. Surprising to you? I mean,   where does this relationship go? Can  they bring it back from the brink? Is   there anybody who's trying to bring it back  from the brink, or is this just more chaos? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Well, you know,  I think the best way to understand   this is not with the analogy of political  science but World Wrestling Federation. THOMAS FRIEDMAN: And those in world Wrestling  Federation, there are breakups and comeback   and new teams and whatnot. I put this all  in the area of entertainment, you know,   not in something serious. We're dealing  with two extremely unstable characters. But what really is more important is, what's  the wider world audience saying? What's the   wider world audience saying? They're saying,  you know, for all of our lifetime, Jeff,   sort of post-war America, if I had an extra  dollar and I'm a foreigner, I'm going to put   it in America. If I have an extra, you know,  brain power and a brainy person, I'm going to   study in America. And if I have a little extra  dollar for trust, I'm going to trust America. Now, you take all three of those  things away and you end up with   a very different relationship  between America and the world. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Okay. So, I have to ask  you. And, by the way, it's interesting,   right? Miami is Miami because it's a safe place  for people's Money. Harvard is or was Harvard,   because people want to come from around  the world and so on. And United Nations   is headquartered in New York, you know, I  mean, everybody -- for a reason. We were   the -- we wrote the rules of the road  for the post-war international order. So, the question is, you're an ally or an  adversary, and you're looking at this clown show,   by the way, on the weekend that marks the 81st  anniversary of D-Day, noting, just for the record.   You put yourselves in the shoes of an ally and  adversary. Are you thinking that this is a midlife   crisis America's having, a nervous breakdown,  or is this some kind of weird terminal illness? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: You know, I don't know, which  all I know is I'm completely disoriented if   I'm an ally. And I'm completely  disoriented if I'm the foreign   affairs columnist for The New York Times,  because I've never covered this world. And, you know, our friend, you know, Fareed  Zakaria wrote a book 15 years ago or so called   The Post-American World. And Fareed's book  was really about a change in relative power,   you know, between that there'll be the  rise of Brazil and Indian other countries,   so we won't have as much power as we had before.  Well, really, if I were writing a book today,   Jeff, would be called the  Post-America World, okay? That's what I'm really worried about,  because America stood for some things.   It stood for universal values. It stood for  stability. It stood for the rule of law. It   was a loyal ally. We were always against the  dictator versus the people seeking freedom.   What really worries me that at the  end of my, you know, career basically,   I'm dealing with the post-America world, the  America I grew up and loved and was devoted to. And as someone who lived abroad, like you have,  know how important that America is to the whole   world. American optimism and stability makes the  world go round. You take us out of the equation,   it's not like anybody else comes in. I'm sorry.  You have a no superpower world, you know? JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. But come back to this.  Is this -- do you think that this instability   that we're experiencing, emotional, political,  all the instabilities that we're experiencing,   could it be temporary or is this -- can  we not come back reputationally to start? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Well, the thing  I'm worried about most is that,   and it may seem like a simple thing, but you  know, Donald Trump came in and he told all   the Democrats on the board of the Kennedy  Center, you're gone. Now, traditionally,   every president sort of left the other party's  people there, and then he put in his people. So, when you enter into a kind of  zero sum politics now in America,   when you fire the head of the NASA after you  appointed him because he made a donation,   a tiny donation to a Democrat, you're into a  kind of politics that I grew up with in the   Middle East. What was that? Rule or die.  Okay, you're either in power or you're -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Zero sum. THOMAS FRIEDMAN: It's zero sum, okay? JEFFREY GOLDBERG: I'm on top or I'm in -- THOMAS FRIEDMAN: And so there's a  book about African dictators called,   It's Our Turn to Eat, you know? And  we're just going to eat everything. So then now, if you're a Democrat and  guess what we do have -- God willing,   if we still have elections, rotations in power,  do they come in now treat all the Republicans   in these traditional bipartisan forum, you  know, the same way? And if that happens,   we're really off to the races, then the  whole thing just starts to disappear. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: What country does  that remind you of that tradition? THOMAS: FRIEDMAN: You know, I mean so  many dictatorship just in general that   I've covered over the years. That's what you  come in, you wipe out all the other guy's,   people. Well, that's not how  we do things in this country. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. Well, let's talk about  a country that's not democratic for a second.   You know, the -- I want you to watch this. It's  the latest analysis by President Trump of the   current state of play in Russia's war against  Ukraine, and he's talking about Putin here. DONALD TRUMP, U.S. President: He  got hit, he's been doing hitting,   so I understand it. But he got hit hard.  And I don't think he's playing games. I said, President, maybe you're going to  have to keep fighting and suffering a lot   because both sides are suffering before  you pull them apart, before they're able   to be pulled apart. But it's a pretty known  analogy. You have two kids, they fight, fight,   fight. Sometimes you let them fight for a little  while. You see it in hockey, you see it in sports. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Not Henry Kissinger,  but he's trying to impose his own   real politic understanding. What is he  misunderstanding, from your perspective? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Jeff, do you know how flat  out crazy that is? I mean, it's like saying,   well, you know, I mean, Hitler and Poland, they  fight, they fight, they come back. You know what   I mean? Trump came in and said, I can end this  war, all right? There's one way to end this war,   you say of Vladimir Putin, if you don't stop  the war and we agreed to the ceasefire terms   I dictate, we are bringing Ukraine into NATO  in 30 days. Which part of that sentence don't   you understand? Do you want to mess with  me? Test me. That's how you end this war. What you just heard of Donald Trump,  that sounded like a commentator on Fox   T.V. He's not that commentator. He's  president of the United States. Well,   he hit him and he hit them and he hit -- this  guy invaded a country. He's basically tried to   rape a country. That's what Putin did, okay?  And the Ukrainians, with incredible bravery,   stood up and defended basically the western  alliance on something that's very important.   Because if Ukraine were able to join the European  Union, Jeff, then you have a Europe that's really   whole and free. That's actually a big deal for  Europe and for us. And this guy's talking about   it like it's some schoolyard fight and they're  morally equal. It's nuts and it's disgusting. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. Is there any issue  from a foreign affairs columnist perspective,   is there any issue in which Trump is not  transactional? Have you ever seen a sign of   what we would think of as, in a  bipartisan way, American idealism? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Out of Trump? JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Yes. THOMAS FRIEDMAN: None comes to mind. What I would  say, and where I thought you might be going is   you know, some things are also true even if  Donald Trump believes them. And, by the way,   his transactionalism sometimes can also be an  advantage. For instance, I'm glad he's sitting   down with the Iranians. Let's see what you  got. I'm glad he told the Syrian president,   I'm going to give you a reputation to  live up to. I didn't mind him talking   directly to Hamas if I can get the hostages out. So, there is that transactional side of him that I  think could be an advantage, but it's not grounded   in any moral, you know, framework of what we stand  for as a country and what we've always stood for   if it's just, a kind of free floating  thing. It becomes very, very dangerous. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Yes. In his non-sophisticated  analysis of the current state of play   in Russia and Ukraine, he didn't really  talk about the drone attack that Ukraine   launched on Russian aerial assets deep in  inside Russia. Does that change this war? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: You know, Jeff, I say two things,  and, again, it's part of the craziness of this   moment. Let's start at 30,000 feet and then  come down to the battlefield. At 30,000 feet,   you and I are having this discussion on the eve  of the greatest technological revolution in human   history. We are very close to birthing a new  species, not a new machine, a new artificially   intelligent species. And it's going to be with  us some time while Trump is president. It is   not going to change one thing. It's going to  change everything. We are not talking about   that at all. So, that's, I would say, number  one, under that technological revolution. And,   you know, one of the things they say about A.I.,  it'll actually be mankind's last invention.   Because once we invent that, it will invent  everything else. That's going to be a big deal. Under that, though, we're seeing a revolution  in military affairs. Basically, Ukraine   spent $20,000 to knock out, you know, $20 million  planes. $20,000, that was probably because they   couldn't get Costco online, you know, from  Kyiv and they had to buy them from Amazon,   you know? So, the asymmetric warfare world  that we're entering now, wow, I mean,   if you're the U.S. Navy and you're sitting with  12 aircraft carriers and you just recovered from   the fact that the Houthis, you know, you lost  an F.A. Hornet because you had to swerve your   aircraft carrier and the plane fell off the  back because you were getting out of way of -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Not a sterling  moment , in naval history. THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Right, which is  you're avoiding a Houthi missile,   a bunch of guys in flip-flops, basically,  in a country that's based -- water starved,   the asymmetry we're going to be dealing with  right now. I think these events are really   disturbing and they're going to require a huge  revolution in how we think about military affairs. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: You know, as I'm listening  to you about A.I., AGI and drone warfare,   I'm just thinking that the preoccupation this  weekend in America is the emotionally febrile   relationship between this ketamine-taking  billionaire and our reality T.V. star   president. And it's like there's something  that's so deeply unserious about our -- THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Well, yes. And I  think it's been true of our country   that basically everything became politics. And  so we don't have just ESPN now. We have PSPN,   you know, sort of politics sports network. THOMAS FRIEDMAN: And it's a testament to  the underlying strength of our country,   Jeff, that our economy goes on, we still  invent amazing stuff and we think we can   afford this. And you know what, Jeff,  we can't afford it until we can't. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. Let me  pivot finally toward the Middle East   and ask you this. And, you know, I've read your  recent columns on this subject. You're a severe   critic of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime  minister, and the way he's conducted this war -- THOMAS FRIEDMAN: And of Hamas, which is -- JEFFREY GOLDBERG: No, and I want to get there. But  what I don't understand from reading you is this,   so Hamas and its allies seek the annihilation of  Israel. They state that. It's not a secret. How   does Israel end the war without totally defeating  Hamas? In other words, is it -- I understand the   criticisms, but how do they coexist with  a neighbor who won't allow coexistence? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: They don't. I'm all for  Israel completely defeating Hamas militarily.   What I am not for are the three alternative  choices that Israel had after that defeat   that Netanyahu refuses to make. One  choice is we defeat them and we, Israel,   the Jewish state, occupy Gaza forever. That  will be the moral and economic end of Israel. Another choice is we just leave and we turn it  into Mogadishu. That will also be terrible for   Israel. The third choice, the one I favor, is you  create an Arab international peacekeeping force in   partnership with the Palestinian Authority, and  over time, you build an alternative to Hamas. I am -- well, my criticism of Netanyahu is not  fighting Hamas, not even crushing Hamas. It's   not creating any alternative Palestinian structure  and therefore leaving the Jewish people with the   choice, Jeff, of permanently occupying Gaza or  having Mogadishu there. And permanently occupying   Gaza, you know what that's going to do? That's  going to create a world where your grandchildren   and mine are going to grow up in a world where  they will learn what it is to be Jewish in a   world where the Jewish state is a pariah. And  that is a disaster and that's what I'm fighting. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: There is a double standard  obviously in the world when it comes to judging   Israel's behavior. But I guess you're just  saying that you have to live with that -- THOMAS FRIEDMAN: that's the world as it is, yes. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: That's the world as it is. You  quoted Ehud Olmert, the former Prime minister of   Israel, a center right prime minister, saying  that Israel is committing war crimes and this   is why he needs the war to stop. Do you  agree that Israel is committing war crimes? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: You know, I have not  entered into that whole linguistic   fight because my position has been for the  very beginning. I'm here to do one thing,   figure out how to end this thing. You know,  I'm old, Jeff, 71. I covered the Hama massacre,   Sabra and Shatila, the American embassy  bombing. I've covered all of them, okay? And I said to myself, I'm not going to be the  scorekeeper of this. I'm focused on one thing,   not who shot, who did the worst thing to  the because. They all do terrible things   at different times. I would've figure out how to   end it. And that's where I put all my  energy from the very, very beginning. And my -- if you've read my stuff on  Hamas, it's the same thing. What is   Hamas' position today? Very simple, we want a  ceasefire and we want Israel out of Gaza. Oh,   really? What did you have on October 6th before  this war started? That's what you had. So,   you fought this whole war. You allowed 40,000,  50,000 people to be killed to get you back to   where you started? Shame on you. But I can't,  you know, control them. I can't figure them   out. All I know I am -- I do believe that if  we want to see a Jewish and democratic Israel,   that's what I do care about. Palestinians have to  figure that out. You've got to find a way to get   out of Gaza in a way that will create a, also in  partnership with a different Palestinian party. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Let me ask you one last  question because you're an expert on this   for many decades, several decades. Many  sounds too dire. What does Netanyahu not   understand about American politics  and about American Jewish politics? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Well, I think Netanyahu is  shocked by what's going on here. Because Trump,   Netanyahu always could go around any  American president and now he can't,   because he's looking for the Republican base.  He's pulling that lever and it comes off. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Kind of looks  like a little bit of a sucker,   thinking that Joe Biden was bad for Israel. THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Yes, exactly. You know,  it turns out there are other worse things. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. And what about --  what doesn't he understand about American Jews? THOMAS FRIEDMAN: You know, I think what he  doesn't understand about American Jews is that,   you know, they're ready to be with him.  They wanted Israel that's successful,   democratic. And if you -- they are really  important to Israel standing in America,   and you abandoned them for evangelical  Christians, you'll regret that one day. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right. Well, it's  enormously complicated, as is Russia,   Ukraine, as is everything. And thank you  for coming on and not talking about Elon   Musk only because I'm a little  already -- I'm a little tired. THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Iran-Iraqi war. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Iran-Iraqi war. THOMAS FRIEDMAN: Sit down on a night (INAUDIBLE). JEFFREY GOLDBERG: We're going to have  to leave it there. But I want to thank   Tom for joining me and thank  you at home for watching us. For more on the Trump-Musk fallout, sorry,   be sure to check out Charlie Warzel's  latest article at theatlantic.com. I'm Jeffrey Goldberg. Goodnight from Washington. (BREAK) END" />

Amy Goodman with Juan Gonzalez we turn now to the Empire of AI that's the name of a new book by the journalist Karen How who's closely reported on the rise of the artificial intelligence industry with a focus on Sam Alman's Open AI the company behind Chat GPT karen How compares the actions of the AI industry to those of colonial powers in the past she writes quote &quot;The empires of AI are not engaged in the same overt violence and brutality that marked this history but they too seize and extract precious resources to feed their vision of artificial intelligence the work of artisan writers the data of countless individuals posting about their experiences and observations online the land energy and water required to house and run massive data centers and supercomputers.&quot; She writes &quot;Karen House book comes at a time when Republican Congress members are trying to block states from regulating AI the House recently passed Trump's so-called big beautiful budget bill that contains a provision that would prohibit any state level regulations of AI for the next decade.&quot; In a major gift to the AI industry Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green has criticized the provision even though she voted for the bill she wrote online quote &quot;Full transparency i did not know about this section i'm adamantly opposed to this and it's a violation of state rights and I would have voted no if I had known this was in there.&quot; She says she won't vote for it if it remains in there after the Senate votes to talk about this and much more we're joined by the journalist Karen How whose new book again is just out Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares and Sam Alman's Open AI former reporter at the Wall Street Journal and MIT Technology Review she leads the Pulitzer Cent's AI Spotlight Series program for J training journalists on how to cover AI you should train everyone on how to understand AI karen it's an amazing book why don't you start by talking about the title what exactly you mean for a lay audience for I suspect a lot of our audience are lites um so you really have to explain what artificial intelligence artificial general intelligence is so AI is a collection of many different technologies but most people were introduced to it through chatbt and what I argue in the book and what the title refers to empire of AI it's actually a critique of the specific trajectory of AI development that led us to chatbt and has continued since chatbt and that is specifically Silicon Valley's scale at all costs approach to AI development ai models in modern day they are trained on data they need computers to train them on that data but what Silicon Valley did and what OpenAI did in the last few years is they started blowing up the amount of data and the the size of the computers that need to do this training so we are talking about the full English language internet being fed into these models books scientific articles all of the intellectual property that is being created and also massive supercomputers that run tens of thousands even hundreds of thousands of computer chips that are the size of dozens maybe hundreds of football fields and use practically the entire energy demands of cities now so this is an extraordinary um type of AI development that is causing a lot of social labor and environmental harms and that is ultimately why I evoke this analogy to empire and Karen could you talk some more about not only the energy requirements but the water requirements of these huge data centers that are essence in essence the backbone of of this uh widening industry absolutely i'll give you two stats on both the energy and the water when talking about the energy demand McKenzie recently came out with a report that said in the next 5 years based on the current pace of AI computational infrastructure expansion we would need to put as much energy on the global grid as what is consumed by two to six times the energy consumed annually by the state of California and that will mostly be serviced by fossil fuels we're already seeing reporting of uh coal plants with their lives being extended they were supposed to retire but now they cannot to support this data center development we are seeing methane gas turbines unlicensed ones being popped up to uh service these data centers as well from a freshwater perspective these data centers need to be trained on freshwater they cannot be trained on any other type of water because it can corrode the equipment it can lead to bacterial growth and most of the time it actually taps directly into a public drinking water supply because that is the infrastructure that has been laid to deliver this clean fresh water to different businesses to different homes and Bloomberg recently had an analysis where they looked at the expansion of these data centers around the world and twothirds of them are being placed in water scarce areas so they're being placed in communities that do not have access to fresh water so it's not just the total amount of fresh water that we need to be concerned about but actually the distribution of this infrastructure around the world and most people are familiar with chat GPT uh the consumer aspect of AI but what about the military uh aspect of AI where in essence uh we're finding Silicon Valley companies becoming the next generation of defense contractors one of the reasons why OpenAI and many other companies are turning to the defense industry is because they have spent an extraordinary amount of money in developing these technologies they're spending hundreds of billions to train these models and they need to recoup those costs and there are only so many industries and so many places that have that size of a paycheck to pay and so that's why we're seeing a cozying up to the defense industry we're also seeing Silicon Valley use the US government in their empire building ambitions you could argue that the US government is also trying to use Silicon Valley vice versa in their empire building ambitions um but certainly these technologies are not they are not designed to be used in a sensitive military context and so the the aggressive push of these companies to try and get those defense contracts and integrate their technologies more and more to the into the infrastructure of the military is really alarming i wanted to go to the countries you went to or the stories you covered because I mean this is amazing the depth of your reporting from Kenya to Uruguay to Chile um you were talking about the use of water and I also want to ask you about nuclear power uh but in Chile um what is happening there around these data centers and the water they would use and the resistance to that yeah so Chile has an interesting history in that it's been under it was under a dictatorship for a very long time and so during that time most public resources were privatized including water but because of an anomaly there's one community in the greater Santiago metropolitan region that actually still has access to a public freshwater resource that services both that community as well as the rest of the country in emergency situations that is the exact community that Google chose to try to put a data center in and they proposed for their data center to use a thousand times more fresh water than that community used annually and it would be free and it you know I have no idea that is a great question but what the community told me was they weren't even paying taxes for this because they they believed based on reading the documentation that the taxes that Google was paying was in fact to where they had registered their offices their administrative offices not where they were putting down the data center so they were not seeing any benefit from this data center directly to that community and they were seeing no checks placed on the fresh water that this data center would have been allowed to extract and so these activists said &quot;Wait a minute absolutely not we're not going to allow this data center to come in unless they give us a legitimate reason for why it benefits us.&quot; And so they started doing boots on the ground activism pushing back knocking on every single one of their neighbors doors handing out flyers to the community telling them this company is taking our freshwater resources without giving us anything in return and so they escalated so dramatically that it escalated to Google Chile it escalated to Google Mountain View which by the way then sent representatives to Chile that only spoke English but then it eventually escalated to the Chilean government and the Chilean government now has roundts where they ask these community residents and the company representatives and representatives from the government to come together to actually discuss how to make data center development more beneficial to the community the activists say it is the fight is not over just because they've been invited to the table doesn't mean that everything is suddenly better they need to stay vigilant they need to continue scrutinizing these projects but thus far they've been able to block this project for four to five years and have gained that seat at the table and how is it that these uh western companies in essence are exploiting labor in the global south you go into something called data annotation firms what what are those yeah so because AI modern day AI systems are trained on massive amounts of data and they're sc that's scraped from the internet you can't actually pump that data directly into your AI model because there are a lot of things within within that data it's heavily polluted it needs to be cleaned it needs to be annotated so this is where data annotation firms come in these are middleman firms that hire contract labor to provide to these AI companies to do that kind of data preparation and open AI when it was starting to think about commercializing its products and thinking about let's put text generation machines that can spew any kind of text into the hands of millions of users they realized they needed to have some kind of content moderation they needed to develop a filter that would wrap around these models and prevent these models from actually spewing racist hateful and harmful speech to users that would not make a very good commercially viable product and so they contracted these middleman firms in Kenya where the Kenyan workers had to read through reams of the worst text on the internet as well as AI generated text where OpenAI was prompting its own AI models to imagine the worst text on the internet and then telling these Kenyan workers to detail to categorize them in detailed taxonomies of is this sexual content is this violent content how graphic is that violent content in order to teach its filter all the different categories of content it had to block and this is incredibly uncommon form of labor there are lots of other different types of contract labor that they use but these workers they're paid a few bucks an hour if at all and just like the era of social media these content moderators are left very deeply psychologically traumatized and ultimately there is no real philosophy behind why these workers are paid a couple bucks an hour and have their lives destroyed and why AI researchers who also contribute to these models are paid million-doll compensation packages simply because they sit in Silicon Valley in OpenAI's offices that is the logic of Empire and that hearkens back to my title Empire of AI so let's go back to your title Empire of AI the subtitle dreams and nightmares in Sam Alman's Open AI so tell us the story of Sam Alman and what Open AI is all about right through to the deal he just made in the Gulf when President Trump uh Sam Alman and Elon Musk were there alman is very much a product of Silicon Valley his career was first as a founder of a startup and then as the president of Y Combinator which is one of the most famous startup accelerators in Silicon Valley and then the CEO of OpenAI and there's no coincidence that OpenAI ended up introducing the world to the scale at all cost approach to AI development because that is the way that Silicon Valley has operated in the entire time that Altman came up in it and so he is a very strategic person he is incredibly good at telling stories about the future and painting these sweeping visions that investors and employees want to be a part of and so early on at YC he identified that AI would be one of the trends that could take off and he was trying to build a portfolio of different investments and different initiatives to place himself in the center of various different trends depending on which one took off he was investing in quantum computing he was investing in nuclear fusion he was investing in self-driving cars and he was developing a fundamental AI research lab ultimately the AI research lab was the ones that started accelerating really quickly so he makes himself the CEO of that company um and and originally he started it as a nonprofit to try and position it as a counter to forprofit driven incentives in Silicon Valley but within one and a half years opening eyes executives identified that if they wanted to be the lead in this space they had to go for this scale at all cost approach and had to should be in quotes they thought that they had to do this there are actually many other ways to develop AI and to have progress in AI that does not take this approach but once they decided that they realized the bottleneck was capital it just so happens Sam Alman is a once in a generation fundraising talent he created this new structure nesting a for-profit arm within the nonprofit to become this fundraising vehicle for the tens of billions and ultimately hundreds of billions that they needed to pursue the approach that they decided on and that is how we ultimately get to present day OpenAI which is one of the most capitalistic companies in the history of Silicon Valley continuing to raise hundreds of billions and and Altman has joked even trillions to produce a technology that ultimately has a middling economic impact thus far and uh we only have about a minute left but the relationship between Altman and other rivals like like Google or Elon Musk it is accelerating the development of this technology that again I I mentioned has this middling impact we've seen through the history of OpenAI that all of the former executives that have left have created their own rivals so Elon Musk was one of the original co-founders created XAI ilia Sudskyver was the chief scientist created safe super intelligence mirror Morati was the former chief technology officer created thinking machines lab all of them are now competing to try and dominate this technology and try and make it in their own image and finally this um regulation within the so-called big beautiful bill that says AI can't be regulated by states for a decade this is absolutely going to enshrine the impunity of Silicon Valley into law i mean I call this these empires of AI because they are already quickly becoming the apex predator in the ecosystem able to act in their self-interest and that bill if passed would certainly codify that well we're going to do a part two posted online at democracynow.org karen How is author of Empire of AI Dreams and Nightmares and Sam Alman's Open AI tune in tomorrow on Democracy Now when we speak with the

          <attvalue for="7" value="you're watching the legal breakdown Glenn it looks like the Trump administration is signaling defeat with a major move as it relates to an immigration case that's ongoing right now Can you explain what happened in court Brian on the wrongful deportation front it really feels like the dam is breaking because now in rapid succession the Trump administration has facilitated the return of not one but two wrongfully deported men They returned them both to the United States after you know saying in court up and down six different ways it's impossible for us to facilitate the return of somebody who's now in a separate country a sovereign nation We have no authority and no power Well guess what They just did not once but twice The big one is in the Abrego Garcia case which has been in litigation for months in federal court in Maryland before Judge Cenees And the attorneys for the Department of Justice these third rate lawyers repeatedly said &quot;Yeah judge can't be done.&quot; They actually I believe used the word impossible Well now they've done it So I guess it can be done It's not impossible And you know no misstatement no misrepresentation by a DOJ lawyer should ever go unpunished or unressed More to come on that front in the in the near future I believe But then they actually brought back a second wrongfully deported unconstitutionally deported person This time it was a Guatemalan that the Trump administration unlawfully unconstitutionally deported did not honor his constitutional due process rights of notice and opportunity to be heard They just stuck him on a bus and they sent him to where Not Guatemala but Mexico Well guess what A judge had previously ordered that this particular man who is identified in the court papers and in the reporting only by his initials OCG this Guatemalan immigrant may not be deported specifically to Mexico Why Because he fled Mexico where he had been kidnapped and brutally assaulted So a judge entered an order saying the Trump administration may not deport OCG to Mexico which of course is precisely what the Trump administration did So this judge a federal judge up in Massachusetts issued an order saying the Trump administration must quote immediately take every step available to have him returned to the US And lo and behold get ready for it The Trump administration abided by that court order instead of fighting it instead of delaying matters instead of offering explanations and excuses about why we can't possibly facilitate the return of OCG No this man was returned The reason it's such a big deal Brian is because now we know that when the Trump administration goes into court in cases like Abrego Garcia and says &quot;Oh judge we can't possibly facilitate the return of anybody who is in a sovereign uh country It's up to that country to return them not us.&quot; Well it looks like those incessant claims that were being offered in other immigration cases in court were were lies Flatout lies And I hope that this is the beginning of a trend where the Trump administration both begins to comply with court orders and begins to return to the United States the many people they have unlawfully and unconstitutionally deported Glenn why do you presume the Trump administration did opt to comply after so many instances where they were just perfectly content to outright uh refuse any court orders Yeah Brian it's a great question and I'm afraid we don't have a definitive answer but let's tease it out a little bit So this gentleman OCG was a Guatemalan migrant Interestingly he had come to the US illegally previously and had been deported Now after he was deported there is reporting and there are court filings that you know he was brutalized in the country of Mexico The reporting is that he was kidnapped and and I'm quoting the reporting here he was raped So he came back into the United States again illegally He'd been deported once before but once he got here he made his way into court He made his case and the judge said &quot;Yes this man may not be deported to Mexico.&quot; And of course the Trump administration didn't care They violated that order They didn't give him his due process rights and they just sent him to Mexico So now the Trump administration finds itself in a position where they have deported him to a place where he had been brutalized previously And you know maybe they felt like listen this is the kind of case where we can facilitate his return and then you know what the Trump administration is going to do I predict they're going to give him his due process rights And here's what I suspect the courts will do They will say &quot;Look he had been deported previously He came back here and the only thing we ordered is that he may not be deported specifically to the country of Mexico However he may end up being deported to Guatemala which is where he was from.&quot; Part of this court ruling involves not allowing the Trump administration to deport people to third countries not their countries of origin So if we tease it out and I'm kind of looking into the crystal ball here Bri here Brian it may be that the Trump administration believes there there is some upside to bringing him back giving him his due process rights and having a court order that okay he can't go to Mexico but you can deport him to Guatemala Wouldn't the Trump administration maybe feel vindicated feel like that's a win If in fact they could deport this man but you know what It's a win for the Constitution because here is something that gets lost in the mix all the time largely courtesy of Trump's disinformation and propaganda There are people in the United States who can be deported and should be deported However they can only be deported after they have enjoyed their full constitutional rights of notice that the government is going to try to deport them and an opportunity to make their case in court represented by an attorney There are plenty of people who deserve deportation but the United States government the Trump administration has to do it right has to do it lawfully and has to do it constitutionally Glenn you brought this point up in your first answer but how does the Trump administration then go into court and continue to say that we have no ability to to bring back someone who's out of our jurisdiction who's out of of the country and in the hands of a sovereign country like El Salvador for example when they've just done exactly that here Brian that's the perfect question And if only mainstream media legacy media corporate media would focus on that I think the American citizens and the American population would be far better informed Because here is what I would say to Donald Trump I would say um you know what sport it looks like you can facilitate the return of people you unlawfully and unconstitutionally deported So I would put it directly to Donald Trump and his administration Now do Abrego Garcia because you've been lying and saying you can't uh return somebody to the US who happens to be in a sovereign country another country Well you were lying about it You've now exposed yourself as liars Now do Abrego Garcia and the the other 140 Venezuelan immigrants that you unlawfully wrongfully deported to El Salvador Also Glenn it's worth asking in light of new reporting uh for your reaction to the fact that a number of these people were deported despite not having any gang affiliation and yet that was the pretense under which these people were deported in the first place Yeah Brian And that's the subject of a brand new ruling in yet another immigration case a ruling that was entered by Judge Booseberg the chief judge of federal district court in Washington DC In recent days he issued an order saying so many of the people that the Trump administration deported to that prison in El Salvador there was no evidence or flimsy evidence of any gang affiliation And I'll tell you Judge Boseberg used a very pointed word He said &quot;And yet those Venezuelan immigrants were sent to that prison in El Salvador and they were quote entombed.&quot; They were entombmed He didn't use the word detained or jailed or imprisoned They were intombed which conotes for example somebody who is buried in a building collapsed They are intombed So you know Judge Boseberg said &quot;Yeah you're going to give all 140 of them their full constitutional due process rights and you have one week to come back to me and tell me how you will accomplish that.&quot; And so Glenn in light of this new unprecedented move by the Trump administration reimporting somebody who was wrongfully exiled to another country uh what can we expect to see in these subsequent cases in terms of uh what the the immigrants attorneys are going to do I think the playing field has shifted It's now clear that the Trump administration can facilitate the return to the United States of people they unlawfully deported So I think gone is that argument that they've been making to federal judges in multiple immigration cases So what I would hope to see Brian I'm not going to go so far as to say I expect to see it but now that we know Donald Trump's administration can comply with court orders and can facilitate the return of these folks to the US I am hopeful that they will begin doing precisely that and they begin complying with the Constitution which is all that the American people are asking and all that the immigrants that the Trump administration is trying to move against deserve And and finally uh let's finish off with this What are next steps at least as it was as it relates to this case in particular Yeah it's a great question because next steps are now OCG We only have the initials of the wrongfully deported and ultimately returned Guatemalan migrant He will now get to make his case in court about why he shouldn't be deported at all He may lose that argument right or but at least he gets due process which is at the end of the day what this entire argument in all of these different cases is is uh regarding He gets his due process and his attorney may be even more focused on not wanting his client deported where to Mexico where he was viciously victimized previously And think about it I would like to think even the Trump administration any administration doesn't want to be part of the machinery that mindlessly never mind lawlessly deports people to a country where they can be expected to be victimized assaulted or worse Yeah Well we will of course stay on top of this case and the other cases that are that are obviously similar um and deal with wrongly deported migrants wrongly deported immigrants and uh what the implications of this case is on those subsequent cases So for those who are watching right now if you'd like to follow along with this stuff and all legal news please make sure to subscribe The links to both of our channels are right here on this screen I'm Brian Taylor Cohen and I'm Glenn Kersner You're watching the Legal Breakdown" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="240,000 that's the number of temporary foreign workers the Canadian government allowed Canadian employers to bring into the country last year it's the most ever on record and almost double the number that they approved just two years ago but here's another number 1.4 million that's about how many Canadians are without a job and looking right now that's got some economists arguing that this program meant to be an extraord orary measure to be used when a qualified Canadian isn't able to fill a job vacancy that it's evolved into something else entirely it's really moved a long way past its intention as a program in the approval rate it has gone from about 7% to now it is it is about 97% this low wage stream has grown absolutely out of control and the concern is that shift is having very real very serious consequences for the country and on younger Canadians looking for work let me explain Canada's foreign worker program was originally designed to fill positions mostly in agriculture you can think of a local farm that needs seasonal workers to help with its Harvest each year other Industries could use foreign workers too but there was a cap no more than 10% of your Workforce but then um we're short employees reports of businesses struggling to rehire restaurants fast food and Retail in particular were struggling they had open jobs that they couldn't fill to the point where they didn't even have enough people to stay open what they needed they said was to be able to bring people into work from overseas open the floodgates there is just quite simply a tremendous amount of lobbying pressure from businesses in in Canada and so the government you know at a time when there were really you know job vacancies were very high they had hit record levels they responded to that threat by essentially opening up the system so the system as it was capped foreign workers at 10% of a business's Workforce but a couple of years ago the government bumped that up to 20% across the board and all the way up to 30% for more than half a dozen Industries and look what happened this chart from the glob in mail shows how many workers Canadian employers were allowed to bring into the country each year to fill the category of low wage jobs so that's the blue line that you see here entrylevel positions in retail construction manufacturing Transportation but what's behind this big jump that you see over the past two years is the food service industry hiring of foreign workers in that category is up close to 5,000% since 2018 according to Bloomberg in Ontario Tim Horton took on 58 temporary foreign workers in 2019 but last year it was over 700 this has been a big transformative change this is tens of thousands of extra temporary foreign workers particularly at a coffee shops and convenience stores uh you know ice cream places and and that kind of uh [Music] workplace now there are still rules in place to make sure businesses aren't just filling as many positions as possible with cheap labor it is supposed to be a last resort right so for example they have to post the job locally first and make the case that the pay they're offering for the job is fair I mean these are what we call generically Labor Market tests they're essentially just a way for the government to ensure that these are genuine labor market needs that can't be satisfied locally with local labor and I think this is an attempt to sort of protect Canadian uh workers the problem is in practice it doesn't work that well because it's you know very hard to determine whether or not that's the case um whether they there really aren't local sources of Labor supplies and that's a really important point something that's hard to verify with an application so for example if a business says it had no qualified local applicants for a job a bureaucrat looking at their application to hire foreign workers has to determine well what does that mean how do I tell if someone was or wasn't qualified especially when you're posting a job with no formal education or technical requirements it isn't that there's you know these hard rules that must be satisfied it is quite simply a very sort of subjective um you have to document that you have made efforts the experts we spoke to say it's gotten to the point where the requirements are so nebulous and there are so many applications coming in they're just being rub stamped when you the the probability your application is accepted with a 97% success rate there's really not much of a test anymore and if you're thinking well maybe 97% of applications are perfectly legitimate uses of the program well just look at what happens when the government does go back later to audit those companies this is a rolling list of businesses that have received fines over the past few years for breaking the rules and take this audit of d y produce in cobri Ontario just as an example the company was fed $25,000 last month because the job details it wrote on the application didn't match what the job actually was the government handed out more than2 million in fines just like this this past year and here's the thing the government not only opened the floodgates in 2022 it removed the guard rails as well here's what I mean there used to be a rule that applications in the food and Retail sectors would be automatically rejected if the local unemployment rate was 6% or higher so the thinking being that if lots of locals were looking for work there should be no reason to depend on cheap foreign labor but in 2022 the government got rid of that rule and take a look at the city of Toronto's unemployment rate for most of the past 2 years it's been above 6% and by now almost every major Canadian city has reached 6% some even higher than that if the unemployment rate is that high it seems like there are a lot of people who could be filling these these V job [Music] vacancies one of the big concerns for economists right now is the impact all of this is having on young people all these jobs are important jobs but they're also jobs that um especially in the fast food sector this is often PE you know Canadians young Canadians first jobs now again this program is supposed to be a last resort to fill jobs when there aren't any Canadian workers available but let's look again at Toronto there are about 120,000 people between 15 and 24 looking for work that's an increase of 50% in Just 2 years the C says they received 37,000 applications this year the most in IND X's history the competition was a lot because they wouldn't even read my emails would even call back on that question of callbacks the economists we spoke to say some companies actually prefer to hire temporary foreign workers over young Canadians because they're generally more mature they have more life experience and in many cases they're much less likely to complain about low pay or poor working conditions I mean the research I've done shows that you know there's reasons to think that employers will pitch a low wage when they advertise if if the search fails hope that the government gives them um permission to hire a temporary foreign worker there are ways of you know advertising on sites that aren't used as much uh perhaps putting in some exotic type requirements and then saying well yes you know we had uh 37 domestic applicants but none of them met our needs so so we have to uh we have to go overseas so it's it's not difficult if you really have a preference for the foreign candidate over the Canadian candidate to say that the Canadian candidate wasn't somehow suitable and I think that's ultimately what the problem is with these tests and take a look at this between the time these new rules were introduced in 2022 and now the national youth unemployment rate has spiked from around 9% to over 14% And for young immigrants who've landed in Canada in the past 5 years it's even worse around 23% a fiercely competitive job market means young people across Vancouver are struggling to score work there is no question uh that this is negatively impacting uh the employment prospects uh for younger people but there's also another side to this coin because it's also probably true that some young people just aren't applying to these service sector jobs because they don't think the pay is high enough and maybe the pay isn't high enough because employers have access to people who think the pay is just fine we should keep in mind that you know what they're trying to do is bring in temporary foreign workers at the current wage rather than raising their wages and and trying to attract uh more uh domestic labor so even when the program is working as designed it's suppressing wage growth uh for for the folks who are already in Canada think of it this way if I own a food truck in Ontario and I'm posting a job because I need someone to help me flip Burgers I'm going to post it at minimum wage in Ontario that's $16 55 an hour a few days pass and I'm not getting any takers so I say okay maybe I need to make the job a little bit more attractive we're not going to pay minimum wage instead we're going to pay $18 an hour and boom suddenly a lot more people are interested but what happens if I don't have to do that and if instead I can just apply to hire someone temporarily from another country where 1655 an hour suits them just fine before we had temporary foreign worker programs the process would be that you had to pay the competitive wage and the competitive wage is where Supply equals demand the temporary foreign worker program in sense hijacks that process and if wages are stagnating instead of of rising that adds up over time here's just how little wages in this category have grown since 2010 end to end this is an increase of 50 cents maybe a little bit more and this is adjusted for inflation but still now is this solely because of the temporary foreign worker program no but the economists we spoke to say it is very likely contributing if there are jobs in the economy that Canadians won't do maybe we should start asking ourselves why Canadians won't do those jobs maybe we should be asking ourselves well maybe the problem is those jobs just aren't attractive enough and and that needs to change for the most part the businesses that rely on temporary foreign workers see all of this from a very different perspective they say taking away these workers would mean they'd have to bump up prices lay off staff or even shut down altogether Canada like many other countries have has become addicted to temporary foreign workers there they may be some uh firms that could not survive at you know if they have to raise their wage from 17 to 18 or to19 but we have to ask ourselves what do we want more do we want a handful of marginally profitable businesses to survive or do we want to see wages go up for hundreds of thousands of young Canadians in my mind that's an easy tradeoff some economists even go so far as to say this program has taken too much pressure off Canadian businesses because when they know that they can hire a whole bunch of ultra low-wage workers there's much less incentive to make large scale Investments develop new processes or adopt new technologies to become more efficient and we know Canadian businesses are falling behind in all of those areas we have a labor productivity problem in this country the way we increase labor productivity is not by working harder it's by working smarter it's by giving workers the tools the equipment the she Mach Machinery the technology that allows them to produce more every hour that they work that's what we need now there is a broader question worth asking about who else the temporary foreign worker program potentially hurts including temporary foreign workers themselves but the federal government has made some small tweaks to the program over the past few weeks and they've promised there's more to come now it's not clear whether they'll roll back all of the changes they made in 2022 or try to adjust the application process but some of the economists we spoke to said if it were up to them it wouldn't be a question of what to change they'd cut this low-wage stream we've been talking about entirely [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="first they were on we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens 25% on Mexico and Canada then they were off president Trump's tariffs against Canada will now be put on hold then while the first set of tariffs were paused Trump threatens a whole new second set of tariffs and then threatens a third set of tariffs reciprocal tariffs stacked on top but eventually he Loops back to the first original tariffs promising they're definitely coming on the tariffs is there any room left for Canada and Mexico to make a deal before midnight and should we expect those Chinese tariffs the extra 10% to take no room left for Mexico or for Canada no the tariffs uh you know they're all set they go into effect tomorrow and then those tariffs became real until they weren't anymore because they were partially delayed we spoke with the big three auto dealers we are going to give a one-month exemption on any Autos coming through usmca and then a big chunk of what was left of the tariffs was paused again here's how Trump Justified it and I spoke to the president of Mexico wonderful woman today and uh we helped them out with the problem they were having having to do with the tariffs I helped them out with a problem they were having as in the problem he inflicted and then paused and then reinli and then paused are these the actions of a man who knows what he's doing doing maybe not but maybe there are two main schools of thought when it comes to how Donald Trump is managing the world's largest economy either the pandemonium is planned yeah I I think chaos is is a big part of Trump's strategy there's a term that applies to what the Trump Administration is doing weaponized uncertainty or another possibility is Trump just likes the attention just likes the drama I don't think there's a genuine economic strategy behind it let's start with that the argument that Trump has no coherent plan is supported by the fact that he sometimes has no consistent point of view take tariffs for example Canada's a very bad abuser also vast numbers of people to come in and Fentanyl to government legally Trump has Justified tariffs by branding the influx of fenil from Canada and Mexico me a national emergency but is that really the motivation or is it about boosting American manufacturing we don't need trees from Canada we don't need cars from Canada we don't need uh energy from Canada we don't need anything from Canada sometimes it seems to be about the principle subsidizing Canada to the tune of over a hundred billion dollar a year by the tune of about $200 billion a year and other times it seems to be more about power I'd like to see Canada become our 51st state uh he feels strongly that it would be very beneficial for the Canadian people to be the 51st state of the United States they wouldn't pay be paying for these tariffs and what about the occasional lack of a unified message Trump's own team sometimes seems left in the dark like whatever Trump was planning if he was planning any of it was never actually discussed out in the open take what Trump's Commerce Secretary said earlier this week on Fox news about tariffs against Canada and Mexico so I think he's going to work something out with them it's not going to be a pause none of that pause stuff but I think he's going to figure out you do more and I'll meet you in the middle someway and we're going to probably be announcing that tomorrow except this was wrong two days later Trump did in fact issue a significant tariff pause we saw this a bit in the first term but not nearly to this extent but if you were to put a timeline of promises backtracking promis is backtracking it's just a zigzag pattern and this zigzagging isn't necessarily only a communication thing sometimes Trump's policies just aren't properly thought out president Trump has announced new tariffs on China that remove the Dom Minimus exemption on February 1st Trump issued an executive order that taxed Chinese Imports under $800 for years those Imports had been duty-free but then one week later Trump completely reversed course because there was no plan for how the US Postal Service was supposed to suddenly process brand new taxes on the mountain of stuff Americans order every day from sites like timu and shien packages started getting backlogged so now this order is on hold until they figure it out it's the whims of somebody who seems to change his mind uh as fast as the rest of us change our underwear there's the constant drama impulse control if you want to make the case that there's a master plan what is that master plan and there are countless examples of this apparent lack of a master plan because many of the consequences that seem to invariably Force Trump to take back what he says are foreseeable the biggest example of this is how tariffs would affect the auto sector I'm afraid for both sides for my workers for the workers in the United States but it it's devastating it'll devastate us car manufacturing Supply chains across Canada the US and Mexico are highly integrated and interdependent millions of parts and vehicles flow between the three countries every year and economists predicted a 25% tariff would increase the cost to make each vehicle by thousands of dollars this industry has been integrated and grown together for decades you can't unscramble the omelet one morning because you decide you know what you want to have a fried egg or a boiled egg you made the omelet you can't turn it into eggs over easy but it was only after Trump had dangled the threat of tariffs for 2 months and then actually enacted them that he decided no wait I can't do that I have to hit pause it's just a modification short term because I didn't want to hurt the American it would have hurt the American car companies if I did that it was predictable to anyone paying attention to the details I mean the auto sector is so heavily integrated that you know a piece goes back and forth multiple times you can't build a car under these circumstances and the entire time Trump spends changing his mind there's material harm to American businesses because they don't know which suppliers to use or what prices to charge what he's doing is he's creating uncertainty for for uh people and companies that have to make pending investment decisions or future Capital planning and consider one of Trump's most prized metrics for Success since my election the stock market has set records everybody's stock has done well since the election but nowadays asked by reporters whether his latest pause on tariffs had anything to do with stock market performance well no nothing to do with the market I'm not even looking at the market because the market has slumped stocks continue to fall today with fears of higher prices and escalating tensions he says I'm not watching the market like uh excuse like yeah yeah I believe that as far as I could throw Honda Civic right that the one thing he will respond to is when the stock market goes down the stock market goes down and he changes his mind but in the meantime there is real economic consequences for doing this for the uncertainty that consumers and producers uh take but let's talk about the second possibility here which is that Trump knows exactly what he's [Music] doing when you spend some time observing Trump you start to notice more and more how he very clearly enjoys the Persona that he's carved out for himself of being a disruptor like when he's naming those countries he believes treat the US unfairly the European Union China Brazil India Mexico and Canada have you heard of them or when he's waving a pen at those same two economies who depend on the US the most they've been in the news lately haven't they or when he calls the president of Ukraine a dictator and Days Later jokes that he would never say such a thing Mr President I still think that Mr is TI um did I say that I can't believe I said that next question I do think that he thrives on the idea that we're having this conversation right now uh about what his strategy is here I think he thrives on the idea that he's unwieldy and nobody really knows what's really going on yes it's this old Paradox of how a bug is sometimes actually a feature as in Trump's leadership may not simply be a series of unforced errors but rather an intentional set of moves designed to throw opponents off balance we see a lot of what what they call the madman Theory you know basically make yourself look so unpredictable that your adversaries don't know what to believe about you and let's stop to consider who Trump might consider his adversaries countries like Canada and Mexico yeah and maybe not just Canada and Mexico the United States has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world but also he's increasingly singled out and used incendiary language against those companies that do business with other countries well a lot of them are globalist countries and uh companies that won't be doing as well because we're taking back things that have been taken from us many years ago basically you have globalist companies that have been ripping us off and I'll explain where I'm going with this Trump has always been transparent about one thing that he wants America manufacturing to return to America America will be a manufacturing Nation once again and he's always been clear tariffs are a way of forcing those companies who would dare to make product outside of the US to relocate to set up factories to create jobs to put America first he would in his heart of hearts like to have fewer cars built in Canada and Mexico and more cars built in Michigan and like North Carolina so what they have to do is build their car plant frankly and other things in the United States in which case they have no tariffs and so there's a strategic line you can start to imagine where maybe you never actually have to apply tariffs to anything because maybe the threat is enough he's essentially trying to intimidate or provoke some response that he thinks he'll be able to take advantage of and if that's the case the rubber banding the pendulum brinksmanship starts to make more sense if he thinks this is the most painless way to get what he wants eventually that the prospect of Perpetual unending uncertainty is too much to bear so from industry's point of view let's just do as Trump wants and move operations to the states he's a lot more willing to try things than your average politician we've seen over the course of the last month and a half his entire month and a half in office in the second term that there's just less of a barrier there to trying things that the Republican party has decided to kind of hand him the keys now to be both fair and clear Trump's aggressive style has produced material change globally in a way that we haven't really seen under previous presidents just look to Europe as an example how they're scrambling to shore up Mutual defense and defense spending directly because of how Trump treats the NATO alliance but turning back to tariffs there are two complications with his strategy the first is whether what he's demanding is even possible you can't move Automotive uh plants in anything less than 5 years you're going to have to close a plant you got to break the supply uh lines you got to find new supply lines find a new site build a new plant get your multimodal access and your power there and that's $2.5 billion per plant that you don't have sales against to amortise that cost these privately owned publicly traded companies that begged him to pull back from the brink he's going to bankrupt them before he gets what he thinks he wants but the second problem is that there may be a point at which Trump's adversaries stop riding the roller coaster Canada seems to want off as I always say you know you touch a stove once and you get burnt you don't touch that stove again uh the only deal is drop the tariffs we're going to ensure that the Americans understand how pissed off we are we cannot live as manitobans with a persistent threat of Donald Trump's tariff tax and consider how differently the federal government has responded to this latest pause compared to the first time after Trump's first pause a month ago the Prime Minister immediately pulled Canadian counter tariffs off the table trade War averted but his response this time I can confirm that uh we will continue to be in a trade war that was launched by the United States uh for the foreseeable future now the Canadian government has withdrawn drawn a future second wave of tariffs but has decided to keep its current first wave on $30 billion worth of American Goods in effect and come Monday which is in a few days from the time I'm recording this Doug forward of Ontario seems so far to be holding firm on his threat to jack up the price of electricity sold to Americans by 25% so if Trump does indeed have a master plan what comes next I don't know I left my crystal ball in the other room I'm sorry I don't know and he doesn't know which makes it very difficult to negotiate how do you play that game when the rules keep shifting on an hourly daily weekly monthly basis but I think we can make at least one prediction that whether you think Trump is governing by impulse or has calculated his moves whatever he says publicly has less and less value because when he says he's going to do something maybe he will and maybe he won't even signed agreements like trade deals stop being meaningful if the US president can simply decide unilaterally to violate them or at least threaten to [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="BUSINESS UNIT, SOPHIA HARRIS, SHE RECENTLY WROTE A STORY WHERE SHE POINTED OUT THIS FASCINATING THING ABOUT VECTOR, SO WE BOUGHT A BOX AND RIGHT HERE ON THE FRONT, YOU CAN SEE IN BOLD NUMBERS, 13 GRAMS OF PROTEIN, WHICH IS PRETTY HIGH FOR A BREAKFAST CEREAL, EXCEPT THERE'S A LITTLE TINY, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT BECAUSE IT'S SO TINY, BUT THERE'S A LITTLE &quot;BUT WAIT&quot; SYMBOL, WHICH MEANS THERE'S A CATCH. SO THE CATCH IS A BOWL ONLY HAS THAT MUCH PROTEIN IF YOU INCLUDE THE PROTEIN FROM MILK. AND READING THE NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION, THE MILK IS MOST OF THE PROTEIN. THE FLAKES ALONE, AS IT SAYS HERE, ARE ONLY 5.6 GRAMS OF PROTEIN. THE OTHER 7.4 IS MILK, WHICH I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU, DOESN'T COME IN THE BOX. SO THE BOX IS BASICALLY SAYING, WE HAVE 13 GRAMS OF PROTEIN PER BOWL AS LONG AS YOU ADD 7 YOURSELF, WHICH IS NOT HOW ANYONE I KNOW UNDERSTANDS FOOD LABELS. NOW, THERE ARE TWO FASCINATING THINGS ABOUT THIS. ONE, THIS IS PERFECTLY LEGAL. EVEN DEFENSIBLE. AND I'LL EXPLAIN WHY AT THE END OF THIS SEGMENT. BUT, TWO, IT'S JUST ONE OF MANY REASONS WE SOMETIMES FEEL MISLED AT THE GROCERY STORE. LIKE WE'RE PAYING THE SAME OR MORE FOR LESS THAN WE THINK. LET'S GO THROUGH IT. SKIMP-FLATION IS WHEN A COMPANY CHANGES UP ITS RECIPE TO USE CHEAPER OR FEWER INGREDIENTS, AND I'LL SHOW YOU HERE AN EXAMPLE. SO QUAKER DIPS GRANOLA BARS OF ARE THEY MADE OF CHOCOLATE CHIP, OR ARE THEY MADE OF CHOCOLATY CHIPS? THE OLD CHOCOLATE CHIP VERSION HAS A MILK CHOCOLATE COATING MADE WITH COCOA BUTTER, BUT THE CHOCOLATY CHIP VERSION USES THE SUBSTITUTE: PALM OIL. &gt;&gt; THERE'S TWO REASONS FOR THAT. ONE IS IF THERE'S A SUPPLY CHAIN PROBLEM, THERE IS A PRODUCT THAT'S CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE, MAYBE A BAD GROWING SEASON, THEN A COMPANY HAS TO FIND AN ALTERNATIVE. THE OTHER FORM OF SKIMP-FLATION IS WHEN A COMPANY PURPOSELY SWITCHES TO A CHEAPER INGREDIENT TO SAVE MONEY. &gt;&gt; Andrew: THIS IS A BIG DEAL WITH THE PRICE OF COCOA BEANS THESE DAYS. IN BOTH CANADA AND THE U.S., YOU CAN'T CALL A PRODUCT CHOCOLATE IF IT'S NOT MADE FROM COCOA, SO QUAKER, OWNED BY PEPSI, SWITCHES OUT COCOA BUTTER FOR THE MUCH CHEAPER SUBSTITUTE, SELLS YOU WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE SAME PRODUCT, REPLACES THE WORD CHOCOLATE WITH CHOCOLATY, BUT IF THE TASTE IS SLIGHTLY OFF, NOW YOU KNOW WHY. HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE. WE'VE GOT WISH-BONE HOUSE ITALIAN SALAD DRESSING. &gt;&gt; THE ONE ON THE LEFT HAS MORE OIL IN IT SO THEY TOOK OUT SOME OF THE OIL AND THEY SEEMINGLY REPLACED IT WITH WATER AND SALT. THAT SAVED THEM MONEY. &gt;&gt; Andrew: AND THE LOWER OIL CONTENT LINES UP WITH THE LOWER FAT CONTENT AND CALORIE COUNT. YOU CAN SEE THAT RIGHT AT THE LABEL HERE. TOTAL FAT, 9 GRAMS, CALORIES, 90 COMPARED TO 7 GRAMS OF FAT FOR THE SMALLER, LESS OIL VERSION, AND 70 CALORIES PER SERVING. YOU CAN ALL OF THAT ON THE LABEL. EDWARD CATALOGUES EVERY EXAMPLE HE CAN FIND OF SKIMP-FLATION ON HIS WEBSITE, MOUSE PRINTS.ORG, DEDICATED TO MAGNIFYING THE FINE PRINT, WHETHER IT'S DILUTED COUGH SYRUP OR MARGARINE THAT USES LESS VEGETABLE OIL, REPLACING IT WITH WATER INSTEAD. &gt;&gt; I THINK THE COST OF INFLATION, WE'RE SEEING MORE EXAMPLES OF SKIMP-FLATION. &gt;&gt; Andrew: NOW I DON'T WANT TO SUGGEST THAT THIS IS NEW OR THAT IT'S EVEN LIMITED TO GROCERIES, LIKE WHEN COMPANIES STRUGGLE, SERVICES GET SCALED BACK. THAT WAS TRUE WHEN DISNEYLAND SCALED BACK ITS FREE TRENDS BETWEEN PARKING AND PARKING LOT, OR SLOW SERVICE AT AN UNDERSTAFFED RESTAURANT. AND, YES, FOOD MANUFACTURERS DO THE SAME THING, REFORMULATING THE RECIPES WITH THE OLD WITH THE SAME PRESSURES, BUT IT FLIES A BIT MORE UNDER THE RADAR. RIGHT? LIKE WHEN THE INGREDIENTS CHANGE. IT'S NOT AS EASY FOR US TO MEASURE OR EVEN NOTICE AS A CONSUMER. &gt;&gt; SHRINK-FLATION IS WHEN IT REDUCES THE WEIGHT BUT NOT THE PRICE OR THE PACKAGING, AND THAT MAKES IT REALLY DIFFICULT TO DETECT. &gt;&gt; Andrew: LIKE SKIMP-FLATION, SHRINK-FLATION HAS BEEN A THING FOR MANY YEARS, BUT CAME INTO SHARPER FOCUS WORLDWIDE DURING THE PANDEMIC, UNKNOWINGLY PAYING THE SAME PRICE FOR LESS PRODUCT BECAME SUCH A BIG PRONG THAT HUNGARY JUST ANNOUNCED THAT IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE LARGE GROCERY STORES TO PUT WARNINGS ON PRODUCTS THAT HAVE SHRUNK IN SIZE AND SHRINK-FLATION GOT SPECIAL MENTION IN A CANADIAN GOVERNMENT NEWS RELEASE LATE LAST YEAR ANNOUNCING AN INVESTIGATION INTO PRACTICES THAT HURT CONSUMERS. BECAUSE IT'S EVERYWHERE. &gt;&gt; THE REASON THE MANUFACTURERS WOULD RATHER SHRINK THE PACKAGE THAN RAISE THEIR PRICES. &gt;&gt; THEIR COSTS ARE INCREASING. THEREFORE PROFITS ARE GOING TO DECREASE IF THEY DON'T MAKE MODIFICATIONS. &gt;&gt; Andrew: THERE'S A WHOLE SUB READ IT OF PEOPLE POSTING EXAMPLES OF PRODUCTS THAT KEEP GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER, LIKE THIS, FEWER GRAMS OF TOOTHPASTE IN THE TOOTHPASTE TUBE. YOU CAN SEE 96.4 GRAMS FOR THE SMALLER, NEWER VERSION, 116 GRAMS FOR THE OLD TUBE. OR THERE'S THIS. 12 PACKS OF SNACKS BECOMING EIGHT PACKS WITH THE SAME PRICE, AND I CAN ZOOM IN HERE. SO THESE SNACKS, YOU CAN SEE THE NET WEIGHT, 600 GRAMS, OR THE 12 PACK, THAT'S $12. EIGHT PACK, THAT'S 400 GRAMS NET WEIGHT FOR THE SAME PRICE. OR CHECK THIS OUT. CHEWING GUM. PACK OF GUM WITH A NEW AND IMPROVED GRIP ENHANCEMENT. LET'S SCROLL PAST THERE. TEA LIGHTS GETTING SMALLER YEAR OVER YEAR. AND CALENDARS CONSOLIDATING WEEKENDS INTO A SINGLE PAGE. &gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S HERE TO STAY IN THE SENSE THAT EVEN IF YOU KNOW ABOUT SHRINKFLATION LIKE I DO, IT'S STILL HARD TO DETECT. I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO SORT OF MEMORIZE THE WEIGHT OF EVERY PRODUCT SO YOU CAN CATCH THEM BECAUSE, AGAIN, THE PACKAGING LOOKS THE SAME. &gt;&gt; Andrew: SHELF-FLATION IS A MUCH LESSER KNOWN TERM THAN THE FIRST TWO. &gt;&gt; YOU FIND YOURSELF THROWING OUT MORE FOOD THAN USUALLY LATELY. &gt;&gt; AND I'VE BEEN HEARING SO MANY STORIES ABOUT ROTTING PRODUCE IN GROCERY STORES, THE QUALITY IS REALLY NOT CONSISTENT RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; Andrew: SHELF-FLATION IS WHEN DISRUPTIONS TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN LEAD TO UNFRESH OR OVERRIPE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES MAKING THEIR WAY ONTO STORE SHELVES. SYLVAIN, WHO YOU JUST SAW THERE, IS A FOOD RESEARCHER, ALSO A PODCASTER AT DALHOUSIE UNIVERSITY. &gt;&gt; IT STRUCK A CHORD WITH ME BECAUSE WE BUY FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND WE WERE LITERALLY LOOKING, HEY, I JUST BOUGHT THIS AND I'M ALREADY SEEING FUNGUS IN MY BLUEBERRIES. WE'VE EXPERIENCED IT. WELL, IN OTHER WORDS, WE HAVE TO GO BUY MORE BLUEBERRIES BECAUSE HALF THIS PACK IS ALREADY COMPROMISED. &gt;&gt; Andrew: 63% OF CANADIANS RESPONDED IN A SURVEY NOTICED THAT THEY HAD TO THROW AWAY FOOD PREMATURELY AT LEAST ONCE IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS. NOW, I SHOULD SAY, LIKE ALL OF THE OTHER-FLATION, IT'S JUST NOT TRACKED ON A COMPREHENSIVE NATIONAL SCALE, BUT THE LAST PROBLEM WE'LL TOUCH ON INVOLVES SOME VERY EASY-TO-UNDERSTAND NUMBERS, AND IT'S SOMETHING CANADIAN POLITICIANS HAVE REPEATEDLY DEMANDED ANSWERS FOR. &gt;&gt; GROCERY CHAIN PROFITS ARE NOT THE REASON FOR INFLATION. &gt;&gt; PROFIT IS PROFIT. &gt;&gt; A COMPANY NEEDS SOME DEGREE OF PROFIT. &gt;&gt; RECORD PROFITS? MORE THAN YOU'VE EVER MADE? THAT WAS THE N.D.P.'S SINGH GRILLING THE THEN HEAD OF LOBLAW WESTIN. THE CHARGE, PRICES ARE THROUGH THE ROOF AND GROCERY CHAIN PROFITS ARE, TOO. &gt;&gt; REFELONY EVASION IS WHEN A COMPANY RAISES THE PRICE OF A PRODUCT, NOT BECAUSE THEY NEED TO, IT'S NOT JUSTIFIED BY RISING PRODUCTION COSTS, BUT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BOOST THEIR BOTTOM LINE. &gt;&gt; Andrew: IN 2022, THE THREE LARGEST GROCERS COMBINED HAD MORE THAN $100 BILLION IN FOOD SALES. $3.6 BILLION OF THAT, PROFIT. THE MOST RECENT EXPECTATION FOR 2023 WAS THAT GROCERY PROFITS WOULD EXCEED $6 BILLION. IN A REPORT FROM CANADA'S COMPETITION BUREAU, WE SAW CANADA'S LARGEST GROCERS FOOD GROSS MARGINS GENERALLY INCREASE BY A MODEST YET MEANINGFUL AMOUNT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ANGRY ABOUT THE STATE OF FOOD PRICES CALL GREED-FLATION, THIS IDEA THAT GROCERY GIANTS AREN'T JUST PASSING ON HIGHER COSTS DUE TO, YOU KNOW, INFLATION, THE PANDEMIC, THE WAR IN UKRAINE, ET CETERA, ET CETERA, BUT THAT THEY'RE USING THIS INFLATIONARY PERIOD TO DISGUISE THE PUSH TO MAKE PRICES AND PROFITS EVEN HIGHER. &gt;&gt; SO THEY FIGURE IF SOMEONE COMPLAINS, THEY SAY IT'S BECAUSE OF INFLATION. THERE'S SORT OF A GOOD EXCUSE OUT THERE IF ANYONE CALLS THEM ON IT. &gt;&gt; Andrew: NOW, MAJOR GROCERY CHAINS HAVE DEFENDED THEMSELVES, SAYING THAT THEIR PROFITS ARE A VERY SMALL BARRAGE OF OVERALL SALES. &gt;&gt; HOW MUCH PROFIT IS PROFIT? &gt;&gt; THE NUMBERS ARE VERY LARGE. WE'RE A BIG COMPANY, BUT IT TRANSLATES DOWN TO THE BOTTOM LINE THE $1 PER $25 OF GROCERIES. &gt;&gt; WE ARE ACTIVELY LOSING MONEY ON CORE COMMODITIES. MILK, VEGETABLE OIL, BUTTER, CERTAIN CHEESES. &gt;&gt; Andrew: BUT WITHOUT MORE TRANSPARENCY IN THE INDUSTRY, IT'S HARD FOR ANYONE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS EXCESS PROFITEERING AND WHAT'S JUST A BUSINESS BEING A BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; ESSENTIALLY, IF INFLATION GOES DOWN, PRICES GO DOWN, AND IF COMPANIES ARE PROFITEERING, THEN WHEN INFLATION GOES DOWN, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STOP PROFITEERING BECAUSE THEY CAN NO LONGER POINT TO THAT AS AN EXCUSE. THAT'S THE BEST WAY FOR PRICES TO DROP. &gt;&gt; Andrew: SO THAT'S WHERE WE LAND. SKIMP-FLATION, SHRINK-FLATION, SHELF-FLATION, GREED-FLATION. SOME OF THE BIGGEST WAYS WE SEE GENERAL INFLATION BEING A ROYAL PAIN WHEN IT COMES TO THE FOOD WE BUY. IF WE MISSED ANY OR IF YOU HAVE ANY EXAMPLES YOU WANT TO SHARE, LET ME KNOW. BUT BEFORE WE GO, THE BOX OF VECTOR, WHY IT'S ABOVEBOARD TO LABEL THIS AS 13 GRAMS OF PROTEIN A BOWL WHEN WHAT COMES IN THE BOX ONLY GIVES YOU LESS THAN HALF THAT. WELL, VECTOR IS A SPECIAL CASE. IF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS A CEREAL, YOU'RE WRONG. IT'S CONSIDERED A MEAL REPLACEMENT. YOU CAN SEE THAT JUST ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF THE BOX. AND ACCORDING TO HEALTH CANADA, MEAL REPLACEMENTS JUST HAVE DIFFERENT RULES. THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE BEING IT NEEDS MILK TO BE A COMPLETE PRODUCT. SO THE CLAIMS CAN INCLUDE MILK. PLUS, IF YOU LOOK HARD ENOUGH, THEY'RE HONEST ABOUT ALL OF THAT. THEY DISCLOSE IN SMALL PRINT THAT THIS IS THE NUMBER FOR FLAKES PLUS MILK AND IN THE NUTRITIONAL LABEL, AGAIN, IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY ENOUGH, THEY GIVE THE NUMBERS FOR BOTH THE STAND-ALONE FLAKES ONLY PRODUCT AND THE COMBINED FLAKES PLUS THE MILK PRODUCT. SO THE FACT THAT YOU FIND VECTOR IN THE CEREAL AISLE AND NOT IN, SAY, THE SUPPLEMENTS AISLE, DOESN'T MATTER. RULES ARE RULES AND LIKE SO MUCH OF WHAT WE'VE EXPLORED TODAY, WE JUST HAVE TO KNOW BETTER." />

WE DID NOT KNOW. THE BEST OF TIMES AND THE WORST OF TIMES. &gt;&gt; AARON, POLICE WERE OUT THERE AT THE SITE OF THE SHOOTING MOST OF THE DATE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: MOSTLY FOR SECURITY, LESTER. THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES. THEY RECOVERED A HANDGUN AND 21 SPENT SHELL CASING. THERE'S A VIGIL TONIGHT. LESTER? &gt;&gt; AARON, THANK YOU. &gt;&gt;&gt; LET'S BRING IN TOM WINTER. THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE SUSPECT. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE NEW DETAILS ON THE WEAPON TONIGHT. COURT DOCUMENTS ALLEGE RODRIGUEZ BOUGHT THE GUN IN ILLINOIS IN 2020 AND BROUGHT IT TO D.C. IN HIS CHECKED LUGGAGE ON TUESDAY. THE FBI IS INVESTIGATING ONLINE WRITINGS POSSIBLY FROM RODRIGUEZ SAYING HE CARRIED OUT THIS ATTACK BECAUSE OF HIS VIEWS ON THE ISRAEL/HAMAS WAR. THEY ARE COMBING THROUGH HIS PHONE AND REACHING OUT TO HIS FAMILY. OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON SAY THEY ARE RAMPING UP THEIR POLICE PRESENCE AT PUBLIC GATHERINGS CITYWIDE. IN NEW YORK, TEAMS OF HEAVILY ARMORED POLICE ARE DEPLOYED TO MANY JEWISH INSTITUTIONS. &gt;&gt; TOM WINTER, THANK YOU. &gt;&gt;&gt; INVESTIGATORS TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENED AFTER A PLANE CRASHED INTO A CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOOD KILLING MULTIPLE PEOPLE AND CAUSING HOMES AND CARS TO CATCH FIRE. LIZ KREUTZ IS THERE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: TONIGHT, DRAMATIC IMAGES SHOW THE AFTERMATH OF A DEADLY PLANE CRASH IN SAN DIEGO. &gt;&gt; MULTIPLE EXPLOSIONS. WE'RE DOING AN EVACUATION. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CONFIRMING AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE DIED AND EIGHT INJURED AFTER A PRIVATE CESSNA JET CRASHED. &gt;&gt; I WALKED IT MYSELF. DOWN THE STREET ITSELF IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING FROM A MOVIE, I WILL BE HONEST. &gt;&gt; Reporter: IT HAPPENED AROUND 3:45 THIS MORNING AS THE PLANE WAS ATTEMPTING TO LAND DURING DENSE FOG WITH LIMITED VISIBILITY. &gt;&gt; ANYONE OVER THERE? &gt;&gt; Reporter: VIDEO SHOW FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN AND PETS ESCAPING THEIR HOMES. &gt;&gt; MY GOSH, ANOTHER EARTHQUAKE. WHEN I OPENED MY EYES, MY ROOM WAS LIT UP IN ORANGE. I TURNED AROUND TO LOOK OUT THE WINDOW. I SAW A BURST OF FLAMES. &gt;&gt; Reporter: ACCORDING TO FLIGHT TRACKING DATA, IT TOOK OFF IN NEW JERSEY BEFORE MIDNIGHT, STOPPING TO REFUEL IN WICHITA, KANSAS, THEN LIFTING OFF AGAIN FOR SAN DIEGO. &gt;&gt; STRUCK POWER LINES TWO MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE AIRPORT. COLLIDED WITH A HOUSE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: A REPRESENTATIVE FOR SOUND TALENT GROUP SAYING THREE OF THE EMPLOYEES WERE KILLED ON THE PLANE, INCLUDING THE MUSIC AGENT DAVE SHAPIRO. WRITING, WE ARE DEVASTATED BY THE LOSS. THIS IS THE HOME THE PLANE CRASHED INTO. A FAMILY WAS INSIDE. IT'S A MIRACLE NOBODY ON THE GROUND WAS KILLED. THE FAA IS SAYING THERE WERE SIX PEOPLE ON THE PLANE. THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES. AUTHORITIES DO NOT BELIEVE THERE WERE ANY SURVIVORS. &gt;&gt; LIZ KREUTZ, THANK YOU. &gt;&gt;&gt; TO A MAJOR RIFT BETWEEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND HARVARD. THE ADMINISTRATION BLOCKING THE SCHOOL'S ABILITY TO ENROLL INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS. HARVARD IS CALLING THE MOVE UNLAWFUL. NBC'S GARRETT HAAKE NOW WITH THAT STORY. &gt;&gt; Reporter: TONIGHT, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ESCALATING ITS BATTLE WITH HARVARD UNIVERSITY, BARRING THE SCHOOL FROM ENROLLING FOREIGN STUDENTS AND ORDERING THE MORE THAN 6,700 CURRENTLY ENROLLED TO TRANSFER OR LOSE THEIR LEGAL STATUS. &gt;&gt; 27% OF THEIR STUDENTS ARE FOREIGN STUDENTS. THEY WILL HAVE TO FIND SOME OTHER UNIVERSITY TO GO TO. HOPEFULLY, THEY FIND ONE THAT CARES ABOUT THEM AND PROVIDES A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING HARVARD IS A HOTBED OF PRO-TERRORIST AGITATORS. THE UNIVERSITY NOW MUST FACE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS. &gt;&gt; A WARNING TO EVERY OTHER UNIVERSITY TO GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; Reporter: HARVARD CALLING THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTION UNLAWFUL. ADDING, WE ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING HARVARD'S ABILITY TO HOST INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AND SCHOLARS. CARL IS A STUDENT FROM AUSTRIA STUDYING GOVERNMENT. DO YOU THINK YOU WILL BE BACK IN THE FALL? &gt;&gt; IT'S HARD TO MAKE A CALL. I'M UNCERTAIN. WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION, ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE ADMINISTRATION FROZE MORE THAN $2 BILLION IN FEDERAL GRANTS TO HARVARD OVER WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE SAID WERE CONCERNS ABOUT UNCHECKED ANTI-SEMITISM ON CAMPUS. DEMANDS TO CHANGE HIRING AND ADMISSIONS PROCESSES. THE UNIVERSITY'S PRESIDENT PRESSED BY LESTER LAST MONTH. &gt;&gt; IS THIS ABOUT ANTI-SEMITISM? &gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY THAT AT HARVARD, WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH ANTI-SEMITISM. WE TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY. WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS IT. WE DON'T REALLY SEE THE RELATIONSHIP TO RESEARCH FUNDING AT HARVARD AND OTHER UNIVERSITIES. THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES. &gt;&gt; GARRETT JOINING US. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ASKING FOR STUDENT RECORDS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT. DHS SAYS THE UNIVERSITY HAS 72 HOURS TO TURN OVER DISCIPLINARY, CRIMINAL AND PROTEST RECORDS FOR ALL STUDENTS OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS IF THEY HOPE TO SEE THIS ORDER REVERSED. HARVARD IS WORKING ON GUIDANCE FOR ITS FOREIGN STUDENTS. &gt;&gt; GARRETT HAAKE, THANK YOU. &gt;&gt;&gt; TO THE WIN FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. A SWEEPING BILL WITH MUCH OF HIS DOMESTIC AGENDA PASSING THE HOUSE. TONIGHT THERE'S A NEW BATTLE BREWING WITH SOME SENATE REPUBLICANS SPEAKING OUT AGAINST IT. RYAN NOBLES HAS LATE DETAILS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: TONIGHT, A MAJOR VICTORY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. HIS SIGNATURE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE CLEARED A BIG HURDLE, PASSING THE HOUSE THIS MORNING. MIKE JOHNSON MAKING GOOD ON A PROMISE TO PASS THE BILL BEFORE THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND. &gt;&gt; THE HOUSE PASSED GENERATIONAL TRULY NATION-SHAPING LEGISLATION TO REDUCE SPENDING AND PERMANENTLY LOWER TAXES FOR FAMILIES AND JOB CREATORS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE MASSIVE 1,000 PAGE BILL DELIVERS A SLEW OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN PROMISES, INCLUDING EXTENDING $4.5 TRILLION IN TAX CUTS PASSED IN THE FIRST TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. ELIMINATING INCOME TAXES ON TIPS AND OVERTIME. PROVIDES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FUNDING FOR THE BORDER WALL AND MASS DEPORTATIONS. IT ALSO MAKES CHANGES TO MEDICAID, IMPOSING WORK REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ABLE-BODIED ADULTS WITHOUT DEPENDENTS TO STAY ON THE PROGRAM. DEMOCRATS OPPOSE IT SAYING IT WILL LEAD TO MILLIONS LOSING HEALTH COVERAGE. &gt;&gt; THIS DAY MAY VERY WELL TURN OUT TO BE THE DAY THAT HOUSE REPUBLICANS LOST CONTROL OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE BILL NOW FACES A ROCKY PATH IN THE REPUBLICAN-HELD SENATE. &gt;&gt; THE SENATE WILL WANT TO PUT ITS OWN STAMP ON THIS. WE WILL WRITE OUR OWN VERSION. &gt;&gt; Reporter: SENATE REPUBLICANS CAN ONLY LOSE TWO VOTES. GOP SENATORS ARE SAYING THE BILL DOES NOT CUT SPENDING ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; WE ARE STEALING FROM OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. THAT'S WHY THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL IN THIS FORM. &gt;&gt; Reporter: LAWMAKERS HAVE SET A GOAL OF PASSING THIS BILL OUT OF THE SENATE BY THE 4th OF JULY. MANY SENATORS TODAY ADMITTING THAT MAY BE AN AMBITIOUS TIME LINE. &gt;&gt; RYAN NOBLES, THANK YOU. &gt;&gt;&gt; THE SUPREME COURT TODAY SIDESTEPPING A MAJOR DECISION ABOUT THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE. THE JUSTICES DEADLOCKED, SPLIT 4-4. WHICH MEANS OKLAHOMA WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE FIRST RELIGIOUS PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL. THE COURT DID NOT DISCLOSE HOW THEY VOTED. BUT AMY CONEY BARRETT WAS RECUSED. &gt;&gt;&gt; NOW TO A REPORT OUT FROM THE MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN COMMISSION ON THE HEALTH OF AMERICA'S CHILDREN. TOM LLAMAS SPOKE WITH ROBERT F. KENNEDY JUNIOR WHO SPEARHEADED THE REPORT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: ROBERT F. KENNEDY JUNIOR, UNVEILING A NEW REPORT THAT CALLS TODAY'S KIDS, QUOTE, THE SICKEST GENERATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY. IDENTIFYING FOUR MAJOR CAUSES. ULTRA-PROCESSED FOOD, ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS, LACK OF EXERCISE AND HIGH STRESS AND OVERPRESCRIBING OF MEDICINES. HOW DO YOU GET FOOD COMPANIES TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY DO BUSINESS? &gt;&gt; I BROUGHT THE FOOD COMPANIES IN TWO WEEKS AFTER I CAME INTO OFFICE. I GOT A LOT OF THEM AT THAT POINT, THAT EARLY ON, TO AGREE THEY WERE GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? &gt;&gt; I'M ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION. THEY SAID TO US, WE NEED ALTERNATIVE VEGETABLE-BASED DYES. WE HAVE ACTED VERY QUICKLY. WE HAVE FAST TRACKED THE APPROVAL LAST WEEK OF THREE NEW VEGETABLE-BASED DYES THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO TRANSITION TO USING DYE IN THEIR FOOD THAT ARE NOT PETROLEUM BASED. &gt;&gt; Reporter: IT MIRRORS MANY OF HIS PRIORITIES, INCLUDING CALLING FOR MORE SCRUTINY OF VACCINES AND A REVIEW OF PESTICIDES. IT OFFERS LITTLE IN THE WAY OF CONCRETE SOLUTIONS. IN THE SPIRIT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY, WHY NOT GIVE US A 70-PAGE REPORT OF SOLUTIONS BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE WRITTEN THIS ON DAY ONE? &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THAT THERE'S BEEN -- MY UNCLE TRIED TO DO THIS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THAT ALL OF GOVERNMENT HAS COME OUT WITH A CONSENSUS DOCUMENT THAT ALL THE CABINET OFFICIALS AGREE ON. THAT SAYS WE ARE IN AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS IN OUR COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; Reporter: I'M GOING TO ASK YOU A QUESTION THAT'S DIFFERENT. I WOULD LIKE TO GET YOUR ANSWER. YOU POSTED THESE IMAGES OF YOU AND YOUR GRANDKIDS SWIMMING IN ROCK CREEK PARK. THERE ARE WARNINGS THE WATERS ARE CONTAMINATED. YOU JUMPED IN. WHY DID YOU JUMP IN AND DUNK YOUR BODY IN THERE? &gt;&gt; WE WERE SWIMMING IN ONE OF THE TRIBUTARIES. I DON'T THINK -- CERTAINLY WEREN'T ANY WARNINGS. THOSE CREEKS BELONG TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. WE HAVE A RIGHT TO USE THEM FOR SWIMMING, FISHING. WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE POLLUTING THEM AND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS. &gt;&gt; TOM JOINS US NOW. SECRETARY KENNEDY MADE HEADLINES ABOUT HIS VIEWS ON VACCINES. WHAT DID HE TELL YOU ABOUT THE MEASLES VACCINE? &gt;&gt; WE FACED ONE OF THE DEADLIEST OUTBREAKS WHEN IT COMES TO MEASLES. HE TOLD ME HIS AGENCY IS RECOMMENDING THE VACCINE TO PREVENT DISEASE. HE ALSO TOLD ME PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICE. &gt;&gt; THANKS VERY MUCH. &gt;&gt;&gt; IN 60 SECONDS, THE CRUCIAL TESTIMONY FROM KID CUDI IN THE COMBS TRIAL. NEW PHOTOS OF THE RAPPER'S TORCHED CONVERTIBLE, HOW IT MAY CONNECT BACK TO COMBS. WHAT WE KNOW, NEXT. &gt;&gt;&gt; GRAMMY WINNING MUSICIAN KID CUDI TESTIFIED TODAY IN THE TRIAL OF SEAN COMBS OFFERING EXPLOSIVE TESTIMONY ABOUT HIS TIME DATING CASSIE VENTURA AND THE DRAMATIC RUN-INS WITH COMBS THAT FOLLOWED. &gt;&gt; Reporter: MUSICIAN KID CUDI TAKING THE STAND, TESTIFYING THAT HIS ONE-YEAR RELATIONSHIP WITH CASSIE VENTURA LED TO DANGEROUS RUN-INS WITH HER EX SEAN COMBS. THE GRAMMY WINNING MUSICIAN WELL-KNOWN FOR &quot;DAY AND NIGHT&quot; ALLEGING COMBS WAS INVOLVED IN AN INCIDENT IN WHICH A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL EXPLODED IN HIS CAR. THESE IMAGES SHOWN TO THE JURY. KID CUDI SAYS HE FILED A POLICE REPORT AT THE TIME. COMBS' DEFENSE TEAM NOTED HE WAS NEVER CHARGED. KID CUDI TELLING THE JURY HE CALLED THE POLICE AFTER COMBS ALLEGEDLY BROKE INTO HIS HOME WHEN HE WAS DATING VENTURA. NO CHARGES WERE FILED THERE EITHER. TODAY'S TESTIMONY, A KEY PART OF THE GOVERNMENT'S CLAIM THAT COMBS LED A RACKETEERING CONSPIRACY. &gt;&gt; THE GOVERNMENT, FOR RACKETEERING, NEEDS TO PROVE COMBS HAD THIS ENTERPRISE THAT ENGAGED IN ADDITIONAL CRIMES, ONE WHICH CAN BE ARSON. THE BURNING OF THE PORSCHE, THAT CAN SUFFICE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: KID CUDI TESTIFIED THAT VENTURA CONFIDED IN HIM ABOUT COMBS' PHYSICAL ABUSE. THESE IMAGES OF VENTURA'S BRUISED BODY SHOWN IN COURT EARLIER THIS WEEK TAKEN BY HER MOTHER WHO TESTIFIED THEY WERE A RESULT OF COMBS' JEALOUSY OVER HER DAUGHTER'S RELATIONSHIP WITH KID CUDI. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A STRESSFUL SITUATION. I'M GLAD IT'S BEHIND ME. &gt;&gt; Reporter: COMBS FACES FIVE CRIMINAL COUNTS. HE PLEADED NOT GUILTY. THE PROSECUTION STILL HAS FOUR WEEKS BEFORE THEY TURN THINGS OVER TO COMBS' DEFENSE TEAM. THE BIG QUESTION IS, WILL HE TESTIFY IN HIS OWN DEFENSE? &gt;&gt; THANKS. &gt;&gt;&gt; UP NEXT, THE FINAL PINCH ON PENNIES. &gt;&gt;&gt; A WOMAN WHO MANAGED TO SNEAK ON A DELTA AIRLINES PLANE LAST YEAR WAS FOUND GUILTY IN FEDERAL COURT TODAY. YOU CAN SEE THE 57-YEAR-OLD ON CAMERA GOING THROUGH TSA AND PREPARING TO BOARD THE PLANE. SHE WAS CONVICTED OF BEING A STOWAWAY ON AN AIRCRAFT AND COULD BE SENTENCED TO SIX MONTHS IN PRISON. &gt;&gt;&gt; WE ARE TRACKING A SMALL PLANE'S EMERGENCY LANDING IN NORTH TEXAS. THIS IS THE TENSE MOMENT A CESSNA 401 MADE A BELLY LANDING AT ARLINGTON'S MUNICIPAL AIRPORT. THE PILOT REPORTED ISSUES WITH LANDING GEAR AND ASKED FOR FOAM ON THE RUNWAY. THE PLAN WORKED OKAY. THE PEOPLE ON BOARD WALKED AWAY FINE. &gt;&gt;&gt; A PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS. THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT MADE ITS LAST ORDER OF BLANK PENNIES THIS MONTH. IT PLANS TO END PRODUCTION OF ONE-CENT COINS. THE U.S. MINT WILL KEEP MAKING THEM UNTIL IT RUNS OUT OF BLANK ONES. PRESIDENT TRUMP ORDERED A HALT TO MAKING NEW PENNIES EARLIER THIS YEAR. &gt;&gt;&gt; WHEN WE COME BACK, CALLING ON BARBECUE LOVERS. FEAST YOUR EYE ON THE FIRST BARBECUE MUSEUM. WE WILL TAKE YOU ON A TASTE TOUR AND A DIVE INTO A BEAN-BALL PIT, NEXT. &gt;&gt;&gt; WITH SUMMER AND BARBECUE SEASON UNOFFICIALLY KICKING OFF THIS WEEKEND, THERE'S GOOD NEWS TONIGHT ABOUT A NEW MUSEUM PAYING HOMAGE TO ONE OF AMERICA'S FAVORITE FOODS. HERE IS STEPHANIE GOSK. &gt;&gt; Reporter: A PLATE OF BARBECUE IN THIS COUNTRY ISN'T JUST A MEAL. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE PULLED PORK. &gt;&gt; Reporter: IT'S A STICKY MESS OF AMERICAN CULTURE. THAT IS SO GOOD. HOW IT'S SERVED, DRY, WET, SPICY, SWEET, TELLS A GENERATION'S OLD STORY OF WHERE YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; I'M A FOOD WRITER BY TRADE WHO FELL IN LOVE WITH THE STORY OF BARBECUE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: WHICH IS WHY JONATHON BENDER THOUGHT BARBECUE NEEDED MORE THAN A SMOKER AND A HOT GRILL. IT NEEDED A MUSEUM. &gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE ARE THE STORY OF THE BARBECUE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: KANSAS CITY, A MECCA FOR THE BELOVED MEAT. IT WAS THE PERFECT PLACE, JUST ASK THE GUYS AT JOE'S BARBECUE. &gt;&gt; THE WAY WE COOK IT IS DIFFERENT THAN ANYBODY ELSE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT THE KANSAS CITY STYLE. THERE'S A ROOM DEDICATED TO EVERY REGION. THERE'S ROOM FOR SIDES. WELL, ONE SIDE. BENDER DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE LOYALTY TO A PARTICULAR STYLE OF BARBECUE. YOU WERE BORN AND RAISED IN KANSAS CITY? &gt;&gt; I'M NOT. I'M FROM CONNECTICUT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: WHICH MAKES HIM THE PERFECT IMPARTIAL OBSERVER. SHARING HIS LOVE WITH A CENTURY OLD PROCESS. &gt;&gt; THEY DISCOVERED IF YOU COOK SOMETHING FOR A LOW TEMPERATURE FOR A LONG TIME, WE CALL IT LOW AND SLOW, YOU CAN PRODUCE SOMETHING SUBLIME. &gt;&gt; Reporter: A MUSEUM, HE SAYS, WAS LONG OVERDUE. STEPHANIE GOSK, NBC NEWS, KANSAS CITY. &gt;&gt; LOOKS GOOD. &gt;&gt;&gt; THAT'S &quot;NIGHTLY NEWS&quot; FOR THIS THURSDAY. THANK YOU FOR WATCHING. I'M LESTER HOLT. PLEASE TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND EACH OTHER. GOOD NIGHT." />

WHERE THEY'VE LOCATED SEEK THE ZEBRA. NIGHTLY NEWS BEGINS NOW. &gt;&gt; THIS IS NBC NIGHTLY NEWS WITH TOM LLAMAS. &gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING. TONIGHT WE START WITH BREAKING NEWS. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ANNOUNCING KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA IS BACK IN THE U.S., INDICTED BY FEDERAL GRAND JURY AND FACING HUMAN SMUGGLING CHARGES. YOU MAY REMEMBER HE WAS THE UNDOCUMENTED MAN IN MARYLAND DEPORTED INITIALLY TO THAT EL SALVADOR SUPER MAX PRISON, BUT THEN THE DOJ SAID HE WAS MISTAKENLY DEPORTED, SPARKING INTERNATIONAL FIGHT OVER DUE PROCESS. THE NEWLY UNSEALED INDICTMENT ACCUSES ABREGO GARCIA OF PARTICIPATING IN A CONSPIRACY TO MOVE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS FROM TEXAS FURTHER INTO THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE VIOLENT MS-13 GANG. ABREGO GARCIA'S ATTORNEY NOW SAYING BRING HIM BACK FOR PROSECUTION IS AN ABUSE OF POWER, NOT JUSTICE. GABE GUTIERREZ WITH WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST SET ON AIR FORCE ONE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: TONIGHT KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA MANAGED TO KEEP A FLASHPOINT IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S CRACKDOWN ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, IS BACK IN THE U.S. TO FACE NEW CRIMINAL CHARGES. &gt;&gt; OVER THE PAST NINE YEARS ABREGO GARCIA HAS PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN AN ALIEN SMUGGLING RING. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE ALLEGATIONS STEM FROM THIS TENNESSEE TRAFFIC STOP IN 2022.

THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INITIALLY SAID THAT WAS A MISTAKE BUT THE WHITE HOUSE LATER DISPUTED THAT. THE SUPREME COURT EVENTUALLY ORDERED THE ADMINISTRATION TO FACILITATE HIS RETURN. THE PRESIDENT'S USE OF THE ALIEN ENEMIES ACT TO REMOVE HIM SOON LED TO A FIERCE LEGAL BATTLE. &gt;&gt; I CAN SEE A DECISION BEING MADE, BRING HIM BACK, SHOW EVERYBODY HOW HORRIBLE THIS GUY IS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: DEMOCRATS TRAVELED TO EL SALVADOR, PLEADING FOR DUE PROCESS. &gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS THE FIRST STEP TO ULTIMATELY BRINGING HIM HOME, AS THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES. &gt;&gt; Reporter: WHILE ABREGO GARCIA'S WIFE CALLED FOR HIS RELEASE. &gt;&gt; MY FAMILY CAN'T BE ROBBED FROM ANOTHER DAY WITHOUT SEEING KOMAR. &gt;&gt; Reporter: SHE PREVIOUSLY HAD ACCUSED HIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. &gt;&gt; MY SISTER CALLED THE POLICE BECAUSE HE HIT ME IN FRONT OF MY SISTER. &gt;&gt; Reporter: LATER SAYING THEY WERE NOT IN A GOOD PLACE AND DENY ALLEGATIONS OF HUMAN SMUGGLING, SAID HE WORKED IN CONSTRUCTION, SOMETIMES TRANSPORTING GROUPS OF WORKERS BETWEEN JOB SITES. &gt;&gt; KILMAR WILL FINALLY GET HIS DAY IN COURT .

AS THIS STORY WAS BREAKING WE'RE HEARING THERE WERE SOME TENSE CLASHES BETWEEN PROTESTERS AND I.C.E. AGENTS IN L.A. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT. IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES WERE CONDUCTING ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS TODAY IN L.A. YOU SEE RIGHT THERE, AT ONE POINT CROWDS OF PEOPLE TRIED TO BLOCK THE OFFICERS. THERE WERE CLASHES WITH PROTESTERS. NO WORD YET ON ANY ARRESTS OR INJURIES. &gt;&gt; GABE GUTIERREZ LEADING US OFF. &gt;&gt;&gt; NOW TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S VERY PUBLIC FEUD WITH ELON MUSK, THE WORLD'S RICHEST MAN APPEARING TO BACK DOWN TODAY WHILE PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST SPOKE ABOUT MUSK MOMENTS AGO. HERE IS GARRETT HEYD. &gt;&gt; Reporter: TONIGHT THE FIERY FEUD BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND ELON MUSK APPEARS TO BE COOLING. THE PRESIDENT SHRUGGING OFF QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS FORMER TOP ALLY AND SAYING HE HAS NO PLANS TO SPEAK WITH HIM SOON. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT ELON. I JUST WISH HIM WELL. &gt;&gt; Reporter: AND A SENIOR WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL TELLS NBC NEWS THE PRESIDENT IS CONSIDERING SELLING OR GIVING AWAY THE RED TESLA HE BOUGHT AS A SHOW OF SUPPORT FOR MUSK IN MARCH, STILL PARKED OUTSIDE THE WEST WING. &gt;&gt; I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE ANY PLANS? &gt;&gt; I HOPE HE DOES WELL WITH THAT STUFF. &gt;&gt; Reporter: ALL OF IT AFTER TRUMP RESPONDED TO MUSK'S BARRAGE OF ATTACKS OVER SPENDING IN HIS SIGNATURE SO-CALLED BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL. &gt;&gt; HE HASN'T SAID THAT ABOUT ME PERSONALLY BUT I'M SURE THAT WILL BE NEXT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: WHILE MUSK, AFTER HURLING PERSONAL ATTACKS AGAINST THE PRESIDENT, NOW APPEARING TO BACK DOWN, RESPONDING TO A POST AT TRUMP AND MUSK, QUOTE, SHOULD MAKE THESE FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR GREAT COUNTRY, MUST REPLYING, YOU'RE NOT WRONG. AND TO A POST THAT READ ELON CRITICIZED CONGRESS, NOT FROM, MUSK'S ONE WORD RESPONSE, EXACTLY. PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO LOOKING TO TURN THE POLITICAL PAGE, POSTING ON SOCIAL MEDIA NOT ABOUT MUSK BUT ABOUT THE ECONOMY, ADDING 139,000 JOBS IN MAY, AND LATER, THAT HE INTENDS TO BUILD A BALLROOM AT THE WHITE HOUSE POINT &gt;&gt; IN LATE TONIGHT, THE SUPREME COURT HANDING THE WHITE HOUSE A VICTORY, RULING THAT DOES STAFFERS CAN ACCIDENT ACCESS SENSITIVE RECORDS TO SEARCH FOR FRAUD. &gt;&gt;&gt; GARRETT HEYD WITH THAT NEW REPORTING JUST IN. NOW TO MICHIGAN WHERE AUTHORITIES REVEALED CHILLING DETAILS ABOUT A POTENTIAL MASS SHOOTING THEY SAY WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AT A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION, NOW SHOWING IMAGES OF THE WEAPONS THEY SAY WERE FULLY LOADED AND AT THE SCENE. ADRIENNE BROADDUS IN PONTIAC TONIGHT FOR US. &gt;&gt; Reporter: TONIGHT, THESE ARE THE FULLY LOADED WEAPONS WITH HIGH- CAPACITY MAGAZINES AUTHORITIES DISCOVERED WHEN THEY SAY THEY AVERTED A POTENTIAL MASS SHOOTING AT A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONY OUTSIDE DETROIT. &gt;&gt; EACH WEAPON HAD A 40 ROUND MAGAZINE. JUST THOSE TWO WEAPONS, WITHOUT CHANGING MAGAZINES, HAD 80 ROUNDS OF POTENTIAL FIREPOWER. SHOOTING INTO A GRADUATION, YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE OUTCOME OF THAT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: INVESTIGATORS HAVE ARRESTED TWO MEN ACCUSED OF FLEEING AFTER WHAT INITIALLY APPEARED TO BE A FIGHT AT THIS SPORTS COMPLEX ON TUESDAY. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE NOT STUDENTS IN THE CLASS BUT FRIENDS AND RELATIVES, AND APPARENTLY ONGOING DISPUTES WITH INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. &gt;&gt; Reporter: AFTER ARRIVING ON SCENE, INVESTIGATORS UNCOVERED A THREAT ON SNAPCHAT TO SHOOT UP THE EVENT AND THE TWO WEAPONS AUTHORITIES SAY THE SUSPECTS HID UNDER CARS, AN AR STYLE PISTOL AND A GLOCK HANDGUN. CHRISTINA SOMMERVILLE WAS AT THE GRADUATION CEREMONY. &gt;&gt; IT IS FRIGHTENING AND IT'S TRAUMATIZING TO THINK WHAT COULD'VE HAPPENED. IT WAS PLENTY OF CHILDREN THERE, BABIES, PREGNANT MEN, ELDERLY. WE WERE ALL THERE TO CELEBRATE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE SHERIFF SAYS HE BELIEVES LAW ENFORCEMENT'S RESPONSE KEPT A GRADUATION FROM BECOMING A CRIME SCENE. &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE THIS ROOM POTENTIALLY WOULD BE FILLED WITH NATIONAL PRESS AGAIN, ABOUT A MASS SHOOTING, AND THANKFULLY THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED. BUT IT COULD'VE VERY EASILY BEEN THE CASE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE SHERIFF SAID SOMEONE HERE AT THE GRADUATION WHO LED THEM TO THAT SNAPCHAT THREAT, SO FAR NO CHARGES HAVE BEEN FILED. &gt;&gt; A MAJOR TIP. ANDREA, WE APPRECIATE THAT. &gt;&gt;&gt; NOW TO THE SEVERE WEEKEND WEATHER THREAT. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. OVERNIGHT, MASSIVE TORNADOES SWEPT ACROSS TEXAS AND THIS MORNING WE FOUND HEAVY DAMAGE IN ARKANSAS AS WELL. AL ROKER WITH US TONIGHT. IT COULD BE A BAD NIGHT NOT JUST TONIGHT BUT INTO THE WEEKEND. &gt;&gt; UNFORTUNATELY, TOM, WASH, RINSE, REPEAT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. HEAVY THUNDERSTORM IS MOVING THROUGH NORTHEAST. WE'VE GOT TORNADO WATCHES IN TENNESSEE AND KENTUCKY, ALSO BACK WESTERN PLAINS .36 MILLION PEOPLE FROM DENVER TO NASHVILLE, DOWN TO BIRMINGHAM, POSSIBLE TORNADOES. 75 MILE-PER-HOUR WIND GUSTS.

LOUIS, SAN ANGELO, DALLAS AS WELL, TORNADOES POSSIBLE. HEAVY RAIN IN SOME PLACES PICKING UP TO 3 TO 5 INCHES WITH LOCALIZED FLOODING. &gt;&gt; COULD BE A DANGEROUS WEEKEND, AL, WE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. &gt;&gt;&gt; WE WANT TO HEAD OVERSEAS TO RUSSIA'S DEADLY STRIKES ON UKRAINE.

KEIR SIMMONS WITH THE VIDEO IN THE LATEST. &gt;&gt; Reporter: RUSSIA CALLS THIS RETRIBUTION. UKRAINIAN FIRST RESPONDER IN TEARS OVER THE BODY OF A COLLEAGUE IN KIEV.

THE INDICTMENT SAYS HE DID IT IN PART BY HACKING INTO A SYSTEM THAT MAINTAINS DATABASES THAT STORE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF ATHLETES FROM MORE THAN 100 COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.

THE DOJ SAYS HE KEPT NOTES ON HIS VICTIMS, COMMENTING ON THEIR BODIES AND THEIR SEXUAL PREFERENCES. &gt;&gt; FOR HIM TO TAKE HIS POSITION, BASICALLY A POSITION OF POWER, AND FULLY ABUSE IT, I MEAN IT'S GROSS. &gt;&gt; WHAT, IF ANYTHING, WERE YOU TOLD ABOUT WHAT MATT WEISS OBTAINED FROM YOU? &gt;&gt; THE MOST INFORMATION I GOT WAS THAT IT WAS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE, SO NOT KNOWING WHAT'S OUT THERE IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT IS INTIMIDATING. &gt;&gt; NOW 30, ALLIE IS PART OF A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ALLEGING NEGLIGENCE IN THE HANDLING OF STUDENT DATA. &gt;&gt; WE SEE THIS AS A FORM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.

Isn't your job knowing what's in there that's like a paramedic saying &quot;I wouldn't have cracked open his chest if I knew it was all gonna be gooey in there i thought it was like a piñata filled with candy where's the nougat?&quot; Another congressman regretting his vote is Nebraska Republican Mike Flood seen here seconds from bursting into tears [Laughter] [Applause] at a town hall uh one of his constituents complained that the bill damages the federal courts and Flood had an interesting admission can you please tell us why you voted to approve a budget bill that includes section 70302 which effectively prohibits federal courts from enforcing contempt orders i do not agree with that section that was added to that bill this provision was unknown to me when I voted for the bill does anyone in Congress read anything before they vote on it are we being governed via Apple user agreement yeah blah blah blah blah blah blah yeah click i agree i just I just want to download Baby Shark come on hold on wait a second did I just defund Medicare what is Whatever baby shark one place uh the Republicans are looking for cuts to pay for their big beautiful bill is in the Department of Education which is currently being led off a cliff by former WWE CEO and final boss at Joanne Fabrics Linda McMahon yesterday yesterday McMahon testified in a Senate budget hearing when Louisiana Senator John Kennedy complained about spending on a certain federal education program we spend $1.858 billion a year on TRIO yes that's $1,580 million a year and how long have we been spending $1,580 million a year on this program more than 10 years yes so that's over a trillion dollars we've spent on this program first of all I know you're all folksy and everything but who calls a billion dollars a thousand million well this this this is the big this is the biggest government waste uh since I was born in 1951 or as my papy used to call it 10 hundreds 900s half a 100red and and one one second his math is extremely wrong as Senator Jack Reid then pointed out I'm not a great mathematician but I think you were talking about a trillion dollars uh I believe 1.5 billion time 10 is $15 billion that's a little bit off from a trillion dollars But I think the the budget cuts 1.2 billion for Well 1.2 that would be $12 billion not a trillion dollars okay wow wow okay okay you're off by 988 billion dollar your guess of $1 trillion is off by $1 trillion if Dave has six apples and Marie has four apples how many apples do they both have uh is that a trillion dollars and she's the Secretary of Education how is it that she can't do simple multiplication was she dropped on her head there you go i apologize i apologize baby baby well it's that time of week again when Trump announces some random tariff stuff and ruins everything today he raised tariffs on aluminum and steel to 50% and that is going to kick Americans right in the old ball bearings just ask Robert Budwway the president of the Can Manufacturers Institute who said &quot;This cost is levied upon millions of American families relying on canned foods.&quot; Do not panic American families you can always make your own favorite canned foods at home like spam all you need is an unsuspecting pig a margarita machine a plastic poncho and I'm going to say a shopvac wouldn't hurt this could this couldn't be coming at a worse time because apparently we're already bracing for an economic downturn in fact Campbell Soup says sales are rising as more Americans cook meals at home and they're seeing stronger sales of broth and condensed soup alarming news for Bernie Sanders trump's fragile economy is causing a rush on America's strategic reserves of both broth and condensed soup he has stabbed Americans right in the backs that's backs B A C S with stands for broth and condensed soups while was he just here was Bur just Bernie right here man was Bernie Sanders just here he's just here while worried Americans suck down their soup the Trump administration is laser focused on critical issues like renaming a naval ship honoring gay rights icon Harvey Milk as part of a part of a push to quote reestablish the warrior culture yes because nothing says warrior like I can't fight i don't like the name on my boat stupid boat name no no I don't want to kill anybody now also Harvey Mil was a warrior he was a former naval officer who was killed while fighting for his and many other people's rights to exist this is shortsighted this is this is shortsighted and long stupided and unsurprising since taking office the Trump administration has curtailed protections around LGBTQ rights banned trans service members from the military asked hundreds of millions in LGBTQ health funding and now said they have no plans to issue a Pride Month proclamation this June no no Pride Month proclamation which means the White House is less inclusive and has less humanity than the Buffalo Bills who tweeted &quot;Happy Pride feeling all the Buffalo.&quot; Even they know even an NFL team knows even the Bills know love is love is Buffalo love which of course is love that comes with salary and blue cheese dressing we got a great show for you tonight my guests are Mark Hamill and star of Penguin Kristen Milli but when we come back puppies y'all puppies heat heat [Music] [Applause]" />

          <attvalue for="2" value="3" />
          <attvalue for="3" value="The man behind Trump’s trade war is Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and his backstory is extraordinary. He’s been a hero, he’s been a villain, he’s been a sympathetic figure and also one of the most hated men in America - and all of that is even before he attached himself to Donald Trump. Over the last few months, gambling with tariffs has caused economic chaos and sent global markets into a tailspin… but  Howard Lutnick is clearly all in. So why is the Commerce Secretary so reckless when it comes to the future of America’s economy?  &#10;Subscribe: https://ab.co/3yqPOZ5   &#10;Watch all episodes of If You're Listening - in our playlist here: &#10;   • If You're Listening | ABC News In-depth  &#10;&#10;Welcome to ABC News In-depth, where you'll find our long-form journalism and other videos to help you understand what's going on in the world around you.&#10;&#10;Watch more ABC News content ad-free on ABC iview: https://ab.co/2OB7Mk1&#10;&#10;For more from ABC News, click here: https://ab.co/2kxYCZY&#10;&#10;Get breaking news and livestreams from our ABC News channel:    / newsonabc  &#10;Like ABC News on Facebook:   / abcnews.au  &#10;Follow ABC News on Instagram:   / abcnews_au  &#10;Follow ABC News on Twitter:   / abcnews  &#10;&#10;Note: In most cases, our captions are auto-generated.&#10;&#10;#ABCNewsIndepth #ABCNewsAustralia" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="can you imagine what it would be like to have basically every economist in the world calling you an idiot this could not be more stupid we're living in crazy town right now how stupid is that someone puts a gun to their own head now I don't think that this bothers Donald Trump too much he's the one they're calling stupid by the way all because one scenile billionaire won't give up on the one stupid idea in his head he is extremely sure that his idea of fixing the world with tariffs is a good one tariffs are very powerful both economically and in getting everything else you want donald Trump argues that tariffs are the solution to everything tariffs are a properly used are a very powerful tool not only economically but also for getting other things outside of economics almost everyone else including people that have worked with him for years disagrees but he doesn't care what all those other people think because he's got someone in his corner agreeing with everything he says today I'm honored to swear in our next Secretary of Commerce Mr howard Lutnik i've known him a long time he's great guy howard Lutnik a billionaire with a permanent smile on his face is Trump's pointman on tariffs and he is all in so I think it's just a different way of thinking donald Trump understands it he's going to be the driver of that policy and I'm excited that he's at the desk this is the guy that I want to talk about today his story is tragic and surprising he has been both a hero and a villain two decades ago he was briefly one of the most hated men in America he's about as Wall Street as anyone can get but he's not stupid he's not confused he clearly understands the system that he is helping Trump upend so why is he doing this what a what a fun day to be on your show today i think the answer lies in his past and while Trump may have eased off on the stratospheric tariffs on China for now I get the impression that he and Lutnik will not be dropping tariffs entirely anytime soon global tariffs are a gamble and Howard Lutnik is all in i'm Matt Beavenon and this is if you're listening there is this photograph of Howard Lutnik that I have been thinking about ever since I first saw it it was taken outside his son's kindergarten on 90th Street in Uptown Manhattan and then I took my next son my oldest son was five to his first day of kindergarten howard Lutnik was almost never late for work because he had a very important job but on this particular day he took the morning off so I have a picture of me he's got he's got a little wet hair he's wearing a little backpack on any other morning Howard Lutnik would have been downtown he was the chairman of Caner Fitzgerald a financial services firm that occupied floors 101 to 105 of the North Tower of the World Trade Center he was a proper Wall Street rich guy he loved fast cars fancy suits and expensive art the office was filled with sculptures by August Redan among those statues was a very nepotistic workforce we chose to only work with people that we like so we would tell everybody &quot;Look you you've got winning friends let's hire those winning friends.&quot; So we all hired our friends i had my brother Gary had my best friend Doug there were 29 sets of siblings on the Caner Fitzgerald floors on the day that Howard took his son to his first day of kindergarten so I have a picture of me with my son in front of the school at 8:46 8:46 a.m on September 11th 2001 had Howard and Kyle looked up as that photo of the two of them was taken they would have seen the hijacked American Airlines Flight 11 fly almost directly overhead holy [ __ ] he he called my sister uh just after the just after the plane hit and he told her that um he said that the smoke was pouring in and he just wanted to say that he loved her when he wanted to say goodbye and uh tell everyone that that he loved them howard Lutnik went to the base of the tower and frantically searched among the evacuees for any of his staff members then he was hit by a wall of debris as the south tower collapsed his driver Jimmy dragged him uptown and the north tower collapsed behind them of the thousand caner employees at the uh trade center only 300 are accounted for at this time and none was at the building at that time by September 14th it was clear that none of the 658 people who were in the Caner Fitzgerald offices that morning had survived my 700 families 700 families i have 700 families howard did interviews with three TV stations and cried in all of them he became nationally famous as the face of the Wall Street victims every single individual with his firm gone gone his entire office everybody everybody i mean I I watched this guy tell his story and it just it just ripped me off i I couldn't handle it on the 14th of September Lutnik created a relief fund for the families and yet the following day he sent out final paychecks to all of them he would no longer be paying their lost loved ones salaries lutnik was all over national television saying that he would do whatever he could for the families of the missing employees well it was about a week later that those families learned that all their paychecks were going to stop immediately why would he cry so on television are you suggesting that he just turned on the tears oh yeah he went on CNN to talk to Larry King about it and cried again they call me and they say &quot;How come you can't pay my salary why can't you pay my husband's salary are the other companies pay their salary why can't you?&quot; But you see I I lost I lost everybody in the company so I can't pay their salaries so they they think we're doing something wrong can't pay their salaries they don't have any money to pay their salaries within weeks Lutnik was a national pariah wall Street watchers say that's the cutthroat Howard Lutnik they know so what was he doing well he had a strategy of sorts having looked at his books he thought that if he kept paying the salaries of his lost workers the company would rapidly go bankrupt but what if he restarted the company on September 12th I hosted a call with my surviving employees and I laid out two choices for them we could either attend our friends funerals but that's 20 funerals a day for 33 straight days or we could try to rebuild the company to take care of the 658 families that we lost that day he planned to pay the families of the victims using Caner Fitzgerald's profits my partners and I we we talked about it and we've decided that what we're going to do is we're going to give 25% of the profits of the company to the families of the victims it was a massive gamble he had lost 2/3 of his workforce he was locked out of all the company's accounts the people who knew the passwords were dead in the rubble all of their paper records were in New York Harbor did they have a backup yes in what they thought was a safe place the basement of the other Twin Tower the company was a shambles what if he never made a profit again 25% of nothing is nothing it's going to be a different kind of drive than I've ever had before it's not about my It's not about my family i get to kiss my kids i get to kiss my kids tonight but other people don't get to kiss their kids but he had a reason to think that his gamble might pay off see Caner Fitzgerald was an unusual firm they were basically the eBay of US Treasury bonds what that means is they trade US government debt i'll let this 1960s film star explain hi I'm Donna Reed i'd like to talk to you about a unique Christmas gift a gift that will fit any situation is always in the best of taste and will never never go out of style one guess you're right it's money but not the ordinary kind of money no this is growing money would you like to see some US savings bonds now watch how they grow this is the 1960s version of Marggo Robbie in a bubble bath explaining credit default swaps so this Christmas give growing money give United States savings bonds thank you and merry Christmas i guess that didn't really explain it did it i guess I'll have to be the one getting in the bubble bath the US government is always in debt so it almost always needs to borrow money you can lend your money to them in exchange for a bond a promise that they will pay you back with interest in the future us savings bonds are one of America's most important institutions they are not new it's not sexy but it's considered very safe after all the US government is hardly going to collapse generally US stocks and US Treasury bonds go in opposite directions because people switch one for the other and that's how it's supposed to work anyone can buy these bonds but you can't just call up the US Federal Reserve and buy them directly you need a broker and that's where Cander Fitzgerald comes in excuse me anyway in 2001 Cander Fitzgerald were by far the biggest broker of US bonds they had reached that status by trading bonds over the phone but they were also in the process of transitioning to online trading via a platform they owned called Espeed espeed the global leader in real time electronic market solutions howard Lutnik knew that the markets would soon be reopening when the greatest financial market on Earth does resume trading the whole world will be watching and he thought that the horrific terrorist attack would lead people to look for safe investments switching their stocks for government bonds people have basically moved to try and get into what they think of secure assets so that they've gone into gold they've gone into government bonds and if people want to buy government bonds they're going to do it through Espeed and that means revenue for Caner Fitzgerald we have to make our company be able to take care of my 700 families using their London staff a temporary office space in New Jersey and an army of technicians they managed to get Espeed up and running in 2 days the strategy paid off so together we raised $180 million over the next five years for those families and my employees they stitched my soul back together that's about 275,000 per family he also paid for their health care for 10 years after 15 years Kender Fitzgerald had hired 57 children of staff members who had died in 9/11 along with his sister Lutnik now runs a massive charity which provides support to victims of terrorist attacks and natural disasters and it's called the the Caner Fitzgerald Foundation and um you know anyone who can uh can make a donation to it is going to help a lot of people who really really need it lutnik knew what funding and community could do for people who had lost everything and dedicated a great deal of time to helping people in need in fact it was through charitable giving that he met Donald Trump he appeared on Trump's TV show Celebrity Apprentice in 2008 as a bidder in a charity auction how aboutund all right that's the game we're playing i'll take a bit for $100,000 in the front row $100,000 all right now obviously this is kind of how it rolls on Wall Street massive gamles that if they work make people think you're a genius it was pretty wild though i think if it was me I would have liquidated the firm taken the insurance and just split the proceeds among the victim's families and that is probably why Howard Lutnik is now a billionaire cabinet secretary and I am a thousandair basement podcaster i think Howard Lutnik's business and his history has made him a very unusual Wall Street trader i'm feeling great Richard this is the best I've felt in a long time for one thing his business is based on how much people trade not on whether the market is going up or down we don't make money when the markets go up we don't lose any when it goes down uh but when we win is when it's busy the company loves volatility and with volatility back you know the numbers of the company are just are just beautiful bull or bear it doesn't matter as long as the market is busy secondly this is a man who has gone through one of the worst traumas imaginable twothirds of his workforce including his brother and best friend were killed in an event that he survived only by chance he seems more than most people to be almost entirely unafraid of negative consequences how could anything be worse than what he has experienced and anyway he's a billionaire now who makes money from volatility he is basically immune from repercussions in 2023 he got a call from his old TV friend Donald Trump so 2023 calls me says &quot;Will you help me?&quot; I actually thought about it like and that was the first time I really thought politics and then I said &quot;Yes.&quot; He told the All-In podcast that he spent a lot of time in Trump's orbit throughout 2024 before deciding in October what he wanted to do to help a potential second Trump administration and I said I want to balance the budget United States of America and I this is the way we're going to do it he said if Elon Musk can cut $1 trillion in spending and he can raise $1 trillion through tariffs he thought that he would be able to get to a balanced budget if we can balance the budget for you will you agree to wave all income tax for every person who makes less than $150,000 a year for the United States of America which by the way is about 85% of America right right and the reason you want to work for Donald Trump is he looks at me goes &quot;Sure.&quot; Okay I want to pause on that point because it is wild remember a few episodes ago when we were looking into Doge and I was illustrating Elon Musk's cost cutting goals with two very big jars of water yeah I'm not going to do that this time because in order to illustrate what Lapnik is suggesting that would basically involve me smashing the jars with a hammer and then trying to glue the pieces back together he says he's wanting to use tariffs on imports to basically fund the entire US government this is the equivalent of Howard Lutnik looking at a pile of twisted steel and concrete a massacred workforce a cloud of paper floating through the air and thinking &quot;I can still make a profit this quarter i have to to support the 700 families the American people are his 700 families now and he's taking another spectacular gamble.&quot; Donald Trump is a rare politician he does what he says he's going to do the stuff Howard Lutnik and Donald Trump are saying in interviews only makes sense if you understand that they are genuinely trying to upend the entire US economy like this quote for example promising to bring the production of high-tech products back to the US you're going to see robotic production of iPhones and the jobs that are going to be created people who build those factories the mechanics who work on those robots these jobs are going to be millions and millions of those jobs these are great high-paying jobs and you don't need a college education to do it millions of non-oled educated robot mechanics who presumably pay no income tax what What about this quote from Donald Trump i don't think a beautiful baby girl needs that's 11 years old needs to have 30 dolls i think they can have three dolls or four dolls donald Trump genuinely wants Americans to cut back on consumption of products that are currently made overseas i'm just saying they don't need to have $30 they can have three they don't need to have 250 pencils they can have five they're not saying all these things by accident these aren't gaffs they are redesigning the American economy you won't need a degree to get a good job you won't buy so many toys or clothes trade with other countries will be vastly different thanks to the trade deals they're currently negotiating but you're going to see over the next month or so we're going to roll out dozens of deals okay because we'll find categories of countries that it'll work out just fine but the other thing here is he's not making any specific promises there's no particular benchmarks or goals much like with his promise to give 25% of his profits to the families that could have been 25% of 1 million or 180 million this means that any concessions they get from other countries can be called a win we had a a trade conversation with a country that sells a lot of cars into America and we don't sell hardly any cars into their market and we were getting nowhere we were just getting nowhere and the meeting was coming to an end and the trade minister at the end of the meeting drops his head and goes &quot;Fine we'll give your car manufacturers the same subsidy that we give our car manufacturers.&quot; Bang bang we don't know what country that was or what the subsidy was or if that's what Lutnik was even trying to get out of them but in Lutnik's eyes that's a win bang i don't know what's going to happen here but it's clearly not going to calm down howard Lutnik is in the middle of the biggest gamble of his life and in his mind it's impossible for him to lose the only thing that's convinced him and Trump to ease off a little bit was a sudden drop in the price of stocks and bonds at the same time after their liberation day tariffs instead of people swapping US stocks for US bonds people swapped both for foreign investments because they thought that America had gone mad short of this kind of thing happening Latutnik is not going to stop until he is forced to stop or until the US economy is unrecognizable if you can find a way to benefit from volatility like Howard Lutnik did then the next few years look pretty good i don't know what's going to happen to everybody else [Music] it's done [Music]" />

THE FRONTRUNNER IS SOMEHOW, FORMER GOVERNOR AND FATHER-OF-THE-BRIDE REALIZING HE WASN'T INVITED TO THE CHICKEN DANCE, ANDREW CUOMO. CUOMO RESIGNED AS GOVERNOR IN 2021, HE HAS 13 SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS. THAT'S CALLED A GROPER'S DOZEN. AND NOW HE'S LOOKING TO MAKE A COMEBACK.

THE THING YOU NEED TO STAY AWAY FROM IS THE GIRLISH FIGURES. THERE YOU GO. CUOMO'S RUNNING AGAINST CURRENT MAYOR AND EVEN WEIRDER MAN ERIC ADAMS, SEEN HERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HE'S UNVEILING A NEW SECURITY ROBOT.

          <attvalue for="7" value="-Donald Trump and Elon Musk engaged in a very gentlemanly, one might even say, scholarly debate on the merits of tax cuts and government spending. And I'm just kidding. They're [bleep] going at each other. [ Laughter ] Trump threatened to take away Elon's government contracts. Elon said Trump was in the Epstein files. And this all happened in like the last hour. [ Laughter ] For more on this, it's time for &quot;A Closer Look.&quot; [ Cheers and applause ] ♪♪ Republicans have a very narrow majority in the House that makes passing legislation very difficult, but thankfully they've been welcomed with open arms by their constituents, who have been very understanding and supportive. -For weeks now, voters have been giving lawmakers an earful at town halls across the country. -When you talk about tyranny, when you talk about presidential power, I remember having the same discussion with Republicans when Biden was elected. [ Crowd booing ] -I feel like this is not productive with everybody yelling at me. -I mean, if you want to hear -- -[ Indistinct shouting ] -Yeah. -[ Shouting continues ] -No wait. [ Indistinct shouting ] -They are not eligible so they will be coming off. So we -- People are not... Well, we all are going to die. [ Crowd boos ] So, for heaven's sakes... [ Indistinct shouting ] For heaven sakes, folks. -It's not a good sign when senators turn into Werner Herzog. As Herzog: As I watched the once majestic landscape decay before me, an unsettling truth became unavoidable. [ Laughter ] We are all going to die. [ Laughter ] As fast food worker: Sir, do you want fries or not? As Herzog: Yes. Me... [ Laughter ] Medium, please. Ernst then followed up with an insincere apology video in which she mocked her own constituents. -Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, meanwhile, is defending comments she made at a town hall event on Friday, Ernst was criticized for her response to constituents who were angry over proposed Medicaid cuts. Despite the backlash, the senator doubled down, posting a sarcastic apology video that appears to be filmed at a cemetery? -I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, we are all going to perish from this earth. -First of all, why are you in a graveyard? Are you digging your political grave or are you there for meetings with Trump advisors? Also, I should point out we put Rudy in the graphic, but he's not really a Trump advisor anymore. As far as I know, he's actually a Times Square performer now. He's Buzz Lightyear. As Guiliani: To infinity and we're the Scotch is cheap. But Iowans were understandably pissed off about Ernst's comment and her sarcastic apology. -At the town hall, Ernst defended proposed cuts to Medicaid. Iowan Pat Pierce says how Ernst defended those cuts was insensitive. -It was rude and it was very uncouth, and there was no compassion in her statement whatsoever. We should call her out and maybe refer to her as Joni &quot;Hearse&quot; from here on out instead of Joni Ernst. -Honestly, [bleep] great. I mean, as far as political nicknames go, Jodi Hearse is a home run. You know who's got to be jealous of that? Donald Trump -- Guy used to be the master of nicknames, you know, Lyin' Ted, Little Marco. He called Kim Jong Un, Rocket man. Then he got old and lost his touch. Started calling Ron DeSantis, Ron Desanctimonious. Then he shortened it to Ron DeSanctus. Which doesn't make any sense. You can't shorten the word sanctimonious unless you're a cool, churchgoing teen. As cool teen: Bro, That sermon today. So Sanctus. [ Laughter ] Joni Hearse is also much better than the nickname Democrats have been using lately for Trump. -Donald Trump's predictable reversing of himself has now created a new phrase with the acronym TACO, as in Trump always chickens out. The New York Times reports that the phrase is now sweeping through Wall Street. -I'm sorry, but Chuck Schumer calling him TACO Trump is so bad. First of all, everyone loves tacos. Tacos are the best [bleep] thing to ever happen to Tuesday. Nobody gave a [bleep] about Tuesday until tacos show up and now I circle it on my calendar. Second, it comes from Wall Street. Most regular people don't know what it means. If you want to call him a chicken, call him a chicken. Don't use an obtuse acronym that's not even clever. TACO Trump sounds like a taco that's covered in ketchup. You can get it at Taco Bell right now. [ Laughter ] and it would make sense if Taco Bell put Taco Trump on their menu, given their new slogan... [ Laughter and applause ] Anyway, the point is, Republicans have been swarmed by angry constituents at town halls, and they don't want to do that over and over, which is why they're trying to cram all of their most unpopular ideas into one piece of legislation, which also has a very dumb nickname. -We have to get the One Big, Beautiful Bill through. -Let's get the One Big, Beautiful Bill across the finish line. -The One Big, Beautiful Bill. -The Big, Beautiful Bill. -Our One Big, Beautiful Bill. -The One Big Beautiful Bill. -One Big, Beautiful Bill. -The One Big, Beautiful Bill. -The One Big, Beautiful Bill. -We call it the One Big, Beautiful Bill. -Please stop calling it the Big, Beautiful Bill. Sounds like a nickname from &quot;Sex and the City.&quot; His name is William, but I have him in my phone as Big Beautiful Bill. [ Laughter ] And he's only 5' 6&quot;. [ Laughter ] This is a classic case of Republicans not being able to pull off Trump's schtick. Like, he can say it because he's already a ridiculous character. He's a cartoon of a human, so he can call it the One Big, Beautiful Bill, and no one bats an eye. But Mike Johnson can't get away with that. It just sounds sinister coming out of his mouth. Probably because he looks like the warden from Shawshank. [ Laughter ] One more word out of you, Dufresne, and you'll be sharing a cell with big, beautiful Bill. [ Laughter ] So they want to wrap up their entire agenda with one big, beautiful, budget-busting, Medicaid-cutting piece of legislation. But there's one small hitch. Republicans don't seem to know what's in it. -GOP Congressman Mike Flood of Nebraska. He had a town hall yesterday, and he made this admission about that piece of legislation. -I do not agree with that section that was added to that bill. [ Indistinct shouting ] This provision was unknown to me when I voted for the bill. [ Indistinct shouting ] -Marjorie Taylor Greene posted on X this, &quot;Full transparency, I did not know about this section that strips states of the right to make laws or regulate AI for ten years. I'm adamantly opposed to this, and it is a violation of state rights, and I would have voted no if I had known this was in there.&quot; -Here's a lesson for us all. No matter what political party holds office and is in charge, we should all watch carefully the bills that we pass. -Yeah. You should. And I'm glad you're finally learning that lesson in your fifth year in Congress. I can't believe that's something a member of Congress feels comfortable saying out loud without any shame. That would be like if for the first five years of this job, I did the show with my back turned. [ Laughter ] And then in year five I, like, spun around and said... Here's a lesson for us all -- The camera is this way. [ Laughter ] And if you're thinking... [ Laughter and applause ] or if you're asking... how would Seth do the show sitting backwards for five years without NBC noticing? They don't watch this show. They think the studio's been empty since Jimmy Fallon took over &quot;The Tonight Show.&quot; Whenever an executive walks by, I just duck down behind my desk and Wally tells them he's just practicing for SNL. -Actually, that's what I am doing, Seth. -Not now, Wally! [ Laughter and applause ] -So the Big, Beautiful Bill... It's a little too big for Republicans to actually read. And that's a problem for Elon Musk, whose whole thing was supposed to be about cutting government waste. Remember, he put his business on the line and exposed his private life so he could take control of the federal government and unilaterally dictate which programs should get cut. -Tesla is facing backlash over his high profile support of the president and his controversial role at DOGE. The company faced declining sales, with first-quarter profits seeing a 71% drop. -The New York Times reporting this morning that Musk was engaged in increasingly intense drug use during the Trump campaign last year. -He told people he was taking so much ketamine, a powerful anesthetic, that it was affecting his bladder, a known effect of chronic use. -That's the thing we all know about Elon Musk now. He told people he was taking so many drugs he had bladder problems. What's with the Republicans Just admitting things they should keep to themselves? They're out there telling everyone they don't read the bills they vote for. They pee their pants. This is like that one friend you have who trauma dumps on you because they don't want to pay for a therapist. And they're like, Dave cheated on me, so I cheated on him. And then he said it didn't mean to. He just didn't read our wedding vows. And I barely heard because I'm on so much ketamine I was peeing my pants. And it's like, Enough, Carol! I'm not your therapist. Anyway, Musk thought he was in control. Now he's realizing he's not, and he's pretty bummed. -I was, like, disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, uh, which increases the budget deficit, not -- doesn't decrease it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing. -He says... -Musk now ramping up the pressure, writing... -I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot. Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will, anymore. -Man, it's all so sad. Another male friendship destroyed. This is why men are so lonely. These two used to be inseparable -- On stage, on foreign trips, at rocket launches, in the Oval Office. Just last week, Trump gave him a ceremonial golden key he stole from the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland. But so what? You know what? So what? Elon criticized the size of the bill. Trump said he was disappointed in Elon. Seems like a reasonable disagreement between friends. Not like they said anything devastating they could never take back, right? -A pretty intense back and forth between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Trump is in the Oval -- was in the Oval Office. He was with the chancellor of Germany. He goes after Musk. Musk in real time goes back after him. -Trump went a step further... -Elon Musk tweeting within the past one minute -- &quot;Time to drop the really big bomb. @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That's the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!&quot; -Well... [ Crowd oohs ] -I don't know about DJT, but I'm having a pretty nice day. [ Laughter ] Holy [bleep]! In the span of three hours, they went from Elon criticizing the bill to Trump threatening to take Elon's contracts away to Elon suggesting that Trump might be a pedophile. Also, if we were to take you at your word, Elon, you already knew that. And it wasn't a deal breaker. [ Laughter ] So that spiraled out of control. And it's not just Trump who lost a friend. House speaker Mike Johnson used to be so proud of how tight he was with the world's richest man. -I was communicating with Elon last night. Elon and Vivek and I are on a text chain together. -Can you imagine how much it sucks to be on a text chain with Elon Musk. Johnson, &quot;DOGE should cut Medicaid.&quot; Johnson, &quot;Huh?&quot; Johnson, &quot;What's UPDOGE?&quot; Stewie laughing GIF. [ Laughter ] Allegedly. So Trump was tight with Musk. He could text him whenever he wanted. And now. -Well, I'll tell you, I called Elon last night and he didn't answer. -Brutal. -Mike Johnson got ghosted by a ghost. [ Laughter ] So Elon's leaving the Speaker of the House on red and trashing Trump. Everyone's been wondering how Trump would respond. And today he finally chimed in, first with a customary swipe at Elon's appearance. -You saw a man who was very happy when he stood behind the oval desk and even with the black eye. I said, &quot;Do you want a little makeup? We'll get you a little makeup.&quot; But he said, &quot;No, I don't think so.&quot; Which is interesting. -He can't use your makeup. It doesn't match his skin tone. Now, I should say we stopped doing orange skin jokes ten years ago, but it's the end of a long week, you know? We thought it'd be a little bit fun. Ask our graphics team what it would look like if Elon Musk used Trump's makeup to cover up his black eye. [ Laughter ] And, well, here it is. [ Laughter and applause ] What happened to you, Elon? As Elon: Oh, I was just looking to make sure there were no more Cheetos in the bag. You know. [ Laughter ] After the swipe at Elon's appearance, Trump explained what he thinks is really going on. -I'll be honest, I think he misses the place. I think he got out there and all of a sudden he wasn't in this beautiful Oval Office. He's not the first. People leave my administration and they love us. And then at some point they miss it so badly, and some of them embrace it, and some of them actually become hostile. I don't know what it is. It's sort of Trump Derangement Syndrome, I guess they'd call it, but we have it with others too. They leave and they wake up in the morning and the glamour's gone. The whole world is different and they become hostile. -Oh, my God, he sounds like an aging Hollywood starlet yelling at her agent after he lets her go. Oh, you're leaving now. But you'll miss the glitz. You'll miss the glamour. But I'll be back. And I won't just be big. I'll be beautiful! [ Laughter ] It's as clear as ever that neither of these guys really believed in anything. Elon spent nearly $300 million to get Republicans elected, and now he's shocked that they're doing the thing everyone said they would do. And in the process, Trump used Elon to get back into power. You know, in a way, they were right. Watching these guys destroy each other is both big and... -Beautiful. -This has been &quot;A Closer Look.&quot; [ Cheers and applause ] [ Electronic warbling ]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="we haven't yet actually discussed the origins of of Israel um and Palestine let's discuss the Genesis of Israel yeah so in the aftermath of World War II uh the Zionist movement finally had a little bit of uh of legitimacy so Zionism was born in the end of the 19th century as a result of the dfus affair so dfus was a Jewish German officer in the French army it's a little a little convol he gets busted by the French for being a spy for Germany the Jewish population in Europe interpreted that as an attack on a on a Jewish person it it's just as possible if not as likely that it was it was actually an attack on an ethnic German living in France right yeah there was probably I'm not denying that there was anti-Semitism in France obviously was but but he was also German so there was probably also a component of anti-german the reality was is he was scapegoated he had nothing to do with what he was being charged with and so um zionists like Herzel are Bor the the Zionist movement is born Herzel kind of being the father of it in the Jewish population it had already existed as an idea we described earlier Napoleon wanting to send Jews to Palestine so the dominant anti Jewish ideology was originally called uden hos in Germany which meant Jew hatred the problem with the name was it sounds like an emotional thing as opposed to a logical thing so they coined the phrase anti-Semitism so that they could say look it's I it's not that I have an emotion I just I disagree with the presence of Jews in Europe part a component of the anti-semitic movement was we just wanted the Jews to leave the initial ideology didn't want to kill the Jewish population obviously it morphs into that and turns into the Holocaust but the orig goal wasn't to kill them it was just to evict them um you know in the same way that uh there's a there's a portion of the United States population that wants to evict undocumented immigrants or that the German population wanted to evict undocumented polish immigrants or that the British wanted to evict the Polish immigrants and that's why they voted for brexit right it's that it's that mentality and so here are these profoundly racist anti-semites they coin the phrase anti-semitism the Zionist movement goes maybe they're right maybe we should leave Europe maybe we're not we can't make a good life for ourselves here um Herzel wasn't interested initially in Palestine he want he was thinking someplace like Uganda so in a really weird way what happened was the creation of a population of White Europeans who were who wanted to conduct a colonial Enterprise not unlike the colonial Enterprise that ended up with Argentina and in the United States in Canada and Australia where there would be a population of white people going to another country and ethnically cleansing and genociding the local population to take it from them ultimately the zionists really just wanted to go to Palestine um the balfor Declaration sort of reinforces the idea of going to Palestine um balfor was a British Lord who said that's where they should end up um and then World War II happens before World War III happens a lot of Jews decide to do this and they begin migrating to Palestine the Palestinian population welcomed them they they saw this as sort of a natural outcome um in part because historically Jews and Muslims and Christians in the Middle East got along you have to remember that even during the Crusades the native Christian population if it had been open to the Crusader states in the beginning totally rejected the Crusader states by the end and were siding with the the the the their fellow Muslims against the Crusades the Crusaders and the Jewish population was always against the Crusaders there was this history of Muslims knew the Jews were their allies and so the idea of Jewish Europeans coming to Palestine the Palestinians welcomed them in uh there's count account after account after account of Palestinian families letting like Jewish poles move into their homes and live with them and then they would do something foolish like go on vacation and come back and the Jewish population in the home said no no this is our home now and you can't come back into it and and and so there was this strange effect of the Palestinians going yeah sure come the Jewish immigrants to Palestine sorry this was like 1910 20s like tens 20s 30s some of them began to do terrorism and so they terrorist organizations formed they began attacking British assets they attack hotels British military bases um so there's a violent element to this um there was a also an attempt to Simply legally purchase land and the the Zionist ended up purchasing somewhere around 5 10% of Palestine legally and then in the process uh there was attempts to create land confiscation where they would just go onto a piece of land that nobody owned and begin colonizing it um the World War II happens there's the Holocaust which is a catastroph event and the world becomes open to the idea that yeah there needs to be a Jewish State the irony is if you're going to create the Jewish State let's do it so I'm part Austrian just I want to out that because I'm I'm GNA suggest the Middle East peace solution let's make Austria a new Israel Hitler was an Austrian the the Germans Austria is German they speak German you can talk to austrians and go I'm not a I'm not I'm not German I'm Austrian whatever they're Germans the Germany did the Holocaust Germany annexed Austria and did the Holocaust so put Israel in Austria call it Israel make the danu be the the boundary between the Austrian area you know so instead of calling it The the West Bank call it the North bank right and put the austrians there Vienna will rename it Jerusalem and then tro will call up the terroll strip and we'll just shove a bunch of the Austrian population into the North Bank and the terrol strip but then let's colonize the the North Bank and and create little walled off sections and ghettoize the I mean I think that's the solution the natural solution instead the world thought let's do this to Palestine which is ironic because it's the Palestinians have nothing to do with the Holocaust in any way shape or form uh during the war some Jews from Palestine actually joined a Jewish uh Brigade that fought with the British the British wouldn't let Palestinians do that because they didn't want Palestinians to have had combat experience but but they did employ Palestinians as stors so Palestinians did serve on the docks loading and unloading ships uh so that so that white people could fight the war because the British were nervous about having brown and black people fight they they did BR and black people definitely fought for the British they were just reluctant they didn't want anybody getting an idea and leading a rebellion when they went back home to Kenya or South Africa or Palestine um ironically the BR British love to put giras and Maes into combat situations but that's a different story so in the aftermath of all of this the UN votes to divide Palestine and and create an Israel and a Palestine the division the vote for the division gave Israel about 55% of Palestine and gave the Palestinians 45% so the 55% that was going to go to Israel that land was to create a Jewish only state and then the 45% that was going to go to Palestine would be for Christians Jews and Muslims but the problem was is that the the land didn't belong to the Jewish population right because they bought 5 to 10% of the land so basically you're gifting somewhere between 45 and 50% of the land to this Zionist movement what about the Palestinians already living there so the Arabs rejected this the Israelis invaded they declare they declare their independence what it is is it's a colonial Enterprise they invade and Conquer Palestine there's a war the 1948 War and the you know the Egyptian army goes in with rifles that don't work they had tanks that were profoundly flawed like tanks that could only turn in One Direction or the turret didn't turn or the machine gun didn't work um they were mostly I don't know if they were mostly but a lot of them were stewards which were these little itty bitty tank cats uh the Israelis were better armed better equipped they had more combat experience there was a bunch of them there was a huge Invasion Force you know the jordanians made an attempt to stop this the syrians fought there were Iraqi units that showed up as volunteers nobody could stop the Israelis from creating the state by the time they were done the Israelis ended up with 78% of Palestine so the UN division of uh Palestine created three Israeli wedges one in the middle one in the north east and then one in the South and then it created four Palestinian wedges one that was about twice the size of the Gaza Strip where the Gaza Strip is like the remnant of it one that was probably about one and a third times the size of the West Bank where the West Bank is and then one in the Northwest um so you know like Bethlehem was supposed to be in the west bank and then uh hia was supposed to be Palestinian and by the time the Israelis were done they had Shrunk the West Bank they had dramatically Shrunk the Gaza Strip and they just took the remaining piece there were four pieces because yaffa was going to become a little Enclave in Palestine that was completely surrounded by Israel and the sea and then uh Jerusalem was going to be a neutral zone and it was going to be administered by the United Nations that was the plan and uh the Israelis of course broke the whole thing Old Jerusalem or west or east Jerusalem ended up in Jordan West Jerusalem ended up in Israel and uh the Israelis during the conquest committed some acts of terrorism so there's a place called darene where they do they conduct a massacre and the Hope was to cause panic in the Palestinian population to cause them to run away and they did a huge portion of the Palestinian population flees fearing that darasin was just the beginning of a series of massacres one of the catastrophic ironies of all of this is yod vashem the Holocaust Memorial is across the Valley from Dar so it's almost like there's there's the commemoration of a terrible cruel Injustice across the Valley from a terrible cruel Injustice instead of the world creating more Justice it heaped more suffering on a population of people that had nothing to do with the initial suffering" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="how then do we end up uh with the Gulf War I and the brutal sanctions which are posed on Iraq afterwards so we got a naughty GCC State doing something they shouldn't have been doing so in the aftermath of the war the Iran Iraq war it's 1989 Iran and Iraq both go to the OPEC States and say look we're dying over here we need to get back on our feet is there any way you can help out and the the answer was and Saudi Arabia was at the at the center of this um what we'll do is every OPEC state will cut their production and then Iran and Iraq can increase their production by that amount so that the supply of oil in the marketplace stays the same so the price doesn't change but it gives Iran and Iraq a larger share of the oil Market that way they can use that extra Revenue to to repair and recover from the Iran Iraq War so everybody's happy Kuwait began flooding the marketplace with oil which caused the price of oil to plunge which meant that any break that Iran and Iraq had gotten from their increased sales was was evaporated um Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait of doing this he brought in a un team to examine this and the UN team discovered that what Kuwait was doing was literally stealing Iraqi oil by both there were oil fields on the board they were they were pumping oil at an excessive amount on those oil fields and they were slant drilling into Iraqi fields that were entirely on the Iraqi side of the border and then flooding the market with the Iraq's stolen oil causing the price to collapse Saddam Hussein brought in April glasby the US ambassador Iraq and said I've tried everything the UN I brought the UN in the kuwaitis won't stop doing this I'm G to attack and and he basically told her look we have a historical claim to Iraq to Kuwait Kuwait was carved out of the bus province of the Ottoman Empire and we want to attack it and Annex it and she said what happens between Arab states is of no concern to the United States and so he interpreted that as a green light he attacked George Bush Senior initially says I don't see any issue with this at this moment but I'm going to consult my team he flies to Aspen Margaret Thatcher flies to Aspen they come out of the Aspen meeting and George Bush Senor goes he's a Hitler he's a Hitler thousand points a and the next thing you know uh we're doing Operation Desert Shield and then the next thing you know we're doing Operation Desert Storm so to be clear invading Kuwait is wrong that's not the answer I don't want to sound like I'm a apologist for Saddam Hussein but on the flip side of it blowing Iraq up and and smashing all its bridges blowing up its schools tearing up its government buildings and Wrecking the place probably also isn't the answer in the other direction so you know this this problem that we have in our world is a wrong is committed and then the response to fix the wrong is to do another wrong that doesn't make the world a better place Kuwait could have easily been liberated from Iraq without blowing Iraq up it there was no need to to to do the kind of Destruction that was done we're talking about an international Force the Egyptian arm is there the the the syrians sent troops the Saudis are there the French are there the British are there the Americans are there like there's nothing in the world that could have prevent that Saddam Hussein could have done to prevent the the military capture of Kuwait the bombing campaign that the United States unleashes on Iraq for one month they we bombed the hell out of the country has no reasonable explanation other than we just wanted to test weapon systems and kill as many people as we could and I think the result was kind of shock and horrify the world like what was that for this was so excessive in any case uh that's what we do the second war is even more irrational like at least in the case of the first war you can say well we're liberating Kuwait in the case of the second war there is no explanation for it so in the aftermath of the first war the United States announced George Bush Senor announced that as soon as Iraq got get got rid of its weapons of mass destruction it would be let back into the the community of countries right the Iraqis misund misunderstood what was being said they misinterpreted they took their their chemical weapons out into the desert in multiple sites and blew them up they did this in August of 1991 so the war had ended you know like six months earlier the Iraqis go out in the desert they blow up all these chemical warheads and they think they're done and then the UN weapons inspection regime shows up first of all chemical weapons aren't a weapon of mass destruction they're a terror weapon the number of people killed by them is actually shockingly low it's just a horrific horrible death that's scary weapons of mass destruction are nukes and biological weapons um also you can use Conventional Weapons as a weapon of mass destruction you know we killed 20,000 people when we firebomb the city of Dresden in World War II I think burning 20,000 people alive it constitutes a weapon of mass destruction at that point right obviously we killed a lot more people when we nuked toosa and Nagasaki but you can even turn a conventional weapon into weapon mass destruction in any case we'll use the terminology because that's the terminology everybody uses even though it's wrong and I just want to be clear that it's wrong the UN weapons Inspection Team shows up and they're like where are the warheads and Iraq goes we we don't have any and they whip out the receipts who delivered those VX sarin and gas mustard gas Warheads nerve gas Warheads to the Iraqis it was the United States during the Iran Iraq war so they had the serial numbers for every single rocket we just handed over the receipts so the UN weapons Inspection Team says okay we have to find the serial numbers and the Iraqis go you're kidding we blew that stuff up and the weapons team goes show us where you blew it up we're going to sift the sand to find the little metal serial numbers so we can check them off by 1998 Scott Ritter a US Marine who was the guy leading the the inspection team at that point had confirmed that he found 98% of the serial numbers the life expectancy of those weapons were expired they were past their expiration date but Bill Clinton was in the middle of the Monaco Lewinsky scandal he need to distract the American public so he ordered the UN weapons Inspection Team out so he could bomb Iraq he does it and then Saddam husin goes that's it I we were clean you knew we were clean you're playing dirty I'm not letting the weapons Inspection Team back in in 2002 George Bush Jr threatens to go to war Saddam Hussein lets the weapons Inspection Team back in because he doesn't want to get bombed he gets bombed anyway and we go to war a second round for weapons we knew they never had because Scott Ritter had identified 98% you got to figure when you're blowing up Warheads some of those serial numbers are going to melt or be shredded 98% shocks me I can't believe they found 98% you at that point I would have treated that as a clean bill of health but obviously Bill Clinton didn't care about that he was right Wag the Dog kind of situation created a distraction for the public why George Bush Jr did the second war may be explained by a thing called the project for The New American Century I what happened was a group of conservatives in the United States had actually written a series of letters to Bill Clinton beginning in 1998 and then they ended up part of the George Bush Senior or George Bush Junior government and those letters said that what the United States ought to do is invade Iraq conquer it create it turn it into a base of operations and then either invade Syria or Iran next conquer those two because whichever only didn't do second you'll do third then the United States is going to invade and Conquer Saudi Arabia So the plan was to backstab Saudi Arabia and then invade and Conquer Egypt and in the process encircle Israel secure Israel make it safe and then change the borders of the region to create even more divisions and and like I I've seen the map it's it's crazy they were going to split the hzz off of nudged and and make it so that there were at least two states where Saudi Arabia was um they were going to carve Iraq up into three states they were going to carve Syria up and the goal was to just make it so that the United States would would now have an imperial foothold in the Middle East the United States military named the Middle East centcom as in Central Command so the United States is in central command the United States is northcom it's north command the center of the United States is the Middle East and that that was the mentality that they brought into that war of course it turned into a disaster and the and the Iraqi people you know Vietnam the United States and and the United States left humiliated and and in disgrace um the United States got Vietnam by by Afghanistan as well so it was it ended up being completely catastrophic for the United States Empire in the end but the loss in life and the loss to the global economy is also catastrophic" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="hello so before I got on an airplane to come here A friend of mine asked the question and the question was if I had an alternate title for my talk tonight what would it be and uh I thought about it a little bit and I decided that maybe the title was um a plea for balance so obviously balance of what there are two forces throughout history that have shaped every single civilization without exception and those two forces don't like each other they're they're in conflict with one another they Clash the first force is the Innovative Force the Innovative force is the force that believes that the only way to greet the future is through change it likes change it seeks out change it's a very dangerous Force especially when it's Unleashed and there's no counterbalance to it because it'll tear up culture and it'll change traditions and it changes identities and it asks uncomfortable questions by contrast the other force is the preserving Force the preserving Force wants to not just lock things in place in this moment it actually almost always has some amazing event from the past that it looks to as the model not just for the present but for the future as well in other words there's some moment in the past that the preserving Force says this is what we should be doing I can't believe we're doing what we're doing what we're doing right now is wrong the Innovative forces have gotten out of control the problem is is our species at least for the last 12 000 years has steadily kept changing the amount of Technology available in other words whether we want to or not we have been in a state of constant change for 12 000 years just look at what we've done in the last 200 years the last 50 years the last 20 years the the pace of change is actually accelerated so that it's geometric it's an exponential curve which is of course scary because it means that on one hand some of the Innovative forces out of control it's out of balance and the preserving force is lost control of that and as a result we see a pendulum swing if your Society has some balance the pendulum swing should be kind of gentle it shouldn't be too horrible there's been a there is one state that has done a decent job in the last two centuries of getting a level of balance and it's Sweden it's used for 175 years it's used its Democratic institutions to slow things down if the change was too fast and the swedes would vote conservative but then when the swedes are ready for more change they would vote socialist and it went back and forth today Sweden a country of 11 million people is one of the largest economies on the planet it's stable the people have buy-in they have levels of happiness by contrast one of the most shocking events in terms of imbalance was the conflict that took place in Spain from 711 to 1492. in the South the Muslim ruled Spain was Innovative it was diverse it was accepting it had Commerce it did inventions it changed things as minor as how shoes were made the term cord waner comes from Cordova and stark contrast the fanatic fundamentalist Christian states of the north sought not just to create a unified Spain they sought to crush that diversity and create a homogeneous state where everybody believed essentially the same thing they sought to then also Purge the Jewish and Muslim populations from Spain in the process what's incredible about the Spanish moment is not only that the conflict lasted 781 years and not only that by most people's standards the bad guys Juan the homogeneous Crusher population but that it all kind of came together in one year so it obviously was a process that took eight centuries but in one year 1492 a bunch of it lined up just the way they wanted it to the kingdom of Granada Falls the last Muslim Kingdom the Jews are expelled and then 10 years later the Muslims are expelled now obviously a lot of Jews and Muslims converted and they became the conversos and the Mariscos but it's also the air that the world is forever dramatically completely changed it's flipped upside down and shaken because it's the year that Columbus starts the conquest of North and South America by Europeans it's the year that triggers a catastrophe for the Native American populations within a century somewhere around 150 million Native Americans die it's incomprehensible Mass enslavement Conquest whole civilizations are destroyed and it was possible because the Spanish had so much momentum from the war machine that they had built to crush the Muslim South that they just simply took that momentum they Unleashed it into the new world and when they did they brought that preserving force of homogenizing with them and the result was that even though the Spanish created a massive Empire that stretched across two continents and then the Philippines they didn't have the ability to adopt they didn't have the industry to develop their to keep their sustain their war machine to replace the armado and the English sanket in other words what they had done by creating this locked in homogeneous society is they had lost the ability to innovate and adapt for the future so even though the Spanish Empire last 300 years the only reason it lasts 300 years was its massive size gave it the momentum to sustain itself in other words the preserving Force got out of balance and in control and it was catastrophic the thing that made the conquest of the Americas possible was also the very thing that doomed the Spanish Empire but having said that that's actually not what I want to talk about I don't want to talk about the past well I do but more recent past I actually want to dive into something a little bit closer to us and I was thinking about it and we live in a world where everything's ideological everything is liberal conservative I'm so exhausted by it sometimes socialist and at the end of the day I have awful names for everybody nobody knows enough to be certain of anything and the fact that you're certain makes me certain that you're wrong right so to avoid that and not upset people I decided to try and do something a little apolitical but to still illustrate my point so my story I'm going to give you a little story is about NASA right space exploration usually people don't get too upset about space exploration I should be able to get away with it in 1972 NASA approached President Nixon because they had just made a discovery it was a really cool Discovery it turns out that if they launch a probe by 1977 if they launched a spaceship by 1977 they could catch the four big gas giants with the one spaceship they could send this probe to Jupiter use its gravity to slingshot it past Jupiter to Saturn past Saturn to Uranus past Uranus to Neptune and then leave the solar system and send us data back the whole way makes him Mania was going to resist the reason they knew Rick Nixon was going to resist is because Nixon was part of the preserver Force in American parlance we'd say conservative but it's not really a liberal conservative thing so I want to be careful with it which is why I'm using the preserver for us it in the in 1968 Nixon believed he had been elected to undo the 60s that was his mandate he wanted a 1973 to be 1953. honestly I think if it could have been 1853 he would have preferred that but at least 1953 the year he became vice president for Eisenhower so two years after we land on the Moon 1971 Nixon slashes NASA's budget they're punished for their success so by 1972 they know they're in trouble so they go to the president tears already in their eyes because they're worried he's going to say no and they tell them about this unbelievably strange event where the planets are not really lined up but kind of lined up right for probe purposes they're lined up they need to launch by 77 so they can't wait for the election results and besides Nixon might get a second term so they need the permission now so they got them and they go will you authorize us to send this probe to look at the four big gas giants and of course his answer is no and the reason his answer is no it's because he sees science as part of the problem what does science do it asks questions it never really answers any question by the time you're done answering a question you end up with 13 more questions and it and the result is that it leaves us going wow I just don't like electrons electrons are so bizarre we can actually have a situation where we can look at an electron and it behaves like a particle and then we can change the parameters and it acts like a wave but here's what's really weird the way we change which one it does is if we looked at the data on how it was behaving if we don't look it acts like a wave as soon as we look it acts like a particle it's almost as if the electron is aware that we're looking right you look at that you go okay I don't never am I going to think of electrons again I'm done with it it's protons for my future because protons are predictable so Nixon is looking at this and he's going we just did the 60s and it's because of people like you innovators who hold Summits to have ideas talked about right that's what this is in case you hadn't figured it out already it's a chance to share and maybe make people uncomfortable on occasion but but to get ideas out there and Nixon goes the 60s which by the way was 15 years long started in 54 ended in 69. Steve's was total upheaval it was a revolution in the true sense of the word an actual Revolution we changed everything we changed the way people dressed we changed the way men wore their hair we changed the music we listened to we changed the political structure we made space for women women to have more political rights movement to have more economic rights we made space for black people we made space for brown people we didn't make everybody equal by any means that would be naive and silly and foolish to think but at least it got better we changed our relationship to drugs to marriage to sex to everything and Nixon and his folk hated every moment of him it was torture for them they wanted the old order returned and so he says no he says no to NASA so they start begging and they're trying to get something out of this and somebody has the idea two two planets what if we compromise how about this Mr President just give us two planets Jupiter and Saturn and the president goes okay just two planets which is of course brilliant on NASA's part because all they have to do is launch the probe at the first two planets and it'll automatically get the other two in 1977 after launching Voyager 2 NASA changes its course so that it will officially pick up Uranus and Neptune and we did and Voyager one and two of course get to go down and history is the greatest probes ever sent into space they're amazing so Nixon interfering with NASA maybe not the worst thing to ever happen to the world but it has a serious consequence the Saturn V rocket that we launched to the moon was never intended for the moon Phantom Braun didn't care about the moon we cared about Mars the whole goal was that the moon was going to be the first step to Mars that's where we were going and so that same year NASA got stuck asking the president permission to also go to Mars and he said absolutely not we're not wasting American taxpayer dollars that could be used to cut taxes for the rich and fight the war in Vietnam and so he said no so they had a backup plan they said okay how about this Mr President what if we design test and use a space pickup truck and he goes a space pickup truck what's that the space shuttle obviously it's the spaceship with a payload in the back that you can put things in it and he goes oh I can relate to pickup trucks and I bet the American public can too and he approves it now in NASA's mind they thought they were manipulating the president again they thought what they were going to get was this the space shuttle to build a space station by bringing stuff up to it and then once they had the space station they would bring the stuff up to build a spaceship to go to Mars off the space station this is the first necessary step and here we are it's 2023 and we're not really close we haven't gotten to Mars what they needed the president to do was do a Kennedy Kennedy said by the end of this decade we'll be on the moon they needed the president to say by the end of this Century we'll be on Mars he didn't so there are consequences at that level but actually there are consequences that are way worse than that Nixon tried to identify what was the causes what were the causes of that Revolution that we call the 1960s and he and his friends concluded there were two two things that caused this one was the incredible U.S economy from 1948 to 1973 for 25 years the U.S economy was so amazing that you could conceivably get a job I mean a regular job I don't mean an amazing job just a job and the pay would be so high and the benefits so amazing that you could not only afford to buy a house and feed your family you might be able to send your kids to school to college and and you might be able to retire really well picketty says in his book the capital in the 21st century that that was the only time in fact in human history where a person could work and make wealth right because if you look at the middle class today in the United States they don't make wealth they barely get by the difference between the middle class and the lower class is that the middle class has stable housing and the lower class doesn't have stable housing the wealth distance between the lower class and the middle class is negligible it's meaningless they're barely getting by but for 25 years people were prospering and what they realize is Maslow's hierarchy of needs if people aren't fretting about food if they're not worried about shelter if they're not in constant fear that the economic situation they're in will collapse they have mind space to start to ask bigger and better questions like wait a minute what about civil liberties what about civil rights what about human rights and the next thing you know by 1954 six years into this explosive economy we're in the middle of a revolution the other thing that Nixon identifies as a problem is our education system now if you if I say that today the American education system usually people laugh and by the way that's appropriate so feel free to go ahead and do it right now so I'm a college professor I've been at this I've been a Prof I've been a teacher for 28 years I think something like that and I have to tell you I have a steady stream of students who've just basically never held an idea in their brains and their lives and they can barely read and they can't do math it's not a thing they whip out their phone their external brain and they use that instead and then I think wow but when you think like when you learn math it builds neural Pathways in your brain so that means that part of their brain isn't developed which means they think differently than I do which is fascinating it could be a power maybe having a mathematical brain or a mathematically trained brain limits you in some way but at the same time it makes me worried especially when I read the essays and then being getting to cry so what Nixon tries to do is begin to chip away at the American education system on purpose he doesn't really do that much damage honestly he doesn't do that much damage to the economy either but he does damage the economy 1973 is is pretty much the high point to the American Empire for those who haven't figured it out we've been in Decline for 50 years 1973 was our Apex it was our height but it was also the moment when we had the most egalitarian society we've ever had there was class Mobility the distance from the poorest person the richest person was really really low and it was a time of innovation I mean we landed on the moon that wasn't a bad thing to do think of how primitive the computers were they were so awful that they had to hire mathematicians to double check the results from the computers because they knew the computers weren't reliable they could get the answer quickly but they couldn't get it to you accurately they were black women we put them in back rooms don't worry nobody had to know about it they would call computers that was their title that was their job title so Nixon doesn't quite do all the damage but he does some and by many socioeconomic indicators the United States starts to go backwards in 1973. in other words in many ways the economy in 1973 is something that most Americans dream of and reminisce of it's our imaginary moment when we think of the economy that the preserver nature wants to get back to so when a politician stands up and says I'm going to do something like make America great again they're thinking in the 1973 economy when they hear that they're thinking in 1953 sorry they're thinking of 1853 when they think of the social order so really they're here make America 19th century again Reagan is the guy who does the destruction to the education system he slashes funding is terrible we've had 40 Years of underfunded education so why does all this matter I'm going to give you since I've been doing this NASA thing I'll give you one more NASA thing it's just to bring this home so from 1962 to 1972 so for 10 years that's when we built the Saturn V rocket in my mind it's still the best rocket ever I know the SLS has more is a little bit more powerful but the Saturn V was glorious and when I say 1962 the first two years were just designing the rocket they didn't actually start building the components until 64. in today dollars it costs 10 billion 10 billion dollars to do the Apollo program basically when you think about it that's nothing it was money well spent just just the just the pictures back from the moon were worth 10 billion we decided that we're gonna jump start the Space Program 50 years later what have we been doing for 50 years point to something we've achieved in the last 50 years besides cell phones I was going to reach for mine but I realized I didn't have it on me and we have these incredible computers these handheld computers okay that's great and the entertainment man Hollywood can really knock it out of the park TV these days incredible but name something like truly do we cure cancer name something that we've done that's Monumental in the last 50 years that stands up to going to the Moon a discovery we made Higgs boson was pretty cool I remember exactly where I was when Higgs boson was discovered I was on a dirt road in Vermont driving listening to BBC cry because I couldn't believe how cool it was but that was just for a few nerds something that the whole world could look at and go wow this is incredible this is the moment we've achieved something all the civilizations before us have those things there's something they can look to and we did too until 50 years ago it's almost like we decided we were done we achieved what we wanted to we went to the moon we were finished up we're going to redo it we're going to go back to the Moon so we have to restart the whole space program including building a rocket to replace the Saturn V that project took 11 years to build SLS space launch system I feel like that's the worst named rocket ever space launch system isn't that a rocket did we just name our rocket rocket I feel like we named our rocket rocket 10 11 years 11 billion dollars Saturn V was 10 years 10 billion dollars let's just call it even right it's close enough what's an extra billion in an extra year we built 15 Saturn V Rockets we built two SLS somehow 50 years ago we were seven and a half times more productive 50 years ago when our computers were so awful we had to have a backup team check the math 50 years ago when we didn't have all the Alloys and Plastics that we have today same money so you can't blame it on the funding same amount of time so you can't say it was rushed how is it that 50 years ago we were so much more Innovative that we could land on the moon six times that we could link up with the Soviets in space and we're just now trying to re-figure all that out all over again and the answer is that the preserver force in the United States economy was so good so thorough that the United States simply doesn't have the ability to operate the way it used to so here's my plea my plea is for world leaders not to give up on the preserver Force if if the Innovative Force gets out of balance that's not good it'll erode things for for example history it's quick to forget it's not interested in the past or culture or Family Ties it's dangerous what I'm saying maybe is hold on to it a little less tightly so that when the Innovations come about we can adapt and engage more of the community one of the things that's happened over the course of the last 50 years in the United States is it's college has become more and more exclusive not inclusive it's become so expensive that a person has to ask themselves a really strange question am I willing because right the United States is such a strange place we want to charge crazy amounts of tuition for public post-secondary education do we really have enough MDS that we can afford to to weed this out can weed them out do we really have enough engineers and the answer is obviously no the United States is six percent Asian but thirty percent of our MDS are Asian so we've compensated for the fact that our education system is terrible by just importing and brain draining on the rest of the world what we should do is fix the education system so I keep saying 1853 is the thing they're looking to because in the 1853 system white men like me are the only people who have privilege and Power are the only people who have a guaranteed path to that I can be completely mediocre and I still have a chance at it well the United States is 59 white today so 29 white men throw in class even if you let half of the white man because the other half were too poor to go anywhere even if you let half of the white man achieve you're down to 20 14 and a half percent 15 can you really afford to throw away 85 percent of your talent and my answer is not in 2023 in 2023 there are too many things that have gone wrong the environment has gone wrong our planet is destabilizing we're 90 Seconds To Midnight according to the Doomsday Clock we have some real problems and we're going to have more pandemics in the future actually frankly I think covid was an easy one and I think we got really lucky this I mean think of Bubonic plague in smallpox this could have gone really bad and it just didn't we dodged that one what we need to be doing is we need to be harnessing our intellectual capability and also we need to remember something that at some level the preserver Force has it wrong because the thing the preserver force is preserving was at the time the innovation in other words through the lens of history at the end of the day the preserver and the innovator looked the same in the past it's only now that we're upset with it and obsessed with it and freaking out and so on that note I ask for more balance when it comes to allowing change to happen in society thank you [Applause]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="&gt;&gt; STEVE: COULD THE EARLY 21ST CENTURY BE THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD IN MODERN HISTORY? IN HIS BOOK, AGE OF REVOLUTIONS PROGRESS AND BACKLASH FROM 1600 TO THE PRESENT, FAREED ZAKARIA LOOKS AT HOW THE REVOLUTIONS OF THE PAST MIGHT HELP US UNDERSTAND OUR CURRENT MOMENT. YOU KNOW HIM, OF COURSE, AS THE HOST OF CNN'S FAREED ZAKARIA GPS AND A COLUMNIST FOR THE WASHINGTON POST AS WELL, AND HE JOINS US ON THE LINE FROM NEW YORK CITY. AND FAREED, IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON OUR PROGRAM. HOW ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT? &gt;&gt; FAREED: VERY WELL, AND IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE BACK WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; STEVE: EXCELLENT. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF LIBERTY, I'M GOING TO GO ON A HUNCH HERE AND THINK MOST PEOPLE DON'T THINK OF THE NETHERLANDS AS SORT OF GROUND ZERO FOR THIS BUT YOU TELL US THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT WAS WHERE THE FIRST LIBERAL REVOLUTION IN WORLD HISTORY STARTED, LATE 16TH, EARLY 17TH CENTURY. WHY DID YOU COME TO THAT CONCLUSION? &gt;&gt; FAREED: WELL, IF YOU LOOK AT THE POINT AT WHICH HUMAN SOCIETY BREAKS WITH THE PAST, YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC, THE AVERAGE INCOME OF HUMAN BEINGS IS BASICALLY THE SAME. IT FLATLINES FOR MOST OF HISTORY. AND THEN IT STARTS TO GO UP IN THE WESTERN WORLD AROUND THE 16TH CENTURY. AND THE PLACE IT FIRST STARTS TO GO UP IS THE NETHERLANDS. AND SO I ASKED MYSELF, WELL, WHY WAS THAT HAPPENING? WELL, IT TURNS OUT THE NETHERLANDS BEGINS THE GREAT BREAK WITH, YOU KNOW, MILLENNIA OF POVERTY AND OPPRESSION. THE NETHERLANDS IS THE FIRST PLACE WHERE THEY TRY TO DEVISE AN ECONOMY THAT IS MORE BASED ON KNOWLEDGE AND INNOVATION RATHER THAN JUST EXTRACTION. BUT IT ALSO TURNS OUT TO BE THE PLACE THAT THEY FIRST, THEY FIRST TRIED TO CREATE A MODERN REPUBLIC RATHER THAN COURTS AND KINGS AND COURT POLITICS. AND IT ALL HAPPENS FOR A PECULIAR SET OF REASONS, AS I POINT OUT IN THE BOOK, THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE NETHERLANDS MEANS YOU KIND OF HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER IN A VERY EGALITARIAN FASHION TO, TO RESCUE THE LAND FROM THE SEA. THERE'S THIS WONDERFUL LINE THAT THE DUTCH HAVE. THEY SAY, GOD MAY HAVE CREATED THE EARTH, BUT THE DUTCH CREATED NETHERLANDS. SO THERE'S THIS SENSE IN WHICH YOU KNOW, THEY DID IT THEMSELVES. SO IT'S THE ORIGINS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, BUT ALSO THE ORIGINS OF SELF-GOVERNMENT. AND OF COURSE, THAT'S WHAT PRODUCES ORDERED LIBERTY. IT THEN SPREADS TO ENGLAND AND THEN THROUGH ENGLAND TO ITS EMPIRE, WHICH IS WHY CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE AMONG THE OLDEST CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACIES IN THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; STEVE: WELL, TELL ME THIS THEN, IF, IF IT STARTED IN THE NETHERLANDS AND SO MANY OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT EXPERIENCED THAT BECAME BIG AND RICH AND POWERFUL, HOW COME THE NETHERLANDS NEVER BECAME A SUPERPOWER? &gt;&gt; FAREED: WELL, IT WAS, MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE BUT IN THE 16TH AND 17TH CENTURY, THE NETHERLANDS HAD A FEARSOME NAVY WAS ABLE TO, YOU KNOW, INVENTED GLOBALIZATION IN MANY SENSES. IF YOU GO TO INDONESIA, THINK ABOUT HOW FAR INDONESIA IS FROM THE NETHERLANDS. THE IDEA THAT THE ENTIRE AREA BY THE WAY, INDONESIA IS LARGER THAN EUROPE, IF YOU PUT IT ACROSS A MAP PROPERLY, WAS, WAS CONQUERED BY THE DUTCH. BUT WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS EVENTUALLY YOU'RE RIGHT. JUST THE SIZE OF THE COUNTRY WAS NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO PRODUCE THE KIND OF ARMY THAT YOU NEED, THE KIND OF NAVY THAT YOU NEED. AND THE BRITS KIND OF DO BETTER THAN THEM AND OUT INNOVATE THEM EVENTUALLY, BUT ALMOST EVERY GREAT BRITISH INNOVATION, LIKE FOR EXAMPLE, STOCK MARKETS, WAS ACTUALLY INVENTED BY THE DUTCH. BUT BY THE END OF, YOU KNOW, BY THE END OF, YOU KNOW, A FEW HUNDRED YEARS THEY GO DOWN AND ONE LAST PIECE OF THIS. AND AGAIN, IT HAS MODERN RELEVANCE. PEOPLE DON'T LIKE PESKY INNOVATIVE, ENTREPRENEURIAL SOCIETIES, PARTICULARLY THE BIG BAD, BRUTAL DICTATORSHIPS. YOU KNOW, WE THINK TODAY OF, OF COURSE, A COUNTRY LIKE RUSSIA BUT IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS ABSOLUTELY JUST FRANCE. AND THE FRENCH GO INTO THE NETHERLANDS AND ESSENTIALLY TRY TO DESTROY IT. AND, AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THEY SUCCEED. THE, YOU KNOW, THE LOUIS XV BASICALLY DESTROYS THE FLEDGLING DUTCH REPUBLIC. IT SURVIVES IN A FORM IN THAT THE DUTCH KING, WILLIAM OF ORANGE GOES TO ENGLAND AND FOMENTS WHAT BECOMES THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION IN BRITAIN. &gt;&gt; STEVE: YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT AN AMERICAN WRITER WOULD CHOOSE AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THIS TO ENGORGE HIMSELF ON RETELLING THE EVENTS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, BUT YOU DON'T. WHY, WHY DOES THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION MAKE SUCH A, A RELATIVELY MINOR APPEARANCE IN YOUR BOOK? &gt;&gt; FAREED: BECAUSE IN TERMS THAT, THAT WE WOULD UNDERSTAND A REAL REVOLUTION, BY WHICH I MEAN, A REAL SOCIAL ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION OF SOCIETY, THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION IS ACTUALLY NOT THAT REVOLUTIONARY. IT IS A, IT IS A CHANGE OF POLITICAL GOVERNMENT, A FORM OF GOVERNMENT FOR SURE. AND THAT IS A VERY BIG DEAL. AND POLITICALLY IT HAS THAT BIG EFFECT, BUT YOU KNOW, SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY, AMERICA LEAVES IN PLACE THE OLD ORDER REMARKABLY INTACT. I MEAN, MOST, MOST OBVIOUSLY AND FAMOUSLY, IT LEAVES IN PLACE SLAVERY AND THE ENTIRE FEUDAL STRUCTURE OF THE SOUTH, BUT IT EVEN LEAVES IN PLACE THE FEUDAL STRUCTURE OF THE NORTH. THERE'S A VERY GOOD BOOK CALLED GENTLEMEN REVOLUTIONARIES, WHICH TALKS ABOUT THIS TENSION WHERE THEY, THE NORTHERN ARISTOCRATS ARE ESSENTIALLY WORRIED THAT THEIR LAND AND THEIR PRIVILEGE IS GOING TO BE TAKEN AWAY. AND THERE WAS ONE EFFORT IN THE WHISKEY REBELLION, BUT BASICALLY IT DOESN'T HAPPEN. WHAT REALLY CHANGES AMERICA SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY IS THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AFTER THE CIVIL WAR. AND IF YOU LOOKED AT AMERICA IN 1850, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY RECOGNIZABLE COUNTRY TO THE FOUNDING FATHERS. BUT IF YOU'D LOOKED AT IT BY 1875, AFTER RAILROADS, THE BREAKUP OF SLAVERY, THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE ENTIRE ECONOMY INTO AN INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY THAT WOULD SOON SURPASS BRITAIN, THAT WAS THE CHANGE. THAT WAS THE ABSOLUTE BREAKDOWN OF THE OLD ORDER. &gt;&gt; STEVE: SO IF YOU'RE KEEPING SCORE AT HOME, WE'VE GOT THE NETHERLANDS, WE'VE GOT THE GLORIOUS REVOLUTION IN BRITAIN WE'VE GOT THE FRENCH REVOLUTION THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, WHICH YOU JUST MENTIONED. WHAT ABOUT THE REVOLUTIONS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE IN THE WORLD TODAY? WHICH ARE THEY? &gt;&gt; FAREED: I THINK THEY MAY BE THE BIGGEST OF ANY TIME. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE GLOBALIZATION REVOLUTION. SO IF YOU LOOK AT HOW MUCH THE WORLD ECONOMY HAS EXPANDED IN THE LAST 30 OR 40 YEARS, SINCE THE FALL OF COMMUNISM, WHICH WAS THE GREAT ENGINE OF TODAY'S REVOLUTIONS IN MANY WAYS. WELL, IF YOU LOOKED AT THE 1950S AND 60S, WHAT COUNTRIES ENTERED THE FREE MARKET SYSTEM? YOU PROBABLY SAY JAPAN, WHAT IS 70 MILLION PEOPLE AT THE TIME KOREA, 40 MILLION PEOPLE AT THE TIME, MALAYSIA, SINGAPORE PLACES LIKE THAT, TAIWAN. YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER, IT'S PROBABLY 200 MILLION PEOPLE. BETWEEN 1985 AND 1995, CHINA, INDIA, INDONESIA, ALL OF LATIN AMERICA, ALL OF EASTERN EUROPE GO FROM ESSENTIALLY CONTROLLED STATISTIC ECONOMIES, SOCIALIST ECONOMIES, TO FREE MARKET, FREE TRADE ECONOMIES OF SOME SORT. THAT'S ROUGHLY THREE AND A HALF BILLION PEOPLE ENTERING THE GLOBALIZED WORLD. THEN TAKE THE INFORMATION REVOLUTION. WE INVENT A WHOLE NEW ECONOMY THAT IS DIGITAL AND VIRTUAL RATHER THAN PHYSICAL, ONE BASED ON BITS AND BYTES RATHER THAN ATOMS. TAKE THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION. TAKE JUST WOMEN'S RIGHTS AS ONE EXAMPLE. FOR MOST OF HUMAN HISTORY, WOMEN WERE SUBORDINATE. AND NO MATTER WHAT PLACE YOU WENT IN THE WORLD, WHAT TRIBE WAS UP, WHAT TRIBE WAS DOWN WOMEN WERE ALWAYS SECOND CLASS CITIZENS, MOSTLY THE PROPERTY OF MEN UNTIL THE 16TH OR 17TH CENTURY. AND I'D SAY IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT IN THE LAST 30 OR 40 YEARS WOMEN HAVE FINALLY BEEN GENUINELY EMANCIPATED, WORK AS EQUALS, ARE ABLE TO CARVE OUT INDEPENDENT LIVES AND ROLES FOR THEMSELVES. THAT'S A BIG DEAL, RIGHT? THE RISE OF MINORITIES, OF COURSE, IS ANOTHER VERY BIG THING. SO YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER, AND I FEEL LIKE WE ARE LIVING IN THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY TIMES WE'VE EVER LIVED IN. AND THE CENTRAL THESIS OF THE BOOK IS THAT WHENEVER YOU HAVE THIS LEVEL OF CHANGE, AND REVOLUTION, YOU'RE GOING TO GET A BACKLASH. &gt;&gt; STEVE: WELL, AND WE'RE SEEING IT RIGHT NOW. AND I WONDER WHETHER THE FREE TRADE REVOLUTION IS OVER WITH THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP. WHAT DO YOU THINK? &gt;&gt; FAREED: I THINK YOU ASK A VERY GOOD QUESTION, AND I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT A GREAT DEAL BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IN SOME WAYS, THE BOOK, I DON'T WANT TO SAY PREDICTS THE RE-ELECTION OF TRUMP, BUT IT REMINDS US, AND I WAS WRITTEN BEFORE THE RE-ELECTION OF TRUMP, THAT THESE ARE VERY DEEP, THIS IS A VERY DEEP BACKLASH. THIS IS NOT, YOU KNOW, TRUMP'S 2016 ELECTION WAS NOT A FLUKE. THERE'S THIS KIND OF POPULISM AROUND THE WORLD. BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THERE ARE ALSO THESE FORCES OF PROGRESS AND MODERNIZATION AND LIBERALIZATION ALSO HAVE A VERY LARGE CONSTITUENCY. SO WHAT I NOTICED GOING AROUND THE WORLD IS THAT THE UNITED STATES HAS TURNED AWAY FROM FREE TRADE AND IN A KIND OF A REAL BACKLASH AGAINST FREE TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION. BUT IN LARGE PARTS OF THE WORLD THEY HAVE NOT BECAUSE THEY REALIZE THE ONLY PATH TO PROSPERITY, THE ONLY WAY TO RAISE STANDARDS OF LIVING, IS TO IN SOME WAY EMBRACE TRADE. SO WHILE THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF MODEST SHIFT AND PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BE TOO DEPENDENT ON CHINA AND MAYBE THE PANDEMIC TAUGHT THEM YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT YOUR EGGS, TOO MANY EGGS IN ONE BASKET, MOST ECONOMIES REALIZE THEY NEED TRADE. LOOK AT CANADA, LOOK AT WHAT MARK CARNEY SAYS VERY INTELLIGENTLY, WHICH IS, WE MADE A MISTAKE THAT WE TRIED TO INTEGRATE TOO MUCH WITH THE UNITED STATES. SO YOU MIGHT THINK WHAT HE'S SAYING IS, IT'S TOO MUCH TRADE AND TOO MUCH GLOBALIZATION. NO, WHAT HE'S SAYING IS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DIVERSIFY OUR ECONOMY AND NOT BE SO DEPENDENT ON THE US, WHICH MEANS TRADING WITH EUROPE MORE, TRADING WITH BRITAIN, TRADING WITH CHINA TRADING WITH PERHAPS INDIA. SO IT'S ACTUALLY MORE TRADE, NOT LESS TRADE. THE US IS UNUSUAL IN THIS REGARD. WE'RE A BIG CONTINENTAL ECONOMY. WELL, 80 PERCENT OF THE US ECONOMY IS DOMESTIC, ACTUALLY EVEN MORE THAN THAT, BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE FOR MOST COUNTRIES. SO HERE YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE US HAS ABDICATED ITS AGENDA-SETTING KIND OF ROLE, BUT THE REST OF THE WORLD IS NOT FOLLOWING AMERICA'S NEW ROLE. THEY'RE SORT OF TRYING TO DO THEIR OWN THING. THEY'RE FREELANCING. BUT IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN EIGHT DECADES, THE US IS NOT SETTING THE AGENDA, BUT IT'S NOT LIKE CHINA IS, IT'S NOT LIKE RUSSIA IS, AND EUROPE IS TOO DIVIDED. SO IN A WEIRD WAY, THE WORLD IS KIND OF AGENDA-LESS, AND EVERYONE IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THEIR OWN PARTICULAR, YOU KNOW PATH THAT IS MUCH MORE SPECIFIC NOT PART OF A GLOBAL NARRATIVE. &gt;&gt; STEVE: THAT MAY ACCOUNT FOR WHY THERE SEEMS TO BE SO MUCH ANXIETY IN THE WORLD TODAY. I WAS TALKING TO SOMEBODY ELSE ABOUT THAT ON THIS PROGRAM LAST WEEK, AND I SAID, YOU KNOW WHICH WAS A MORE ANXIETY- INDUCING TIME, WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING NOW OR DURING THE COLD WAR WHEN WE HAD 30,000 NUCLEAR MISSILES, MAYBE MORE POINTED AT EACH OTHER? AND THE COMMENTATOR SAID DEFINITELY NOW. THERE WAS A PREDICTABILITY, AND THERE WERE CHECKS AND BALANCES BACK THEN. NONE OF THAT SEEMS TO EXIST TODAY. WOULD YOU AGREE? &gt;&gt; FAREED: I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE SOMETIMES FORGET HOW UNNERVING THOSE DAYS WERE AND PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT NUCLEAR WAR AND NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST. BUT I THINK HE'S ON TO SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT, WHICH IS THERE WAS A MASTER NARRATIVE, YOU KNOW? AND YOU KNEW WHERE YOU FIT INTO THAT MASTER NARRATIVE, WHICH WAS THIS WAS A BATTLE OF IDEOLOGIES. THIS WAS A BATTLE OF GEOPOLITICS BETWEEN EAST AND WEST. YOU WERE EITHER ON THE EAST OR THE WEST, OR YOU HAD EVEN TAKEN A PRINCIPLED NEUTRALIST POSITION, LIKE THE COUNTRY I GREW UP IN, INDIA. SO IT WAS, THERE WAS A MUCH MORE, THERE WAS A SENSE OF A SET FRAMEWORK. WHAT WE ARE IN NOW IS LIVING IN A TIME OF DEEP UNCERTAINTY. AND, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS FOR HUMAN BEINGS TO DEAL WITH IS UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE IT LEAVES YOU UNSURE. IT LEAVES YOU WONDERING, YOU KNOW, WHERE YOU'RE GOING. AND I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF LIFE, OF THE NEXT FEW DECADES, IS GOING TO BE LIVING WITH THAT UNCERTAINTY AND TRYING TO PLAN FORWARD WITH SOME LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY, NOT KNOWING WHAT DIRECTION THE WORLD IS GOING IN. &gt;&gt; STEVE: LET'S TALK ABOUT POLITICAL POLARIZATION. IT HAS CLEARLY, I WAS GOING TO SAY INFECTED. OKAY, MAYBE THAT'S THE RIGHT WORD. INFECTED YOUR COUNTRY. IT'S A 50-50 COUNTRY. OUR LAST NATIONAL ELECTION WHICH JUST TOOK PLACE, WAS SEPARATED BY A POINT AND A HALF IN THE TOTAL VOTE. AGAIN, A VERY, VERY CLOSE ELECTION. HERE'S WHAT YOU SAY IN YOUR BOOK ABOUT THAT. SHELDON, BRING THIS GRAPHIC UP AND PEOPLE CAN READ ALONG AT HOME. IN RECENT CENTURIES, POLITICS HAS TAKEN ON A PARTICULAR IDEOLOGICAL SHAPE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALIEN TO THOSE LIVING IN THE ANCIENT OR MEDIEVAL WORLD. MODERN POLITICS AROUND THE WORLD HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED AS A CONTEST BETWEEN THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT. THE SIMPLE DEMARCATION OF LEFT AND RIGHT HAS TRADITIONALLY SAID A LOT ABOUT WHERE SOMEONE STANDS, WHETHER IN BRAZIL, THE UNITED STATES, GERMANY OR INDIA. ON THE LEFT, A STRONGER STATE WITH MORE ECONOMIC REGULATION AND REDISTRIBUTION. ON THE RIGHT, A FREER MARKET WITH LESS GOVERNMENTAL INTERVENTION. THIS LEFT-RIGHT DIVIDE HAS LONG DOMINATED THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE OF THE WORLD, DEFINING ELECTIONS, PUBLIC DEBATES AND POLICIES, EVEN PROVOKING VIOLENCE AND REVOLUTION. BUT THESE DAYS, THIS FUNDAMENTAL IDEOLOGICAL DIVISION HAS BROKEN DOWN. OKAY, WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S BROKEN DOWN? WE NO LONGER DO THE LEFT-RIGHT THING? &gt;&gt; FAREED: WELL, THINK ABOUT WHAT DONALD TRUMP STANDS FOR. AND HE REALLY IS, IN SOME WAYS THE KIND OF PIONEER OF THIS. TRUMP STANDS FOR, YOU KNOW, MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, A HOSTILITY TO FREE TRADE, WHICH HAS LED US TO REMEMBER FREE TRADE IS FREE MARKETS. I MEAN, WHEN ADAM SMITH AND DAVID RICARDO WERE INVENTING, IF YOU WILL, OR IDEOLOGIZING CAPITALISM, FREE TRADE WAS ABSOLUTELY CENTRAL TO THAT IDEA BECAUSE IT IS BASICALLY THROUGH PROTECTIONISM THAT GOVERNMENTS USED TO INTERVENE THE MOST IN TRADE IN THE 17TH, 18TH CENTURIES. SO HE'S ANTI-FREE TRADE, IN THAT SENSE, ANTI-FREE MARKETS. HE HAS COMPLETELY GIVEN UP THE WHOLE CONSERVATIVE CONCERN ABOUT DEFICITS AND ABOUT BALANCING THE BUDGET AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING. HE'S A BIG SPENDER. HE ALSO BELIEVES IN THE FAIRLY ARBITRARY USE OF GOVERNMENT POWER TO ACHIEVE WHATEVER OBJECTIVES HE WANTS. SO YOU'D SAY, NO TAX ON TIPS, NO TAX ON OVERTIME, NO TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY, I'M GOING TO FAVOUR STEEL, I'M GOING TO FAVOUR, YOU KNOW, CERTAIN STATES THAT HE WANTS TO FAVOUR. SO IT'S A VERY ARBITRARY USE OF GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY TO INTERVENE IN THE MARKET. SO IT'S VERY, VERY HARD TO PUT DONALD TRUMP ON THE RIGHT IN ANY TRADITIONAL LEFT-RIGHT SPECTRUM. WHAT IS HE ON THE RIGHT ON? ON CULTURE, ON CLASS, ON ALL THE ISSUES THAT I ARGUE THE NEW DEFINING ISSUES, WHICH REVOLVE AROUND CULTURE, CLASS, IDENTITY. HE'S AGAINST IMMIGRATION. HE'S, YOU KNOW, HE'S IN FAVOUR OF TRADITIONAL FAMILIES. HE'S AGAINST WOKE IDEOLOGY. HE'S AGAINST GENDER FLUIDITY. YOU KNOW, AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE EUROPEAN CONSERVATIVES NOW PARTICULARLY THE NEW ONES, IF WE LOOK AT MARINE LE PEN, LOOK AT THE AFD IN GERMANY, LOOK AT THE SWEDISH DEMOCRATS WHO ARE THE RIGHT-WING PARTY IN SWEDEN, LOOK AT THE DUTCH, YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU SEE IS ANTI-IMMIGRATION, ANTI- ISLAM, ANTI, YOU KNOW, GENDER FLUIDITY, WOKE IDEOLOGY, YOU KNOW, CALL IT WHAT YOU WILL. SO IT IS REALLY, I THINK VIKTOR ORBAN, WHEN HE WAS ELECTED, SAID THE FIRST TASK OF THIS GOVERNMENT IS TO RESTORE CHRISTIAN CULTURE IN HUNGARY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I'M PARAPHRASING. AND THAT GIVES YOU, YOU KNOW WHERE THE SORT OF THE WEIGHT OF THESE NEW MOVEMENTS IS. LOOK AT GEORGIA MALONEY, WHO'S YOU KNOW, HER BATTLE CRY WAS I'M AN ITALIAN, I'M A CHRISTIAN I'M A MOTHER, AS OPPOSED TO, IN A SENSE, BEING A EUROPEAN BEING, YOU KNOW, SECULAR AND BEING, YOU KNOW, NOT REGARDING HER GENDER IS IMPORTANT AND NOT REGARDING THE MATERNAL ROLE AS IMPORTANT. SO THAT'S THE NEW DIVIDE. IT'S BETWEEN A KIND OF TRADITIONALIST, CULTURAL CONSERVATISM, AND WHAT PEOPLE WOULD DESCRIBE AS, YOU KNOW SECULAR COSMOPOLITANISM. AND THAT IS THE BIGGEST DIVIDE IN AMERICA TODAY. SO IF YOU ASK YOURSELF, WHAT IS THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR OF YOUR VOTING PATTERNS IN AMERICA TODAY? IT IS, DO YOU HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE? THE SECOND STRONGEST IS, DO YOU LIVE IN A RURAL OR AN URBAN AREA? AND THE THIRD STRONGEST IS, DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD? DO YOU BELIEVE IN ORGANIZED RELIGION? SO IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'VE STACKED AMERICA. ON THE ONE SIDE, YOU HAVE SECULAR, LIBERAL, EDUCATED URBAN TYPES. AND YOU HAVE, ON THE OTHER SIDE RURAL, LESS EDUCATED, OFTEN MORE WHITE, LESS MULTICULTURAL TYPES YOU KNOW? SO IT'S ALMOST A CLASS CULTURE DIVISION, AS MUCH AS IT IS A DIVISION ABOUT POLITICAL IDEOLOGY. &gt;&gt; STEVE: I NEVER UNDERSTOOD AND MAYBE YOU COULD HELP ME FIGURE THIS OUT, I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY THIS CLEAVAGE IS SO SEVERE. BECAUSE CLEARLY, PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN CITIES LIKE TO GET OUT TO THE COUNTRY, FOR EXAMPLE, TO GO IF THEY HAVE A COTTAGE, OR GO VISIT FRIENDS AT COTTAGES, OR WHATEVER. AND PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN RURAL PARTS OF CANADA OR AMERICA, OF COURSE, COME TO THE BIG CITY ALL THE TIME TO SEE SPORTING EVENTS THEATRE, WHATEVER. SO WHY DOES THIS CLEAVAGE SEEM TO BE SO IMPENETRABLE? &gt;&gt; FAREED: BECAUSE I THINK IT REFLECTS, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT KIND OF MODERN CLASS LINES. WE DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT CLASS IN NORTH AMERICA. BUT THERE ARE CLASS MARKERS. SOMEBODY ONCE DID SOME POLLING COMPANY, AN ANALYSIS OF WHETHER YOU COULD PREDICT VOTING PATTERNS BASED ON HOW CLOSE YOU LIVED TO EITHER A STARBUCKS ON ONE SIDE OR AN ARBY'S ON THE OTHER. AND IT TURNED OUT THERE WAS A VERY STRONG CORRELATION. SO IN A SENSE, WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS THESE CLASS MARKERS WITH HOW PEOPLE LIVE, HOW THEY THINK OF THE WORLD. AND I THINK, TO YOUR POINT MAYBE CULTURE IS HARDER TO COMPROMISE ON. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE OLD DIVIDES OF ECONOMICS, THE LEFT WANTED TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY. THE RIGHT DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY. THERE'S A WAY TO COMPROMISE. THE LEFT WANTS TO SPEND $100 BILLION. THE RIGHT WANTS TO SPEND ZERO. WELL, THERE'S A NUMBER BETWEEN THE TWO. WHAT IS THE NUMBER, THE COMPROMISE NUMBER, FOR SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES PASSIONATELY IN GAY RIGHTS AND GAY MARRIAGE AND SOMEBODY ELSE WHO THINKS IT'S IMMORAL AND AGAINST THE WORD OF GOD? WHAT IS THE COMPROMISE ON ABORTION? WHAT IS THE COMPROMISE ON NATIONAL IDENTITY? THESE ARE THE PROBLEMS, I THINK THAT ARE LESS AMENABLE TO A KIND OF SPLIT-THE-DIFFERENCE ATTITUDE THAT CHARACTERIZED SO MUCH OF OUR ECONOMIC POLITICAL IDEOLOGY. &gt;&gt; STEVE: LET'S REMIND EVERYBODY, YOUR BOOK IS CALLED AGE OF REVOLUTIONS, PROGRESS AND BACKLASH, FROM 1600 TO THE PRESENT. AND WE ARE DELIGHTED THAT IT HAS BROUGHT FAREED ZAKARIA TO OUR PROGRAM ONE MORE TIME. ALL GOOD WISHES, FAREED, AND THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME. &gt;&gt; FAREED: THANK YOU, AND JUST LET ME SAY, THIS IS A TERRIFIC PROGRAM, AND YOU'VE DONE SUCH AN AMAZING JOB. MORE POWER TO YOU, AND I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST IN YOUR NEXT ADVENTURES. &gt;&gt; STEVE: VERY KIND OF YOU TO SAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="public support for Israel in European countries has fallen to its lowest level on record that's according to a new Yuggov poll when asked about Israel's actions in Gaza more than half of all those surveyed said they were not justified with less than a quarter believing Israel was in the right and regarding who they sided with more than double those surveyed in the UK and Spain said they sympathized more with Palestinians than Israelis now last month the UK Canada and France released a joint statement condemning the starvation of Palestinians in Gaza under a three-month blockade on international aid they also vowed concrete action if Israel didn't reverse course the UK followed it by summoning the Israeli ambassador and suspending free trade talks in a week's time from now France will co-chair a UN conference with Saudi Arabia calling for recognition of a Palestinian state which could grant the Palestinians greater legitimacy at the UN and the ability to take Israel to international court on their own behalf france's President Manuel Macron has reportedly also been lobbying other countries to step up and recognize Palestine calling it a moral duty and a political necessity if we abandon Gaza if we consider there is a free path for Israel even if we do condemn the terrorist attacks we kill our own credibility in the rest of the world and this is why we do reject double standards and this is why I think it's very important in our current environment to be consistent and to follow our principles our rules and to consider that what is at stake is clearly the global order and what is at stake is our credibility to protect this global order now all of this has had little impact on the Netanyahu government which continues to expand its military occupation of Gaza displacing the majority of its population and depriving them of aid netanyahu himself struck back angrily at Macron saying that Israel will not stop and will not surrender but is rising diplomatic pressure on Israel changing how Israelis themselves see the ongoing genocide in Gaza to tell us more we're joined now by Israeli academic and philosopher Annette Matar annette thank you so much for being with us yes I think but not for the whole population i mean we we've seen recently it started a while after Israel resumed its war or whatever is genocide actually it's not a war um in in March uh 18th but it took some time until that sank uh and then liberal liberal in intellectuals um people who were protesting against Netanyahu throughout the last years realized that I think the West started to to to be annoyed and I think they somehow maneuvered their way out of the the the indifferent or whatever position that they held before it could have been indifferent it could have been supportive of the war and we're talking about different studies it's a very very long uh period that we're talking about so what was true for October November December 23 was no longer true for some of those people at the end of 24 say uh but uh but since March and especially since we've heard exactly what you said I mean the the this appro um by the allies I mean people they think themselves as part of I mean they these intellectuals they see themselves as part of the intellectual or liberal uh left and and or or the west and and now I think they're finding their alongside that so you you see much more protests against the war they still call it the war by the way um so much more protests even in my university and other universities somehow things things were shaken up and and we've been protesting since I think October and and only very recently other people joined which I find really it's it's good that it happened it's not good that it happened so late but it's good that it's happening i want to dig a little more into this because when you listen to the statements coming from Israeli officials whether the Netanyahu government or whether at the United Nations you get this recurring theme that the entire world is against Israel unfairly the United Nations itself is against Israel European leaders are targeting Israel unfairly that there is this double standard that Israel is being held to internationally do you think Israelis themselves when they hear this criticism coming from overseas are they following this line that their government is is holding or or do they believe this criticism to be legitimate again I think that the Israeli population is split almost half and half if you if you ignore the the my margin which is not part of any half but uh but let's forget about that so the Jewish majority I think is divided more or less u for in two halves and one half will go after Netanya whatever he says and and and they are still supporting of whatever remains of that war and and they even don't really care even if they say uh that they do about the hostages uh they're saying yeah we want them free but not at the expense of the holy war so so yeah that these people will buy whatever whatever slogan uh and for them Israel is the eternal victim and that's it and nothing will change there the other population is the one I mean in in in degradations but but uh but I think that the other population starts realizing that maybe in this case we're not the sole victim last month when Israel began allowing a trickle of aid into Gaza under the controversial Gaza found humanitarian foundation Netanyahu had to justify it to his own public saying that this is going to shield Israel from pressure that it was under from its allies and allow it to continue the war what kind of pressure do you think Israel is feeling in in real terms from its allies right now i I really don't think it's feeling any pressure i must say I don't buy this uh because there is no pressure when when you you look at the ground israel has a total impunity and we've seen that all along and we've seen that since October 23 of course but we also have seen this after March i mean when Israel Israel really explicitly breached the agreement it was signed on so I mean that it cannot be denied uh and still they they they are accusing anyone else who doesn't agree with them and no and I don't see any uproar not in England not in yes we've seen Macron and we we we've seen Starmer and we've seen Lami in England and you know and we've seen the in Canada and nowhere in other places but where are the real sanctions where is something that is go that goes beyond words so they're contemplating of you know putting aside an agreement and you know they're contemplating some symbolic steps but I don't see the the the real payment now many and it is my own conviction that until until a real payment will come nothing will happen now you mentioned sanctions there you have been one of those voices at the forefront of calling for sanctions against Israel why do you hold this position because I don't think anything else will change the the the situation here i really don't think anything else i'm not sure this will help by the way because of course there may be the the the knee-jerk reaction that you know oh they they sanction us we hate them even more and they're anti-semite and whatever so that it may be the case but any other option was already tried not reproaches articles in the papers uh you know expositions in the New York Times well new discoveries in the Guardian whatever i mean but nothing really changed you talked uh before about that sliver that you consider yourself a part of in Israeli society what does it mean for someone like you to say something like this publicly in Israel given describing the public mood that you are saying describing these two groups that are you know one they're both essentially against the war but on different levels what does it mean for somebody to call for sanctions against their own country given this climate yeah well it's not easy but I've been used to it for years so so just that the the last couple of years were particularly heavy but and they were heavy they are heavy um and still you know we have hostages in both sides and prisoners in both sides in terrible conditions in both sides and and I care about both sides um and I've been involved for years in committees for the Palestinian prisoners and I know what the situation in prison in the Israeli prison is so you know I worry uh it's not an easy period for me to to to live in Israel or anywhere because I I I don't think I would change anything if I was abroad uh but I have my circle of friends and and comrades and we we've been protesting together from you know very early on we've known each other for many years that that helps that helps m and I mean what do you take uh a hope in and where do you find strength to continue carving this very lonely path that that you're on well I don't see any hope at the moment i hope I hope I'm mistaken about hope but u but the strength well I've got it and um I think many because of my experience many because of the so many years that I've been active it you know it gives it gives you some energy to to keep going and as I said I mean there is this cluster of friends and and and comrades that you know we hold each other together now Today there was this explosive story that we saw about the Israeli government all but confirming that it has been arming gangs inside of Gaza affiliated some of its members with ISIS what do you make of the story i'm sure it's true i'm sure it's true because first of all be not not because of Fleerman or other people i don't I don't buy the the what what they're saying but it was covered in which is a reliable source and I I I know that when they say they have reliable source sources then they do but I also remember it from months ago i remember people I've I've been in touch with in Gaza directly uh telling me that you know that Israel disrupts the the ordinary um functioning of of the aid delivery and then that it supports the gangs and that was months ago i can't recall now but it was months ago and it came from you know many many people just you know I know or friends know so it was in the background already then but then now you have you have names you have faces you have pictures you have Tik Toks so and yeah I'm sure this is true and it's actually very typical when you think about Israel's behavior all along why not it's so obvious that this would be the the road it does betray a kind of cynical thinking when it comes to the way that uh the government chooses to pursue uh a military um it's the the way that it chooses allies in a place like Gaza um the way that it would arm one faction to go after another it is quite a far cry from the uh refrain that you hear from a lot of Israeli spokespeople about the IDF being the most moral army in the world and and and things of that nature uh I mean how do you think the Israeli public the ones that you say are are following Netanyahu blindly wherever he goes how do they justify for themselves some of these tactics that might be difficult to hear about well I don't know about them really because I cannot fathom what of Netanyahu really thinks because we know Netanyahu they may say that yes we're against Hamas and anything that can be bring down H kamas is in our side but this is what they said you know when they supported kamas years ago so you know this what I'm saying that this is not the first time it's not a surprise that Israel behaves like that so if they if they feel okay with all of Israel's history then they would feel okay now if they don't then okay they will be critical and I'm sure here we we will hear from that liberal part that I was mentioning in the beginning you know I'm sure that we will hear critical voices you know ex generals and all those people who just came to realize that the war is no longer u profitable was something they they will criticize I'm sure they will and finally and many Israeli voices that we have spoken to have said that the only pressure that only the pressure from the United States can have any influence on what Israel doesn't do and we saw the US's position quite clearly again yesterday at the UN when they vetoed a call for a ceasefire that all the other members on the security council supported without the US changing its position if that doesn't happen on the horizon what do you think the international community can do is there anything that they can do i I'm sure they can do a lot if they detach themselves from from mommy you know from from from the US i mean Europe is quite powerful i mean if they gather together and add this to to United Kingdom as well this is this is a strong power uh and actually when when uh when Trump announces announced his tariffs then you saw them you know uniting and and and and and you know talking against it and at least giving uh a sort of image of firm position and then he retracted a little bit so they can do this in relation to Gaza they simply don't" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="♪ (&quot;LAST WEEK TONIGHT&quot; THEME MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ We're going to dive straight in with our main story tonight, which concerns immigrants. Once again, named Group of the Year by Right-Wing Scapegoat Magazine. While campaigning, Trump promised a draconian crackdown on migrants, and his administration has since made a big show out of following through on that, from inviting Dr. Phil on a ride along with ICE to nauseating social media posts like this one, titled, &quot;ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight,&quot; featuring sounds of manacles and handcuffs, and this one, which is somehow in even worse taste. ♪ Closing time ♪ ♪ You don't have to go home But you can't stay here ♪ ♪ I know who I want To take me home ♪ That is real. They used &quot;Closing Time&quot; by Semisonic, which obviously isn't the right song choice. The right song choice would be no song at all, because deportation Instagram reel is a combination of words that should never exist, like &quot;Oscar winner Mr. Beast,&quot; or &quot;Stephen Miller nudes,&quot; or &quot;Bill Belichick speaks about his relationship -with 24-year-old girlfriend.&quot; -(AUDIENCE GROANS) Now, Semisonic denounced that video, saying, &quot;We did not authorize or condone the White House's use of our song in any way. The song is about joy and possibilities and hope, and they have missed the point entirely.&quot; And of course they have, because according to the band's drummer, the song's about the &quot;anticipation of fatherhood, a song about being sent forth from the womb as if by a bouncer clearing out a bar.&quot; And obviously it is. We all knew that and got it from the lyrics. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) It's closing time. You're a baby. Get out of that uterus and finish your whiskey and beer. You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here. It seems every day brings terrible news concerning deportation policy, some of which has been so surreal, local news has had to run fact checks on it, like in this sponsored segment. ANNOUNCER: Tonight's &quot;Fact or Fiction&quot; is brought to you by America's Finest Carpet. Tonight, we're looking into a comment allegedly made by the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A story that you may have seen today claims acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said that he would like the agency to be run like Amazon Prime for human beings. And this is true. Yeah, it is true. And spare a quick thought for that station and its sponsor, America's Finest Carpet. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Because verifying ICE's director wanted to expel humans with the speed of a pack of emergency tampons on same-day delivery clearly isn't what their &quot;Fact or Fiction&quot; segment is for. It's for getting to the bottom of actual questions that they've answered like, &quot;Sharks test positive for cocaine?&quot; &quot;Woman arrested for cinnamon roll attack?&quot; and &quot;Ford creates 'very gay' raptor?&quot; Which you'll be pleased to know was very much fact. But the intention behind that Amazon Prime idea gets to something important here. For all this administration's talk of prioritizing hardened criminals, in practice, it seemed to value speed, volume, and spectacle over all else. Perhaps best summed up by the fact, at a rally on Tuesday, Trump directed the audience's attention to a grotesque video of men getting deported to a Salvadoran prison, being marched off an airplane, and having their heads shaved. Prefacing it by telling the cheering crowd those men were &quot;the worst of the worst.&quot; Despite the fact, when 60 Minutes looked into it, they couldn't find criminal records for 75 percent of the men on those flights. And Trump's own administration has conceded that at least one man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was sent there due to an administrative error. For weeks now, it has been scrambling to come up with reasons why it was okay to send that man to a foreign prison, which has been hard for them to do given that he had a court order protecting him from deportation to El Salvador and no criminal record. At one point, Trump posted a photo of himself holding an image that had been circulating online of Abrego Garcia's hand with labels added, suggesting the tattoos on his knuckles were somehow secret code spelling out MS-13. Multiple gang experts have disputed that, pointing out MS-13 tattoos tend to feature things like the letters &quot;M&quot; and &quot;S&quot; and the numbers &quot;1&quot; and &quot;3.&quot; But in an interview on Tuesday, Trump not only defended posting that image, he argued that the letters and numbers that had clearly been superimposed were actually tattooed on his hand, and he refused to let go of that idea for an agonizingly long time. And while you may have seen small clips of this exchange, it is worth watching the full 90 seconds, because it is absolutely incredible. The man that you picked out, he said he wasn't a member of a gang, and then they looked, and on his knuckles he had &quot;MS-13.&quot; -There's a dispute over that. -Wait a minute, wait a minute. He had &quot;MS-13&quot; on his knuckles, tattooed. He had some tattoos that are interpreted that way. -But let's move on. -Wait a minute. Hey, Terry, Terry, Terry. He did not have the letter &quot;MS-13.&quot; -It says &quot;MS-13.&quot; -That was Photoshopped. -So let me just-- -That was Photoshopped? Terry, you can't do that. Hey, they're giving you the big break of a lifetime. You know, you're doing the interview. I picked you because, frankly, I never heard of you, but that's okay. I picked you. Terry, but you're not being very nice. He had &quot;MS-13&quot; tattooed. TERRY MORAN: We'll agree to disagree. I want to move on to something else. Do you want me to show you the picture? TERRY: I saw the picture. Oh, and you think it was Photoshopped? -Well... -TERRY: Here we go. Don't Photoshop it. Go look at his hand. He had &quot;MS-13.&quot; He did have tattoos that can be interpreted that way. I'm not an expert on them. I want to turn to Ukraine. No, no. Terry, Terry. No, no. No, no. He had &quot;MS,&quot; as clear as you can be, not interpreted. This is why people no longer believe the news, because it's fake news. When he was photographed in El Salvador, they aren't there. But let's just go on. They aren't there when he's in El Salvador. Oh, they weren't there, but they're there now, right? -No. -But they're there now. -They're in your picture. -Terry. Ukraine, sir. He's got &quot;MS-13&quot; on his knuckles. Okay? We'll take a look at that. It's such a disservice. TERRY: We'll take a look at that, sir. Why don't you just say, &quot;Yes, he does,&quot; and, you know, go on to something else. It's contested. Terry! Terry! Terry! You're in hell, Terry! (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Terry, this is hell right now. I'm genuinely shocked Trump doesn't drink alcohol because that is the most &quot;drunk at an IHOP&quot; conversation I think I've ever heard. And no disrespect to Terry, but maybe don't move on from that. I know you've got other questions to get to, but if the president of the United States is trying to tell you that this amateur hour Photoshop is real, let him go get the picture and make him say it again. Point to that Helvetica-looking &quot;M&quot; and make the president say, &quot;Yes, I believe that artless 'M,' that's weirdly clearer and darker than all the other tattoos, is real.&quot; Make him say, &quot;I believe that man went to a tattoo parlor and said, 'The skull's pretty spooky, but what I'd really like is a neatly aligned '3' directly on the bone of my knuckle, and can you please make it so that it doesn't stretch or bend with the natural curves of the human hand, and also make it look like a typewriter did it?'&quot; Because, Terry, sometimes... when Trump's doing his normal racist blue-skying, you do need to cut him off to slow the flow of hatred into the world. But if he wants to tell America that this laughably doctored picture is evidence of a major threat to American safety, you have an obligation to let the man cook. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS, CHEERS) And for what it's worth... if Trump's going to hash out those claims, he probably should be doing that in court, not on TV, and after he's already shipped someone off to a foreign prison. But Abrego Garcia is just one of many horrifying stories surrounding immigration right now, from tourists being detained for weeks, to US citizens being caught up in ICE dragnets, to videos like this. ALYSHA PALUMBO: You can see an agent using a large hammer to break the back passenger window of their car. Marilu said the agents were focused on her husband, Juan, but kept calling him Antonio. That's the name of another man who lives in their building. Thinking this is a case of mistaken identity, Juan called his attorney, who told him to stay in the car until she got there. But instead of waiting for their lawyer, the agent smashed the car window, broke into the vehicle, and dragged the couple out. MARILU: They had no reason to detain him. We've been following the rules of this country. We are doing things the right way. That's why we have a lawyer. Right. They're trying to do things the right way. We have an asylum process in place. And while it is not perfect, I don't think a key step in it is &quot;guy smashes your car with a hammer while screaming someone else's name at you.&quot; But that's just the tip of the iceberg here. So, given that, tonight, let's look at Trump and deportations, the aggression of his administration's crackdowns, its blatant contempt for the law, and where this could be heading. Let's start with the fact Trump's off to a much quicker start than last time around. In its first 100 days, this administration has taken 181 immigration-specific executive actions, a six-fold increase over that same period in Trump's first term. And that is deliberate. As the head of one anti-immigration group that advised the White House has put it, the plan has been to &quot;do everything, all at once, everywhere.&quot; Which sounds less like rational government policy and more like a knock-off DVD sold on the subway. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And to do that, they've employed a wide variety of tactics. Sometimes they've gotten creative by looking through old statutes for cheat codes to expedite deportations. We've talked before about how they've tried using an obscure provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act to remove people if the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe their presence here would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences. That is the reason they gave for arresting students like Mahmoud Khalil. And while that was clearly a targeted attempt to frighten students out of voicing solidarity with Palestine, they've also taken much broader swings using a federal database that tracks even the slightest interactions with law enforcement to revoke visas and put thousands of international students in jeopardy. And some of the cases have been truly absurd, like this grad student who was suddenly told he had 15 days to leave the country. PATRICK TERPSTRA: Suguru Onda, getting a PhD at Brigham Young University in Utah, had his legal status in the US suddenly revoked after a criminal records check. But Onda, from Japan, had no criminal charges on his record, just two speeding tickets and a citation for catching &quot;one too many fish,&quot; his attorney says. That is ridiculous. If you can be flagged for deportation for catching &quot;one too many fish,&quot; then I truly fear for Henry Winkler. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) We could be just days away from seeing him -in an El Salvador prison. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Which I'm sure the White House will then justify by badly photoshopping an &quot;MS-13&quot; tattoo onto his neck. And while they later reversed that specific decision, this all feels like the inevitable result of a campaign that fearmongered about an epidemic of so-called &quot;migrant crime,&quot; which, as we've discussed before, was wildly overblown. But having promised mass deportations and even printed signs for people to wave around demanding them, they're now scrambling to deliver. While the administration denies it, ICE officials have reportedly been told to aggressively ramp up the number of people they arrest, from a few hundred per day to at least 12 to 1,500, with the idea being each of the agency's field offices should make 75 arrests per day. And for all of this administration's promises of a &quot;worst-first&quot; strategy, where they focus on those with criminal histories, as a former director of ICE pointed out three months ago, that was always unlikely to last. REPORTER: Sarah Saldaña believes if arrest numbers don't increase as rapidly as the administration hopes, it might abandon the worst-first strategy and begin targeting community locations like day labor sites. SARAH SALDAÑA: That is really a big concern of mine, because that's not, again, a stretch, to think that that might happen next. If the numbers are not coming through, let's get the low-hanging fruit. Right. And you should avoid low-hanging fruit. I tried to do that. If I were to constantly go for low-hanging fruit, I'd say that &quot;worst-first&quot; doesn't describe Trump's immigration policy so much as it describes his children. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -But again, I've avoided saying that because I have standards, so I won't do it. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) And the administration now seems desperate to scoop anyone up. Police in places like Upstate New York have been stopping Hispanic drivers for minor traffic violations, and if they're undocumented, handing them over to Border Patrol agents. Also, at one point, tens of thousands of people received emails explicitly telling them to please leave the United States immediately. Some of those were sent by mistake to American citizens, while others went to migrants with a legal right to be here. The fact is, what the administration is doing is sometimes targeted, sometimes arbitrary, usually blatantly racist, and always cruel, and sometimes breathtakingly so. REPORTER 2: Tonight, the administration is facing criticism from migrant advocates over the removal of two American citizen children of an undocumented woman from Honduras, including her four-year-old son. A migrant rights group says he was sent to Honduras without his medication for stage 4 cancer. How is going after families with young kids targeting the worst of the worst? First of all, we said we were going to prioritize the worst of the worst. You feel like that's what you're doing? Absolutely. But when you prioritize something, it doesn't mean you forget about everybody else. I said from day one, if you're in the country illegally, you're not off the table. Okay, first, Tom Homan can truly rot in hell. -(AUDIENCE CHEERS) -Though I'd expect nothing less from a man who clearly answers the question, what would Shrek look like as a white ogre? (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And while the government insists that woman &quot;chose&quot; to have her son deported with her, her lawyers insist that was not, in fact, the case. And either way, between the government putting that kid on a plane without his medication and the cuts to research at the NIH, it seems this administration's actively coming out pro-pediatric cancer. I feel there's a non-zero chance Trump's about to add a fucking brain tumor to his cabinet and then presumably RFK's either going to eat it or point at it and say, &quot;It's from Wi-Fi.&quot; But one of the boldest moves they've made to circumvent due process is invoking what's called the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that &quot;allows the president to detain or deport non-citizens without a hearing and based only on their country of birth or citizenship, if he decides that an invasion or predatory incursion by that country is underway.&quot; It was famously used to justify the internment of Japanese, Italian, and German immigrants in World War II, but Trump has now invoked it again, saying, &quot;It lets us do a lot of the things we wouldn't be able to do.&quot; He's issued an absurd proclamation, declaring a Venezuelan gang called Tren de Aragua, or TDA, has invaded the United States. And he's used that as a pretext to sweep people up in raids, label them as gang members, and deport them. Some have been shipped off to CECOT, a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador. And if you've only seen it in Trump's propaganda videos or in Kristi Noem's grotesque photo-op, it is worth knowing just how grim it is in there. DAVID CULVER: Inmates are assigned to one of eight sectors, each roughly the size of an airplane hangar, basically prisons within the prison. Once inside, it's said to be a life sentence. They'll never leave their assigned sector. Each sector holds more than two dozen large cells, roughly 80 inmates per cell, but that can fluctuate. Inside each cell, toilets, a concrete basin for bathing, and a barrel of drinking water, several rows of metal bunk beds. No mattresses, no sheets, no privacy. Yeah, it is awful in there. The Salvadoran Justice and Security Minister has even bragged that &quot;no one who enters the CECOT will ever walk out. They will only be able to leave in a coffin.&quot; And, &quot;You'll only be able to leave in a coffin,&quot; is a horrifying statement no matter where it is. Even if it was on a sign outside a literal coffin dealership... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...it'd be a bit much. I get you're just trying to make a sale, but come on, tone it down. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And look, sending anyone there is unforgivable, whatever they're accused of. But it's worth noting, we've not only done it without due process, in many cases, we've done it without cause. Remember, on those first plane loads, three-quarters of the people had no discernible criminal record. And while Tom Homan has insisted that that doesn't mean anything because &quot;a lot of gang members don't have criminal histories,&quot; you clearly shouldn't be sending people to a Central American forever dungeon just on vibes. And the government's evidence in some of these cases is just absurdly weak. Take Andry Hernandez Romero, a Venezuelan stylist who was in the middle of seeking asylum in the US to escape persecution for his political views and the fact that he's gay. Time magazine photographed him having his head shaved upon arrival at CECOT, with the photographer saying he was &quot;crying for his mother.&quot; And as his lawyer points out, the evidence the government's shown to justify that is ridiculous. CECILIA VEGA: In Andry's case, the only evidence the government presented in immigration court were these pictures of his tattoos. Crowns, which immigration authorities say can be a symbol of Tren de Aragua. LINDSAY TOCZYLOWSKI: The crowns themself were on top of the names of his parents. The most plausible explanation for that are that his mom and dad are his king and queen. CECILIA: A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said on social media that its intelligence assessments go well beyond just gang affiliate tattoos. She said Andry's own social media indicates he is a member of Tren de Aragua. We went back a decade and could only find photos like these. That is utterly infuriating. That is your evidence? What about this man screams violent gang member? The only thing I'm actually confident he's a genuine threat to is unaccented cheekbones. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -And for what it's worth, there are no tattoos that denote membership to TDA. An expert who wrote the book on them has said Venezuelan gangs are not identified by tattoos. But apparently the Trump administration's been relying on an Alien Enemy Validation Guide, specifically its scoring system, under which eight points are required for any individual to be identified as a member of Tren de Aragua. But that is not a high bar, as you can get four points simply for having tattoos denoting membership or loyalty to TDA, which, again, is not a thing, and four points if you display logos or dress known to indicate allegiance to TDA, which can be as simple as being dressed in high-end urban streetwear, especially basketball jerseys from the Chicago Bulls. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But that is clearly bullshit, because if that is all it takes, then 75 percent of the city of Chicago are TDA from October to April. And somehow, it gets even dumber. CECILIA: Tattoos and social media were also used to link another Venezuelan migrant, Jerce Reyes Barrios, to the Tren de Aragua gang. Immigration court documents include this Facebook post from 14 years ago, showing him flashing what officers said was a gang sign. His girlfriend told us it was all about rock and roll. Immigration agents also flagged Jerce's crown tattoo as a gang symbol, but they did not mention the crown is above a soccer ball. Jerce was a soccer player in Venezuela. His lawyer says the tattoo honors his favorite team, Real Madrid. That is pathetic. And as for this picture of Jerce supposedly throwing up gang signs, if that were true, Rihanna, Fergie, and Former President George W. Bush are all Tren de Aragua too. (AUDIENCE CHEERS, APPLAUDS) But when confronted on this in court, the government's been completely unrepentant. Early on, they violated a judge's orders to turn around planes carrying deportees to El Salvador. And even after the Supreme Court explicitly directed they facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody there, they've chosen to dick around about the exact meaning of the word &quot;facilitate.&quot; As for Trump, when he was pressed on whether the people he sent to El Salvador deserved any sort of due process, he said this. You know, we have thousands of people that are ready to go out. And you can't have a trial for all of these people. And a judge can't say, &quot;No, you have to have a trial.&quot; The trial is going to take two years. And we're going to have a very dangerous country if we're not allowed to do what we're entitled to do. But that's not how anything works. You can't just opt out of due process because it's inconvenient. It's why court orders don't tend to end with, &quot;If not, no worries! You do you!&quot; (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And the thing is, this could all get worse, because while thankfully the courts have tried to curb Trump's use of these two acts, they've also seemed to sign off on a new diabolical strategy the administration's been using, involving a decades-old legal provision called &quot;registration of aliens.&quot; It allows the administration to require undocumented people register with the government and carry proof of that registration. And it is clearly a trap. Because if you register and give the government all your information, you become an easy target. But if you don't, or are caught not carrying proof, you can be charged with a federal misdemeanor, allowing them to label you a criminal and putting you at risk of deportation. And this is already happening. People have been charged in Texas and Arizona using this mechanism. Basically, they can't find enough criminals to deport, so they found a way to turn more people into criminals so that they suddenly can. It's a desperate but depressingly effective move. And that's not even getting into the other plans that they've teased, from Marco Rubio saying, &quot;We are actively searching for other countries to take people,&quot; to the administration floating the idea of labeling suspected gang members as &quot;enemy combatants.&quot; They've also tried to stop anyone who stands in their way. Just last week, they arrested a judge in Wisconsin for supposedly helping an immigrant evade ICE. -(AUDIENCE BOOS) -And on Thursday, ICE made a big production out of serving a search warrant as part of an investigation into these flyers that were posted months ago with information about ICE agents on them. They even released dramatic footage of them rolling up to the house of their target's parents, who were understandably pretty surprised. REPORTER 3: Drone video this morning shows ICE agents moving into an Irvine neighborhood. Annie Yang and YuZong Chang are still in shock after being woken up by Homeland Security investigators. NEIGHBOR: Woke up to this this morning. REPORTER 3: Neighbors captured the scene outside their home. They described hearing, &quot;We have a warrant, come out with your hands up,&quot; over a loudspeaker. Never happened to us before. I feel like I was in a movie set or something. I mean, it was so unreal. Yeah, I'm afraid this is real life though. Seventeen vehicles with armed agents did a Zero Dark Thirty on a lovable, middle-aged couple, looking for a guy who'd put up flyers warning about ICE overreach. Fun fact, guess who was on site for that raid? The ICE acting director who said the Amazon Prime thing. Guess who wasn't there? The guy they were looking for, as he apparently &quot;moved to New York last month.&quot; A mistake, for the record, that Amazon would not make. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And while that's almost laughably absurd, it's also obviously scary and extremely dangerous. And it kind of gets to the heart of all of this, which is Trump loudly selling his supporters the lie that he'll protect them from existential threats, only to further government overreach and state violence, even while deporting makeup artists, unlucky soccer fans, and four-year-olds with cancer. So, what can we do? Well, some of this depends on elected leaders. And to their credit, a number of prominent Democrats have gone to El Salvador to call attention to this, which is definitely preferable to the approach that others have taken, with some anonymous House Democrats quoted as saying, &quot;Should it be the big issue for Democrats? Probably not.&quot; And complaining, &quot;Rather than talking about the tariff policy and the economy, we're going to go take the bait for one hairdresser,&quot; which is absolutely enraging, especially as many voters do seem to get the clear problem with deporting people without due process to a prison for life, even in red states. Here's Chuck Grassley being confronted at a town hall in Iowa. -Exactly! Exactly! -(AUDIENCE CHEERS) -That man... -(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) ...who definitely owes a real 1,200-dollar ticket... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...is right on the nose there. The president is clearly not following the law as he is required to. And look, if your elected officials aren't holding town halls, you can still tell them you care about this issue. Call them and say if they believe in due process, they should work to repeal the Alien Enemies Act and amend the part of section 237 of the INA that lets Marco Rubio decide whose free speech is a threat. But in the meantime, we're going to need to help immigrants defend themselves. Remember, those in the immigration court are not guaranteed a lawyer. And if they don't have one, their chances are basically zero. So if you can, it is worth supporting nonprofits like these that provide legal services for immigrants or local ones in your community. And this is an issue where I do think there is a practical value to public protest, because this is going to be in the courts. And those inside them need to be made aware of public opinion on this. Because it can make a difference. Former Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist once wrote that &quot;no honorable judge would ever cast his vote because he thought the majority of the public wanted him to vote that way.&quot; But that in certain cases, &quot;judges are undeniably influenced by the great tides of public opinion.&quot; And I would argue the moment we're in right now isn't just worthy . of a great tide, it is worthy of a fucking tsunami. Because this is an absolute outrage. (AUDIENCE CHEERS, APPLAUDS) And it is one where it is important to remind our elected leaders that all people are worthy of safety, protection, and due process. Because that is indisputably, in the words of this country's single weirdest carpet-sponsored local news segment, -a fucking fact. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Hello, I'm Lucy Hockings from the BBC World Service. This is The Global Story. Today: Are teens in Australia about to get kicked off social media? Parents across the world know this predicament. Social media networks can be a huge part of teenage life. A place to speak to friends and join communities. But it's also a place where harmful content can repeatedly impact young people. So how can we keep our teens safe on these platforms? In today's episode, Australia wants to ban teens under the age of 16 from using social media networks. But will it work? With me today is the BBC's cyber correspondent Joe Tidy and our Australia correspondent joining us from Sydney, Katy Watson. Hi to you both. Hi! Joe, I think because I have teenagers that social media is a bit like a runaway train in a land I've never been to, and I just really want the train to pull over and give me a bit of a break. It is a constant topic of conversation, and in my house. Is that because the kids want to be on there all the time? They're saying, give me my phone late at night and that kind of thing? The kids want to be on there all the time. That is where they're talking to their friends. That's where they're making plans, making arrangements, everything from a sports practice to meeting up, you know, to socialising. It's all happening on social media. It's no surprise, though, is it, because these platforms have become the biggest companies in the world because of how successful they are. They know how to keep us on the platform. They've got very, very specific and very sophisticated algorithms that know that if you dwell on a picture oh, you might like that kind of content, let's give you more of that. They know that, for example, when you get a like, it feels good, or when you get a message, it makes you feel loved. So it's no surprise, is it, that young people, even more so than us, are addicted to social media. And what about your kids, Katy? They're a bit smaller, but has it made you think about what you're going to do about social media as they grow up? I think I'm in the privileged situation of watching everybody with slightly older kids. My eldest is eight and so I can see everybody else who've got, you know, early teens panicking and I can take a view or certainly start debating and discussing it with my partner, I think. Uh, no, none of them are on social media. They sometimes look at what I do. Um, but really, um, I'm in a probably a good place right now to kind of... But I've got to make decisions and I've got to have that kind of authority of what my plan is. And at the moment, I'm still formulating that one. Have you formulated a strategy with yours, Joe? They're small too. Yeah. My eldest is ten today. I've got two others who are younger, so I'm in the same position, really. I'm waiting to have those conversations. Luckily, they're not happening yet, and my boy is obsessed with football and likes to be outside and loves gaming. I have to restrict the gaming, but phones, social media? I'm not there yet. So any advice from you would be great! Okay, I've got lots of it! But let's have a look at what Australia is proposing. This is about protecting young people, not punishing or isolating them, and letting parents know we're in their corner when it comes to supporting their children's health and wellbeing. That's Australia's communications minister, Michelle Rowland. She says the ban, it's going to cover platforms like TikTok, X, Facebook and Instagram. Not that many teens are actually on Facebook, I have to say, but it's about protecting young people from the harms of social media. Katy, tell us a little bit more about what the Australian government is saying and what they're planning. This has made huge waves in Australia because of the age 16, you know, that was a seen as a high age, a big discussion about whether, you know, that was even going to be feasible. And what the main thing is, is that parents aren't going to be penalised. Neither are any teens who slip through the net and get social media accounts. But effectively there will be no exceptions. Not even if parents agree and say that they want their kids, they're okay with their kids having a social media, um, social media account, that they can't do that. But the onus will be on the companies and the platforms to come up with ways of making sure that those under 16s are kept safe. And this is the thing. At the moment, it is a legal framework. So, you know, the legislation is passing, but it's not clear exactly how it's going to be implemented. And it will still have a year from the legislation passing to coming up with a solution on how it's going to work. And a year at least. That can be negotiated. So it's a big process, and there's lots and lots of question marks about how it's going to work in practice. How it's going to work was the big question I had when I heard about it, because keeping your kid off social media, if they really want to be on there, aside from actually taking the device away from them, could prove almost impossible. Has the government got some suggestions about how you're actually going to stop kids from logging on. There's discussions about age verification. How would that work? Will that mean everybody has to upload their ID, whether or not they're under 16? There's so many question marks. And the other thing is, is that messaging services, gaming sites, none of those are going to be restricted. Some sites, for example, that, um, you would access for health or education purposes, they won't be restricted. And I spoke to, you know, one young, uh, influencer who was just like, it's just a bunch of old people who are making up rules for young people who who know far more about it. Just angry old people like, 'Ah, ban social media.' But now this is becoming a threat. This only affects me, not the people making this law. Not at all. You're taking choices away from young people, and these are choices that they have grown up with, that they understand, that they navigate quicker and better. It's not really good for communities and stuff because some people need to have communities online. Honestly, I think it's a good thing. There's a lot of really terrible influences online, more so than good ones. Joe, we're going to be talking a lot about teenagers as consumers of social media. But teenagers are also wonderful creators of content when it comes to some of these platforms as well. And that's had a big impact. Yeah, I think the social networks want the kids on their platforms because often, as you say, it's vibrant, it's creative. Some of the best memes and GIFs and online trends have come from very young people on these platforms. And some of the most fun that you can have on the internet is on these on these networks, for example, TikTok, you know, some of the stuff that we saw on TikTok in the last couple of years. The joke is that it takes three or four weeks for that to eventually end up on Instagram, because it does start on these platforms where kids populate and social networks know that, and they want their creators to be young and have a long future of building content that people are going to be interested in. And what's interesting as well is that if you look at what's happening in what some, including Mark Zuckerberg from Meta, will argue is the next stage in our technological entertainment, the Metaverse. So VR headsets, they've actually lowered the age. They've now lowered it to ten in America and Canada. And if you go on those platforms, you know, I feel very, very old now going into some of these rooms and these experiences and horizon worlds because they are... it's all kids there. And that's where they see the future of these platforms being. So you can see the kind of the strain that the social networks and these companies are under. If they somehow get rid of the children, how are they going to get them into the social networks that are going to help them create the next generation of content creators? If you speak to parents around the world, most would acknowledge that they're worried that their teenagers are spending too much time on these social media platforms. And that's concerning, particularly as we start to learn more about the impact that that is having on them. What are some of the things that actually do concern you when you look at what some teams are consuming. There's no denying that algorithms push people towards extremes. We now know that. We've had 20 years of social networks, and there's been so much research that's been done on it. So, for example, if you look at, um, a macho type account, maybe you're going to be given more of that, maybe it's going to lead you down a path of, I don't know, misogyny or, um, you know, incel culture in some ways, and particularly with, with young boys, we see that kind of thing. Likewise with women more in particular, we see if you look at, um, body image type imagery or videos or content that will push you eventually down to potential issues of how you feel about how you look and potentially eating disorders, that kind of thing. We know those issues are there, but then there's lots of other things that we're still not sure about. So, for example, is there such thing as social media addiction? Is there such thing as gaming addiction? There's a lot of this discussion. A lot of these words are being bandied around right now about children being addicted. I said it earlier, didn't I? Just off the cuff. But there's no real evidence to say that those are actual real addictions. There's a gaming addiction, uh, therapy centre in the UK that was opened and that was very controversial because scientists said, well actually, is it an addiction? And there are other places, other research that says that actually social networks are really good for children because it brings them together. We mentioned earlier, Katy said about particularly if you're, for example, LGBT, queer or trans, you know, you need that kind of community, to find your people. So the dangers of social media are there. Some of them we know about, and there seems to be not enough happening to solve them. And some are still kind of debated about whether or not they're good or bad for you. And so do we know or has research been done about what regular social media use does? Because I think that'll be a lot of the concerns that parents will be expressing is just about the daily use of social media and how much time their kids are spending on social media. Well, the research says that if everything else in your life is stable and good, then social media is good, because it's another way to socialise, open up your world horizons, that kind of thing. But when you add that into a situation where perhaps you haven't got a stable home life or you're being bullied at school or something like that, then it can just compound problems and make things worse. There's no hard and fast rules that I've seen in research that says if you spend more than two hours a day as a teenager on social networks, you're going to have mental health problems. There's nothing that concrete out there. But the thing about all of this is, you only have to ask a parent when you look at your kid absorbed in their phone for hours and hours a day, perhaps starting to feel bad about how they look, or things like that. And you feel like anecdotally it cannot be a good thing. Or that it's preventing them from doing other things. Yeah. The amount of time I hear parents say, 'Get outside, get a ball, go and play, get off your phone, get off your phone!' You hear it time and time again. Is there an argument that teenage years should also be when teens are learning to navigate online spaces safely? So if they get to 16 and they're in Australia and they've got no experience of this. That that's a bit dangerous. That's one of the arguments that we're hearing on this is that if you're suddenly launched into the internet at the age of 16 and you haven't got much experience, would you know how to spot, for example, AI imagery? The prevalence now of models that are artificial intelligence created. Would you be aware of that kind of thing because it's something that you haven't had experience of. There was some research done by a university in the UK about Chinese, not just social media bans, but the bans of smartphones and devices, at a certain sort of time of night. And they are saying that it's a good thing to take the devices away, and then they can go out and they can play and it's a less sedentary lifestyle, that kind of thing. And they said that a 10% reduction in screen time means ten more minutes of playing outside or something. So they would argue, the researchers, that that kind of experience of playing and socialising face to face makes up for a lack of technical knowledge, for example. Are these some of the arguments, Katy, that you're hearing, particularly from parents, in Australia? When, uh, the Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, announced it back in September, he said, um, we want people back on the footy fields, uh, you know, out and doing things, you know, like a kind of typical childhood. And I spoke to one expert who said, but why? That's such a kind of attitude that everybody's good at sport. I mean, on a personal level, my son hates football, He doesn't like, he's not into social media either. But like, there's this assumption that childhood is the same as it was when you were young. And that is that. So that doesn't mean that you might not, you know, go out and enjoy a good walk. And we all know that's really good for health as well. But this idea that it's better to be in sport than it is to be online is a huge assumption that everybody's sporty and liking that. And we all know that there are plenty of kids in their youth who hated being part of sports and team sports like that as well. So if you spoke anecdotally to parents, especially parents, um, of kind of similar age to my children, the view is, oh, well, at least it kicks a can down the road so that when our kids go, I want to have a social media account, we can go, oh, you can't now because the government doesn't let you. And also everyone's on the same playing fields. You know, it's a level playing field. So that it's not that some people are allowed to because their parents let them and others don't. Legally, nobody's allowed to. So there's a kind of initial, ah, well, great. It's one extra tool. But then when you dig down and certainly I've spoken to plenty of experts and I don't, I haven't found one, like, tech expert who thinks it's a good thing. So we've established that there's a problem. The Australian government is trying to provide a solution. This was the view of one online safety educator. The big reason that I am pro-ban is because we're having a conversation about it. And if the collective total of world governments look at this as a positive move and maybe they'll do it, and that pressure goes back towards those companies or changes in legislation in the US that also going to be a really positive thing. So that's Kirra Pendergast. She heads up an online safety education company in Australia. She speaks to thousands of students every week. But Joe, tell us a bit more about what the challenges are going to be in banning under 16s in this way. How practically difficult is it going to be? Well, one thing I think we should sort of bear in mind here is that you have to be 13 to be on these social networks, but that doesn't stop under-13s going on right now. So the issue is, you put in a 16 age limit. How is that enforced? Because at the moment, of course, you go on to a TikTok or an Instagram and you just say, oh, I'm 18 or 19 when you're not, very clearly, and there's no checks or balances there. It's just literally you put your date of birth in and they say, you know, there you go. Ofcom, the Office of Communications here in the UK, a survey they've done, says that one in five children are lying about their age to get on social networks. In fact, it's 22%. So a bit more than one in five. So that goes to show that the current restrictions of 13 just simply don't work. So if you bring in a 16 or in France, they've been trying really, really trying to get a 15 age limit going on there. You have to then have the law in place. And as Katy said, the onus in Australia will be that the technology companies have to be the ones that check. So how are they going to do that? Well, they could use, for example, facial recognition systems where you scan your face and it has a rough guess at your age, um, which may or may not be accurate. What's really interesting in this is that actually the ones that I've used are really accurate. I was mucking around on TikTok a few months ago, and there's a filter that you can use to guess your age, and it got me exact and it got my wife exact. But what's funny is they're not using that. I don't think I want to use that! But if we're playing around with this tech as a filter that's made by some, you know, independent company that might make some money from it, why isn't TikTok already implementing that? And we do see that, for example, in China with their ban that they've had on gaming and, um, online use late at night. It does make a difference, but it's not being used elsewhere. So when you bring in a ban on 16s or under, you have to then have something like that in place. And also these teenagers are so savvy when it comes to tech, surely they're just going to get a VPN and get around it? Yeah we have, we did see that, particularly in France with the ban there. Um, you can just get a VPN and say you can pretend you're logging in from a different country where there is no ban. So you can get around the issues. But then I think the thing to bear in mind here is as well, though, is that if you add friction, so let's say you bring in the ban, but you can circumvent it with VPN. That is another step. That is another step that children will have to take to get around it. So that will knock out a certain number of people. It's whether or not you want 100%, you know, um, success rate. Katy, what else are people who are criticising this ban saying? What are their other concerns? A lot of the experts I've spoken to have kind of expressed a lot of disappointment that they, they're like, we've talked about this. We've, you know, advised the government, and yet nothing seems to have gone through on anything that we have suggested, um, you know, and they've even pointed to the fact that the UN also doesn't really say ban it. It's about the human rights is to kind of educate and give access to. It's a really, really hard, uh, law to implement, I think. I think, you know, and because it's still so much a framework, there's so many, you know, unanswered questions on this. So it's very much a headline grabber. But really getting down to the nitty gritty, we'll see in the next year or so. So the argument against this ban would be, hang on a minute, instead of blocking children from going on to dangerous places, make those dangerous places less dangerous. And of course, that is even more onus on the technology companies to do that. But it can happen. It can be done. If you look at Douyin in China, for example, which is the Chinese equivalent of TikTok, which is owned by the same company, ByteDance, they own both TikTok around the entire world. And then Douyin in China. Douyin is exactly the same as TikTok, but it is very, very different in terms of the content that is displayed to young people on that app. It's all about science. It's all about maths. And they have big campaigns about social well-being and how to be a good citizen. There must be teens dancing?! Well, yeah. Oh, there'll be there'll be a bit of that as well. But it's a very different experience. And I think some people in the camp of, 'This is wrong, don't ban kids, make technology companies do more', would look at Douyin as an example of that being possible. Well, let's have a look at how the tech companies are responding. Because Elon Musk wrote that this Australia ban was backdoor control of the internet. How are the other platforms, you know, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, how are they reacting? They're all dead against it, as you can imagine. The main argument from them is that we need more time. We need to talk about this properly because, I think Katy mentioned earlier, it is a bit of a rush. What's happening in Australia is going through quite fast and the technology companies, rightly or wrongly, are saying pause, slow down, let's look at the science, let's look at the research, let's look at the evidence that there are harms out there for children. And also let's look at whether or not the verification systems will actually work. How is it actually going to work. We are seeing some interesting developments of having technology companies have youth-related apps. So you can have a kind of you've seen, for example, on YouTube, you've got main YouTube and then you've got kids YouTube, which is meant to be and is, to be fair, a more moderated and protected version. So it's that 'making the swimming pool safer' for children. That's the kind of argument there. And we might see that rolled out more widely, where you have a kids' Instagram, a kids' version of TikTok and the others. So Katy, headlines all over the world. Lots of people are talking about it. Uh, parents particularly. Do people in Australia think this is going to succeed? I think a lot of people are questioning whether it will really succeed, even those for and against are thinking, like, they just don't really understand how they could possibly it could possibly work. So, uh, no, I think a lot of people are wanting to, to wait and see exactly how this will play out. And to pick up on Joe's point. So the tech companies, the onus is on them to comply, but they will face penalties of as much as 50 million AUD. So that's about £26 million, $33 million USD. So if they don't comply, that's, you know, the top penalty they can get. But there will be some exemptions. So if they're able to create low-risk services, so more kid-friendly services, then that might kind of help their case. But again all of this is still, the detail is yet to be defined. But certainly there's a kind of a motivation there to try and make these platforms more, uh, kid-friendly. Well, the whole world is watching Australia on this one. Katy, thank you so much.

          <attvalue for="7" value="russia has launched a major missile attack on Ukraine's second largest city with at least three people reported killed the mayor of Harv says it's the biggest attack on the city since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion he said dozens of explosions had been reported another official said emergency crews were searching for victims trapped in the rubble he said a residential building had been hit two children including a young baby were among those injured it's the second big attack on Harkiv in the past few days it comes as President Trump said Ukraine gave Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them after Sunday's massive attack on air bases deep inside Russian territory well they gave they gave Putin a reason to go and it bobbed the hell out of him last night that's something I didn't like about it when I saw it I said &quot;Here we go now it's going to be a strike.&quot; Well let's go live now to Kiev and speak to our correspondents there Paul Adams paul what do you make of what the mayor of Harkiv had to say saying that this is the most powerful attack on the region since the start of the fullcale invasion how fair an assessment is that well it's not the most deadly there have been other uh attacks on Khib that have killed more civilians but it does seem to have been one of the most intense our understanding is that this all took place within the space of about 90 minutes uh in the hours before dawn uh and with reports of around 40 explosions including drones glide bombs that the Russians use uh particularly in areas closer to the front lines and also at least one ballistic missile so for that period of time that was clearly a very very intense and terrifying experience for the people of Kharkiv and the pictures that we have seen this morning of apartment blocks and private buildings on fire give you some sense of how grim it must have felt we heard there President Trump saying Ukraine gave President Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them following that spid web attack on Russia how are those comments being received in Kiev there you know Ukrainians are extremely weary of hearing this kind of language that somehow things that they do to attack Russia trigger retaliation i mean after all the night before Operation Spid Russia launched 472 drones over Ukraine you know this has been going on for more than three years what on earth does Donald Trump think that Ukraine has been experiencing night after night for all of this time i think it's clear that when he spoke to Vladimir Putin just a few days ago uh the President Putin bent his ear probably about Operation Spid which was clearly a massive humiliation for the Russian air force uh but also about an alleged attack on a passenger train inside Russia a train that was heading in the direction of Moscow uh that uh that crashed into a bridge that had been blown up killing seven civilians the Russians say that that was an act of terrorism by Ukraine they have yet to provide any evidence for that but clearly that's what uh one of the things that President Putin was telling Donald Trump about paul thank you that's the BBC's Paul Adams in Kiev there well let's bring in Mikolola Biliskov who's a research fellow at Ukraine's National Institute for Strategic Studies which is part of the Department of Defense Policy he's in Kiev as well thank you for joining us on BBC News so we've seen two days of major Russian strikes on Ukraine is this Russia's retaliation for that spiders web attack on its territory well well the way people are putting it as for me is a justification for the Russian acts there is a saying in Ukraine that demonstrates the absurdity of this uh justification that says that if Ukraine stopped fighting there would be no Ukraine and if Russia stop fighting there would be no war so we target everything that is used to terrorize Ukrainian cities Ukrainian infrastructure and it is within the right of self-defense so in that regard what do you make of President Trump's comments that Ukraine had given President Putin a reason to go ahead and bomb the hell out of them and what does that mean in terms of Kiev's relationship with Washington DC well that's incredible and that's a major frustration to equate uh the aggressor and the countries that suffer from aggression again we exercising the right of self-defense it is uh the 51st article of a UN charter and when someone even if it's US president as he think himself as a mediator put it in such a way unfortunately uh he is not creating conditions for the peace and for sure it's not good for US Ukrainian relations which we value so that's incredible and frustration and what do you make of these missile attacks is there a strategic value to them in terms of what's happening on the ground in the war because we keep hearing about a Russian summer offensive what's happening on the front lines at the moment well u these are two separate acts they exist in a parallel so Russia is waging so-called total war with total war you deliberately target civilians civilian infrastructure rare areas to undermine the moral to make life untenable maybe to create uh the situation when Ukrainian citizens would pressure Ukrainian government to negotiate on Russian terms uh but it has nothing to do with the front line and within the front line Russians trying to advance and we try to arrest them and uh these are just two parallel stories and Russian attacks against civilians it's part of the total war approach that thus far is not delivering to them but unfortunately Russians still don't come to the conclusion that it's futile to do this total war and we continue to see images coming in from Ukraine and we hear reports of civilians having to take cover when you have these constant constant missile attacks and of course those alerts for Ukrainians to really go into bunkers how does it affect the life of civilians in the country again that's a part of Russian approach to make life unbearable you know sleep deprivation it's a major problem and it has a cumulative effect when you do not sleep enough your cognitive and physical abilities decline and again it's very vicious intent of the Russians to undermine Ukrainian moral but thus far it proved to be counterproductive thank you very much that's Michiskov there from Ukraine's National Institute for Strategic Studies thank you" />

pay more attention to us several hundred kilometers away Munich is one of the wealthiest places in Germany the Leopold family lives here dir Leopold works as an engineer his wife Anna is an accountant they say they're getting by but the polit Ians need to do more to turn things around inv inv invest invest invest in all possible areas in the areas where there hasn't been investment in the last 15 years and that's everything from infrastructure to education to internet new ideas new technologies everything what I can't stand hearing anymore what I would tell a politician is is about cutting red tape it's always talked about always brought up as a necessary step and nothing happens the mood before the elections in Germany is gloomy whether in the west or the East among young or old in poor or Rich regions there's broad dissatisfaction with the political system because people are worried about the future Arthur Sullivan from DW businesses here to talk about what exactly people are worrying about good to see you Arthur so let's start with the main economic challenges facing Germany today tell us what they are well in simplest terms Anya the biggest problem is that Germany has no growth so for the last two years the country has not only not had any growth it has had two years of a contraction so the economy has actually shrunk in that time so when you don't have any growth you therefore then don't have any confidence now the main reason why there has been no growth is primarily driven by a collapse in the country's manufacturing base so you're talking about Industries like car making machine building these sectors chemicals which Germany has really been a world leader in for much of its post-war history but which are are collapsing before its eyes shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs over the last five six years and the country sort of flailing as a result of that now there's lots of reasons why those sectors are flagging but more than anything else that big collapse in those key sectors is what is undermining German growth in fact leading to that contraction and fundamentally leading to this crisis of confidence at the heart of the German economy right it has quite heav psychological impact as well doesn't it I mean let's look specifically more specifically at companies and medium-sized businesses so what are the main problems there so a lot of these companies and and as you said medium-sized businesses the Mand as it's known in Germany Germany developed a reputation over the decades as a world leader in manufacturing and then as an export power making world-class goods from Cars to the smallest type of components for different machines and various other types of products now what has what has really fundamentally happened is that since the war in Ukraine there's been this huge energy crisis in Europe and particularly in Germany where because these companies which are very energy intensive and often reliant on on cheaper gas gas prices have become so much more expensive and as well a lot of these companies have to pay a levy to to the German government to you know for emergency gas storage so they're just crippled with huge gas prices that's not necessarily the only issue I mean the car industry for example has faced competition from China from the electric vehicle Market but fundamentally these these big issues Energy prices another one of course is the high cost of Labor in Germany they've eaten away at the uh the the profits obviously from the lack of market share but then these extra costs have further crippled them and then as a result we're we're seeing all these job losses in the sector now of course we know that there's an election coming up on Sunday there's been lots of campaign pledges to spend to invest more but there's a major hurdle in the way of that isn't there here in Germany there is it's something that some of our viewers I'm sure will have heard about they may not necessarily know the details but it's called The Debt break so in 2009 quite a while ago now Angela Merkel the then Chancellor brought in a specific rule which really limited the amount of money that Germany can borrow so to very quickly sum it up Germany can only borrow a tiny fraction of its GDP .35% over its GDP which in the in the context of Germany is really only a few billion which is a lot of money but not much for one of the world's biggest economies which means that Germany wants to fund itself exclusively through the money it takes in and not necessarily through any extra borrowing now when you have a country country that has a lot of economic problems like infrastructure for example needs major investment it needs much more investment to become more digitally Innovative also in areas like artificial intelligence a whole range of areas where the country needs to spend money it's difficult to do that when your econom is not growing and you won't borrow anything else and the thing is the political parties any you they disagree over this debt break some of them say we need to get rid of it we need to borrow more others the more fiscally conservative ones like the CDU the center right the fdp the who are where were in the previous government and in fact that previous government fell over this very issue they're they're much Keener to keep it and have that more conservative approach whereby you don't take on extra borrowing just briefly Arthur looking ahead to the election I mean what kind of impact do you think the election really can have on the economy I mean do you think a new government will be able to turn things around well I think it's important to always be optimistic about the economy because you can definitely talk yourself and think yourself into a worse situation optimism and confidence are fundamental factors in driving a business economy forward but Anya the key thing is here no party we don't know the results yet but no party is likely to have a majority there's going to be a coalition possibly involving as many as three parties so it could be that center right party the center left the SPD and possibly a third party like the greens who knows they all have different approaches to these issues there's going to be horse trading I think the really interesting thing will be to see the program for government whatever program for government emerges from the election and see what kind of things they can agree on and what is their common approach to dealing with Germany's multitude of economic problems we'll know much more off to Sunday DW uh business Arthur Sullivan thank you so much Arthur let's look at this with Marcel frater who is president of the German Institute for economic research he's also a professor at humal University Berlin welcome to DW everywhere you look certainly in the west they're talking about a cost of living crisis Germany obviously suffering uh the the same at the moment are there particular reasons why Germany is being hit particularly hard the reason why the German economy is doing worse is for two reasons first uh its openness to trade uh and its former dependence on energy Imports um exports are suffering uh and second industry is doing very poorly and we we just saw it in the reports uh industrial companies are having a very hard time uh the industrial sector is shrinking since 2018 so this is nothing new so this has happened over the last 5 years and it's getting worse um but at the same time one also has to be very honest and say well many services sectors uh people are doing well um and my assessment is the mood is a lot worse than the reality we have record employment we never had more people in jobs than today uh we have rather rather a shortage of skilled workers in particular Engineers uh the fear is not so much about the present about the business cycle about the recession it's really about the future and that concern that fear is Justified and what do you see from the offerings from the the various political parties ahead of uh Sunday's election what do you see from them that would change this for the better uh to be quite Frank I see very little um by all parties uh this has been election debate which basically has been a struggle or a fight for redistribution the party's right of Center are promising huge tax cuts of partly three % 4% of GDP uh including uh the conservative party which is the front runner at the moment knowing full well uh that this will not be implemented and most of that tax cut to the rich the parties left of the center are promising increases and pension and public pensions so redistribution from young to old uh so the Young Generation is really the victim of this campaign because the promises are we don't have to change in Germany it has worked well in the past we want to go back to the past we don't want to go to the Future and that's why I'm not very optimistic about a new government really having understood that reforms have no alternative and they need to be courageous and really changing a lot within the German economy and Society so what if not that if not doing what we did before but better if not that then what are you calling for what would uh uh improve Germany's economic prospects I'm convinced there are three things the new government needs to do first it needs to reestablish confidence um especially the economy is a lot about trust and that trust is not present so companies are not investing consumers are not consuming and I'm optimistic on that that a new government will be less there will be less infighting they will have a clearer idea the second major investment initiative and also that we heard just in the reports uh Germany has a pretty bad public infrastructure is investing far too little in energy infrastructure digital infrastructure and education um and the big hurdle is a debt break so we Germans love the debt break we hate debt um and that's probably the biggest dilemma a new government needs to solve it needs to spend more uh it needs to invest more that inevitably will mean more debt and the third Big Challenge is Europe Germany needs to take more responsibility in Europe uh we see this with the conflict in the Ukraine we see it now with the recent developments um um through the US government through Donald Trump so without a strong United Europe uh particular Germany will pay a very high price for this crisis we just pick out one of the points you you you rais there in in your plan for for the the country investment in in infrastructure this has been a call for the last 10 years at least why is it that successive German governments have been so shy of putting money into the country's infrastructure there are two reasons for that first it's a federalist structure of the econ of of the country uh we have very strong checks and balances half of all public investment is conducted at the municipal level and we have 30% of the municipalities that are over indebted they cannot invest more um so we need a fundamental reform uh helping them to invest more um that's one of the reasons the second one is look Germany had a golden decade of the 2010s the economy was hugely successful and when we when my Institute 10 years ago actually 12 years ago was in 2013 said we need more public investment people attacked us and said that's rubbish the Germany economy is doing so great uh so why should we change anything and that understanding we need to change we need to accept more debt in return to more investment and more productivity and competitiveness that conviction broad conviction in public has not sunk in yet and that's my concern over the next four years thanks for leading us through that

Today, global temperatures have risen about 1 degree Celsius since pre-industrial times. This is what that looks like so far: Storms have gotten more intense, wildfires are more common, and ancient glaciers are melting faster and faster. And that’s just one degree of warming. Without global action, the world is on track to warm at least 3 degrees Celsius by 2100. This would be catastrophic. That’s why most scientists agree that we need to limit global warming to this range, between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius. Carbon dioxide, which is emitted when we burn fossil fuels, accounts for most of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. It’s the main culprit behind climate change. And to limit global warming to the degree that scientists are calling for, we have to stop releasing it. We have to “decarbonize.” The US doesn’t currently emit the most carbon dioxide of any country. But as one of the oldest industrial powers, it’s emitted more carbon dioxide in total than any other country or region. So America has a big role to play in decarbonizing. But how is the US supposed to do that? And is it actually possible? If you want to get halfway there by 2030, you have to start now. Now. Going fast. There is literally zero more time to waste. Dave writes about energy and climate for Vox. And he says the 2020 US election comes with fairly clear stakes. If Trump is reelected, that's it. Like there's no chance for 1.5. And probably all chances for 2 degrees are gone. “The United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord.” “...open up the coal mines.” “...new offshore oil and gas leasing program.” President Trump doesn't have a climate policy. And his reelection will most likely continue policies designed to boost the fossil fuel industry. They’d increase carbon emissions instead of decreasing them. And the effects would be felt globally. You just can't have the world's second biggest economy opting out, moving kin the opposite direction, and expect the world to get there. The other major candidate in the election does have a plan to address climate change. And this part of it in particular is ambitious: Biden has been convinced and pushed to the point that he's got a great climate plan. What Biden's plan doesn't get into are the details on exactly how the US would actually do that. But there are people who have thought about what it might look like to decarbonize by 2050. And to understand that, it helps to get a picture of where America's energy comes from, and where it goes. [Scream] Sorry, my son nearly stepped on a snake. Do you want to say hi? This is Saul Griffith. He’s a physicist, and an engineer, but this is how Dave describes him: Probably the person who knows more about energy as it's used in the United States than any other human being. A few years ago, Saul decided to make a model of America’s energy use. He ended up reading basically every available piece of data, from... ...the Energy Information Administration, Department of Transportation, the National Highway Transit Authority, the Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and NOAA. And so we pulled all of those together to build a very comprehensive picture of the US energy economy. That picture of the US energy economy? It looks like this: If you're just looking at the whole thing at once, it just looks like a big pile of spaghetti. It's hard to make sense of, but it just traces energy, every unit of energy. How does it enter the economy? How is it used throughout the economy? This kind of chart is called a Sankey diagram. And it’s easier to understand in 3 sections. These columns here on the left are the sources of all the energy used in the US, like natural gas, coal, solar, wind, nuclear, and oil. This column in the middle is what those energy sources get converted into. So a lot of it becomes electricity. Most oil becomes the fuel we use for transportation. And here, you can see how much natural gas energy is being used to generate electricity, versus being used directly to power things like cooking stoves. And over here on the right? This is where all the energy is used, broken down into incredible detail. Like how much energy is used to light shopping malls in the US. Or how much energy is used by vehicles driven for work. So you start to get this incredibly detailed picture of all of the interconnections, which is really, really important when you do the next exercise: what happens if we decarbonize? Remember that carbon emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels. This stuff. And Saul says that means that to decarbonize, we just need to follow their path. The first place that leads you is here, with electricity and the energy we use to generate it — the majority of which, in the US, comes from two kinds of fossil fuel: natural gas and coal. If the US wants to decarbonize, it needs to stop getting electricity this way, and replace it with other decarbonized energy sources. That means coal power plants - gone. Gas power — gone. All electricity would come from renewable sources — wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, and biomass. Or, nuclear energy. Decarbonizing the way we get electricity would be a huge investment. But it would also only eliminate 20% of emissions. And that’s because electricity and energy are not exactly the same thing. That doesn't solve vehicles' emissions. It doesn't solve your heating emissions from using natural gas or fuel oil in your basement. All these other parts of the economy draw their energy directly from fossil fuels. Like transportation: We use oil for fuel. And commercial and residential buildings, where we use gas and oil for heat. But Saul says there’s a kind of elegant solution to this: you decarbonize these sectors by switching their energy source from here, to here. Make all of it electric. Because we already have almost all of the technology we need to do it. Heat pumps, batteries, electric vehicles, wind turbines, nuclear power plants. We know that that can work. We know we can do electric cars. We know we can do electric heat for nearly everything. It’s all in the end just about machines, right? We've got a bunch of machines that use fossil fuel energy. We need to replace them with machines that use clean electricity. And so it really just comes down to a matter of industrial capacity: How fast can you build machines? There are some things we’d have a harder time decarbonizing. Air travel will rely on fossil fuels until alternative technologies get better. And things like steel and concrete are really hard to manufacture without fossil fuels. But if we decarbonized as much as possible with the technology that we have now, it would end most of the US's carbon emissions. This chart shows the country’s carbon emissions broken down by economic sector. If electricity, residential, commercial, and transportation were mostly decarbonized, you’d have solved a lot of the problem. All of this would be a huge undertaking. And it needs to happen fast. Saul’s research modeled different scenarios for the transition from fossil fuel-based machines to electric ones: From a market-driven transition, to carbon taxes, to a much more direct and heavy-handed approach that would replace our machines with their electric counterparts very quickly. And he found that because we’ve delayed action for so long, none of these slower approaches will be enough. If you went back to 2000 and started then, you could just put like a modest carbon tax in place and it would have just eased us down over the course of 30 years or whatever. But emissions kept rising and rising and rising. So now to get where we need to go, they got to fall off a cliff. And that means zero delay. We're just talking about a level of industrial mobilization that none of us alive have seen. It would look like what FDR did to prepare us to prepare the US for war. Literally, every single solitary fossil fuel machine that goes out of service is replaced by a clean energy alternative. Every furnace, car, factory, you name it. Nearly everyone is buying an electric vehicle, nearly everyone is buying rooftop solar, nearly every new power plant that comes online is industrial scale solar, or industrial wind. We need that level of effort to do a lot better than two degrees. All of recorded human history has happened within an era of relative climate stability. An era that’s about to end. But we still have control over what comes next. And the global effort that’ll require hinges in part on what the US decides to do. America can decarbonize. We have the technology to do it. We have the resources. The only question is whether we want to do it. I have a six year old and an eleven year old, and I have to believe that's going to happen. Otherwise.. And I have to try to make that happen, as long as possible, because it's their future we're stealing by not doing it. Thanks for watching this episode of our 2020 election series. We're focusing on the issues that matter most to you. And we got this topic requested by a lot of people. We want to know what you think the candidates should be talking about.

          <attvalue for="7" value="&gt;&gt;&gt; TONIGHT, THE FIRST AMERICAN POPE GIVES TO HIS FIRST MASS IN ENGLISH. POPE LEO, WHAT YOU SAID TO THE FAITHFUL GATHERED CELEBRATING HIS NEW PAPACY, PLUS WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT HOW HE CONSOLIDATED SUPPORT TO BEAT OUT THE COMPETITION. WHAT AMERICAN CARDINALS ARE SAYING AND WHY MANY WERE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO FOLLOW IN POPE FRANCIS'S PATH. THE POLITICS OF THE PONTIFF, WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT, IMMIGRATION, AND MORE, AND HOW HE WILL WORK WITH THE WHITE HOUSE. &gt;&gt;&gt; AND FROM CHICAGOLAND TO PERU, WE FOLLOW POPE LEO'S ROOTS. &gt;&gt;&gt; NETWORK AIRPORT LOSING RADAR DISPLAYS AGAIN. THE URGENT RADIO CALL DEMANDING MORE PRESSURE ON OFFICIALS. AS DELAY IS STRETCHED TO FOUR HOURS. THE SHOWDOWN AT AN DETENTION FACILITY AS DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS SAY THEY ARE DOING OVERSIGHT, AND DHS SAYS THEY BROKE IN, A MAJOR CITY MAYOR ARRESTED. &gt;&gt;&gt; PLUS, A FEDERAL &gt;&gt;&gt; AND FROM BULLS S TO WILDCATS, CUBS TO THE BEARS, HOW AMERICAN ROOTS SET THE INTERNET ABLAZE. &gt;&gt;&gt; THIS IS NBC NIGHTLY NEWS, REPORTING TONIGHT FROM THE VATICAN, HERE IS LESTER HOLT. &gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME FROM A CITY IS STILL A GO AFTER YESTERDAY'S ELECTRIFYING INTRODUCTION OF A NEW HEAD OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. POPE LEO QUICKLY ENDEARING HIMSELF AMONG THE FAITHFUL, LEADING HIS FIRST MASS AS SPOKE THIS MORNING IN THE SISTINE CHAPEL, WHERE ONLY HOURS EARLIER, THE CONCLAVE THAT SAW HIM ELECTED AS POPE ENDED. BORN IN THE UNITED STATES, A FIRST FOR A POPE, A SURPRISE CHOICE TO MANY, BUT NOT FOR THE CARDINALS WHO ELECTED HIM, MANY REVEALING IT WAS BARELY A FACTOR IN THEIR DISCUSSIONS THAT PRECEDED THE BOATS. TONIGHT, WE ARE GETTING GLIMPSES SURROUNDING THE LARGELY SECRETIVE CONCLAVE PROCESS, INCLUDING WHAT GUIDED THEIR DECISION-MAKING AND HOW THEY GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER. &gt;&gt; [ SINGING ] &gt;&gt; POPE LEO THE 14th PRESIDING OVER THIS FIRST MASS AS PONTIFF TODAY AND THE SISTINE CHAPEL. BEGINNING WITH A FEW WORDS IN ENGLISH. &gt;&gt; AND I KNOW I CAN RELY ON EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU TO WALK WITH ME AS WE CONTINUE AS A CHURCH. &gt;&gt; TODAY, THERE HAS BEEN A SLOW PULLING BACK OF THE CURTAIN ABOUT THE CONCLAVE ON THE DAYS LEADING UP TO IT, SPECIFICALLY THE MEALTIME BREAKS AND COFFEE BREAKS WHERE CRITICAL DISCUSSIONS TOOK PLACE. THE ARCHBISHOP OF CHICAGO TOLD ME IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS, THE CARDINALS ZEROED IN ON THE QUALITIES THEY WERE LOOKING FOR. A CHICAGO NATIVE AND VILLANOVA GRAD, WHO HAD WORKED FOR YEARS AS A MISSIONARY IN PERU, EMERGED. &gt;&gt; THEY WANTED PEOPLE WHO WERE MULTILINGUAL, WHO LIVED ON MORE THAN ONE CONTINENT, WHO HAD PASTORAL MISSIONARY EXPERIENCE AS HE DID, SO HE SEEMED TO CHECK ALL THE BOXES. AND THEN THE BOATS CAME IN AND THEY JUST SEEMS TO MOVE IN THE DIRECTION TO ELECT HIM. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS POPE LEO WELL. WE HEAR PEOPLE SLIP INTO CALLING HIM BOB. VERY FAMILIAR. BUT TALK TO US ABOUT WHAT KIND OF PERSON HE IS. &gt;&gt; WELL, HE IS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS JUST VERY REAL, WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET. HE IS AUTHENTIC, HE CARES ABOUT PEOPLE, AND IT HAS BEEN SAID HE DOESN'T PICK A FIGHT, BUT HE WON'T RUN FROM IT EITHER. &gt;&gt; BUT THERE IS ONE THING THE CARDINALS SAY WASN'T A BIG FACTOR. &gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK THE FACT THAT CARDINAL PREVOST IS FROM THE UNITED STATES HAD MUCH WEIGHT. &gt;&gt; CARDINAL JOSEPH REFLECTED ON THE WEIGHT OF THE MOMENT FOR HIS FRIEND OF 30 YEARS. &gt;&gt; AFTER ONE OF THE BALLOTS, I WENT BACK AND THEY TOOK A LOOK AT BOB, AND -- BECAUSE HIS NAME HAD BEEN FLOATING AROUND, AND HE HAD HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS. AND I WAS PRAYING FOR HIM, BECAUSE I COULDN'T IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENS TO A HUMAN BEING WHEN YOU ARE FACING SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND THEN WHEN HE ACCEPTED IT, IT WAS LIKE HE WAS MADE FOR IT. &gt;&gt; AND POPE LEO'S FIRST NIGHT AS PONTIFF WAS A BUSY ONE, GRADING THE FAITHFUL, SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS OFFERING A BLESSING. TODAY, THE VATICAN RELEASING THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENT, ANNOUNCING HIS ELECTION. POPE LEO'S OTHER -- OLDER BROTHER, LUIS, SAYS IT IS ALL PRETTY SURREAL. &gt;&gt; IT IS JUST MIND BLOWING THAT MY BROTHER WAS ELECTED POPE. WE USED TO TEASE HIM ABOUT BEING POPE WHEN HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD. X IN POPE LEO'S HOMETOWN TODAY: LET US PRAY FOR POPE LEO THE 14th. &gt;&gt; A SPECIAL MASS HONORING THE NEW LEADER OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING FROM BACK HOME? &gt;&gt; LOTS OF THINGS. THE CULTURE OF CHICAGO AND THE MIDWEST PRODUCED A POPE. THAT IS TERRIFIC. I THINK IT IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO TAKE PRIDE IN, BEING FROM CHICAGO. &gt;&gt; I SEE YOU ARE A LITTLE CHOKED UP THERE. IT TOUCHES DEEP. &gt;&gt; VERY DEEP, YEAH. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER QUESTION TONIGHT, HOW WILL THE FIRST AMERICAN POPE HANDLE THE THORNY POLITICAL ISSUES OF THE WORLD STAGE? WE ARE ALREADY GETTING SOME CLUES. WITH MORE ON THAT, HERE IS MOLLY HUNTER &gt;&gt; WHEN POPE LEO THE 14th SPOKE OF REACHING OUT TO THE WORLD IN HIS FIRST MASS AS PONTIFF, IT CAME AS NO SURPRISE TO FATHER TONY BATES. &gt;&gt; HE IS GOING TO TRY TO BRING INTO DIALOGUE DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS ON DIFFERENT THINGS. &gt;&gt; THE FELLOW AUGUSTINIAN DESCRIBES ISSUES THAT HIS FRIEND, THE FIRST AMERICAN POPE, CARES DEEPLY ABOUT, LIKE MIGRANTS, ISSUES THAT MAY PUT HIM ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. &gt;&gt; WHY CAN'T THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THESE AFFLICTED COUNTRIES ACTUALLY SHARE IN THE RICHES OF THE COUNTRIES? &gt;&gt; AND GO IN SEARCH OF BETTER LIVES. &gt;&gt; IN FEBRUARY, AN EX-ACCOUNT FOR FORMER CARDINAL PREVOST POSTED: JD VANCE IS WRONG, JESUS DOESN'T ASK US TO NBC NEWS DAILY OUR LOVE FOR OTHERS. AND BACK IN 2015, THE ACCOUNT [ INAUDIBLE ] UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP. EVEN STILL, THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT CONGRATULATING AND PRAISING THE NEW POPE. &gt;&gt; TO HAVE THE POPE FROM THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THAT IS A GREAT HONOR. &gt;&gt; BACK IN 2012, HE CRITICIZED POPULAR CULTURE FOR PROMOTING SYMPATHY FOR BELIEFS AND PRACTICES THAT ARE AT ODDS WITH THE GOSPEL, REFERRING IN PART TO THE HOMOSEXUAL LIFESTYLE. &gt;&gt; [ INAUDIBLE ] TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ON THE PERIPHERY OF CHURCH. THERE IS NO REASON FOR THAT EXCLUSION. &gt;&gt; Reporter: ACCORDING TO VOTER REGISTRATION RECORDS, THE NEW POPE VOTED IN REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES IN ILLINOIS IN 2012, 2014, AND 2016. &gt;&gt; WILL HE WANT TO BUILD BRIDGES TO DONALD TRUMP? I SUPPOSE, BUT HE WILL WANT TO BUILD BRIDGES WITH THE LEADER OF EVERY NATION. &gt;&gt; Reporter: NOW, CARDINAL DOLAN SAYS THE NEW POPE WILL START THOSE MEETINGS WITH WORLD LEADERS WITHIN DAYS, AND PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE LOOKS FORWARD TO MEETING THE NEW POPE. &gt;&gt; MOLLY, THANKS VERY MUCH BUT AS WE TRACE THE POPE'S ROOTS, THE JOURNEY LED OUR TEAM TO SOUTH AMERICA WHERE LEO WAS BISHOP AND A MISSIONARY, A JOURNEY THAT PAVED HIS WAY TO THE PAPACY. STEPHANIE REPORTS IN PERU. &gt;&gt; Reporter: NOT LONG AFTER LEO THE 14th, THE CHICAGO BORN POPE, APPEARED ON THE VATICAN BALCONY, CHURCH BELLS RANG IN LIMA, PERU. THE PRESIDENT PROBABLY DECLARING: &gt;&gt; [ SPEAKING IN A GLOBAL LANGUAGE ] &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE POPE IS PERUVIAN, GOD LOVES PERU. FOR CATHOLICS IN PERU, LEO THE 14th IS THERE POPE, TOO. SOCIAL MEDIA LIT UP WITH ME IN SPIRIT THE POPE AND THE NATIONAL SOCCER JERSEY, DRINKING COCA-COLA. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE MEANING IN THE CITY TODAY. &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE A PARTY, THE PEOPLE ARE VERY EXCITED. &gt;&gt; ROBERT PREVOST SPENT MORE THAN WO DECADES WORKING IN THIS SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRY, FIRST AS A MISSIONARY, THEN A PRIEST, AND ULTIMATELY A BISHOP IN THE CITY. &gt;&gt; THIS IS TERRIFIC, I AM AT A RESTAURANT RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE CATHEDRAL AND THEY ARE SERVING UP THE POPE'S FAVORITE LUNCH, GOAT WITH RICE AND BEANS. AMONG BISHOP PREVOST'S MOST BELOVED CAUSES, HELPING IMMIGRANTS. WE VISIT THE SHELTER HE HELPED BUILD WITH JUAN CARLOS. HE TELLS ME WHEN BISHOP NBC NEWS NOW SAW PEOPLE IN NEED, HE WANTED TO HELP THEM. GABRIELLA HAS BEEN HERE FOR THREE YEARS AND MET THE FUTURE POPE. I ASKED HER IF SHE HAD A MESSAGE FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; [ SPEAKING IN A GLOBAL LANGUAGE ] &gt;&gt; Reporter: SHE SAYS I'M GRATEFUL FOR EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE FOR US, FOR VENEZUELANS. HIS TENURE IN PERU DID NOT ESCAPE CONTROVERSY, HE WAS ACCUSED OF MISHANDLING AN INVESTIGATION OF REPORTS INTO PRE- SEXUAL ABUSE, ALLEGATIONS THE DIOCESE HAS DENIED. HERE IN CHICAGO TODAY, IT IS ABOUT CELEBRATION. PEOPLE SAY BOTH THINGS COULD BE TRUE, POPE LEO THE 14th IS THE FIRST U.S. POPE AND HE IS THE FIRST PERUVIAN POPE, TOO. PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT THE CARDINALS IN THE VATICAN WERE THINKING. LESTER? &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE, THANK YOU. AND BACK AT HOME TONIGHT, NEWARK AIRPORT IS ONCE AGAIN DEALING WITH OURS ON DELAYS AFTER AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS YET AGAIN LOST RADAR DISPLAYS EARLY THIS MORNING. HERE IS TOM COSTELLO. &gt;&gt; Reporter: IT HAPPENED AT 3:55 A.M. THE FAA SAYS FOR 90 SECONDS, NEWARK CONTROLLERS LOST SEVERAL RADAR SCOPES. ONE CONTROLLER CHECKING IN WITH THE FEDEX PILOT. &gt;&gt; WENT BLACK AGAIN. [ INAUDIBLE ] &gt;&gt; Reporter: TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY TELLS NBC'S KRISTEN WELKER, UNSTABLE DATA LINES AND SOFTWARE GLITCHES ARE TO BLAME. &gt;&gt; THE SYSTEM IS OLD, RIGHT? THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT IS 25 AT BEST, SOMETIMES 50 YEARS OLD. WE HAVE TO FIX THIS, BECAUSE WHAT YOU SEE IN NEWARK IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN OTHER PLACES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, IT HAS TO BE FIXED. MATT DUFFY SAYS ALL DATA LINES AND RADAR AND RADIO FROM NEWARK UP TO LONG ISLAND, NEW YORK, THEN DOWN TO PHILADELPHIA, WHERE CONTROLLERS MANAGED NEWARK AIRSPACE. ONE CURRENT CONTROLLER TELLS NBC NEWS THEY HAVE LOST RADIOS AND RADARS MANY TIMES SINCE LAST AUGUST. WHILE AIR TRAFFIC AT 4:00 A.M. IS MOSTLY LIMITED TO CARGO PLANES AND SOME CHARTER FLIGHTS, ANY HOUR OF THE DAY IS DANGEROUS IF YOU LOSE RADAR. &gt;&gt; ALL NEW HARDWARE, ALL NEW SOFTWARE IS GOING TO BE BUILT INTO THIS BRAND-NEW AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM. &gt;&gt; Reporter: ON THURSDAY, DUFFY DETAILED PLANS TO COMPLETELY REBUILD AMERICA'S AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM. NEW TOWERS, RADIOS, RADARS, AND RADAR CENTERS, AMID A PUSH TO HIRE MORE CONTROLLERS, BUT IT WILL COST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND TAKE THREE TO FOUR YEARS. ARE WE LOOKING AT A REALLY DIFFICULT SUMMER BECAUSE ALL THESE CHALLENGES? &gt;&gt; IS OUR CONTROLLERS CAN'T CONTROL A REALLY BUSY AIRSPACE, WE ARE GOING TO BRING IN LESS AIRPLANES, AND THAT CAN CAUSE DELAYS AND CANCELLATIONS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: DUFFY TELLS ME HE THINKS THE DATA LINE FROM NEW YORK TO CONTROLLERS IN PHILADELPHIA SHOULD IMPROVE WITHIN A FEW DAYS, HOPEFULLY IMPROVING THE RADAR SIGNAL FOR CONTROLLERS. LESTER? &gt;&gt; TOM COSTELLO, THANKS FOR YOU CAN SEE MORE OF KRISTEN WELKER'S EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH THE TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY ONLY ON MEET THE PRESS. &gt;&gt;&gt; ALSO IN NEW JERSEY TONIGHT, AN ARREST OUTSIDE AN I.C.E. DETENTION CENTER WITH A PROTEST UPSET OVER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S CRACKDOWN ON UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANTS. GABE GUTIERREZ HAS LATE DETAILS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: TONIGHT, A NEW SHOWDOWN OVER IMMIGRATION. THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK ARRESTED OUTSIDE OF THIS I.C.E. DETENTION FACILITY IN NEW JERSEY FOR ALLEGED TRESPASSING BUT AFTER A PROTEST ALSO ATTENDED BY THREE DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF NEW JERSEY'S CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION. MONOCOT, BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN, AND ROBERT MENENDEZ JUNIOR. &gt;&gt; WE WERE ASSAULTED BY MULTIPLE [ INAUDIBLE ]. &gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAYS THERE WAS NO ASSAULT AND THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS [ INAUDIBLE ] AND BROKE INTO IT. A DHS SPOKESPERSON CALLING IT A BIZARRE POLITICAL STUNT AND ILLEGAL BREAKING AND ENTERING. &gt;&gt; MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ALSO HAVE TO FOLLOW THE LAW. &gt;&gt; Reporter: FOR WEEKS MEMBERS HAVE SLAMMED PRESIDENT TRUMP OVER DEPORTATIONS, SAYING HE IS IGNORING DUE PROCESS RIGHTS FOR UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. SOME DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ALSO TRAVELING TO EL SALVADOR TO MEET THE MAN AND DEMAND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION RETURN HIM TO THE U.S. THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS HE IS A GANG MEMBER, WHICH HE DENIES. &gt;&gt; THE SECOND WE TRIED TO DEPORT THEM, THE RADICAL DEMOCRAT PARTY IS RACING TO THE DEFENSE OF SOME OF THE MOST VIOLENT SAVAGES ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. &gt;&gt; Reporter: THE WHITE HOUSE IS NOW CONSIDERING SUSPENDING THE RIGHT TO CHALLENGE A PERSON'S DETENTION BY THE GOVERNMENT. &gt;&gt; THE CONSTITUTION IS CLEAR, IT CAN BE SUSPENDED IN TIME OF INVASION, SO IT IS AN OPTION WE ARE ACTIVELY LOOKING AT. &gt;&gt; GABE, TODAY, A JUDGE ORDERED THE RELEASE OF A TUFTS UNIVERSITY STUDENT WHO HAD BEEN DETAINED SINCE MARCH BUT &gt;&gt; YES, LESTER, AND JUST BREAKING, A TURKISH DUE TO JUST WALKED OUT OF A DETENTION FACILITY IN LOUISIANA. THE FEDERAL JUDGE RULED HER DETENTION COULD POTENTIALLY CHILL THE SPEECH OF MILLIONS OF NONCITIZENS. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAID STUDENT VISAS ARE A PRIVILEGE, NOT A RIGHT. LESTER? &gt;&gt; GABE GUTIERREZ, THANKS FOR THE SHOW OF STRENGTH TONIGHT IN RUSSIA BY PRESIDENT LATIMER PUTIN, APPEARING AT A MASSIVE MILITARY PARADE WITH CHINA'S LEADER IN WHAT APPEARED TO BE ALSO A DIRECT MESSAGE TO THE U.S. SIMMONS IS THERE FOR US. &gt;&gt; Reporter: RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN AND CHINA'S PRESIDENT XI APPEARING SIDE-BY- SIDE, SENDING AN UNCOMPROMISING MESSAGE TO THE U.S. FROM MOSCOW TODAY. AT A RUSSIAN PARADE MARKING VICTORY OVER NAZI GERMANY IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR, JUST AS CHINA PREPARES FOR TARIFF TALKS WITH HE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND RUSSIA REFUSES TO AGREE TO TRUMPS 30 DAY CEASE-FIRE PROPOSAL IN UKRAINE. PRESIDENT XI SAYS HE AND PRESIDENT PUTIN ARE FRIENDS. PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS PUTIN WANTS PEACE. THIS COULD BE PUTIN'S ANSWER. &gt;&gt; THE PARADE INCLUDED FIGHTERS FROM THE FRONT LINE, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, DRONES USED TO TARGET UKRAINE. AFTER VICE PRESIDENT VANCE THIS WEEK ACCUSED THE KREMLIN OF NOT GOING FAR ENOUGH TOWARDS A PEACE DEAL. &gt;&gt; WE THINK THEY'RE ASKING FOR TOO MUCH. &gt;&gt; Reporter: AFTER THE PARADE, PUTIN'S CLOSE ALLY TELLING NBC NEWS, PUTIN DOESN'T OWE ANYONE ANYTHING. MORE THAN 20 WORLD LEADERS ARE HERE. PUTIN MEETING WITH EACH ONE, INCLUDING BRAZIL'S PRESIDENT. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU NOT CONCERNED THAT STANDING A RED SQUARE NEXT TO PRESIDENT PUTIN STRENGTHENS THE RUSSIAN LEADER, DOESN'T PUSH HIM TO -- BRING PEACE? &gt;&gt; NO, IT WON'T, BECAUSE BRAZIL'S POSITION CONTINUED TO BE THE SAME, IT HAS NOT CHANGED. BRAZIL IS CRITICAL, IT HAS MADE A CRITIQUE ON UKRAINE'S OCCUPATION AND WE HAVE TO FIND PEACE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: TONIGHT, THE KREMLIN SAYS PEACE TALKS ARE MOVING FORWARD, WHILE PRESIDENT TRUMP AGAIN IS THREATENING SANCTIONS IF A CEASE- FIRE IS NOT REACHED. LESTER? &gt;&gt; SIMMONS, THANK YOU. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK IN 60 SECONDS. WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT BRYAN &gt;&gt;&gt; WE HAVE GRIPPING NEW DETAILS TONIGHT FROM &quot;DATELINE&quot; INVESTIGATION OF THE MURDERS OF THE FOUR COLLEGE STUDENTS IN IDAHO, PROVIDING THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE LOOK YET INTO THE ACTIONS OF ACCUSED KILLER BRYAN KOHBERGER AFTER THE MURDERS. HERE'S KEITH MORRISON. &gt;&gt; Reporter: 48 HOURS AFTER THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT STABBING DEATHS AT 1122 KING ROAD, BRYAN KOHBERGER WAS ON AMAZON SHOPPING FOR A K-BAR KNIFE AND SHEATH, THE SAME BRAND OF SHEATH INVESTIGATORS HAD FOUND IN THE BED OF ONE OF THE VICTIMS LEFT BEHIND, THEY BELIEVE, BY THE KILLER. THAT AND THE REST OF WHAT WE'RE REPORTING COMES FROM RECORDS IN THE POSSESSION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES WITH DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CASE. THAT SAME WEEK, THE WEEK AFTER THE KILLINGS, KOHBERGER BEGAN VIEWING OR SAVING ON HIS PHONE PHOTOS, VIDEOS, AND NEWS UPDATES ABOUT THE MURDERS. HE DID THAT AT LEAST 60 TIMES. &gt;&gt; HE WAS COLLECTING EVERYTHING, ALL THE REPORTING ABOUT THE INCIDENT. &gt;&gt; IT'S VERY COMMON. HE'S BEEN WATCHING ALL THESE THINGS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: A MONTH AFTER THE MURDERS ON DECEMBER 15th, KOHBERGER WATCHED A VIDEO THAT INCLUDED THIS QUOTE, SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH ME. I CAN'T BE WHO I NEED TO BE. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH ME. WILL IT LAST FOR ETERNITY? &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T FIT IN TO SOCIETY. &gt;&gt; Reporter: IN LATE DECEMBER, SIX WEEKS AFTER THE MURDERS OF MADDIE MOGEN, KAYLEE GONCALVES, XANA KERNODLE AND ETHAN CHAPIN, RECORDS SHOW KOHBERGER, A CRIMINOLOGY STUDENT, WAS ON HIS PHONE PLAYING A CLIP FROM A YOUTUBE PROGRAM CALLED &quot;TED BUNDY: THE ESSENCE OF A PSYCHOPATH.&quot; WITHIN 24 HOURS OF THAT, TWO SELFIES, KOHBERGER DRESSED THE SAME WAY BUNDY IS PICTURED ON THAT PROGRAM. AND FINALLY TWO DAYS LATER ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 29th, BRYAN KOHBERGER PULLED UP A SONG ON HIS PHONE BY BRITNEY SPEARS, THE TITLE, &quot;KILLER.&quot; TACTICAL TEAMS ARRESTED KOHBERGER LESS THAN TWO HOURS LATER. HE HAS PLEADED NOT GUILTY TO ALL CHARGES. KEITH MORRISON, NBC NEWS, LOS ANGELES. &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN SEE MUCH MORE OF KEITH'S REPORTING TONIGHT ON &quot;DATELINE&quot; AT 9/8 &gt;&gt;&gt; WE'RE BACK WITH NEWS. THE MENENDEZ BROTHERS WILL FINALLY HAVE THEIR NEW DAY IN COURT NEXT WEEK, NOW THAT A LONG-AWAITING RESENTENCING HEARING IS ON THE BOOKS. IT COMES AFTER ATTORNEYS FOR THE BROTHERS WITHDREW THEIR MOTION TO REMOVE L.A.'S DISTRICT ATTORNEY FROM THE CASE. ERIK AND LYLE MENENDEZ ARE SERVING LIFE IN PRISON FOR THE MURDERS OF THEIR PARENTS. &gt;&gt;&gt; FORMER SUPREME COURT JUSTICE DAVID SOUTER HAS DIED. APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT GORGE H.W. OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO SAY THERE'S SOMETHING MORE HERE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: BECAUSE WHERE THERE'S SMOKE, THERE'S FIRE.

          <attvalue for="7" value="ELON MUSK JUST TWEETED YES AND AMPLIFIED OR RETWEETED A POST THAT SAYS PRESIDENT VERSUS ELON, WHO WINS, MY MONEY'S ON ELON. TRUMP SHOULD BE IMPEACHED AND JD VANCE SHOULD REPLACE HIM. HE ALSO RETWEETS HIS ORIGINAL POST SAYING DONALD TRUMP IS IN THE EPSTEIN FILES. THAT IS THE REAL REASON THEY HAVE NOT BEEN MADE PUBLIC. HAVE A NICE DAY, DONALD TRUMP. AGAIN, AS A NEWS ORGANIZATION, WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF THAT, BUT ELON MUSK, WHO JUST SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH HIM. IS MAKING THAT CLAIM AGAINST HIM. MARA GAYE BROUGHT US TO THE POINT THAT WE ARE AS A COUNTRY, AS A PUBLIC, AS AN ELECTORATE, DEALING WITH THE INSECURITIES AND, AND NOW UM MALIGNANT SOCIAL MEDIA WAR BETWEEN TWO MEN. LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT KARA SWISHER, WHO'S COVERED ELON MUSK SINCE THE BEGINNING, HAD TO SAY BY WAY OF EXPLANATION. THIS IS AN INTERVIEW FOR OUR NEW PODCAST, THE BEST PEOPLE. IT AIRS ON MONDAY, BUT WE HAD SOME OF IT READY FOR THIS CONVERSATION. WHAT IS ELON MUSK'S TRAUMA STORY? YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS I USED TO SAY TO A LOT OF PEOPLE I COVERED, CAUSE YOU COULD SEE THAT, THE TRAUMA, UM, UH, OBVIOUSLY LACK OF THERAPY, WE WOULD HAVE DONE VERY WELL IF HE HAD GONE TO THERAPY AT ONE POINT, BUT HE DIDN'T. THAT PERSON? NO, NO. HE, HE WASN'T. I, I WILL TELL, HE DEFINITELY HAD PROBLEMS FROM THE GET WITH STUFF AROUND RACISM, YOU KNOW, HIS, HIS FAMILY HISTORY IS REALLY QUITE FRAUGHT. AND SO I THINK HE HAD A LOT OF TRAUMA AND THEN HE WAS, YOU KNOW, HE HAS AWFULLY AUTISM ISSUES, UM. AND HE, HE'S A CREATIVE PERSON WHO'S VERY DEEPLY, UH, ENMESHED IN SCIENCE FICTION, WHETHER WE'RE IN A SIMULATION OR NOT, UM, VERY CREATIVE THINGS THAT WE'RE IN A SIMULATION. HE, HE TOLD ME THAT AS HE GOT MORE ACCLAIM, AS PEOPLE SUCKED UP TO THEM, AS INEVITABLY HAPPENS WITH RICH PEOPLE OR FAMOUS PEOPLE, MOST RICH PEOPLE NOW. UM, HE STARTED TO BELIEVE HIS OWN NONSENSE AND BECAME OVERLY DRAMATIC. AT ONE POINT, WE DID AN INTERVIEW WHERE HE SAID, IF, IF TESLA DOESN'T SURVIVE, HUMANITY IS DOOMED TO ME. I THINK THAT HE, HE STARTED USING DRUGS QUITE A BIT. I THINK THAT'S BEEN WELL REPORTED, ESPECIALLY KETAMINE, AND IF YOU'VE EVER TAKEN IT, WHICH I DID, IT'S A VERY DISASSOCIATIVE DRUG. SO YOU UNDERSTAND THE TRUMP, OH, WHAT'S HE DOING WITH THE GOVERNMENT? I THINK HE HAS A THING IN HIS HEAD THAT HE HAS THIS NARRATIVE IN HIS HEAD THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS TERRIBLE. SO TEDDY, THAT WAS, IT'S PROBABLY NOT AS UM NEW, NEW TO YOU AS IT WAS TO ME. I WAS IN SHOCK ABOUT WHO HE WAS BEFORE TRUMP WELCOMED HIM IN, AND AS MARA IS ALLUDING TO, GAVE HIM THE KEYS TO THE MOST IMPACTFUL ELEMENTS OF OUR GOVERNMENT, ALL, ALL OF OUR PERSONAL DATA, UM, THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT SEND A MESSAGE AROUND THE WORLD THAT AMERICA ISN'T ALL ONE THING, OUR SOFT POWER LEVERS, UM. THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE THAT'S BEEN TRAUMATIZED BY DESIGN. WHAT IS THIS BLISTERING FIGHT WITH DONALD TRUMP? HOW IS IT LIKELY TO END? UM, WE'RE TALKING AT 4:25, LET'S SEE WHERE THINGS ARE AT 4:35, I MEAN, UM, YOU KNOW, OR 4:45. UH, I MEAN, THE REALITY IS, UM, UH, YOU KNOW, IN KIND OF CONVERSATIONS TODAY WITH, UM, SOME PEOPLE AROUND HIM, UM, THEY'RE, THEY'RE NOT REALLY SURE WHAT HIS PLAN IS. I MEAN, I CAN TELL YOU, YOU KNOW, UH, ELON MUSK HAS BEEN PERTURBED BY, UM, YOU KNOW, THIS BUDGET BILL, SURE, UM, BUT HE'S BEEN PERTURBED BY OTHER THINGS THAT TRUMP HAS DONE HAS NOT GONE PUBLIC IN THIS KIND OF BALLISTIC WAY. SO WHAT EXACTLY ELON'S PLAN IS IS SOMETHING THAT ELON'S OWN FRIENDS ARE ASKING ONE ANOTHER RIGHT NOW. UM, YOU KNOW, THERE'S LIKE A NERVOUSNESS AND AND A SADNESS THAT THAT IT'S COME TO THIS, UM, YOU KNOW, I I I THINK THE REALITY IS HE IS MOTIVATED UH BY STIMULI, AND HE IS UPSET ABOUT THINGS THAT HE IS SEEING ONLINE, AND HE'S UPSET ABOUT SOME OF THE WAYS THAT UH, TRUMP TREATED HIM ON THE WAY OUT, AND HE IS REACTING. THERE THERE IS NOTHING MORE COMPLICATED OR SOPHISTICATED BEYOND THAT. HE IS UPSET AND HAS ACCESS TO HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT AND IS MAKING THAT PUBLIC. I KNOW THAT SOUNDS VERY SIMPLE, BUT THAT'S KIND OF ALL IT IS. UM, I, I THINK WE LEARNED FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY THAT OR TRUMP AT LEAST SAID PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY THAT HE ASKED MUSK TO LEAVE. DID WE KNOW THAT THAT IT WAS TRUMP THAT THAT ASKED FOR HIS EXIT? I MEAN, IT IS TRUE THAT THAT ELON MUSK WAS ON A 130 DAY SPECIAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE, UM, TENURE WHICH REQUIRES, UM, UH, PEOPLE TO LEAVE AFTER 130 DAYS OR NOT BECOME SPECIAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES. IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THAT IS A UM DISTINCTION THAT, UM, FEDERAL BUREAUCRATS HAVE GOTTEN AROUND FOR A WHILE AND YOU CAN DO SOME CREATIVE ACCOUNTING TO AVOID THAT. UM, I, I BUY THAT, THAT THAT MUSK WAS KIND OF WEARING HIS WELCOME FIN, UM, AND YOU KNOW, CLEARLY, UH, MUSK ALSO WANT TO GET BACK TO HIS COMPANIES, AS HE SAID VERY, VERY PUBLICLY. UM, AND YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY THIS KIND OF CHOREOGRAPHED ROLLOUT WAS SO INTENTIONAL WHERE, YOU KNOW, MUSK WAS DOING INTERVIEWS FROM SPACEX AND HE WAS DOING UH UH MEETINGS WITH TESLA INVESTORS IN A VERY PUBLIC WAY BECAUSE HE WANTED SHAREHOLDERS TO KNOW THAT HE CARES ABOUT HIS COMPANY. SO I BELIEVE ALL THESE THINGS WERE TRUE, THAT THAT IT WAS GOOD FOR TRUMP, IT WAS GOOD FOR MUSK, UM, BUT YOU KNOW, NOW THEY CAN BOTH PORTRAY THIS UNCOUPLING AS UM THEM FIRING THE OTHER. UM, LET ME SHOW YOU, UM, ONE MORE THING THAT KARA SWISHER SAID ABOUT THE FUTURE OF TESLA. AND MUSK WANTS TO GO TO MARS, AND HE'S GETTING THAT. THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS, AND HE REALLY DOES. AND THAT IS, TO ME, HIS ULTIMATE GOAL WAS THAT, AND TO GET THE REGULATORS OFF HIS BACK, IT'S TESLA IN ANY WAY, AND THAT'S GONNA HELP. TESLA'S GOING DOWN RIGHT NOW. DO YOU THINK SO? OH YEAH. AND IT STOPS BEING VIABLE. WELL, I ALWAYS SAY THE PLANES ARE COVERED WITH THE BODIES OF PIONEERS. I MEAN, THEY WERE A TRUE PIONEER IN THE SPACE. I THINK THE REASON, EVEN THOUGH HE BLAMES THESE PROTESTS AND THIS AND THAT AND HIS STUPID, I MEAN, HE BROUGHT THIS ON HIMSELF, FYI, THESE PROTESTS, SO STOP BLAMING THE PROTESTERS. TEDDY, UM, IS THAT, IS THAT THE SENSE? I MEAN, THE, THE MARKET CERTAINLY, UM, SEEMS TO AGREE WITH KARA SWISHER'S, UM, ANALYSIS. YEAH, LOOK, I MEAN, UH, THIS IS, THIS IS A COMPANY THAT IS UH THAT IS IN A PRECARIOUS SITUATION TO SAY THE LEAST, RIGHT? I MEAN, UM, WHAT EXACTLY THE FUTURE OF TESLA IS, UM, IT IS SUCH A A COMPANY THAT IS SO ENRAPTURED IN KIND OF CURRENT POLICY FIGHTS. I MEAN, THEY OBVIOUSLY WERE WERE APOPLECTIC DURING THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION THAT THEY WEREN'T GETTING THE LOVE, UM, FROM A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT, UM, THAT THEY EXPECTED TO GET FROM EVS, AND THEN THEY BECAME LINKED WITH THIS PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T REALLY CARE FOR EVS, RIGHT? AND, AND FRANK, UM, IN FACT, WAS NOT INCLUDING UM EV SUBSIDIES IN THE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL. SO, UM, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A COMPANY THAT IS SO KIND OF DEPENDENT ON FEDERAL GOVERNMENT POLICY, IT MAKES SENSE THAT ELON WOULD WANT TO INFLUENCE, UH, INFLUENCE IT, BUT, BUT WHERE EXACTLY DOES THIS COMPANY GO, GIVEN THAT THEY'VE NOW ALIENATED CERTAINLY DEMOCRATIC VOTERS AND MAYBE UH REPUBLICAN VOTERS NOW. YOU KNOW, ANGELA, I WANT TO COME BACK. YOU KNOW, MY, MY FAVORITE THING YOU'VE TAUGHT ME IS NARRATIVE DOMINANCE. UM, IT GOES AWAY WHEN A DEMOCRAT AND A REPUBLICAN ARE SAYING THE SAME THING ABOUT YOU. AND SO I THINK THE POWER OF, OF, AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT AT THIS POINT, THESE ARE JUST WORDS, BUT THE POWER OF THE WORDS. THAT TRUMP IS USING AGAINST ELON, THAT HE'S MAD BECAUSE HE DIDN'T GET HIS EB SUBSIDY IS NOT GOING TO HELP HIS BRAND. I'M NOT GOING TO BRING ANYONE BACK TO TESLA BECAUSE HE DESTROYED USAID. HE SEIZED ALL OF OUR GOVERNMENT DATA FOR A TAX BREAK. REALLY, THAT'S NOT BRAND ENHANCING. AND ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE NARRATIVE DOMINANCE RELIED ON NOBODY PIERCING TRUMP'S DOMINANCE IN THE BUBBLE. THE ONLY PERSON WITH MORE DOMINANCE IN TRUMP'S MEDIA ECOSYSTEM IS ACTUALLY ELON MUSK, WHO'S, WHO'S PICKING A SIDE, HE'S PICKING, HE'S PICKING JD VANCE, WHO'S THIS PROMINENT IN THE FEVER SWAMPS OF RIGHT WING AND DISINFORMATION AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES AS AS ANYONE. AND HE'S NOT JUST SAYING, HE'S NOT JUST SAYING TRUMP SHOULD BE IMPEACHED. HE'S SAYING AND JD VANCE SHOULD BE ELEVATED. YEAH, AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, I, I THINK KARA ALSO SAID IT WHEN SHE WAS TRYING TO DESCRIBE, AT LEAST IN PART TO HELP EXPLAIN AND ILLUSTRATE HOW MUS GOT TO WHERE HE IS, IS THAT HE, HE, HE HAD A, HE HAS A NARRATIVE INSIDE OF HIS HEAD THAT HE JUST CAN'T GET UNSTUCK, AND HE'S LIVING HIS LIFE ACCORDING TO THAT NARRATIVE. BUT WHERE DID HE GET THAT FROM? WE GOT RED PILLS ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR YEARS. AND A LOT OF THAT IS POISONOUS, AND THAT THAT GETS TO THE CORE PART OF WHAT YOU'RE GETTING TO, WHICH IS A FEW THINGS. ONE, WHATEVER THE OUTCOME IS OVER THE LONG TERM, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I, I REALLY DO THINK THE EPSTEIN THING IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THING THAT MUSK HAS SAID SO FAR, BECAUSE WHAT IT DOES IS IT PUTS POISON INTO THE SYSTEM. AMONGST TRUMP'S BASE, THAT IS A SOFT SPOT FOR TRUMP RIGHT NOW, AT LEAST AMONGST HIS OWN SUPPORTERS. THEY ARE MAD AND FEEL LIKE HE'S HIDING SOMETHING, AND THAT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THAT INTERVIEW A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THAT BONGINO AND CASH PATEL DID, THE FBI DIRECTOR AND DEPUTY FBI DIRECTOR, WHEN THEY SAID, LOOK, EPSTEIN DID KILL HIMSELF. THERE'S NO CONSPIRACY HERE. PEOPLE ONLINE WERE FURIOUS ABOUT THAT. TRUMP SUPPORTERS WERE MAD ABOUT THAT. THEY THEY. TURNED ON PATEL AND BONGINO. IT'S THE THING THEY WANT TO HAVE AN ANSWER. THEY HAVE A NARRATIVE THAT SOMETHING REALLY DASTARDLY WAS DONE AND THAT THERE'S SOME SHADOWY FORCES COVERING IT UP, UM, AND THE IDEA THAT MUSK IS NOW LINKING TRUMP TO THOSE SHADOWY FORCES IS A VERY POWERFUL CONNECTOR TO THE NARRATIVE THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF HIS. HAS AND THERE'S THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER LITTLE SOFT SPOTS TOO, AND HE KNOWS WHERE THEY ARE AND THAT'S THE KEY HERE BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW TRUMP CAME TO POWER, THAT WAS A BIG PART OF HOW HE CAME TO POWER. HE CAME UP AND VALIDATED A LOT OF THE NARRATIVE THAT A VERY LARGE PART OF PEOPLE BELIEVED AND TRUMP SAID, YEAH, SURE, I GAVE IT TO BOTH SIDES, AND I DIDN'T PAY TAXES BECAUSE I'M SMART, AND THAT'S WHAT RICH PEOPLE LIKE ME DO. WE SCREW YOU. SO OF COURSE YOU NEED TO HIRE ME. FIRE WITH FIRE. I KNOW, I KNOW HOW, I KNOW WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON BEHIND THE CURTAIN, AND I'LL EXPOSE YOU ALL TO IT. AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT MUSK IS THREATENING TO DO HERE. COULD HE EVER UNSEAT TRUMP? NO, BUT WHAT HE CAN DO PROBABLY IS PUT A LOT OF A LOT OF POISON IN THE SYSTEM AND TAKE ALL THOSE FRACTURES AND TURN THEM INTO BIG FAT CRACKS, AND THAT SHOULDN'T BE DISCOUNTED. AND IT DOES, IT WILL SHAKE TRUMP'S SUPPORT AMONGST HIS BASE. THERE'S NO WAY AROUND THAT. THE EXPLOSION IN WHAT IS NOW THE CLEARLY COMPLETELY BROKEN RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS LARGEST DONOR, ELON MUSK, WHO WENT FROM LORDING OVER CABINET MEETINGS, HOLDING THAT SPECIAL GOODBYE PRESS APPEARANCE IN THE OVAL OFFICE. REMEMBER THAT WAS JUST LAST WEEK TO A TOTAL BLOWOUT BATTLE TODAY THAT IS RIVETING WASHINGTON POLITICS, HUGE CORNERS OF THE INTERNET, AS I SAID, BOTH FOR ITS MESSINESS, PETTINESS, BUT ALSO ITS STAKES. NOW THEY HIT NEW LOWS WITH MUSK TRYING TO SMEAR TRUMP WITH A HORRIFIC CONSPIRACY THEORY. TRUMP BLASTING MUSK AND NOW DOING SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NEVER BE NORMAL, WHETHER HE'S MAD AT MUSK OR NOT, WHICH IS BLATANTLY THREATENING, THREATENING TO ABUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO RETALIATE AGAINST HIM. MEANWHILE, TESLA'S STOCK IS DOWN TODAY. WE'LL GET INTO THAT, WHICH HITS MUSK WHERE IT HURTS. WHAT BEGAN WITH THE TENSION EARLIER THIS WEEK AND MUSK LASHING OUT AT TRUMP'S TOP LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY BUT CLAIMING THAT IT WAS A POLICY DISPUTE HAS TURNED PETTY, AS I MENTIONED TO OUR COLLEAGUE NICOLE, IT HAS TURNED RAP BEEF LEVEL PETTY AND PERSONAL. SO THESE TWO MEN AGAIN WHO HAVE IN ONE CASE BUSINESSES TO RUN IN THE OTHER CASE A COUNTRY TO OBVIOUSLY RUN. ARE NOT EXACTLY ACTING LIKE MATURE PROFESSIONALS, TO SAY THE LEAST. TODAY THEY HAVE EXCHANGED A VOLLEY OF THREATS AND VITRIOL, TAUNTS AND ATTACKS, AND I'LL JUST SAY SOMETHING SOMETIMES IN THE NEWS WE JUST SORT OF TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE SEEING, AND IT SOUNDS OBVIOUS. SO LET ME PUT IT LIKE THIS THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN THESE TWO MEN JUST TODAY. IS ACTUALLY FAR HARSHER, MORE NEGATIVE AND NASTY THAN WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING BETWEEN THE TWO POLITICAL PARTIES FOR THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS OR MONTHS, WHICH REMINDS YOU JUST HOW BANANAS THIS IS. NOW, THESE ARE TWO MEN WHO CLAIM TO BE WORKING TOGETHER TOWARDS LARGELY THE SAME AGENDA OR GOALS AS RECENTLY AS LAST WEEK. ONE OF THEM REMAINS A HUGE PLAYER IN REPUBLICAN POLITICS BECAUSE MONEY MATTERS. EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT IN OUR AMERICAN SYSTEM WHERE YOU CAN DONATE A LOT, UNLIMITED TO SUPER PACS, AND HE IS STILL ON RECORD AS THE BIGGEST REPUBLICAN DONOR FROM LAST YEAR, AND THAT POWERPOINT IS ONE THAT MUSK CITED AS IF ANYONE NEEDS A REMINDER ON THE RIGHT. TELLING EVERYONE TODAY THAT TRUMP AND THE GOP WOULD HAVE LOST THE ELECTION LAST YEAR, WOULDN'T, HE ARGUES EVEN BE IN POWER AND THAT HE THUS HAS LEVERAGE OVER REPUBLICANS BECAUSE OF THAT SPENDING, WHETHER IT'S THE PAST, WHICH HE THINKS HE'S CLEARLY OWED FOR, OR THE FUTURE WHERE HE CAN SPEND MORE THAN MOST CANDIDATES COULD EVER RAISE AND IT WON'T AFFECT HIS BOTTOM LINE. SO THAT'S THE BIG CONTEXT. HE WAS THE PRESIDENT TODAY. LOOK, ELON AND I HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP. UH, I DON'T KNOW IF WE WELL ANYMORE. I WAS SURPRISED, BUT I'M, I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED IN ELON. I'VE HELPED ELON A LOT. PEOPLE LEAVE MY ADMINISTRATION. AND THEY LOVE US. AND THEN AT SOME POINT THEY MISS IT SO BADLY AND SOME OF THEM EMBRACE IT AND SOME OF THEM ACTUALLY BECOME HOSTILE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. IT'S SORT OF TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, I GUESS THEY CALL IT. HE HASN'T SAID BAD ABOUT ME PERSONALLY, BUT I'M SURE THAT'LL BE NEXT. I'LL BE HONEST, I THINK HE MISSES THE PLACE. I THINK HE GOT OUT THERE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WASN'T IN THIS BEAUTIFUL OVAL OFFICE. I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY HE'S UPSET. REMEMBER, HE WAS HERE FOR A LONG TIME. YOU SAW A MAN WHO WAS VERY HAPPY WHEN HE STOOD BEHIND THE OVAL DESK. AND EVEN WITH A BLACK EYE, I SAID, DO YOU WANT A LITTLE MAKEUP? WE'LL GET YOU A LITTLE MAKEUP. BUT HE SAID, NO, I DON'T THINK SO, WHICH IS INTERESTING. MUSK HAS OVER 200 MILLION FOLLOWERS, MANY OF THEM IN THE UNITED STATES, AND A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF THEM ON THE RIGHT. HE ALSO HAS A SITE THAT HAS BEEN CAUGHT SINCE HE TOOK IT OVER, BOOSTING THE REACH OF WHAT HE SAYS FURTHER. SO EVEN THOUGH WE TALKED TO YOU HERE THROUGH THE NEWS AND YOUTUBE, IF YOU WATCH ON THERE, AND OTHER PEOPLE USE OTHER PLATFORMS, NOBODY CAN DOUBT THAT THE PLATFORM OF X ON THE RIGHT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS IS KIND OF THEIR HOME BASE, AND NOW IT HAS BEEN FLIPPED. MUSK UNDERCUTTING THE VERY REPUBLICANS HE WAS WORKING WITH AS POWERLESS WITHOUT HIM AND THEN ARGUING THEY SHOW SUCH INGRATITUDE. REMEMBER, THIS IS ELON MUSK ON THE PLATFORM HE OWNS IN A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE HAVE SALUTED OR WORSHIPED HIS WEALTH AND TECH ACUMEN. THESE ARE NOT JUST EMPTY ATTACKS. A LOT OF PEOPLE, REPUBLICANS NEED FOR THE NEXT ELECTION ARE READING THIS. MUSK'S ATTACKS ALSO MOVE EVEN FASTER THAN SAY HOW DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN ATTACKING DONALD TRUMP. I MEAN, THEY'VE MADE MANY CRITICISMS, BUT THEY HAVE NOT YET FLOATED IMPEACHMENT EVEN OVER POTENTIAL GROUNDS LIKE FLOUTING COURT ORDERS OR THE VIOLATION ALLEGED ALLEGEDLY OF THE EMOLUMENTS CLAUSE RIGHT WITH TAKING THE FOREIGN JET. BUT MUSK DOESN'T WASTE TIME. HE IS NOW TONIGHT WE CAN REPORT BACKING TRUMP'S IMPEACHMENT. YES, HE SAYS, BY REPOSTING THAT CALL ONLINE. AND BOTH THESE MEN HAVE USED TWEETS AND MISINFORMATION IN THEIR CRUSADES, BUT USUALLY TOGETHER TOWARDS THEIR COMMON OPPONENTS. MUSK NOW TURNING THOSE SAME DIRTY TRICKS BACK ON TRUMP TODAY, AND I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT THIS NEWS WITHOUT REINFORCING THE SMEAR. SO I'M NOT GOING TO REPEAT IT, BUT MUSK IS TRYING TO SMEAR HIS TEAMMATE WITH ONE OF THE WORST THINGS YOU CAN ALLEGE ABOUT SOMEONE, ALLEGING SORDID CRIMES THAT PEOPLE THROW AT OPPONENTS. NOW WE'RE NOT GETTING INTO THE SPECIFICS AND WE'RE NOT REPORTING THIS AT ALL ANYTHING RELATED TO TRUTH, JUST RELATED TO HOW THESE TWO MEN ARE BEEFING. AND BY THE WAY, MR. MUSK SHOULD KNOW, PUSHING THAT KIND OF CLAIM. WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE IS THE KIND OF THING THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE SUE AND FILE DEFAMATION CASES OVER. AGAIN, HE HAS SO MUCH MONEY, HE MAY BE IMMUNE TO THAT TYPE OF CIVIL ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT WHAT WE ARE WITNESSING MATTERS BECAUSE SOMETHING THAT ONCE LOOKED ALL POWERFUL AND PEOPLE WONDERING HOW MUCH MUSK WOULD GET AWAY WITH WITH HIS PSEUDO GOVERNMENT ROLE HAS NOW ENDED. THIS NOW BRIEF ALLIANCE OF ALLEGED MAGA GOALS, MONEY AND TECH. IS DEAD AND TRUMP IS ADMITTING HE MAY ATTEMPT THE SAME KIND OF ALLEGEDLY UNLAWFUL RETALIATION HE'S USED ON ON LAW FIRMS HE DOESN'T LIKE, NOW AGAINST MUSK. REMEMBER, WHATEVER YOU THINK OF ELON MUSK, I WILL TELL YOU. THE PRESIDENT OR ANY POLITICIAN'S POLITICAL OPINION OF HIM SHOULD NOT AFFECT OR CORRUPT HIS GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. THOSE SHOULD OBVIOUSLY BE DONE FAIRLY BASED ON WHAT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS. AND IF NASA NEEDS TO WORK WITH SOMEONE AND THEY DO A FAIR BIT, GREAT, IT SHOULDN'T COME AND GO WITH POLITICS. THAT'S THE SAME STANDARDS WE'VE MENTIONED FOR OTHER ISSUES. WELL, HERE WE SEE IT IN THE CIVIL WAR BECAUSE TRUMP SAYS HE COULD TERMINATE MUSK'S GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES AND CONTRACTS. THAT'S HOW TO SAVE MONEY, A DIG AT THE EFFICIENCY MUSK PROMISED. MUSK'S NET WORTH HAS TAKEN A HUGE HIT THIS YEAR. THOSE ARE THE CONTRACTS THOUGH, THAT CONTINUE TO SUPPLY PART OF HIS EMPIRE. AND AS THE SPENDING BILL HANGS IN THE BALANCE, TRUMP, OF COURSE ATTACKED MUSK IN THE PRESS, AND NOW HE'S ANNOUNCING SOMETHING THAT THEY DIDN'T SAY LAST WEEK. HE'S CLAIMING HE FIRED ELON MUSK, DIFFERENT STORYLINE. IT'S ALSO WE SHOULD NOTE WHAT SOME EXPERTS THOUGHT ACCOUNTED FOR MUSK'S ANGER. REPUBLICAN VETERAN BILL KRISTOL ACTUALLY SUGGESTED THAT JUST THIS WEEK. TRUMP NOW POSTING THAT HE WAS THE ONE WHO ASKED ELON TO LEAVE BECAUSE HE WAS WEARING FIT. THOSE ARE FIGHTING WORDS FOR A BILLIONAIRE WHO HAS NOT BEEN PUBLICLY FIRED IN A VERY LONG TIME. AND THEN, AS I TOLD YOU, HERE'S WHAT ANOTHER PART THAT MATTERS AND THAT IS TELLING. THE PRESIDENT ACCUSING MUSK OF BASICALLY BEING IN ALL THIS FOR HIMSELF, THAT IT WASN'T ABOUT EFFICIENCY OR HELPING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, BUT MUSK WAS REALLY MAD HE COULDN'T GET MORE MONEY OUT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNDER TRUMP. QUOTE, I TOOK AWAY HIS MANDATE. IT FORCED EVERYONE TO BUY ELECTRIC CARS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THAT TRUMP BASICALLY POSTED AND THEN HE SAID IT MADE MUSK GO CRAZY, QUOTE, UNQUOTE. NOW THAT'S AN ACCUSATION OF COURSE. AS TO THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CREDITS, WELL, THAT WOULD OF COURSE HELP TESLA. UPSET BECAUSE WE TOOK THE EV MANDATE, AND YOU KNOW, WHICH WAS A LOT OF MONEY FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES, AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE HAVING A HARD TIME WITH THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES, AND THEY WANT US TO PAY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SUBSIDY. I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE. THE INNER WORKINGS OF THIS BILL BETTER THAN ALMOST ANYBODY SITTING HERE, BETTER THAN YOU PEOPLE. HE KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. HE HAD NO PROBLEM WITH IT. ALL OF A SUDDEN HE HAD A PROBLEM AND HE ONLY DEVELOPED THE PROBLEM WHEN HE FOUND OUT THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CUT THE EV MANDATE BECAUSE THAT'S BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND IT REALLY IS UNFAIR. REALLY IMPORTANT POINT THERE. NUMBER ONE, THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE REPORTING ON WHETHER THAT WAS A PART OR A BIG PART OF WHY MUSK LEFT. SEPARATE FROM TRUMP SAYING IT, AXIOS REPORTED EARLIER THIS WEEK THAT THAT WAS A FACTOR, AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO TRACK THAT DOWN. BUT I TOLD YOU WE HAD THE WHOLE RAP BEEF PART OF THIS AND THE PETTY PART OF THIS. THIS PART MATTERS COMPLETELY APART FROM THE MESSINESS. I WANT YOU TO. JUST, HEY, WE TAKE IN THE NEWS TOGETHER. LET'S TAKE IN THE PREMISE THE PRESIDENT JUST SHARED THERE THAT I PLAYED FOR YOU. DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO CAST HIMSELF AS A WHISTLEBLOWER FOR HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION. THAT'S WHAT HE'S SAYING. HE'S SAYING, LET ME, LET ME TELL YOU WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. THIS GUY WAS JUST IN IT FOR THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CREDITS THAT WOULD SO ENRICH TESLA, BUT THE PROBLEM IS YOU CAN'T BE A WHISTLEBLOWER ON YOURSELF, CERTAINLY NOT WHEN YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT YOU'RE IN CHARGE. YOU HIRED THIS GUY, AND IF YOU WERE SO CONCERNED THAT THIS WAS JUST TESLA ENRICHMENT, WHY DIDN'T YOU BLOW THE WHISTLE AND FIRE HIM EARLIER? AND THE ANSWER MAKES IT EVEN WORSE. I SAY THIS NOT AS CRITICISM, BUT AS FACTS THAT MAKE THESE MEN LOOK BAD, RICH MEN WHO STILL WANT TO TAKE YOUR TAXPAYER MONEY IF YOU KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN AND NOTICE IT. BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY SEEN WHAT THEY DID ELECTRIC VEHICLE CREDITS, OPENLY TRAFFICKING IN FAVOR SELF DEALING AND THE KIND OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND CRONY CAPITALISM WHICH PROLIFERATE WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE CONTROLS OR RULE OF LAW OR BY THE WAY, A STRONG FREE PRESS, ALL THE WAYS THAT YOU KEEP PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE I'M SAYING THIS ALL TO YOU WHILE YOU SEE ON YOUR SCREEN WITH YOUR OWN EYES WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW. THESE TWO MEN WHO ARE BILLIONAIRES AREN'T CONTENT TO BE RICH ENOUGH. THEY WANTED TO TAKE YOUR WHITE HOUSE, THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE, YOUR TAX DOLLARS, AND OUR ATTENTION. TO HAWK THOSE TESLAS. GOT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT. IT'S WE WANT THE FUTURE TO LOOK LIKE THE FUTURE, AND IT'S KIND OF WHAT KIND OF TRUCK WOULD BLADE RUNNER DRIVE? THE ONE I LIKE IS THAT ONE AND I WANT THAT SAME COLOR. TESLA WILL BOOST TESLA SALES AND I CARE ABOUT ONE THING. WHEN SOMEBODY'S A GREAT PATRIOT, THEY SHOULDN'T BE HURT. HE'S A GREAT PATRIOT. I LOVE TESLA. HE HOPES IT DOES. AND ANY CONVENTIONAL SYSTEM THAT IS AN ADMISSION OF A PROBLEM, THE GOVERNMENT PLAYING FAVORITES AND TRYING TO HELP THEIR PEOPLE IN THE FREE MARKET. IT'S SOMETHING REPUBLICANS AND CONSERVATIVES HAVE LONG SAID THEY ARE AGAINST. THE GOAL THEN WAS TO SELL WHAT TRUMP CALLED THAT LOVE AND MAKE MUCH MONEY, WHICH HE ADMITTED. NOW THAT IS. NOT OK FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, PERIOD. WHETHER IT WORKS OR NOT, IT'S NOT OK. IF YOU'RE WATCHING THE NEWS AND YOU SAY I'VE HEARD ABOUT THESE TREMORS AND INFLECTION POINTS BEFORE, I GET IT. BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST. REPUBLICAN CONSERVATIVE CRISES THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS FACED IN THIS SECOND TERM, AND HE'S FACING AN OPPONENT WHO IS WELL CAPITALIZED AND NOT BACKING DOWN. NBC NEWS ALSO REPORTED YESTERDAY THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS LAUNCHED WHAT THEY ARE CALLING OPERATION AT LARGE, AND THE PLAN PULLS IN 1800 AGENTS FROM HOMELAND SECURITY'S INVESTIGATIONS UNIT, 2000 EMPLOYEES FROM THE FBI, THE US MARSHALS SERVICE, AND THE DEA, AND 250 IRS AGENTS. SO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE JUST REASSIGNED, TAKEN OFF THEIR NORMAL JOBS, AND TASKED SIMPLY WITH ROUNDING UP IMMIGRANTS TO MEET. STEPHEN MILLER'S OBJECTIVES AND ALL OF THOSE RESOURCES BEING PUT INTO IMMIGRATION MEANS THERE ARE LESS RESOURCES FOR EVERYTHING ELSE. FEDERAL PROSECUTORS TOLD NBC NEWS THAT CASES WITHOUT IMMIGRATION COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN STALLED OR ARE MOVING MORE SLOWLY. AT LEAST ONE US ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ABANDONED A POTENTIAL FEDERAL PROSECUTION AGAINST SOMEONE PROSECUTORS FELT WAS DANGEROUS BECAUSE THE CASE LACKED AN IMMIGRATION COMPONENT. AND LAST WEEK PROPUBLICA REPORTED THAT BECAUSE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO FOCUS SO MUCH ON IMMIGRATION, THEY'RE LEAVING THE FIGHT AGAINST EXTREMIST VIOLENCE TO THE STATES. AS MICHIGAN ATTORNEY GENERAL DANA NESTLE PUT IT, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USED TO PRIORITIZE DOMESTIC TERRORISM, AND NOW IT'S LIKE DOMESTIC TERRORISM JUST WENT AWAY OVERNIGHT. IT CERTAINLY DID NOT. TO SHOW YOU HOW MUCH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CARES ABOUT KEEPING THE COUNTRY SAFE. CHECK OUT WHO THEY JUST APPOINTED TO LEAD THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY'S ONE OF THEIR HUBS FOR TERRORISM PREVENTION. THIS GUY, THIS IS 22 YEAR OLD THOMAS FUGATE, WHO LITERALLY GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE LAST YEAR. AND ACCORDING TO HIS LINKEDIN, THE BULK OF HIS LEADERSHIP EXPERIENCE COMES FROM HIS PARTICIPATION IN A CLUB THAT SIMULATES THE UNITED NATIONS. I AM NOT KIDDING. NOTHING WRONG WITH THOSE CLUBS, BUT YOU'RE NOT READY TO BE IN CHARGE OF A COUNTERTERRORISM HUB A YEAR LATER. BUT PIVOTALLY, NO THREAT PREVENTION EXPERIENCE IS LISTED IN HIS EMPLOYMENT HISTORY. SO WHAT EXACTLY MADE MR. FUGATE RIGHT FOR THE ROLE? AS PROPUBLICA PUT IT IN A NEW PIECE, FUGATE BRINGS A DIFFERENT QUALIFICATION PRIZED BY THE WHITE HOUSE, LOYALTY TO THE PRESIDENT. ON INSTAGRAM, MR. FUGATE TRACED HIS POLITICAL AWAKING TO 2016, WHICH, BY THE WAY, HE WAS 13 YEARS OLD, WHERE HE SAID, QUOTE, IN A GENERATION DEPRIVED OF HOPE, OPPORTUNITY, AND HAPPINESS, I SAW IN ONE MAN THE CAPACITY FOR REAL AND LASTING CHANGE, DONALD TRUMP. NOW, JUST LAST YEAR, MR. FUGATE SPENT SOME TIME DOWN IN FLORIDA CELEBRATING TRUMP'S 78TH BIRTHDAY. AS A PARTY, AS PART OF A FAN GROUP CALLED CLUB 47, PEOPLE INSIDE DHS SAID THAT MR. FUGATE WAS HIRED LESS TO RUN THE AGENCY AND MORE AS A MINDER OR A BABYSITTER, SAYING, QUOTE, THE WHITE HOUSE INSTALLED FUGATE TO OVERSEE A PIVOT AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM LANES AND TO STEER RESOURCES TOWARD MAA FRIENDLY SHERIFFS AND BORDER SECURITY PROJECTS BEFORE EVENTUALLY SHUTTERING OPERATIONS. THE OFFICE'S MISSION HAS CHANGED OVERNIGHT, WITH A PIVOT AWAY FROM FOCUSING ON DOMESTIC EXTREMISM, ESPECIALLY FAR RIGHT MOVEMENTS. THE TERRORISM CATEGORY THAT FRAMED THE AGENCY'S WORK FOR YEARS WAS ABRUPTLY EXPANDED TO INCLUDE DRUG CARTELS, PART OF WHAT DHS STAFFERS CALL AN OVERARCHING MESSAGE THAT BORDER SECURITY IS THE ONLY MISSION THAT MATTERS. MEANWHILE, WE AS A COUNTRY HAVE SEEN PLENTY OF ACTUAL EXTREMIST VIOLENCE RECENTLY. I MEAN, AN ARSON ATTACK ON THE GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA'S HOME, A MASS SHOOTING AT FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY, A CAR BOMBING AT A FERTILITY CLINIC IN CALIFORNIA, TWO ISRAELI EMBASSY AIDS SHOT DEAD OUTSIDE A JEWISH MUSEUM IN WASHINGTON, A FIRE BOMBING ATTACK IN COLORADO. ALL THAT HAPPENED IN JUST THE LAST 2 MONTHS. AND NOW, THE GUY IN CHARGE OF ONE OF THE OFFICES TASKED WITH PREVENTING EXTREMIST VIOLENCE LIKE THAT IS THIS 22 YEAR OLD. BEFORE HE GOT THE POSITION, THE PREVIOUS DIRECTOR WAS BILL BRANIFF, AN ARMY VETERAN WITH MORE THAN 2 DECADES OF NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERIENCE. HE RESIGNED LONG BEFORE THIS, EARLIER THIS YEAR WHEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION STARTED GUTTING THE OFFICE, AND HE JOINS ME NOW. BILL BRANIFF, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE WITH ME TONIGHT. I THINK IT'S SO MUCH, SO IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE DIFFERENT FACTIONS OF GOVERNMENT, ALL THE THINGS THEY DO. SO LET ME JUST START BY ASKING. YOU ABOUT THIS OFFICE AND WHAT EXACTLY THE TEAM YOU USED TO RUN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR AND HOW THEY WORK WITH COMMUNITIES. SO I USED TO BE THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND PARTNERSHIPS, AND THE KEY WORD THERE IS PARTNERSHIPS. MY OFFICE PARTNERED WITH STATE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS, MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. SCHOOLS, THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CREATING UPSTREAM PREVENTION PROGRAMS. THESE ARE PROGRAMS THAT CAN DO A NON-CRIMINAL JUSTICE INTERVENTION IF SOMEONE IS GRAVITATING TOWARDS VIOLENCE THE WAY WE MIGHT DO A NON-CRIMINAL JUSTICE INTERVENTION IF SOMEONE WAS GRAVITATING TOWARDS SUICIDE, UH, AND THESE PROGRAMS HAD AMAZING PRO. WE REALLY DEMONSTRATED PROOF OF CONCEPT, AND I THINK AMERICANS WOULD BE REALLY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT THIS VERY MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM WAS DOING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS. IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND. I MEAN, EVEN WORKING IN GOVERNMENT FROM MYSELF, I DIDN'T DO THIS, OBVIOUSLY, THAT PREVENTION AND WORKING WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES IS SUCH A PIVOTAL PART OF WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES AROUND THE COUNTRY. PART OF YOU CAME TO THE JOB WITH TWO DECADES OF NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERIENCE WHICH I THINK WAS APPLIED FOR IN A RANGE OF WAYS. YOU'RE WORKING IN PREVENTING ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF VIOLENCE. HOW IS THAT APPLIED AND WHY IS HAVING THAT EXPERIENCE IMPORTANT? OBVIOUSLY THEY'VE TAKEN A DIFFERENT APPROACH WITH YOUR WITH YOUR SUCCESSOR OF SORTS. SURE, UM, YOU KNOW, I TRIED ON A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT ROLES FOR SIZE OVER THE YEARS. I SERVED IN THE ARMY. UH, I WORKED IN NUCLEAR COUNTERTERRORISM. UH, I WENT TO GRAD SCHOOL. I, UH, SPENT 5 YEARS TRAINING THE FBI, THE CIA, THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMUNITY, THE STATE DEPARTMENT, AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ON COUNTERTERRORISM ISSUES. AND ALONG THE WAY, I REALIZED THAT TRADITIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM. UH, WHILE ESSENTIAL IS INSUFFICIENT, THAT WE NEEDED SOMETHING ELSE BESIDES RESPONDING TO ALREADY MOBILIZING VIOLENT ACTORS. WE NEEDED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO EVER GOT TO THAT POINT WHERE THEY WANTED TO ENGAGE IN VIOLENCE AND. I STARTED TO LOOK AROUND AT OTHER PROFESSIONAL, UH, DISCIPLINES. IT TURNS OUT THAT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY FOR OVER 3 DECADES HAS BEEN TAKING EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACHES TO OTHER FORMS OF VIOLENCE PREVENTION, WHETHER THAT'S SUICIDE OR INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE PREVENTION, VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN, AND I JUST SAID, WELL, WHAT IF WE PICK UP THIS WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM OTHER FORMS OF VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND PUT IT DOWN ON THIS VERY EXOTIC FORM OF VIOLENCE THAT WE'VE, WE'VE SAID WAS HOMELAND SECURITY BUSINESS, NATIONAL SECURITY BUSINESS, AND IT TURNS OUT. HUMANS ARE HUMANS AND VIOLENCE IS VIOLENCE AND A LOT OF THOSE PROGRAMS REALLY WORK SO I ACTUALLY HAD TO DO THIS FOR 15 YEARS AND REALIZE IT WASN'T WORKING TO KNOW TO LOOK AT ANOTHER GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS TO FIND OUT WHAT DOES WORK. IT'S EXPERIENCE REALLY MATTERS. I, I, YOU LEFT BACK IN MARCH. UM, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN A REALLY HARD DECISION TO MAKE AT THE TIME. IT'S A, A, A KIND OF YOU YOU'VE BEEN WORKING AND THINKING ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS EFFECTIVELY FOR SOME TIME, UM. WHAT WAS THAT DECISION LIKE AND ARE YOU STILL IN TOUCH WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL WORKING IN THE PROGRAM NOW? ALMOST EVERY DAY, UH, I'M IN TOUCH WITH WITH MY COLLEAGUES. UM, IT WAS A DREAM JOB. UH, IT WAS A BRUTALLY DIFFICULT JOB INITIALLY WE HAD TO CHANGE, UH, A CULTURE TO ADOPT THIS PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMED APPROACH. WE HAD TO DO A LOT OF INTERNALIZING AND AND AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AS A TEAM, BUT, UH, LEAVING THAT ORGANIZATION WAS, UH, GUTTING FOR ME, UM. WE HAD SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL GOING AND THE TRACTION WE WERE GETTING ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH OUR PARTNERS WAS REMARKABLE. UH, BUT 8 OF MY PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEES WERE FIRED WRONGFULLY. UH, THEY, THEY HAD RECEIVED AN EMAIL SAYING THAT THEIR PERFORMANCE WAS LACKING, AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THEIR PERFORMANCE WAS NOT LACKING. THEY WERE EXTRAORDINARY. 8 OF THEM, 8, OVER A WEEKEND AND UH, I WAS ALSO NOTIFIED THAT I WOULD NOT, UH, BE RENEWED AT THE END OF MY FIRST 2-YEAR TENURE. SO I KNEW I WAS A LAME DUCK. I COULD SIT ON MY HANDS FOR, FOR 8 WEEKS OR 6 WEEKS AND HOPE NO ONE ELSE GOT FIRED OR I COULD. UH, RESIGN AND PROTEST TO TELL MY PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEES THAT THEY MATTERED, THAT THEIR SERVICE MATTERS, THAT THEY WERE NOT, UH, PEOPLE I WOULD, YOU KNOW, SAY WE SHOULD BE DISCARDING IN THAT WAY, UM, AND THEN I, I WENT TO WORK AT THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY, UH, THERE'S A RESEARCH LAB THERE THAT REALLY LEADS THE FIELDS IN THIS PREVENTION SPACE, AND WE ARE WORKING TO, TO RECREATE THIS GOVERNMENT CAPABILITY OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT. BILL BRANIFF, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'VE BEEN WANTING TO TALK TO YOU SINCE I READ ABOUT YOU IN PROPUBLICA OVER A WEEK AGO. I HOPE YOU'LL COME BACK AND TALK TO US ABOUT THAT AND VIOLENCE PREVENTION, AND I THINK THIS IS AN AREA PEOPLE SHOULD REALLY KEEP THEIR EYE ON. SO THANK YOU AGAIN. I WOULD LOVE TO. AMERICANS SHOULD KNOW THAT VIOLENCE IS PREVENTABLE, AND WE CAN HELP THEM PREVENT IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WELCOME BACK. A STARK NEW WARNING FROM RUSSIA'S VLADIMIR PUTIN ISSUED VIA PRESIDENT TRUMP IN A SOCIAL MEDIA POST, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE SPOKE WITH PUTIN FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR YESTERDAY, AND THAT PUTIN VOWED STRONG RETALIATION FOR THE STUNNING UKRAINIAN DRONE ASSAULT ACROSS MULTIPLE LOCATIONS DEEP INSIDE RUSSIA THIS WEEK. NEW FOOTAGE RELEASED BY THE UKRAINIAN SECURITY SERVICE SHOWS MORE OF THAT ATTACK THAT DEVASTATED SOME AIRCRAFT OF RUSSIA'S BOMBER FLEET, A SURPRISE ASSAULT A WHOLE YEAR AND A HALF IN THE MAKING. LET'S GO TO NBC'S CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT KIR SIMMONS FOR THE VERY LATEST. KIIR, WHERE DOES PUTIN'S RETALIATION THREATS LEAVE POTENTIAL PEACE NEGOTIATIONS? WELL, THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION, AND MUCH OF IT DEPENDS ON WHAT'S IN THE MIND OF NOT PRESIDENT PUTIN, BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP. THE POLITICAL SITE ANA AXIOS, CITING SOURCES WHO DISCUSSED IT WITH HIM, SAY PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLED THOSE UKRAINIAN DRONE STRIKES BADASS. AND STRONG BUT IS CONCERNED THAT THOSE STRIKES WILL MAKE A CEASEFIRE HARDER. SO THE WAR CONTINUES AND SO DOES A PROPAGANDA BATTLE WITH UKRAINE RELEASING MORE DETAILS OF THAT ATTACK ON RUSSIAN BOMBERS WHILE RUSSIA CLAIMING CLEARLY FALSELY FROM THE IMAGES THAT ALL THE PLANES CAN BE REPAIRED. PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT PUTIN OFFERING THEIR FIRST PUBLIC REACTION AS NEW VIDEO EMERGES OF UKRAINE'S DRONE ATTACK THAT DEVASTATED SOME OF RUSSIA'S DEADLY LONG-RANGE BOMBER FLEET. THE MORE THAN 4 MINUTES OF FOOTAGE RELEASED BY THE UKRAINIAN. SECURITY SERVICE SHOWS ADDITIONAL RUSSIAN AIRCRAFT TARGETED, INCLUDING WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN A-50 SPY PLANE. AFTER AN HOUR AND 15 MINUTE PHONE CALL BETWEEN THE TWO MEN, TRUMP SAYING PUTIN TOLD HIM VERY STRONGLY, RUSSIA WILL HAVE TO RESPOND. MOSCOW HAS LAUNCHED AN ONSLAUGHT OF AIR ATTACKS IN RECENT WEEKS. THIS LATEST VIDEO, THE AFTERMATH OF A RUSSIAN DRONE AND MISSILE ATTACK ON KHARKIV IN JUST THE LAST 24 HOURS. TRUMP DID NOT SAY WHETHER HE TRIED TO PERSUADE PUTIN AGAINST ANOTHER DEADLY OFFENSIVE. DESPITE CLOSE TO A RUSSIAN MILITARY CASUALTIES, 400,000 UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS, ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT, AND PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LONG-STANDING CONVICTION THAT PUTIN WAS READY TO END THE WAR. I BELIEVE PUTIN WANTS TO DO IT. AND IF I THOUGHT THAT PRESIDENT PUTIN DID NOT WANT TO GET THIS OVER WITH, I WOULDN'T. I WOULDN'T EVEN BE TALKING ABOUT IT. TRUMP SAID HIS CALL WITH THE RUSSIAN LEADER WAS NOT A CONVERSATION THAT WILL IMMEDIATELY LEAD TO PEACE. THAT IMPASSE DID NOT PREVENT THEM FROM DISCUSSING COOPERATION ON OTHER ISSUES LIKE IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS. IRAN'S CLOSE. RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA ALONG WITH CHINA AND NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN DUBBED AN AXIS OF RESISTANCE. PRESIDENT ZELENSKY WARNING PUTIN FEELS IMPUNITY AND THAT RUSSIA IS GIVING THE FINGER TO THE ENTIRE WORLD. WE JUST HAVE TO PRESSURE HIM AND MAYBE. WE WILL GET PEACE. PRESIDENT ZELENSKY HANDING OUT MEDALS. HIS MESSAGE UKRAINE CAN KEEP FIGHTING. AND BACK TO THAT DRONE STRIKE, TOP UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS INSISTING THAT 41 RUSSIAN AIRCRAFT WERE DESTROYED OR DAMAGED. SO FAR, VISUAL EVIDENCE IS NOT AVAILABLE TO CONFIRM THAT NUMBER. THE RUSSIAN SPY PLANE THAT YOU SAW THERE, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE FOOTAGE, YOU DON'T ACTUALLY SEE IT ON FIRE, BUT THERE IS OTHER FOOTAGE WHICH SHOWS UKRAINE TARGETING RUSSIAN PLANES THAT AT THAT MOMENT ARE LOADED WITH BOMBS, HANNAH. ALL RIGHT, KIR SIMMONS, THANK YOU. JOINING US NOW IS IGOR NOVIKOV. HE'S IN KIEV. HE'S A FORMER ADVISER TO UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY. IGOR, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. CEASEFIRE NEGOTIATIONS SEEM TO BE AT A STANDSTILL RIGHT NOW. RUSSIA HAS ALREADY STEPPED UP ITS BOMBARDMENT OF UKRAINIAN CITIES, VOWING FURTHER RETALIATION AFTER THAT MASSIVE ATTACK. WHAT ARE THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE BRACING FOR TO HAPPEN NEXT? WELL, I'M PRETTY SURE NOTHING WE HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE. ON ONE HAND, ON THE OTHER HAND, OBVIOUSLY PUTIN IS A BIT ANGRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE OPERATION OF SPIDERWEB, BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COST OF THIS WAR FOR PUTIN IS UNBEARABLE. AND SINCE WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH SUPPORT AS WE HAD FROM THE WEST, WE HAVE TO BASICALLY USE THE ASYMMETRICAL WAR TACTICS. I MEAN IT WAS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A SPY THRILLER THAT OPERATION SPIDERWEB. HOW BIG OF A MORALE BOOST WAS THAT FOR UKRAINE? AND I GUESS CONVERSELY, ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT SETBACKS WHEN IT COMES TO REACHING A CEASEFIRE? WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE IN CEASEFIRE UNTIL AUTUMN, TO BE HONEST, BECAUSE PUTIN'S NOT INTERESTED IN THAT. IN THE CONVENTIONAL WARFARE, HE DOES HAVE ADVANTAGE AT THE MOMENT, HENCE OUR ASYMMETRICAL ATTACKS. PLUS, I DON'T THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP IS REALLY HELPING BECAUSE IF YOU ANALYZE WHAT HE SAID, HE BASICALLY SAID THE OPERATION WAS BADASS, SO CONTINUE DOING THAT. PUTIN'S GOING TO STRIKE IN RETALIATION. WELL, NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT, BUT GUYS, I WANT PEACE. I MEAN THAT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT. SO WE KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PUTIN SPOKE FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR, BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP DIDN'T SAY WHETHER HE TRIED TO PERSUADE PUTIN FROM RETALIATING. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE US INVOLVEMENT AT THIS POINT? WELL, IT'S ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC. I MEAN, THAT STATEMENT I SAW FROM HIM ON TRUTH SOCIAL, BECAUSE BASICALLY WHAT HE'S SAYING IS, YOU KNOW, A DICTATOR JUST SAID, I'M GOING TO MURDER A BUNCH OF CIVILIANS BECAUSE IF ANYONE'S GOT ANY DOUBTS, HE'S GOING TO ATTACK CIVILIANS RATHER THAN THE MILITARY TARGETS. YOU JUST WAIT AND SEE. AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, YOU KNOW, THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD, JUST SAID, WELL, YOU KNOW, HE JUST TOLD ME THAT. I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING IN RETURN. IGOR NOVIKOV, THANKS SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THIS PULSE CHECK FROM UKRAINE AND FOR CONTINUING TO PROVIDE THAT INSIGHT. WE APPRECIATE YOU. AND THEN OF COURSE THAT OTHER EXECUTIVE ORDER SIGNING A WIDE ORDER ORDERING A WIDE RANGING INVESTIGATION INTO FORMER PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN AND HIS AIDES, THIS LATEST ATTACK ON HIS POLITICAL RIVAL. TRUMP IS ACCUSING THE AIDES OF COVERING UP BIDEN'S ALLEGED COGNITIVE DECLINE AND USING THE AUTO PEN TO SIGN BILLS AND ASSERT EXCLUSIVE PRESIDENTIAL POWER, INCLUDING ON PARDONS, EXECUTIVE ORDERS, AND OTHER DOCUMENTS. TRUMP DIRECTED ATTORNEY GENERAL PAM BONDI AND THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL TO LEAD THAT INVESTIGATION. BUT THE MOVE APPEARS TO BE AN EFFORT TO POSSIBLY PAVE THE WAY FOR REPUBLICANS TO ARGUE THAT MANY OF BIDEN'S ACTIONS AS PRESIDENT WEREN'T VALID. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR HERE, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DURING THE ADMINISTRATIONS UNDER BOTH PARTIES, HAS RECOGNIZED THE USE OF AUTOEN TO SIGN LEGISLATION AND ISSUE PARDONS FOR DECADES, AND TRUMP PRESENTED ZERO EVIDENCE THAT BIDEN WAS UNAWARE OF ANY ACTIONS TAKEN IN HIS NAME. ALSO, THE PRESIDENT'S ABSOLUTE PARDON POWER IS ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTION. BIDEN RELEASED A STATEMENT THOUGH ON THIS INVESTIGATION. IT READ IN PART, LET ME BE CLEAR, I MADE THE DECISIONS DURING MY PRESIDENCY. I MADE THE DECISIONS ABOUT THE PARDONS, EXECUTIVE ORDERS, LEGISLATION, AND PROCLAMATIONS. ANY SUGGESTION THAT I DIDN'T IS RIDICULOUS AND FALSE. WITH ALL THAT, LET'S BRING IN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER FOR POLITICO JAKE TRAILER. JAKE, LET'S JUST START WITH ALL OF THESE NEW WHITE HOUSE ACTIONS, THE REVIVAL OF THE TRAVEL BAN TARGETING CONTINUALLY HARVARD UNIVERSITY, AND THEN OF COURSE JOE BIDEN. IS THIS A SIGN THAT ALL OF THE MUSK STUFF ON CAPITOL HILL IS GETTING TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE PRESIDENT? YEAH, IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS NOT COMPLETELY UNPRECEDENTED OR UNSURPRISING THAT WE SEE, ESPECIALLY IN A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE. WE WERE LOOKING AT A WEEK WHERE THERE WASN'T A LOT OF GOOD NEWS FOR DONALD TRUMP, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CAME TO POST AFTER POST ON X FROM ELON MUSK GOING AFTER THIS MEGA BILL, CREATING QUITE THE STIR ON CAPITOL HILL AND OVER AT THE WHITE HOUSE. WHEN WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS TAKE PLACE, IT'S NOT. COMPLETELY UNCOMMON THAT A LOT OF TIMES THE WHITE HOUSE KIND OF BURIES SOME OF THOSE OTHER STORIES ALL IN THERE AT ONCE. ALL THESE ACTIONS CAME YESTERDAY EVENING PRETTY UNPROMPTED, ALTHOUGH TALKING WITH WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS AFTER ALL THESE ANNOUNCEMENTS AND EXECUTIVE ORDERS CAME OUT, THEY SAID THIS WAS IN THE LINEUP ALL ALONG. IT IS PRETTY RARE THAT THESE HAPPENED AFTER THE ACTUAL WORKDAY IN THE EVENING TIME, AND IT FELT AS THOUGH A LOT OF THEM HAD JUST PILED UP, KIND OF SWEEPING AND CHANGING. THE NARRATIVE THAT HAD KIND OF CONSUMED WASHINGTON SO FAR THIS WEEK, WHICH HAS BEEN MUSK'S CONSISTENT ATTACK OF THIS MEGA BILL. YES, I DO THINK IT WAS STRIKING AND INTERESTING, JAKE, THE FACT THAT REPUBLICAN SENATORS ON THE HILL WERE ASKED ABOUT THE RESURGENCE OF THE TRAVEL BAN IN THIS NEW FORM, AND THEY BASICALLY SAID, OH WELL, I DON'T ACTUALLY THINK IT'S IN RESPONSE TO WHAT HAPPENED IN BOULDER, COLORADO, EVEN THOUGH THAT'S WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE IS SAYING. EVEN THEY SAID THEY KNEW THAT THIS WAS COMING AT SOME POINT. YEAH, THESE TYPES OF THINGS OFTEN HAPPEN WHENEVER WE SEE THE WHITE HOUSE MOVE REALLY QUICKLY, AND SO THE DETAILS OF THAT ARE STILL PARCHED OUT AND NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR OF THE TIMING OF ALL THIS. BUT YEAH, WE WERE SPEAKING WITH OFFICIALS LATE LAST NIGHT WHO DISCUSSING THE TIMING OF THIS, THEY SAID EXACTLY WHAT YOU DID, THAT THAT BOULDER WAS THE REASON THIS WAS AMPLIFIED AND HURRIED UP. WHEN WE TALKED TO PEOPLE ON THE HILL, THEY SAY THAT'S NOT THE CASE. IT REMINDS ME OF WHEN THE TRADE MINISTER WAS IN AN ACTUAL HEARING ON THE HILL WHENEVER TARIFFS RAPIDLY CHANGED. AND HE WAS ASKED IN REAL TIME, DID YOU KNOW THAT THIS HAS CHANGED? AND HE WAS NOT MADE COMPLETELY AWARE. THE WHITE HOUSE OFTEN MOVES IN A VERY KIND OF QUICK, SPEEDY, AND SOMETIMES NOT FULLY COMMUNICATIVE WAY HERE. THAT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE, AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET A READOUT ON THAT THROUGHOUT THE DAY. YES, OF COURSE, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT, THESE EXECUTIVE ORDERS ARE TYPICALLY SIGNED WITH SOME KIND OF PRESS ACCESS, EVEN IF IT'S JUST FOR THE POOL. THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO TALK THROUGH THESE USUALLY THIS IS DIFFERENT EVEN THOUGH AGAIN THE WHITE HOUSE AND OTHER PEOPLE ON CAPITOL HILL ARE. YEAH, WE HAD SOME SENSE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS WAS COMING. OF COURSE, THE FACT THAT IT COMES AGAINST THIS BACKDROP IS NOTABLE, OF COURSE, JAKE, BECAUSE ELON MUSK IS RAMPING UP HIS CRITICISM OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LEGISLATIVE AGENDA, CALLING ON SENATORS TO KILL THE BILL, LIKE THE SEMINAL BILL THAT WILL DO ALL OF THEIR POLICY ITEMS. IN A SERIES OF SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS YESTERDAY, THE TESLA CEO TRIED TO RALLY REPUBLICANS AGAINST THE LEGISLATION, URGING VOTERS TO CALL THEIR SENATORS AND CONGRESSMEN, WRITING, QUOTE, BANKRUPTING AMERICA IS NOT OK. MUSK ALSO SUGGESTED DRAFTING A NEW BILL THAT WON'T ADD TO THE NATIONAL DEBT. SURE, WHAT? LIKE IT'S HARD. THE COMMENTS MARK WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN ESCALATION IN THE RIFT BETWEEN MUSK AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. ONE SENIOR WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL TELLING NBC NEWS PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOW CONSIDERING HOW AND WHEN TO RESPOND, ADDING THAT HE WAS QUOTE CAUGHT OFF GUARD BUT NOT ENTIRELY SURPRISED BY MUSK'S OPPOSITION. MEANWHILE, HOUSE SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON HAD THIS TO SAY. ELON AND I LEFT ON A GREAT NOTE. WE WERE TEXTING ONE ANOTHER, YOU KNOW, HAPPY TEXT, UH, YOU KNOW, MONDAY, AND THEN, UH, AND THEN YESTERDAY, YOU KNOW, 24 HOURS LATER, UM, HE DOES A 180 AND HE COMES OUT AND OPPOSED THE BILL, AND I, IT SURPRISED ME, FRANKLY. I THINK HE'S, HE'S FLAT WRONG. I THINK HE'S, UM, HE'S WAY OFF ON THIS, AND I'VE TOLD HIM AS MUCH, AND, AND, UH, I'VE SAID IT PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY. I'M VERY CONSISTENT IN THAT, BUT, UM, AM I CONCERNED ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THIS ON THE MIDTERMS? I'M NOT. LET ME TELL YOU WHY, BECAUSE WHEN THE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL IS DONE AND SIGNED INTO LAW, EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN IS GOING TO DO BETTER. WE'RE GONNA WATCH THAT THEORY GET TESTED IN REAL TIME. MEANWHILE, IN THE UPPER CHAMBER, SOME REPUBLICAN SENATORS ARE NOT TAKING MUSK'S CRITICISM LIGHTLY, ASKING HIM TO BE A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC TOO. I CAN'T RESPOND TO GENERALITIES. IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC PROVISIONS IN THE BILL AND SOLUTIONS FOR IT, I MEAN, THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS GOT A LOT OF INSIGHT INTO THE US GOVERNMENT OVER THE LAST 6 MONTHS. GIVE US SOME PRODUCTIVE FEEDBACK THAT WE CAN OPERATE ON. I CAN'T OPERATE ON PLATITUDES OR I CAN'T RESPOND TO PLATITUDES. I WISH HE'D JUST SAY WHAT HE WHAT HE THINKS. UH, LOOK, I THINK MR. MUSK, I'M A BIG MUSK FAN. I THINK HE'S REALLY SMART, UH, I THINK HE'S ENTITLED TO HIS OPINION. UM, HE'S FRUSTRATED. I THINK HE BELIEVES IN MY JUDGMENT CORRECTLY THAT WE'RE QUICKLY BECOMING DEBT SLAVES, UH, THAT CONGRESS NEEDS TO. TO REARN THE MAGICAL HEALING POWER OF NO, UH, AND I AGREE WITH HIM. UH, HAVING SAID THAT, UM, I'M NOT READY TO THROW IN THE TOWEL IN THIS BILL. INTERESTING COMMENTS THERE AND WE'RE GOING TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM SENATOR KENNEDY IN JUST A LITTLE WHILE WHEN HE JOINS MORNING JOE THIS MORNING. BUT A NEW ESTIMATE FROM THE NONPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE FINDS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TAX AND SPENDING BILL WOULD DO AS MUSK AND OTHERS FEAR, ADD $2.4 TRILLION TO THE NATIONAL DEBT OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS. THE SIMPLE MATH ON THE BILL PROJECTS A LOSS OF $3.7 TRILLION IN TAX REVENUE WHILE CUTTING NET SPENDING BY $1.3 TRILLION. THE BUDGET OFFICE ALSO ESTIMATED THAT NEARLY 11 MILLION PEOPLE WOULD LOSE THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE BY 2034 BECAUSE OF SPENDING CUTS AND NEW ELIGIBILITY RULES UNDER MEDICAID. THE NEW BUDGET PROJECTION FACTORS IN A SERIES OF LAST MINUTE REVISIONS THAT REPUBLICAN LEADERS MADE TO PLACATE HOLDOUTS BEFORE THE HOUSE PASSED THE LEGISLATION LAST MONTH. SO JAKE, HOW ARE YOUR SOURCES PARSING THROUGH THIS MOMENT AND WHAT DO THEY THINK FROM A WHITE HOUSE PERSPECTIVE THE ULTIMATE IMPACT ON SENATORS AND THIS LEGISLATION IS GOING TO BE BECAUSE OF MUSK? YEAH, ALI, THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT IS ON EVERY WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL'S MIND RIGHT NOW IS HOW IMPACTFUL IS THIS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE TO THE VOTE. I SPOKE WITH A LOT OF WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS YESTERDAY. IT'S FUNNY, THEY KEPT TRYING TO TELL ME THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS NOT TAKING THIS PERSONALLY. I WOULD THEN TALK TO OTHER FOLKS WHO SAID THAT'S EXACTLY HOW HE'S TAKING IT. THAT'S HOW HE TAKES THESE TYPES OF THINGS. ANOTHER OFFICIAL WAS TELLING ME THAT THIS IS NOT ENTIRELY SURPRISING AS WE'VE HEARD BECAUSE ULTIMATELY, MUSK WAS A SPECIAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE FOR MONTHS AND IN SOME WAYS HAD TO GO ALONG WITH HIS BOSS DONALD TRUMP ON SOME THINGS. HE'S NOW GETTING A CHANCE TO AIR SOME OF THOSE GRIEVANCES OR SOME OF THOSE DISAGREEMENTS, AND HE'S DOING THAT FROM OBVIOUSLY HIS VERY PUBLIC PROFILE. MUSK IS KIND OF THE MONSTER THAT TRUMP CREATED. HE GAVE HIM A LOT OF THIS AUTHORITY AND POTENTIAL INFLUENCE, AND NOW HE'S EXERTING SOME OF THAT. MOST OF THE OFFICIALS ARE TELLING ME. THAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS ACTUALLY HAS THE POWER. MUSK'S CRITICISM DOESN'T HAVE THE POWER TO SINK THE BILL. IT'S NOT THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH ANYMORE. THEY, THEY STILL SAY THEY FEEL VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT THAT. WHAT IT DOES MOST IMPORTANTLY THOUGH, IS IT GIVES SOME OF THESE REPUBLICAN HOLDOUTS THAT THE JOSH HAWLEY'S AND OTHERS WHO ALREADY ARE SHOWING SOME HESITANCY TOWARDS SUPPORTING THIS BILL. WHAT IT DOES IS IT GIVES THEM MORE AND MORE OPPORTUNITY TO DIG. THE HEELS IN AND ULTIMATELY IT MIGHT END UP HAVING TO MAKE THE WHITE HOUSE GIVE CERTAIN CONCESSIONS TO THESE SENATORS THAT THEY WEREN'T PLANNING ON DOING IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO IT DOESN'T ENTIRELY SINK THE BILL THEY SAY, BUT IT DOES FRUSTRATE THEM AND THAT'S CLEAR FROM SOME OF THE RESPONSE YESTERDAY. I THINK THAT'S RIGHT. I MEAN, IT DEFINITELY SHAKES THE TURF ON CAPITOL HILL. WHAT I THINK SOME PEOPLE ON THE HOUSE SIDE WERE EXPECTING TO BE MINIMAL CHANGES FROM THE SENATE. NOW THEY ARE BOLSTERED IN THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE SOME AND THE WHITE HOUSE. MAY HAVE TO GIVE THEM THAT COVER BECAUSE OF ELON MUSK AND THEN ONCE AGAIN IT LEAVES HOUSE REPUBLICANS IN THE POSITION THAT MANY OF THEM WERE WORRIED ABOUT, WHICH IS DEFENDING ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL THE MOST WE COULD SAY EXTREME VERSION OF THIS BILL, AND THEY'RE GOING TO STILL HAVE TO TAKE THAT BACK TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS AFTER DEFENDING MUSK AND DOGE FOR ALL OF THESE MONTHS IN FRONT OF ANGRY TOWN HALLS. JAKE TRAILER, THANK YOU AS ALWAYS FOR COMING ON. WE APPRECIATE YOUR REPORTING. A LOT TO COVER HERE." />

History: How Fascists Rewrite the Past to Control the Future and he joins Michelle Martin now to discuss how new teaching guidelines are stoking a culture of fear and why he's taking drastic measures as a result thanks Christian professor Jason Staley thanks so much for talking with us once again thank you Michelle it's great to be in conversation in this existential time so so you've been thinking about and writing about authoritarianism for quite a while you recently wrote a piece for the Guardian in which you said that President Trump is leading the country down the path of educational authoritarianism what does that mean that means that he's creating a culture of fear in universities they already have done this in states like Florida uh creating a culture of fear in K through2 education but authoritarianism uh requires a culture of fear it requires uh feeling like the state is always looking o over your shoulder feeling like there are vague rules that you can be punished for and your fellow citizens have been empowered to report you that's the first thing it means the second thing it means is that there's an official state ideology and if you violate the official state ideology you get in trouble what sparked your latest piece uh for the Guardian was this dear colleague letter that the Department of Education issued the Office of Civil Rights issued on February 14th it was a letter to American educational institutions and it essentially reinterpreted federal civil rights law let me just read a little bit of it it said that educational institutions have toxically indoctrinated students with the false premise that the United States is built upon systemic and structural racism and advanced discriminatory policies and practices and that proponents of these discriminatory practices have attempted to further justify them particularly during the last four years under the banner of diversity equity and inclusion you know DEI smuggling racial stereotypes and explicit race consciousness into everyday training programming and discipline so first of all your reaction to this and and tell us why you were so concerned about this that you you said that this is what is the is the sign that that is the intention of the administration to move toward this path well the the dear colleague letter announces that it's the intention uh of the administration to move towards this path and in Linda McMahon's uh final mission statement of the Department of Education she mentions patriotic education as uh as sort of the goal here of uh to impose on K through 12 uh and universities uh so the problem here is that the United States is founded and built upon systemat systematic racism and inclusion it's part of our founding documents that uh that we wanted to take more indigenous land uh so slavery the United States is built on slavery there's no factual argument about that so when you begin by saying that universities and K through2 schools are not allowed to teach facts then you're already on a very problematic uh playing field and part of the point of these guidelines is to be vague because it allows wide latitude to target professors and to encourage students to report professors for anything that might suggest that the United States was not always the greatest nation on earth and was essentially free from sin is is is part of the issue here because I mean because to take it from the other direction I mean conservatives would say that that progressives or non-conservatives whatever you want to say are are are just mad because they're offering an alternative ideology that they're just they're replacing one ideology with another and that you know I think their argument is elections have consequences and they get to do that like what do you say to that there's no such thing i mean in a democracy the state cannot impose uh a required uh patriotic ideology uh I mean universities are not there in a democracy to uh to uh as to stoke egos of the citizens of a country just imagine what uh your cartoon vision of an authoritarian country it's where the purpose of schools is to tell students to love their country and not question it in a democracy universities are there to teach the facts they're not there to to breed patriotism these documents explicitly tell us the purpose of schools and universities is to create patriotic citizens that is not the purpose of univer that's nationalist education that is not democratic education what they've been doing by banning critical race theory which is essentially banning black history because you're banning the study of institutions that developed under slavery and Jim Crow that have repercussions today so you're banning that with these vague guidelines you know they say we're not banning that but the guidelines are so vague that you would be you know you would be foolish to test whether or not it's really banning that so what what's your evidence of that though what's your evidence that that is the case because I think other people might look at that and say &quot;Well they're vague that means that there's room for interpretation.&quot; So why do you say that the vagueness is itself a problem well the uh a conservative intellectual in a New York Times uh uh article uh where I was also quoted said you know terms like DEI are vague so they allow us wide latitude to target people uh because they leave they leave it open to interpretation and that's the point so we can basically target anything we want by calling it DEI and that's what Christopher Rufo one of the main political activists behind this strategy said he said uh early on we're going to call the federal bureaucracy critical race theory and then people will want to take it on take it down this is evocative of the Republican southern strategy of calling anything they don't like welfare and then that would create negative attitudes towards it and now this does the vagueness does leave room for contestation but would you like to go in front of a school board would you like to go in in front of a title six office with a lawyer to defend that con uh that that in the interpretation that it does not that your teaching about slavery or Jim Crow or mortgage redlinining uh does not fit uh does not fall under these prohibited guidelines uh that's really a distraction from your work legal fees are very expensive uh most teachers and professors if not all teachers and professors would like to avoid that american universities have been engines of tremendous wealth tremendous innovation there's a reason why people want to come from all over the world to study at these universities including people like Peter Teal and Elon Musk um because of because of their role in creating private wealth through the accumulation of knowledge so why is it that they in in your estimation that these activists are so and this administration is so sort of hellbent on bringing universities to heal can I be frank Michelle i hope so uh they are destroying my country they are intentionally destroying my country vlad they're saying Vladimir Putin is an ally they're taking down the federal bureaucracy they're taking down the schools and universities to enrich the the billionaire class and then they're throwing scapegoats to the American people to the working people trans women black Americans uh it's about uh juicing up dominant group victimhood it's about telling white Americans you're the real victims and once we target all the people who made you feel like you weren't the real victims all the people who are making you feel guilty for inheriting your house from your parents when they didn't have a couldn't inherit a house from your parents once we do that then everything's good for you and we can dismantle the country uh that's what's going on and starting out with the universities uh is vital you take down the universities you tell people universities are just for job skills they're not for they're not democratic institutions anymore uh and then so you encourage people not to go and uh you encourage people not to go to universities you make student loans more difficult more expensive privatize them uh and you and then you delegitimize the university one of the things that you talked about is the fact that Columbia University is the source of particular eye to this administration and also to let's say members of Congress who made a point of making a pilgrimage to the university to um you know to express their outrage at what they consider to be anti-semitic demonstrations that started in the wake of Israel's war on Gaza colombia agreed to a list of Trump demands in order to re reinstate some $400 million in federal funding that the administration revoked as they said for punishment for Colombia's failure to protect uh its Jewish students so let me ask you about this because the reality of it is there are a lot of Jewish students at Colombia who did feel threatened and demeaned by these by these demonstrations so some people are looking at this and they say that this is kind of an outrageous capitulation on Colombia's part but other people are saying well you know maybe this was just a pragmatic step to try to survive this era what do you think there were a tremendous number of Arab students who felt incredibly threatened at Colombia what about them their people too first secondly at Yale and I'm sure this is true of Colombia there were a very large number of Jewish students in those protests because who on campus cares the most about the behavior of Israel well one group are Jewish students but the way the administration is using the term anti-semitism is synonymous with leftism which is ironic because the large majority of Jewish Americans voted for Kla Harris uh you know comparable to black Americans so but the administration is using the term anti-semitism as short for leftism so Jewish Americans like me who are highly critical of Israel uh I mean I don't know what the phrase right to exist means but you know I'm not you know I don't want to take down the state of Israel i'm some kind of Zionist however I'm very critical of the behavior of the state of Israel and there were plenty of students it was it was you know tied for the largest identity group in the protests so why don't they count as Jewish well the administration is saying there are good Jews and bad Jews and good Jews are the ones who uh support Israel's actions in Gaza and bad Jews are the people like me uh who uh who are highly critical of what is happening and push for Palestinian rights uh because Palestinians deserve every bit of political equality uh that Jews Jewish people deserve so this Yeah you you argue that the Trump administration is using the pretext of Jewish safety to justify crackdowns on disscent and critical scholarship and you actually have said that you think this actually reinforces anti-semitic tropes so can you say can you say more about that this is reinforcing anti-semitic tropes all across the political spectrum what is the the most what are the most toxic anti-semitic tropes well Jews control the institutions this is absolutely reinforcing this any young American is going to think remember what happened when they took down the world's greatest university system uh on behalf of Jewish safety uh and uh this will go down in history books the history of this era will say that that Jewish people were the sledgehammer for fascism so if we don't speak out if we American Jews do not speak out against this this will be a grim history chapter in our history as Americans the first time in my life uh as an American that I have been fearful of our status as equal Americans not because of the protests on campus which as I said were uh had a lot of Jewish students in them but because we are suddenly at the center of politics of US politics it's never good to be in the crosshairs for us and we are being used to destroy democracy the history books are going to be harsh unless we Jewish Americans can say this should not be done in our name and finally by focusing on us they're erasing the atrocities and horrors that are happening in Gaza and they're shifting the true victims here uh not just Palestinians who are here but the victims in Gaza uh and the West Bank uh of the Israeli government's policies well then um well I have two questions here that first of all why do you think that Colombia has agreed to these these terms including you know banning face masks and empowering campus police officers to remove people from campus or arrest them if needed why why would Colombia which is not a a poor institution agree to these terms two reasons first of all uh there are people within the Colombia structure who are essentially betraying Colombia they agree with this ideological attack uh I think uh that is really problematic they're not seeing it they're in fact traitors to their own institutions uh so that's one point uh the this the second point is uh that um you know this Colombia is completely bending to an authoritarian regime and what we're seeing across universities Michelle is we're seeing this culture of fear this idea that if we just do what they say everything will be okay but I'm seeing this everywhere and it's one reason that uh I am probably leaving the United States to the University of Toronto is that is that is that I was going to ask what what are your thoughts about your own course here so you you feel strongly enough about this that you are going to leave the country yes uh because what I would not do this if I saw all of our universities banding together but it's not just the universities Michelle it's the law firms it's all of our American institutions uh when uh when Paul Weiss Paul and Weiss uh uh capitulated the part of the reason they capitulated is other law firms instead of defending them were going after their clients now we see universities saying things including my university like &quot;We're going to keep our head down so we're not targeted.&quot; As soon as I heard that vocabulary I knew sort of you know it might be that game the game is over because you're not banding together if you say we're going to keep our head down so So so I want to get back to you though you you are you're leaving um any any regrets about that do you you feel in a way you're abandoning the fight or how do you see it i think Canada is very centrally in the fight right now so uh you know I uh I would return to the United States my home uh in a heartbeat and I hope you know and that's why I'm saying I'm probably moving to Canada because I might return to Yale uh if so uh if the they essentially allow me with with leave structures i'm leaving because the political climate for the universities and the political climate for freedom looks grim in this country we face a fascist regime so uh so I can best fight it in a country that is dedicated to fre to the the values that I love the values that America the United States was formed on freedom and equality uh and Canada definitely centers those values i have two black children uh two black Jewish children and you know uh the United States to erase to to use one of their identities as a sledgehammer for fascism and to try to erase another of their identities uh is uh deeply problematic for me and you know there's all these long-standing features of this country like mass incarceration that I worry and uh violent policing that uh obviously with two black sons uh concern me as well but I this is my home the United States is my home it will always be my home i'm a patriotic American and I want to fight for our country but I do have two small children i do have two young children uh and I do think that the institutions that I love uh are being existentially threatened and they're not defending themselves uh in a way that gives me any kind of uh hope uh that free inquiry will still be possible professor Jason Stanley thank you so much for talking with us you've certainly given us a lot to think about thank you so much Michelle [Music] [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="through all the chaos in the Middle East there is one big unanswered [Music] question how did Israel not see this coming we have breaking news out of Israel this morning where Hamas has launch a surprise attack a surprise attack a surprise attack a surprise attack how did one of the most well-resourced intelligence communities in the world specifically designed to prevent this exact thing from happening failed to detect an operation that involved months of planning meetings in multiple countries and thousands of militants in part two of our series on the Israel Gaza conflict we're looking at Israel's Security operation an operation that's maintained nearly full control over the borders and movement of people in Gaza for a decade that suddenly saw a rag tag bunch of militants flood through literal holes in the wall and threaten Israel in a way it hasn't been threatened before I'm Matt Bon I'm a little bit Husky and this is if you're listen it was October 1973 in London and an Egyptian man named Ashraf marwin called a meeting marwin was well connected he was the son-in-law of the previous Egyptian president and now the top Aid to the new president bit of a nepo baby what is bosses in Egypt didn't know is that he was also a spy marn's meeting was with the head of the Israeli spy agency mad you see Egypt was planning to attack Israel and marwin was giving Israel a warning they had 18 hours before Egypt and Syria would invade but the Israeli were a little bit sick of marwin you see he'd warned mad twice before that war was imminent both times it had been a false alarm thousands of troops had been mobilized for nothing it was a classic boy who cried Invasion scenario and now marwin was telling them that the war was going to kick off again this time on yum kapor the holiest day on the Jewish calendar a massive national holiday in Israel news of the invasion was slow to reach the top levels of the Israel government time was wasted and Israel was not prepared but marwin was right the war's outbreak took the World by surprise Egypt and Syria launched a simultaneous surprise attack Egyptian forces are at present engaged in military operations it caught Israel off guard and led to thousands of casualties the armies of Egypt and Syria are still battling with Israeli troops on the Sinai Peninsula and the Goan Heights it was seen as the biggest intelligence failure in Israeli history that is until exactly 50 years and one day [Music] later Israel's main method of Defending themselves from Hamas is to literally contain them in the Gaza Strip no one goes in and no one goes out without the express permission of the Israeli government to achieve that they've built what they refer to as the obstacle from a distance it looks like a fence but it's so much more than that the fence is 6 M high and under it is a deep underground concrete wall which will be very difficult to Tunnel through but that's not all that bario is not standing alone and it won't stand alone it's part of a cocktail the main ingredients of the cocktail are a concrete wall and two fences but it's the garnishes that are really interesting remote control drones remote operated cameras remote operated gun turrets with AI assisted targeting remote seismographs to detect any digging nearby it's all Wireless with solar panels and battery backups to save it from power outages it can be operated from a central location and doesn't need thousands of troops patrolling up and down the Border it's 65 km long and gives Israel confidence that they can decide who comes to their country and the circumstances in which they come on top of that Israel's installed the high-tech Iron Dome missile defense system which can automatically detect rockets and shoot them out of the sky Israel is very proud of it the military says hundreds of rockets have been intercepted so far and in any case the Israeli government was increasingly convinced that Hamas was less extreme dream now and weren't as much of a threat besides they were trapped behind an impregnable Ultra Hightech border fence and so Hamas slipped down their priority list a long way down with their new sense of security the Israeli government focused on expanding and protecting settlements on the West Bank now it's crucial to understand what a settlement is if you look at the West Bank on a map it looks like a kidney bean but if you look at it properly it's actually more like a piece of Swiss cheese the Palestinians live in the holes the cheese bits are controlled by Israel on nearly every Hilltop around here are Israeli settlements gated communities of Jewish residents in the middle of the land Palestinians want for their future state so pockets of Palestinians surrounded by Israelis this has not yet led to peace and Harmony and so the Israeli security Services have been deployed to keep the peace Israeli soldiers occupy more than 60% of the West Bank there are checkpoints patrols military posts and noo zones throughout the whole area we'd save a heck of a lot of money if we could disand if we could disband the Army it's there to protect us according to international law these Israeli settlements are illegal I believe in the right of the Jews to reestablish our home homes in our villages in areas which were for thousands of years uh part of the Jewish history one of the long-term residents of these settlements is itamar Ben who has been making news for decades as a member of the radical Jewish kak movement branded a terrorist organization by the US government he's been arrested hundreds of times and spent more than 9 months in jail benav is an ultra Nationalist and a violent activist a convicted criminal with a WRA sheet that includes inciting racism and supporting a terrorist organization go home anti his politics are so extreme that he was disqualified from compulsory military service for years he had on his wall a photo of Jewish terrorist Barak Goldin who killed 29 Palestinians and injured more than 100 in 1994 in court he likes representing himself he's done this so often that judges started suggesting that he probably should just go and study law to give himself a better chance once he became a lawyer he specialized in defending Israeli Jews accused of hate crimes and terrorism he was elected to the Israeli parliament in 2021 that didn't stop him from getting out into the streets to to defend the rights of Israeli settlers in October last year he was filmed at the sight of a violent clash between settlers and Palestinians in East Jerusalem as he's pulled away from the scene by police he urges them to shoot Palestinians who throw stones then he reached under his suit jacket and pulled out an actual handgun and started waving it around that's at the time he was a minor party backbencher prone to trolling and don't we all know and love those guys but the following month he got a massive promotion Benjamin Netanyahu desperate for Coalition Partners signed a deal with Ben gavier in exchange for his party support Ben gavier would become the minister for National Security in charge of keeping Israelis safe and protecting them from Hamas but he had other things on his mind Benjamin netanyahu's six term as Israeli Prime Minister has been dominated by right-wing parties in his Coalition that want to Annex the entire West Bank just days into his tenure Ben gav decided it would be a good idea to go and visit the AL AXA mosque at Jerusalem's Temple mount in Israeli politics this is the equivalent of waving a gun around in the street for extremely complicated reasons that go back literally thousands of years is Israeli leaders visiting the mosque tends to make many Muslims extremely angry and has on several occasions in the past led to violence a surprising Unity ticket formed with Hamas the United Nations and the United States government asking benier not to do it Hamas called it provocative the UN and US said it risked inflaming tensions and the Israeli opposition said it risked the nation's security and the safety of its citizens keep in mind Ben is the national security minister the Temple Mount is open for everybody Muslims Christians and yes also Jews we make it clear to Hamas we don't give in we don't surrender we don't blink sure I mean what are they going to do about it right the Israeli government meanwhile ramped up the establishment of settlements in the West Bank benav personally ordered several unauthorized Palestinian homes to be bulldozed to make room for more settlements with that violence increased around the settlements as well according to the United Nations 2022 was the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank since they began recording fatalities in 2005 2022 was bad but 2023 has been worse Ben has expressed little interest in doing anything about this what he's very interested in doing something about is attacks on Settlers the Palestinian gunman shot dead seven people near near a synagogue in a settlement in East Jerusalem except now he's not waving his gun around he's encouraging Israelis to arm themselves I want weapons on the street I want Israeli citizens to be able to protect themselves benav made Law and Order in the West Bank his top priority deploying more troops and police to defend settlers and raid the homes of suspected terrorists it's one of a series of Israeli raids that have killed dozens of Palestinians in the last month alone with the high-tech but lightly manned Gaza border fence Israel's strategy was based on the idea that they would deploy troops there if they were alerted that something was coming picking up warnings was vital so were there any warnings [Music] well 25 days before the attack Hamas released a video of their Fighters training for a massive assault on the border Defence and Israeli Army Camps the video was highquality propaganda of what looked like a very well equipped operation with drones flying around and large groups of well-armed men moving quickly through a training course I've watched the video of this rehearsal and video of the actual attack and they're difficult to tell apart aside from the blood in the real version this is the kind of thing that should have triggered an alarm in Israel I mean Israel has spy agencies surely they would hear or see something concerning and then send troops and guards to the fence to deal with it and yet it seems that the system didn't really work the thought of 2,000 Hamas terrorists overcoming a multi-billion dollar security system I don't think was on anybody's radar screen in terms of possibilities so so the propaganda video from Hamas was warning number one 10 days before the attack came warning number two the Egyptian intelligence agency which is now a friend of Israel called Benjamin netanyahu's office to tell the Prime Minister that Hamas was planning something unusual a terrible operation and yet it seems this was ignored too six days before the attack the Israeli National Security advisor Zaki HBY was confidently telling the Israeli Defense Force radio station that Hamas had pivoted to a position of unprecedented restraint three days before the attack Egypt called to warn Netanyahu again according to Egyptian officials Netanyahu wasn't concerned and was more focused on the West Bank Netanyahu denies that he ever got a call itar benier began planning another another visit to the alaxa mosque when Israeli officials went to bed on the 6th of October exactly 50 years after the Yum kapore War Began they slept soundly with no clue of what was going to happen in the morning it started at 6:30 small drones packed with explosives flew out of Gaza they flew directly to their targets the mobile internet Towers which enabled the entire Gaza border security system to operate and the observation towers with AI targeted machine guns they dropped explosives on the towers taking them out they also dropped explosives on the tanks stationed along the border the billion dooll remote control defenses were offline paragliders took off covered by rocket fire and flew over the fence attacking any troops nearby then then Hamas Fighters charged at the fence with bulldozers explosives motorbikes and trucks they were able to drive right up to it and take it down the fence no matter how many senses at the end of the day it's effectively a metal fence right the militants attacked the headquarters of the Israeli border security operation they killed the soldiers inside many of whom were still in bed for the entire morning they rampaged almost unchallenged across Southern Israel before the Israeli Defense Force was able to arrive and fight back 1500 Hamas Fighters were killed which is an extraordinary number and it's indicative of how big an operation this obviously was from hamas's perspective in the days after the attack Hamas gloated about how successfully they'd fooled Israel they've openly said they wanted to lull Israel into a false sense of security something which appears to have worked perfectly you got to call spade and Spade and this was a massive costly failure and Israel knows that it was a failure almost identical to the 150 years beforehand Hamas has specifically cited increased settler violence and itamar Ben's visits to the alaa mosque as their reasons for the attack which they called operation alaxa flood benav hasn't accepted any responsibility despite the fact that the border of police are his responsibility as the minister of National Security he says now is not the time for investigations but it does seem that his role in this debacle has been noticed he's been excluded from the war cabinet formed by Netanyahu and opposition parties to deal with the current emergency it's worth noting that in 1973 Israel did eventually win the Yon kapore War we'll see if the parallels continue

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] thank you so much R Shir for sitting here with me today talk about many things that Hing we can explore together one being Judaism in relation to Zionism and vice versa what you've turned uh Israel's armed materialism then possible new for of allyship between Palestinians and Orthodox Jews and everything in between those things but perhaps we can start with this question which I know is one you've explored so thoroughly is this relationship or lack thereof between Judaism and Zionism and for you if I understand correctly um they are not only different but at odds yeah it's more than at odds they work as kind of a team actually in the sense that a disease works as a team with its cure Judaism is the disease and Zionism is the cure Zionism was designed to create a new type of Jew the reason they wanted to create a new type of Jew is because because the uh old zionists back in the day 1800s uh they looked at the Jews as disgusting they looked at the Jews as weak they looked at the Jews as cowardly unmanly was a word that they used often they basically absorbed the anti-semitic tropes of Jews and they believed it see a little history is in order over here Jews for thousands of years were religious uh people a monastic people we lived in what they called ghettos but about a thousand years ago the Jews themselves requested to be segregated because we are loyal citizens to the countries we live in but we have a mission in the world as a religious people it's not just merely a religion that you have to believe in God and then you're saved but rather it's a actual lifestyle and a job description that governs every facet of our lives and not only are there dos and don'ts but but there's actual uh a job that we have to do we study and we pray and we the more scholarship you have of God's Bible and the Torah then the higher level you are the closer you are to God and the the deeper your prayers are the higher you are and the closer you are to God and it's a it's a lifetime it's a lifetime uh program being a Jew and the reason why it's a lifetime program is because after the lifetime is over then we stand before God and however much we accomplished in this world that's how much we can retire with for billions and billions of years forever more that's Judaism in a Nell we're here in this world to prepare for the afterlife and if you ever prepared for a test you know that you shut the doors and you shut the phone and you just lock everybody out and you say come back to me in a couple of weeks when the test is is over we're also preparing for a test but takes our whole life so we had our our way of living Imagine by way of analogy I know shaol and monks on a Hilltop but without the martial arts you know instead there's biblical studies and that's the way Jews were now not everybody uh wanted that lifestyle but Jews were forced to have that lifestyle there was a old historian a Cambridge historian Sao Baron who had a very good line he said that the locks on the inside of the ghetto doors were there before the locks on the outside but there were people that wanted to get out but they weren't allowed to get out until then came the Enlightenment and the Emancipation and we had freedom of religion and freedom from religion and there were Jews that said who whoop we do now we could assimilate and be like everybody else and they tried to assimilate and instead of studying the Torah they wanted to be artists and they wanted to be writers and they wanted to be like everybody else um it didn't work though that was the problem it started in Russia in about 1881 there were programs and the anti-semitic programs attacks lethal attacks against Jews which included the assimilated Jews as well as the religious ones these guys figured that why would anybody attack us why would anybody hate us we're the same as the Russians we're the same as the ukrainians they that led to kind of an identity crisis amongst these assimilated Jews they didn't want to be Jews because they thought the Jews were disgusting um weak pathetic cowardly unmanly um not part of History uninterested in anything useful um but the non-jewish world will not let them be non-jews so what do they do there are various different answers um communism was one of the answers the idea of communism if you believe in it is everybody's going to be treated equal and then the Jews will also be treated equal one of the ideas was Zionism and that ended up the dominance one because at the end of middle of the 20th century um the Jews in Europe were pretty much W wiped out and um because Zionism took place in Palestine to a large extent they ended up the dominant Jewish movement because the others were just wiped off the face of the Earth Zionism believed that the Jews need to change that the reason why people don't like Jews is because the image of the Jew is still of that religious Jew of the disgusting Jew in addition there's something else uh hatable about Jews they don't have a country nationalism in those days was a very strong movement Empires were becoming nation states and the Jews don't have a state and the Jews aren't the people like other people now we weren't because we were religion but they figured look if we could change the Jews into a nationality we could be like everybody else that will have two important results result number one people will look at the Jews differently now you're normal because now you have your own land you have a language you have a culture you're not these weirdos and two more importantly it'll change the Jews themselves the aspirations will change they instead of wanting to finish volumes of the talmud they'll want to win Olympic gold medals they'll want to win euro vision song contests they'll want to be like everybody else they'll want a strong Army so the Zionist set out to create a nationality out of the Jews this was a very it was a daunting task because the Jews had no National characteristics because we were not a nationality we had no common land language or culture h there was no common land cuz for thousands of years the Jews were all over the world and there was nothing wrong with that absolutely nothing wrong with that that's what God wanted and that's where we were God is all over the world we could also be all over the world we had no language or culture because they were Jews in Ethiopia there are Jews in Morocco Yemen uh there are Jews in Syria there are Jews in Germany Spain Russia England these Jews have nothing cultural in common they had one thing in common their religion that's it but the Zionist said no land language culture we need it for the Jews we'll make the Jews a flag like old people have they made a flag that's what's today's Israeli flag which existed before Israel did will create a language so they sat down aen Yehuda his name was to create modern Hebrew a Biblical Hebrew or Rabin Hebrew is not really a speakable language there only few hundred uh root words um so he created an actual modern language modern Hebrew um a national anthem they created H they created uh a culture they had various different ideas about what the culture should be it should be right-wing leftwing fascist socialist and that those differences of opinion led to differences of political parties today in Israel um long story short the religious Jews were very much against this they considered it a form of idol worship it's an actual denial of jewi Jewish identity because Jewish identity is only religious uh for many many centuries the Jews understood the only thing that unites the Jewish people is the fact that God gave the Jews the Torah at Mount Si as the Bible says and that's the only common denominator that Jews have the definition of a Jew is somebody en joined by God to fulfill the Torah being a Jew is a job description the Zionist said no that will not do we will become a nationality and there was always this not tension it was it was worse than tension the zionists wanted to cure the Jews of the aspirations which were to be meek mild humble uh Priestly uh the Bible says the Jews areos a Priestly people you will become strong men Warriors especially Warriors Jews did not like Wars it was very much against our values um you you will become Warriors you'll become strong men you will stop with this cerebral um lifestyle and the studious Pious lifestyle you will be like the kacs you will be like the Germans you will be like the Russians exactly how exactly which country you'll be like in what culture okay there are different Zionist opinions about that and again that resulted in different Zionist political parties today um and that was Zionism designed to wipe out Jewish identity uh destroy it and replace it with Zionist identity very simple and that way the Jews would be normalized and everybody will and the Jews will be normalized will be normal in the eyes of the world they had educational centers they created history books that changed Jewish history that the Jewish aspirations all throughout history was not for a messiah to come and make a renewal of the world and the world become spiritual place no Jewish aspirations were always for National self-determination we were always looking to 2,000 years to come back to our land no we were looking for a Messianic renewal of the world for an esoy for God to come back and end of days no that's not what we were looking at for said the Zionist we were looking for return to our homeland and the the Holy Land Palestine Israel it is never our homeland a Homeland in English the word homeland doesn't say much about what a Homeland is but in other languages including Hebrew Homeland like in French La Patria Fatherland there's Mother Russia it's motherland his Fatherland in Hebrew moles the place you were born and there's a certain in nationalist philosophy a certain organic connection between a people and the place that where the people were born where the people were formed according to Judaism the Jewish people were created at Mount Si in the desert there was no country according to Zionism the Jewish people were created as Israel's Declaration of Independence says in Israel before Israel weren't real Jews Moses never went into Israel but Israel is where the Jews were created and Israel is therefore the Homeland for us it's a holy land Israel for the Zionist it's a Homeland change all the Jewish Concepts change everything from spirituality to politics or from spirituality to physicality from spirituality to materiality keep the names keep the the symbols yes the holy land is valuable to us but not because of the way the Jews think and Jews think it's holy no it's your what Russia is to the Russians and German is to the Germany is to the Germans Israel is to the Jews we wanted an es eschatology in End of Days spiritual spiritual renal of the world said the Zionist no we want National self-determination the Jews are a people only United by our religion by our God we Jews are brothers because we have one father God no it's not true Jews are brothers the same way the Russians of Brothers we are Nationals and that's it now that's why Zionism is opposed to Judaism and never mind the fact that the zionists violate the Jewish religion in all sorts of ways um the most blatant is that we're not allowed to have uh sovereignty over that land until the Messiah comes but set that aside for now the very definition of a Jew according to Zionist is different than the definition of a Jew according to Judaism when I say Jew and Benjamin nanyu says Jew it's only hins so if you want to know the definition of Zionism really the Zionist won't even tell you what the definition of Zionism is they'll every Zionist will tell you that whatever you say that's not really the definition definition is the right for the Jews to do the all Zionism instead of talking about the definition of Zionism it's better um to realize that every Zionism presupposing is two things thing number one the Jews are a nationality not just the religion thing number two Israel is the state of that nationality in the words of Israel's own website aan wrote an article there that says the following and Dani alone said the same thing uh the zionists say this Netanyahu wrote this kind of different language but same idea in one of his books what Japan is to the Japanese and France is to the French Israel is to the Jews okay and therefore by the way that's why Netanyahu and all of these guys say anti-zionism has to be anti-Semitism this is coming from Benjamin Netanyahu you cannot say I'm against the existence of the United States of America but I want an American identity you can't say I'm against the existence of France France and say I want a french identity so too you can't say I'm against the existence of Israel and want a Jewish identity without Israel it's like French without France it's like the Japanese without Japan now the whole thing is baloney because the Jews existed way before Israel did we exist now independent of Israel there was no connection between the existence of the Jews the identity of the Jews and the state of Israel yet the state of Israel wants to own Jewish identity to the point where Japan is to the Japanese what Israel is to the Jews that's Zionism it's the nationalization of Jewish identity okay it's not even Jewish nationalism it's more than that a Christian nationalism let's say would say that would agree that Christianity is a religion but it should rule the nation um white nationalism would agree that whites are whites but they should also be a nation Zionism doesn't say merely that being Jew is a religion but this religion should run a country the Jews are primarily a nationality they also had a religion like the Greeks had a religion they had they worshiped Zeus and I don't know what the Scandinavians had Odin the Jews had our God but the Jews are a nationality like Greeks are a nationality okay that's Zionism and that's a absolute eraser of Jewish identity now this idea of Zionism it causes a lot of problems for the Jews and for non-jews first thing is that I am a Jew by religion I'm a citizen of the United States of America my family's from Poland we've been there for hundreds of years is Israel my country there is United States of America my country well Israel has a nation state law 2018 that Israel is officially the nation state of the Jewish people remember Zionism means the Jews are nationality and Israel is the state of that nationality but I thought I'm an American and America is my country this was one of the biggest objections to Zionism from both religious and non-religious Jews in England when they had the ball declaration there was one Jewish member of the um cabinet his name was Edwin montigue he was against the bord Declaration he was against Zionism he said you're going to make Jews um strangers foreigners in their own countries he says you want to make a Jewish state that means that the Jews will be strangers in their own countries and indeed Netanyahu comes to America he did so when he he came to speak to Congress about Barack Obama's Iran deal which he wanted a squelch and he said I come here representing not only the people that elected me but I represent all Jews all over the world Netanyahu claims to be my prime minister na toi Bennett said after Barack Obama insulted nanyu he called him a coward using a nasty colloquialism that insulting Netanyahu is insulting all the Jews all over the world Netanyahu is not only the prime minister of Israel he's the prime minister of the Jews Jonathan Pard the Israeli spy that was convicted for spying on America he did his time he would move back to Israel he had not long ago said it was in all of Israel's papers he would advise Jews to spy on America for Israel according to Zionism Israel is my country when Israel says that Japan is to the Japanese what and France is to the French what Israel is to the Jews imagine there's two people in France a Jewish guy and a non-jewish guy Fran is to the French what israels to the Jews he doesn't mean the Israeli Jews he means the French Jews too so Fran is to the non-jewish Frenchmen what Israel is to the Jewish Frenchmen Zionism by definition is anti-Semitic therefore because it it makes Jew it's a it's a um dual loyalty Trope not only dual loyalty Trope it demands my loyalty it demands that it claims that it represents Me by its own law now mind you there is not a single country in the world like that there is no other country in the world that claims to be the state of people that are not its citizens never were its citizens don't live there never did live there I have a right by international law to change my nationality if I don't like my President Joe Biden I can move to Mexico and then Mexico is my nation states if they'll have me but no matter where I run what country I live in Benjamin who claims to be my prime minister because I was born Jewish that sounds like a dictatorship not a democracy to me you know they may give people equal rights over there but if I can't escape from that that being my nation state doesn't sound like a democracy to me there is no other country in the world like that now we need to understand this Israel is different than all other countries in the world all other countries in the world are the countries of its citizens Israel is not the country of its citizens by Israeli law Israel is the country of the Jews meaning if you are an Israeli citizen but you're not Jewish Israel is not your country by that I mean Israeli law says you have no self-determination rights in Israel unless you're Jewish so if this is the country of the Jews and the non-jews are there yes they're there with equal civil rights they are citizens but Israel is not their country Israel could never allow non-jewish people to run the country has to be a Jewish majority now more than that by Israeli law remember I said that the Jews are a nation and Israel is a state by Israeli law there was no such thing as an Israeli nationality Israel census uh it has various different categories for people there's religion and there's nationality and citizenship nationality is Jewish nationality is Arab nationality is Jews citizen Israeli Israel is the country not of its citizens Israel is the country of a nationality now you have to understand how Israel looks at themselves and if we understand this we'll understand a lot of things about why Israel behaves in many ways that they do and why they look at themselves in certain ways as opposed to the rest of the world looking them at them in other ways there are people who have said that Israel is a racist State because it favors Jews okay is turkey a racist State because it favors Turks over people who are not Turks I'm talking about Turkish citizens well obviously not countries are there to serve their people Turks turkey is there to serve the Turkish citizens France is to there to serve the French citizens but Israel is to serve the Jewish Nation they look at all the Jews as other countries look at the citizens of those countries it is the country of the Jews it was made to be to be the country of the Jews now you're going to tell me well okay but every other country you can become a citizen of that country regardless of your nationality well you can convert to Judaism and then you are officially an Israeli National which is weird because even though Israel claims Zionism claims that being a Jew is not a religion it's a nationality if you go through a religious conversion not a naturalization process you go to a rabbi in Belgium and you go through religious conversion maybe anti-zionist rabbis rabbis that don't recognize Israel if you are a Jew by religion you are now a Jew by nationality and by the way that doesn't apply to all Jews by Israeli law even if you're an atheist obviously you you're a Jew and you're entitled to the law of return because has nothing to do with religion although it's kind of contradictory to the fact that if you become if you convert with a religious conversion now you're Jewish National however according to Israeli law if you're born Jewish and you believe in another religion other than Judaism you believe Jesus is the Messiah you believe Muhammad's the prophet you're not a Jew you you believe in no God then you are a Jew you believe God's a trinity no Jew there was a case of a Jew that was born uh Jewish his name was Daniel refusion polish guy he later converted to Christianity he was no anti-semite he helped Jews Escape in World War II because of his status um and after World War II 1948 he like when Israel was formed he wanted to move to Israel and become a citizen on the law of return Israel Supreme Court ruled no he's not Jewish he's Christian but wait if an if a Jew could be an atheist why can't the Jew be a Christian imagine this this brother Daniel that's what was a commite monk if he would say all right I don't believe in Jesus anymore I don't believe in anything anymore I'm an atheist oh now you're Jewish now you can come I'm Christan you're Christian you're no good okay fine I don't believe in Christianity anymore I'm an atheist oh now you're an atheist come to Israel now you're Jewish now you're none of this makes any sense and the reason it does doesn't make any sense is because Israel tried to create something that doesn't exist they tried to create added the Jews a nationality had they wanted to create a new nationality they were pseudo kind of zionists that did want to create a totally new nationality have nothing to do with the Jews they were called cananim never never got off the ground that would be one thing it was a valid idea it was also a fiction but they had no nobody to buy into it nobody what they did was they tried to Gaslight the Jews and change the Jews and re-educate the Jews to look at themselves differently as a nationality rather than a religion the problem is the Jews for thousands of years have been very very solid in their identity that they're nationality and that they are a religion they have no National characteristics and this whole idea that well if you're a Jew anywhere uh you could come to Israel what's the definition of a Jew Israel has never defined what a Jew is Israel claims to be a Jewish State the Jewish State what's a Jew" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] hi there internet i'm john oliver uh we are off this week but i wanted to quickly check back in to talk to you about a subject that is near and dear to my heart and that is rocks that's right rocks so congratulations whoever just completed their last week tonight topic bingo cards but but i'm not going to be talking to you about just any rocks i'm going to be talking about specific rocks although not straight away because for reasons that will become clear i'm going to need to lay some significant groundwork we really have to ramp up to this one so before i talk to you about specific rocks i'm first going to talk to you about furries and before i talk about furries i need to talk to you about the georgia republican gubernatorial primary remember the rest of my staff is on vacation right now my family went to an island i think and i'm here so we are all where we're supposed to be now if you know anything about the georgia primary it's probably the front runners involved incumbent brian kemp and challenger david perdue but this piece isn't about them to be honest i don't even have time to point out which is which they're both old white republican men who look a lot like that meme of two spider-men pointing at each other instead i want to talk about a third candidate in the election candice taylor she was also running in the republican primary although polling far behind kemp and perdue at around just four percent so she had a real uphill battle on her hands which may be why she came out swinging in this debate appearance donald trump won he won we have a fraudulent pedophile in the white house i'm going to put the constitution first and i'm going to put jesus first every single time and we're going to fix our schools we're going to get rid of this anti-white racism and we're going to get rid of kindergarten teachers men with beards and lipstick and high heels teaching our children we're going to get back to being moral in georgia now obviously there is a lot of offensive on display there from the baseless accusations of voter fraud to naked racial grievances to anti-trans panic too and this is the big one how she spells candice because that is simply incorrect that looks like how a cartoon snake would pronounce the word candies but was that fiery debate performance enough to win her the primary probably not since it was this past tuesday and she lost it um at least i'm assuming that she lost it we take these ahead of time so there is a small possibility that she won but honestly if she did we'll have deleted this video anyway and pretended it never happened so if you're watching this right now that means candice taylor definitely lost and one of these two guys who shared many of her terrible views but in a more media savvy package they won instead and if you're thinking john if you're thinking john why on earth john are you devoting one of your precious few web exclusives which many consider to be a far superior product to the dreck you put on television why are you wasting this yammering on about a barely scene also ran in a primary that just ended i would respond hey hey you don't have to be here why are you watching this to which you might respond because you promised me rocks goddammit where are my rocks and we will get there we will get there i promise but first a little more about candice taylor this was her campaign bus and look you can put whatever you want on a bus like jungkook from bts or this big snake or this although ideally never that but my point is candace's bus made some weird choices i don't know whether it's the i'm the one you've been waiting for with one emphasise for no clear reason or the mixture of cursive and stencil fonts usually reserved for epsy signs like together is my favorite place to be or home is where the wine is waiting or the fact she listed her three campaign priorities as jesus guns babies it is the sort of brain dead knee-jerk culture war buzzword platform that you would expect to appeal solely to mike lindell and guess what you'd be absolutely right because she once tweeted mike lindell understands our movement for jesus guns and babies but for whatever reason the handshake of a deranged pillow baron didn't do much for her numbers and candice seemingly spent the final months of her campaign how any republican who desperately wants attention would and that is by frantically seeking out culture war issues that would give her campaign traction and people do like to see a fighter don't they which is presumably why she posted this campaign video the governor's race in georgia has four establishment politicians and then there's candace taylor and i'm one of you that's the whole clip we didn't edit that down that is the complete video that she posted along with a tweet that said that's it that's the tweet and yeah candice i guess i guess i guess agree to agree on that one i suppose also not for nothing that is the least convincing portrayal of a boxer that i have ever seen and i have seen ed sheeran's shape of you video he looks like ron weasley failing a zumba class now for a while for a while it seemed like candace's chosen enemy would be the manufactured panic the public schools have been formally accommodating the needs of furries which brings me as promised to furries if you are not aware earlier this year a bunch of conservatives fell for some very weird online rumors about what was happening in schools and i will let nebraska state senator bruce bostelman explain i'm a little shocked i guess is what i would put it it's called something called furries we don't know what furries are it's where school children dress up as animals cats or dogs during the school day meow and they bark and now schools are wanting to put litter boxes in the schools for these children to use how is this sanitary [Applause] i mean none of that happened bruce [Applause] first and this is the least of the problems here dogs don't in litter boxes but also neither do furries that is not what furries do what they do do is they use regular toilets where elaborate fursuits and many offer art commissions where you can get yourself done up as a sexy river otter at very reasonable prices they are harmless but candice taylor an adult seeking office remember actually ran on this anti-furry issue issuing 10 proposed executive orders one of which instructed no fury related items will be worn in schools also tweeting the furry days are over when i'm governor which is just an all-time thing to tweet honestly it's an all-time thing to say just try it walk into any room and announce the furry days are over when i'm governor do it right now and see if you don't feel an electric rush of power don't explain yourself why should you after all you're the governor and furry days are over and the replies to that tweet are exactly the sort of response that you would hope for and expect from the furry community one person said if schools are for academics not fairy tales then how come people still teach supply side economics to which i say roasted well several others simply posted furry cartoon asses and if you absolutely had to reduce the furry presence online right down to his bones critiques of conservative economic theory and fuzzy butt shots really are the guiding principles of the whole movement anyway i mentioned candice taylor's ten executive orders she initially only released nine of them and made it clear that number 10 was going to be a major drop even spending days hyping it up online saying evil cannot be negotiated with and must be crushed eo number 10 is going to shake the nation stay tuned which yeah you're right it does sound pretty major doesn't it and you know what when number 10 finally dropped it turned out candice was right the new world order is here and they told us it was coming it's a battle far greater than what we see in the natural it is a war between good and evil [Music] yeah candice isn't around she tweeted that alongside i am the only candidate willing to stand up to the satanic cabal the georgia guidestones must be demolished that was the closing argument of her campaign raising the obvious question hey candace taylor what the are you talking about and at this point it is finally time to talk about rocks and not just rocks remember specific rocks and specifically the georgia guide stones because it turns out they are a roadside attraction in alberts county georgia and taylor is actually not the only one with a sense of animosity towards them the guidestones are the centerpiece of a lot of online conspiracy theories which kind of makes sense they were erected centuries ago by ancient druids except they weren't they were put up in 1980 and the man who commissioned them did so under a pseudonym there are also a functioning astronomical calendar and some think they have paranormal properties like this guy when you take pictures of it [Applause] when you put your head down in there like this and look through it the ball of energy comes through that sucker man i try to get up here three to five times a week you know what i for one believe him not about the blue orb that is ridiculous what i believe about is the scheduling i fully believe that some days that man thinks to himself oh no i've only been up to see the ball of energy twice this week i'm gonna have to move some stuff around the stones also feature massive engravings that have been the subject of a lot of investigation as you can see on this episode of the history channels decoded looks like there's a bunch of different languages i just googled this and we've got english spanish swahili hindi hebrew arabic chinese and russian it seems like to me it seems like a weird new 10 commandments is it 10 [Music] 10 that's weird yeah good catch is it is it a good catch is that the weirdest thing about the 20-foot stonehenge outside of atlanta the number 10 also to television editors everywhere next time you're sitting in the edit bay watching footage of a middle-aged man slowly count to ten don't put it to dramatic music you can just edit it out people will honestly thank you in fact here are 10 reasons why you should do that what but they are right in that the stones feature weird aspirational instructions mostly vague catch-all edicts like protect people and nations with fair laws and balance personal rights with social duties and guide reproduction wisely improving fitness and diversity you know some broad feel good precepts mixed in with some light to medium eugenics but but the line that the controversy focuses on reads maintain humanity under 500 million in perpetual balance with nature and i will say at this point you could see how anyone who believes in say a satanist new world order cabal might see that as a bit of a red flag and as long as these stones have been around which is again since 1980 people have been scared shitless by them some believed they were a satanic altar while in 2014 conspiracy theorists cited the guidestones as proof that the ebola outbreak would kill off much of humanity and in 2018 marjorie taylor green oh yeah she is involved here too i mean how would she not be she endorsed the idea that the guidestones revealed a world genocide plot and after hearing a bunch of theories that dumb instinctively i am tempted to defend the guidestones and point out that a far more common interpretation is that they are directions for rebuilding civilization after an apocalypse which would make some sense given that they were built at the height of the cold war and the client who went by the alias robert christian by the way had told the builder he wanted it to be capable of withstanding the most catastrophic events i could also point out the ridiculousness of thinking that some sort of global illuminati wrote down their plot for killing off 95 percent of humanity on a giant granite post-it note and left their secret plan somewhere no conservative would ever find it rural georgia i am tempted to say all of that but here is where this piece gets a little weird that's right at this point not with the snake boss not with that thing that you had to look at earlier and are having to look at again now this right here is the weird part because while researching this piece as far as we knew no one had ever definitively uncovered who was responsible for the guide stones none of the reporting that we looked at ever dug that deep and it was only after we wrote everything that you've seen up to this point right now that we discovered this kind of shitty 2015 documentary from a born-again christian filmmaker who decided to investigate the guide stones in it the producers tricked the one man who knows robert christian's real identity and who had promised never to reveal it into allowing them to open this case containing their correspondence on camera and in doing so seemingly revealed that the guidestones were ordered by a man named a man named dr herbert kirsten and if that documentary is right and kirsten is the man behind the guide stones that is pretty troubling because he was a doctor from fort dodge iowa with multiple interests conservation certainly population control absolutely but he also wrote at least two letters in newspapers praising david duke yeah that's david duke the clan leader and neo-nazi arguing among other things that duke voices many beliefs held by reasonable americans it is unfortunate that more acceptable public figures are not pushing similar views which is the sort of thing that makes a line like guide reproduction wisely hit a little bit different now doesn't it so unfortunately this web extra which was supposed to be a light piece about this silly southern fried stonehenge suddenly got much less fun which is very disappointing i mean what other roadside attractions are harboring dark past how many mini golf dinosaurs are secretly race zealots who rolled up this giant ball of twine hitler it doesn't bear thinking about and i know that you like me may be blindsided by this revelation although i'm also willing to bet that others saw this coming the very moment i said a monument in georgia i mean this is a state that carved confederate generals into the side of a mountain it's not like white supremacist stonework is light on the ground there but in the end i guess what this really means is that reluctantly i do have to hand it to candice taylor in a way not to her policies which are terrible or her platform which is incoherent or her campaign ads as which are ridiculous or her bus which is very bad or her position on furries which is extremely funny or her ability to spell her own name which again is just objectively wrong that's not how you spell that but i will admit that when it comes to the georgia guidestones she may have been partially right albeit for completely wrong reasons when she suggested that they were a problem which is totally heartbreaking because if there's one thing that should bring our country together is a good mysterious roadside attraction so if you live in georgia or anywhere and you have a few hundred tons of granite lying about why not build your own functioning astronomical clock one that doesn't reference eugenics put your own mysterious rules on it like i don't know the furry days are over when i'm governor that's a good one i promise you if you build it they will come i know at least one guy who will come three to five times a week thank you so much for watching this we're back on june 5th goodbye you" />

been a territory of death and destruction united States get involved and make it just a freedom zone have a real freedom zone a freedom zone this comes amidst mounting warnings of starvation in Gaza which is the headline of our next guest's new piece in the London Review of Books alex Dval executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tus University author of the book Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine welcome back to Democracy Now uh congratulations on the efforts of so many at TUS and also outside of TUS to have uh Romesa released um the uh Turkish student uh who was a Fulbright scholar and was taken by masked ICE agents on the streets of Somerville uh Ramesa Oturk now out of an ICE jail alex if you can start off by laying out um what you found in your new piece for the London Review of Books Starvation in Gaza so just a couple of days ago the United Nations integrated food security phase classification which is a real mouthful um it's a it's a system it's a collaboration of different humanitarian agencies um and they undertook a survey it's the fifth such survey since the beginning of the war in in in the most recent war in Gaza some 19 months ago they undertook a survey of food security and malnutrition and what they found was yet again that uh the majority of people in Gaza are facing emergency or catastrophic levels of food insecurity and levels of malnutrition are rising fast and this is directly related to the total blockade imposed upon the Gaza Strip at the beginning of March and normally um in situations of famine there are many complex factors that uh work in between the level of food availability and and children getting hungry and beginning to die in large numbers in the case of Gaza it's actually sadly a lot more straightforward there's really the only food that is available is that that is permitted to enter by Israel and those food stocks are running out russians are getting low and the poorest and most vulnerable are beginning to starve and die well you write in in your piece uh Alex Cival uh that quote &quot;Gaza is an anomaly a laboratory in which we will discover how much nutritional stress a population can withstand before succumbing on mass so if you could uh elaborate on that and whether that is indeed the conclusion that was reached in the IPC report so a a normal healthy adult will uh last somewhere between 60 and 80 days deprived of all nutrition now we haven't got to that stage but children perish much more quickly and there are a significant numbers of children who need specialized feeding need food that cannot be readily prepared with just the food that is available with the uh with the lack of clean water the lack of electricity supplies so we are seeing the most vulnerable um already succumbing and there are two scenarios that were laid out in this report one is a situation in which the status quo continues the level of blockade and the level of destruction continue unimpeded in which case um mass starvation famine is inevitable it is a question of weeks before that unfolds the second scenario is if the Israeli US plan for setting up a an an alternative humanitarian system comes into play now the background to this is that Israel um wants to debar the UNRA and the United Nations and um other international humanitarian organizations from being present on the ground in Gaza and to to put humanitarian provision in the hands of a new system uh a new method a new scheme the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and not many details are available about this but what is known is that the plan is to have just four distribution centers in a small part of Gaza supplying at most 60% of the population with minimum rations and the food would be brought and distributed by uh members of this uh new foundation including uh US private military contractors protected by the IDF and it would simply be those rations and and and basic hygiene and medical kits there would be no reconstruction of infrastructure no specialized feeding um for malnourished children etc now even if this were to work the conclusion of the IPC it doesn't spell it out in quite so many words but it's pretty clear the conclusion is mass starvation would still unfold just somewhat more slowly so uh Alex could you also um talk about the fact of this this concept of yours of surveillance humanitarianism how does the aid scheme that you've just been talking about uh that is proposed by the Israelis and backed by the Americans fit into that uh how precisely would it work you've also said the plan is quote an individualized version of late colonial counterinsurgency back in the 1950s the British government mounted a a a anti-communist counterinsurgency in Malaya and they explicitly called it operation starvation and the idea was that every individual who was in a protected village would and and and was properly accredited with the authorities would receive enough food and every item of food was counted going into those protected villages and outside the protected villages where the communist gerillas were able to roam no food would be available they would be forced to starve now what we're seeing is a version of this um a much more sophisticated version being uh uh being implemented by Israel today so clearly their intent is that no food should get into the hands of Hamas and they have details about every individual in Gats so the the plan as a by inference is that they would screen every individual and they would put accredited individuals who have no link to Hamas on the distribution list those individuals would be notified by text message to come to pick up the uh the rations that they are allocated at a certain time in a certain place and their identities would be verified by face recognition and other technologies and then they would go they would take those rations those rations would presumably be just enough for a few days perhaps a week so that they would um there would be very little chance of them falling into the hands of anybody else and then they would have to um come back so it is um the the the welfare indeed the survival of every Palestinian family in Gaza would be dependent upon on a week-to-eek basis on this type of surveillance and and accreditation system in a you can look at it as the the sort of the counterpart of the uh the surveillance and AI algorithms the the the lavender system that is being used by Israel to identify by um members of Hamas whom they are targeting for u assassination so they would have a counterpart for feeding the people whom they um are prepared to keep alive meanwhile Alex Dval the New York Times is reporting some Israeli officials are privately admitting Gaza is on the brink of starvation and warn of the effects if the blockade is not lifted since it takes a while there are thousands of trucks waiting outside to get in to increase the humanitarian aid and you have President Trump today in Qatar uh talking about um uh is Gaza being a freedom zone controlled by the United States your response i'm not quite sure what President Trump means by a a freedom zone but I think it is it is clear across the board um with the information that we have and I have no doubt Israel has pretty much the same information and they may just dispute some of the details but the the overall um picture is is completely clear that something dramatic is going to have to be done to prevent mass starvation and and and and famine unfolding in the very near future in in Gaza the situation cannot be allowed to to get to the brink and then just pull back slightly from the brink has been as has been happening when the Israelis um opened u supply routes and and food distribution a year ago and and again with the the ceasefire a few months ago the population simply cannot withstand um this type of pressure for uh really any longer without the the utmost catastrophe unfolding well Alex you conclude your piece by saying that Israel may quote do just enough to keep most Palestinians alive but whether this prevents the destruction of Palestinians in Gaza as a group is another matter if you could say what you mean by that what do you imagine Israel will do so the um what we see in this process of if if it unfolds this sort of individually targeted surveillance humanitarianism is keeping individuals and and families alive but dismantling the entire structure of society now clearly the uh the dismantling of Hamas is the political and military goal of of Israel but if it goes further towards the dismantling of society as a whole which is one of the things that we often see during famines it's not just that individualized biological suffering it is the tearing apart of social bonds the collective humiliation the degradation of society that is the the the deep trauma the profound experience of famine if that is allowed to proceed then Palestinian society as it has existed will be in irrevocably changed torn apart traumatized and if Israel knowingly does this then it will be culpable not just of the the war crime of starvation but of the destruction of of of the Palestinian people of Gaza alex Dval thank you so much for being with us executive director of the World Peace Foundation at Tus University author of the book Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine we'll link to your piece in the London Review of Books headlined Starvation in Gaza that does it for our show democracy Now currently accepting applications for director of technology check

today's show looking at the university protest movement nationwide as students deliver commencement speeches over the weekend many focusing their remarks on denouncing Israel's relentless war on Gaza and their university's complicity in attempting to silence their voices on Friday the Indian-American class president at MIT the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Mega Viri was barred from attending her graduation ceremony after she gave a commencement speech on Friday uh on Thursday when she wore a red and white kafia and said MIT students would never support a genocide praising them for continuing to protest despite quote &quot;Threats intimidation and suppression coming from all directions especially she said your own university officials.&quot; This is part of her speech the Israeli occupation forces are the only foreign military that MIT has researched ties with this means that Israel's assault on the Palestinian people is not only aided and embedded by our country but our school as scientists engineers academics and leaders we have a commitment to support life support aid efforts and call for an arms embargo and keep demanding now as alumni that MIT cuts the ties meanwhile at Harvard University down the road in Cambridge faculty join students and calling for an end to Israel's war on Gaza this is professor of law Andrew Crespbow addressing the 2025 Harvard Law School graduating class last week commending students for standing up to the Trump administration's crackdown on universities and education in an endless barrage our government has tried to crush Harvard University the very symbol of higher education in the world and more simply than that our home our scientists and international students have been taken hostage our research bankrupted our community terrorized all in an effort to try to change the way that we teach the questions we ask and the answers we offer from climate change to vaccines to the study of race and inequality in our country's past and present they want us to shut up or worse they want us to say only what they want to hear this too is what authoritarianism looks like in the face of it fear is rational but courage is essential and to your great credit you the class of 2025 have taught us time and again what true courage looks like harvard Law School professor Andrew Crespo also criticized his own university's response to the wave of pro Palestine peaceful protests on campus we your university have not always learned well the lessons you were trying to teach harvard deserves praise for taking a stand to defend its academic independence [Applause] it is just as important for Harvard to use that independence to protect the academic freedoms including the rights to study publish teach and yes protest of everyone on our campus without exception especially when our messages are politically inconvenient in this respect whether in denying degrees to peaceful protesters or suspending hundreds of students and some teachers from our libraries or firing the faculty directors of our center for Middle Eastern Studies in what the New York Times called quote unquote an offering to the Trump administration I fear sometimes our university has too often exhibited acquiescence when courage was called for sooner rather than later I am confident we will learn the lessons you try to teach us for our own sake and for the sake of this democracy harvard law professor Andrew Crespbow was speaking after winning the 2025 Albert M saxs Paul award for teaching excellence at Harvard he was addressing the graduating class of the Harvard Law School in a minute we'll be joined by Zara Imam a new graduate of the Harvard Divinity School where she delivered the commencement address last week she's also Muslim associate chaplain at MIT she spoke out in support of Palestine in her remarks class of 2025 Palestine is waiting for us to arrive and you must be courageous enough to rise to the call because Palestine will keep showing up in our living rooms until we are ready to meet its gaze zera Imam is wearing a kafia on her head she held a Palestinian flag as she addressed the commencement ceremony at Harvard Divinity School zara Imam joins us now for more she's also a Muslim associate chaplain at MIT just down the road uh Zara congratulations on your graduation uh from Harvard Divinity School can you elaborate on your comments yeah um first thanks thanks for having me on the show Amy um I what I was talking about in my speech is the fact that we this is a moment that calls for courage uh not just on part of the student body but the administration and all college campuses beyond harvard and beyond um we are seeing that um last year Alan Garber um got booed at commencement and this year he got a standing ovation for celebrating international students but what if those international students are Palestinian and they come to a place like Harvard where you know I took a class called um on on Israel Palestine and that class no longer exists and at Harvard i also um went to Palestine through Harvard Divinity School that program no longer exists at Harvard Divinity School um the three professor the three teachers who taught that class are no longer at Harvard so what kind of a place is Harvard for its Palestinian students who are coming in and for its pro Palestinian students who are protesting at Harvard um so that's that's what I was calling attention to i was also calling attention to the fact that I have worked with students in Kaza who I was in conversation with as I was working on this speech and they are living their history's worst nightmares um and there are parts of the speech that I didn't even put in that um I want to share right now which are that I I felt truly that I'm in touch with the Anne Franks of our time and but we can still change the ending and I say that because just yesterday I saw Anne Frank's uh great cousin come on uh a video and he he called for the Jewish community for the Germans for the international community to stop the war crimes that are happening and taking place in Gaza and all across Palestine so that's that's what I was calling attention to in um in bringing up Palestine in my speech who wrote your speech along with two other students one Christian the other Jewish you are Muslim correct and we each wrote our respective parts we each gave input to one another we had other students look over the speech i had I personally not only brought in students from um I I had a lot of quotes from students from Gaza that you know some I brought in some I couldn't but I was in I was in conversation but yeah it was a it was a group effort um not because we agreed with everything we were saying um but because it was important to be in solidarity with one another in a moment when um the world is is extremely divided um and I think we wanted to show what it means to be in community with one another um so yeah so let me ask you um you are also um an associate chaplain at MIT um I wanted to get your comment on the Indian-American class president at MIT Mega Vim Murray who was barred from attending her graduation ceremony after she gave a commencement speech the day before um around Palestine uh your thoughts um I think Mega is incredibly brave um she and as are all the students at MIT and on college campuses who are standing up for Palestine um yeah everything she said really speaks to the heart and soul of the student movements which are going to be undeterred um and that was clear in her speech um students will keep uh speaking up for Palestine and for liberation um across college campuses so I'm I'm really proud of Mega for for having finding the right words and um really really being very courageous well I want to thank you for being with us uh did you get your diploma after you gave your commencement address Zarah Imam i did um you know and I so I mean I have it so far so I don't have any um haven't changes with that yet even though Mega V Murray was not allowed to attend her graduation uh MIT did bestow upon her her diploma unlike NYU that took away the diploma of a young student who spoke out in his graduation address uh that does it for our show i'm Amy Goodman thanks so much for joining us democracy Now is funded by viewers like you please give today at

ago today on May 19th 1925 the man who would become known as Malcolm X was born in Omaha Nebraska malcolm X would go on to become one of the most influential political leaders of the 20th century before he was assassinated at the age of 39 on February 21st 1965 as he was standing at the podium before a crowd in Harlem's Ottabon Ballroom his wife Dr betty Shabbaz pregnant with twins and sitting next to her four daughters aed 6'4 two and five months were in the ballroom looking on in 2023 the family of Malcolm X filed a hundred million dollar longful wrongful death lawsuit against the FBI the CIA New York City and state and the NYPD as well as the district attorney's office for concealing evidence of their involvement in Malcolm X's assassination now his family is calling for President Trump to release more details about Malcolm X's assassination just as he released thousands of unredacted files related to the assassination of President John F kennedy and vowed in an executive order to release files on the assassination of Dr martin Luther King Jr the state of Nebraska officially designated May 19th as Malcolm X day in 2024 his daughter Dr elasa Shabbaz was recently there to remember her father's legacy and joins us in our studio but first we go to an interview in the 1960s when Malcolm X briefly spoke about his childhood he was questioned by Chicago reporter Jim Hurlbut in a clip featured in the PBS American Experience documentary Malcolm X Make It Plain you were born in Omaha is that right yes sir and you left your family left Omaha when you were what one year old i imagine about a year old and why did they leave Omaha well to my understanding uh the Klux Clan uh burned down one of their homes in uh in uh in Omaha they had a lot of made your family feel very unhappy I'm sure well insecure if not unhappy so you must have a somewhat prejudice point of view a personally prejudice point of view in other words you cannot look at this in a broad academic sort of way really i I think that's incorrect because uh despite the fact that that happened in Omaha and then when we moved to Lancing Michigan our home was burned down again in fact my father was killed by the Klux Clan uh and despite all of that no one was more thoroughly integrated with whites than I no one has lived more so in the society of whites than I so that was Malcolm X in the 1960s today would have been his 100th birthday and today the National Action Network will commemorate this birthday with Reverend Al Sharpton and National Civil Rights Attorney Ben Crump who joins us now remotely and with members of his family including Dr yasa Shabbaz uh one of Malcolm X's six daughters professor at John J college of Criminal Justice here in New York City a community organizer an activist award-winning author of many books her memoir is titled Growing Up X her most recent book for young adults co-written with Tiffany Jackson titled The Awakening of Malcolm X dr shabbaz is the chairperson of the Malcolm X and Dr betty Shabbaz Memorial and Educational Center we welcome you both to Democracy Now um before we turn to Ben Crump uh Dr shabbaz it's great to have you with us again your thoughts as you watch your father talking about growing being born in Omaha being forced out by the white supremacists there his legacy uh you know and as I shared with uh members in that community um that was the legacy I'm sorry that was the foundation for my father um his parents instilled these specific values of love of care compassion environmentalist um it's such a beautiful place and um it is just so indicative of how this young boy would grow up to be this iconic human rights uh figure m well I want to come back to that legacy but um Ben Crump I know you have a court zoom in a few minutes and I want to make sure we get in this lawsuit that you filed and the demand that as President Trump releases u most of the documents in the case of the JFK assassination and says he's going to do it in the case of the King assassination the your and the families demand that they release the Malcolm X assassination documents what exactly you're calling ing for and tell us about the lawsuit certainly Amy first I want to say thank you to Dr ilas Shabbaz and her family for keeping the legacy of Malcolm X alive 60 years later on what would be his 100th birthday uh we can never say thank you enough um as it relates to the court case and celebrating his enduring legacy we continue to fight for justice for Malcolm X by any means necessary we are calling for truth and transparency to finally be the prevailing factor in all of this legal minutia we know that the FBI files exist we know that they were surveilling every waking moment of Malcolm X's life we know that they were aware of assassination attempts on Malcolm X before he uh was fatally killed in the Ottabban ballroom and so in our lawsuit that we filed for $100 million against those who conspired to assassinate Malcolm X one of the great thought leaders of the 20th century we continue to try to make absolute certain to everybody who's paying attention that this was an intentional effort at the behest of the leaders of our government that been New York Police Department the FBI the CIA all the way to the very top and so therefore finally 60 years later on what would have been his 100th birthday we implore the federal government to release all of the FBI papers on Malcolm X you know as you sue the city it makes me think about the fact the mayor is going to be with you is that right today at noon uh Mayor Eric Adams who is a former uh police officer and now he's the mayor and he has ability to release information about the assassination ben Crump do you know if he's going to do this well you know we are involved in litigation with the city of New York and it is our hope that he is going to be able to speak with Dr bass as well as uh other civil rights leaders who are encouraging him to help finally get justice for Malcolm X's family you see Amy you know two and a half years ago the city entered into a settlement agreement with those two brothers who were wrongfully convicted for killing Malcolm X and when you really think about it those men suffered but who suffered the greatest for the assassination of Malcolm X is Malcolm's family his wife Betty Shabbaz his daughters that's who suffered the most and can we finally give them some measure of justice and accountability that is what this fight is for in fighting to pay homage to Malcolm X's enduring legacy of selfexpression and self-determination for black people all over the world as well as those oppressed by the oppressor and then exploited by the exploer what we want to do is make sure there is some measure of justice some measure of accountability to Malcolm's family to say that we understand that even though the assassin's bullet may have killed him we never stop fighting for Malcolm X's life for his justice and for his accountability well Ben Crump I want to thank you for being with us dr ilas Sherbaz uh there'll be an event tonight at the Ottabban Ballroom where your father was gunned down before your very eyes how old were you at the time i wasn't quite 3 years old but I have to tell you um in all the work that I do I always think about my mother because she was a young woman she had four little girls she was pregnant with twins her home had been firebombed the week before a week before and she saw 21 bullets rip through my father's body on February 21st she offered him um mouthto-mouth resuscitation she she gave him the the most comfort she possibly could so I often think of how she safeguarded her husband's legacy and how she raised all six of her girls in this bubble of love you know in spite all of the trauma there was no despair there was no bitterness that she showed to her children i wanted to go to your dad speaking a week before his assassination about the very firebombing you're talking about that almost killed you that's right my house was bombed that was bound by the black Muslim movement upon the orders of Elijah Muhammad now they had come around to they had planned to do it from the front and the back so that I couldn't get out they had they they covered the front completely at the front door then they had come to the back but instead of getting in directly in back of the house and throwing it this way they stood at a 45 degree angle and tossed it at the window so it it glanced and went on to the ground and the fire hit the window and it woke up my second oldest baby uh and then it but the fire burned on the outside of the house but had that fire had that one gone through that window it would have fallen on a six-year-old girl a 4year-old girl and a 2-year-old girl and I'm going to tell you if it had done it I'd taken my rifle and gone after anybody in sight i would not wait cuz in the and I say that because of this the police know the criminal operation of the black Muslim movement because they have thoroughly infiltrated it because they've thoroughly infiltrated it and this is the information you're trying to get right now you were that two-year-old that he was referring to along with your sisters actually that was Yes that's right that's right that's right so this is a hundred years later you're keeping to say the least the uh your father's legacy alive along with so many around the world and as you teach people at John J college students what do you think it's most important to understand about Malcolm X um you know this sense of compassion uh he introduced a human rights agenda to the civil rights movement and so there are people all around the world who recognize our uh you know every single individual's human rights you know he said uh it you know just I tell you there's just so many thoughts but when I think of my father most he was such a young man you know he was uh in his 20s when the world learned of him 39 when he was assassinated he like King were assassinated when they were 39 years old that's right they were assassinated at both at 39 and um he said I don't know why I keep going on a blank but this quote that is so important by introducing this human rights agenda to the civil rights movement movement for the first time we're talking to Dr il Yasa Shabbaz one of Malcolm X's six daughters she's a professor at John J college of Criminal Justice as well as an activist um if you can talk about you have the two men who are held in prison for decades they've won tens of millions of dollars from New York City they were exonerated um what would it mean for you to settle this lawsuit well you know it's principle and and the quote that I was thinking of my father he said &quot;Oh gosh every time I want to say it so maybe I'm not supposed to say it right?&quot; Well I bet you're going to say it tonight and we're going to record it and play it on Democracy Now in the coming days okay and you know one word that I can recall growing up with hearing from my mother is the word surveillance surveillance and and so I think of how traumatiz how uh uh terror Oh gosh what is going on with these words um how my mother must have been uh traumatized at such a young age to experience and live through all of this my father being such a young man you know and so we most definitely want to um ensure that we get justice for our father you know he sacrificed his entire self he you know he said we demand our human rights as your brother there is no asking we demand our human rights as ordained by God and I would imagine it's the reason why there is this reverence for this young man whose legacy continues to inspire empower uplift people all around the world you're wearing all white today um not black uh to remember your father um the fact that he was assassinated but white why oh you know it's you know the spirituality it's just a bunch of things and I love my father i love my mother so much and you know whatever I can do to keep uh these legacies alive and thriving and you know and tonight you'll be at the Ottabon Ballroom which your mother fought to save from destruction when Colombia was building its big biotech building and there you have so many events honoring Malcolm X and Dr betty Shabbaz and I want to say that my mother turned this place of tragedy into a place of triumph dr el Shabbaz on the 100th anniversary of the birth of Malcolm X i'm Amy Goodman thanks for joining us democracy Now is funded by viewers like you please

(University of Virginia School of Law, Oct. 4, 2023)" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="University of Virginia School of Law" />
          <attvalue for="7" value="JIM DONOVAN: So the topic about which I've been asked to speak tonight is the making of an investment banker. And I would start by saying investment banking is hard. It's also extraordinarily rewarding. It's fiercely competitive. Most people in this room won't succeed as investment bankers, or maybe not in this room, but in most rooms. To most groups of people to whom I speak, most of them would not succeed in investment banking. So I'm hopeful that tonight, the comments that I'm going to make, the speech, the advice that I'm going to give you will help you increase the chances of your success as an investment banker, if you choose to pursue a career in investment banking. I'm going to divide my talk into three parts. Part one is the interview, getting the job. Part two is keeping the job, how to succeed as a young analyst or associate investment banker. And part three is excelling at the job, how to become an elite senior investment banker.  So part one, the interview. So all of you are at this incredibly competitive fantastic university. All of you have great grades, hopefully. And you're all here tonight because you want to learn. You want to better yourselves. You want to improve your chances of getting a job in investment banking and of having a successful career in investment banking. Those are all very, very, very good things. So I'm going to give you four pieces of advice around the interview, which if you follow, will help you walk out of that interview with a job offer. Now I'm assuming that you will satisfy the basic requirements of an interview. So this list is not exhaustive. It's for things that you need to do on top of the basic requirements of an interview. And there are many. | assuming, for example, that you have done research on the company for which you are interviewing. I'm assuming that you can project confidence in the interview. I'm assuming you can walk someone, an interviewer, through your resume. I'm assuming those things and a host of other givens that I'm going to stipulate-- that hopefully you've satisfied. In addition to those, here are four pieces of advice I would give you. Two things you should do prior to the interview, two things you should do in the interview. Prior to the interview, all of you should be reading the Wall Street Journal every single day.  Read the Wall Street Journal every single day, three articles from the Wall Street Journal. One article on a macroeconomic topic like inflation or interest rates.  One article on a specific industry, company, or transaction. So for example, a recent merger transaction that's been announced or a recent IPO that's been announced or a company that's recently announced earnings. It will be an article about whether those earnings are good or bad and why. One article on a specific company transaction. And thirdly, an article from the Op-Ed page.  Three articles every day no matter what. No exceptions. It'll take about 15 minutes a day. It's not hard. If you do that, you'll be amazed at how you know, how much you've learned after six months or 12 months. You'll be amazed. You will know an incredible amount substantively after six months or a year. You will also, by the way, begin to decipher the jargon that we use as investment bankers, the jargon that we speak in. And that will help you in your interview and in your job. So read the Wall Street Journal. Start reading it early on. Every day, three articles, 15 minutes. Second thing you should do before the interview, become familiar with the three financial statements. Become familiar with the three financial statements. Know what they are. If you don't now, that's OK. Look them up. Ideally, take a class in financial accounting.  And be facile with how these financial statements interact with each other and be able to analyze them, at least at a basic level. Be familiar with the three financial statements. Two things you should do in the interview. One, what topic do people enjoy talking about the most? Answer is-- SPEAKER: Themselves. JIM DONOVAN: Very good. Themselves. That may sound cynical, but that is a psychological fact. People enjoy most talking about themselves. So in the interview, you want to get the interviewer to talk about himself or herself. That should be a primary goal. You ask questions like, why did you decide to become an investment banker? Why did you decide to work at xyz firm? What's the most interesting transaction you worked on and why?  Get the interviewer to talk about themself. If you do that, they're going to enjoy the interview a lot more, which is good for you. One, and two, by asking these personal questions, you will elicit the most authentic and genuine responses. You will learn the most.  So get the interviewer to talk about himself or herself. Secondly, you should do in the interview avoid questions that lend themselves to yes/no answers. Ask questions that are open-ended, that require sentences as answers. Ideally, multiple sentences as answers. You want this interview to be a dialogue, not an interrogation. Ask open-ended questions. Those are the four things you should do surrounding the interview, in addition to all of the basics that I'm assuming you've satisfied. If you do those four things, you are more likely to walk out of the interview with an offer, if you do them and you do them well. Second part of the talk, keeping the job. How to succeed as a young analyst or a young associate in an investment bank? Six pieces of advice. First piece of advice, find a role model. Find a role model. Your criteria for selecting the role model is singular, purely merit-based. You want to find the person who's an analyst, if that's what you are, or an associate, if that's what you are, who's one or two years ahead of you and is the best at the job. You don't have to have a lot in common with them. You don't even have to like them. You want to find the person who's the best. And then you want to model your behavior at work after that person.  There's no reason to recreate the wheel, right? If someone's doing the job very, very well and it's generally recognized as being very, very good, in fact, maybe the best, learn-- watch that person. Study that person. Learn as much as you can by watching them, and then model your behavior after them. Second piece of advice, make it clear that you have no ego. Make it clear that you have no ego. Make it clear that you have no task that's given in to you-- that there is no task that's given to you that is beneath you. There is no task too menial for you. Make it clear to the team that you're willing to do whatever is necessary for the team to succeed. In fact, early on in your career as an analyst, let's say in the first month or as an associate, volunteer for the menial tasks. Go get coffee. Make copies. Make it clear you have no ego. Number three, take notes.  Some of you are doing that tonight. Take notes. When you're in a meeting with a client, a prospective client, a superior, take notes. You want to do that because it conveys to the people in the room that you're serious.  It also conveys to the people who are talking that what they're saying is important. You're writing it down. And thirdly and most importantly, it gives them a sense of comfort that you're not going to forget what happened in the meeting or the follow-up task that you have to accomplish after the meeting. The analogy I always like to use with this is if you go to dinner with a group of your friends and there's six of you at the table at a restaurant, and the waiter comes over and he takes your orders and one at a time each of you order, and he doesn't write anything down. And he says, terrific, I'll be back with your orders. And he leaves. I don't know about you, but I'm wondering, in 30 minutes, am I going to get the salad that I ordered or am I getting meatloaf, right? You've no idea because there's nothing written down. It doesn't inspire confidence, and he didn't recap what the orders were. Now it may look impressive. And I don't care if you have a photographic memory, take notes. Write things down. And then in a meeting with your superior afterwards, walk through the list of follow-up items that you have. Tick them off. Say to your boss, I will have the memo rewritten by tomorrow at noon. I'm going to rerun the model with the new numbers. The other follow-up item I have from the meeting is I'm supposed to call xyz person or write a text to abc person. Recap the meeting and your follow-up items with your boss. It will put your boss's mind at ease. Even if you know them all, even if you're not going to forget them all, it will make your boss feel like, OK, it's OK. He's got this. She's got this. I don't need to worry about it. Take notes. Number four, work hard.  Make no mistake, the most successful analysts and associates in investment banking are the hardest workers. Period. Full stop. It doesn't matter if you're a good golfer, if you can schmooze well. Doesn't matter if you can play tennis well or you know something about professional sports. That doesn't matter. What matters is how hard are you willing to work. Be prepared for that. It's hard. Work hard. Number five, related to number four. First impressions die hard. Good first impressions die hard, and bad first impressions die hard. So be very responsive, especially early on. There's nothing more frustrating for a senior investment banker than to send an email or a text to an analyst or an associate and have that email or text go unanswered for an extended period of time. Don't let that happen, particularly early on. Be available. Be responsive. People like to extrapolate. If the first five interactions they have with you, you're super responsive, you never drop a ball, they're going to extrapolate from there and assume that behavior is going to continue. If the first five interactions with you, you're unresponsive and you forget a bunch of things, they're going to extrapolate in a negative direction. And it's incredibly hard to recover from that. First impressions die Hard. Make good ones. Be available. Be responsive. Don't make mistakes, particularly early on. Number six piece of advice. As a young associate or young analyst, never stop learning. So in year two, day three, you should be reading the Wall Street Journal every day. In year three, day four, you should be reading the Wall Street Journal every day. Every day, you may read more articles. You may read different articles, but read it every day. Ask questions of your peers. Ask questions of your superiors. Approach the second and third year the same way you approach the interview, with that same zest, zeal, that same sense of intensity. Be curious. Ask questions. Never stop learning. The most successful analysts and associates do that. They never stop. They never rest on their laurels.  Third part of the presentation, how to become an elite senior investment banker, how to really excel at this job. Six pieces of advice. First, give your client advice that is the best advice for the client, even if, and in particular if, it is contrary to your own interests. There's no better way to establish credibility with a client than to give them advice that they know is contrary to your interest. Give that advice no matter what. Second, take a position. Don't equivocate. The client has hired you to advise them. Tell them what to do. That's what they've hired you for. Don't give them five options and say, pick one. You pick one, advocate for it. It's OK to present options, but advocate for one. Tell them what you would advise them to do. That's what they've hired you for. Take a position, don't equivocate.  Number three, embrace and relish in adversity. Adversity is what makes you better, stronger at this job. Relish it. It's easy, particularly for young professionals, these days to want to take and to take shortcuts. It's easy in particular because we have phones and the internet. And there's a lot of answers at our fingertips now, right? So if someone's asked you to build an Excel model to perform some task at work, you could probably look up on the internet a model that will do that. Resist that temptation. Build your own model. Resist the temptation to take shortcuts. Live in the trenches because the best investment bankers lived in the trenches. Their skills were forge there. Relish adversity. You will come out of it stronger. Don't be disappointed, afraid, angry when you encounter it. View it. Embrace it. And view it as something that will make you stronger. Number four, master discipline. This job requires incredible discipline. Master it, inside and outside of your work. This means different things to different people. To some people, it means remaining physically fit. To others, it means time management. Master discipline. Don't procrastinate. Don't let items build up in your inbox. Keep lists. Don't procrastinate. Be extraordinarily disciplined. Master it. Number five, excel on the merits.  If you're really good at what you do, if you're one of the best investment bankers, it's a lot easier to avoid spending time on things that you don't want to spend time on. And you'll have much more control over what you do at work and what you do outside of work. A lot of people ask me, what's the best way to achieve work-life balance? The answer is be really, really good at what you do. No one is going to give you a hard time if you're the best investment banker at the firm, or among the best, for taking some time off to do something that you like to do. In fact, taking a lot of time off for doing something that you like to do.  Excel on the merits.  Number six, final piece of advice. Never ever give up. Adopt that mantra as part of your life. Don't take no for an answer. Apply this in everything you do, from getting reservations at a restaurant, to getting a job, to getting a new client. Never ever, ever, ever, ever give up. Don't take no for an answer. What separates the good investment bankers from the great investment bankers is the great investment bankers never ever give up. " />

          <attvalue for="3" value="Americans don’t agree on whether being born here should make you a citizen. That’s not new.&#10;&#10;Support our work. Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships&#10;&#10;On the first day of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump’s order stated that the rule, which comes from the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. Within a few weeks that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges — but it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.&#10;&#10;The US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it’s uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it’s very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the question: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?&#10;&#10;The short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In this video we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today’s concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They’re actually not.&#10;&#10;00:00 A rule&#10;2:23 Jus soli&#10;3:13 Dred Scott&#10;4:46 The 14th Amendment&#10;8:02 Wong Kim Ark&#10;10:30 Another look at the 14th Amendment&#10;&#10;Sources and further reading:&#10;&#10;Garrett Epps’s law review article about the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment has everything you’ll ever need to know about the history of birthright citizenship in the US: https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.e...&#10;&#10;The Library of Congress has a great map showing which countries of the world offer unconditional birthright citizenship like the US: https://maint.loc.gov/law/help/birthr...&#10;&#10;The 1861 map of the US we use a few times in the piece is itself a strikingly rich document that I could stare at forever: https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3701sm....&#10;&#10;Some other original documents we use in the piece:&#10;&#10;Trump’s executive order on birthright citizenship: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/F...&#10;&#10;The Ipsos poll containing the question about support for ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants: https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics...&#10;&#10;The Dred Scott decision: https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services...&#10;&#10;President Andrew Johnson’s letter vetoing the 1866 Civil Rights Act: https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/docum...&#10;&#10;Congress’s debates over the 14th Amendment (we quoted from page 498): https://www.congress.gov/congressiona...&#10;&#10;The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/S...&#10;&#10;The Wong Kim Ark decision: https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services...&#10;&#10;Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO&#10;&#10;Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

          <attvalue for="7" value="In the years after the American Civil War, the US made three amendments to its national constitution that, among other things, established rights for African Americans. One of those amendments abolished slavery. One granted the right to vote to African American men. And one, among other things, gave African Americans the right of citizenship. But this one: the 14th Amendment, dealing with citizenship. It was interesting. It never actually used the words African, or Black, or race, or former slaves. Instead, it contained a rule. That, with some exceptions, being born in the US would make you a citizen of the US. Birthright citizenship. If you're born here, you're a citizen here. “Birthright...” “Birthright...” “Birthright citizenship” “Ending birthright citizenship...” In 2025, on Donald Trump's first day as again-president, he signed an executive order to end birthright citizenship for the children of anyone temporarily or unlawfully in the US. Over the next few weeks, that order was blocked by more than one federal judge, with one of the cases calling birthright citizenship a “foundation of our democracy.” And as of this video, we don't actually know how this will all shake out: if the Trump administration will back down, if the Supreme Court will back them up. But Trump had had his eye on birthright citizenship for some time. Number one, the 14th Amendment is very questionable as to whether or not somebody can come over, have a baby, and immediately that baby is a citizen. And he hasn't been the only one to feel that way. Today, 40% of Americans think that the children of undocumented immigrants should not be given birthright citizenship. The meaning of the 14th Amendment didn't just come up for debate this year. It's actually an argument we've been having with ourselves as a country going way back. And a lot of that debate has been around this idea of who is supposed to get citizenship and who isn't. Like, for example: The 14th Amendment meant to give citizenship to freed slaves. It was never meant to give citizenship to foreign aliens. So okay. Is that true? What does the law actually say about birthright citizenship? And why have Americans been arguing over it for almost 200 years? So in this video, we're going to look at the three moments that made us a country where everyone born here is a citizen. And we're going to start with, actually with none of these. First we're going to start quickly here, at the original US Constitution, which said nothing about who is and is not a citizen. The idea that you're a citizen if you're born here, that existed, but it was more of a legal assumption at the time, inherited from English common law. It was just simply understood, if you were born in the realm, you were a subject of the king. Which itself came from this old Roman idea of “jus soli” or the right of soil. As opposed to the right of blood, where citizenship is passed down from your parents. But because “jus soli” is more of a principle than a law, for the first 70ish years of the US, there aren't really specific rules on who is and isn't born an American citizen. Until. 1857. Just a few years before the Civil War, a time when the US looks like this. Some states where slavery is legal, some where it isn't. And around this time, an enslaved man is taken by his enslaver from a slave state into free territory. And he eventually files a lawsuit, saying that entering free territory should have made him a free man. His case eventually goes to the US Supreme Court in Washington, DC. And it will come to be known as the Dred Scott decision. That's his name. And what the court says is, neither Scott nor his family are free. And they add that he's also not a citizen. And in fact, they say that, as a rule, a person of the African race cannot be a US citizen, by birth or otherwise. The Supreme Court ultimately concludes that they weren't considered to be part of the people of the United States, part of the citizenry of the United States. At this time, there are many free Black people in the free states of the US, but this court decision officially says that the country now has two classes of people: those who are citizens, or who can become citizens, or whose children can be citizens, and those for whom none of that applies. And within a few years, ideas like that have literally torn the US apart. These states secede. And these states go to war against them, partly to eliminate slavery and that two-tiered system. And they win. So now the Civil War is over. And the victorious North decides to undo the Dred Scott case by passing the first American law to say that people born here are citizens. The Civil Rights Act of 1866. Problem number one. The president at the time has some objections to this. And in a letter to Congress, he complains that, in addition to African Americans, birthright citizenship is also going to make “Gypsies” and Chinese people citizens. But Congress actually has enough votes to pass it over the president's objections, and it becomes law. But problem number two. There would always be the risk that the civil rights laws could be modified by a subsequent Congress. A future Congress could theoretically repeal the law. So to make birthright citizenship a more permanent part of the law, they also decide to write it into a constitutional amendment. What will become the 14th Amendment. And it says, all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States. This is the language that will put birthright citizenship into the US Constitution. But it will also, eventually, be the source of some debate. Because of this line. The qualifier. Subject to the jurisdiction of the US. For example, let's say an immigrant comes to the US and then has a child. Are they subject to the US’s jurisdiction? The amendment itself doesn't elaborate on this. But before Congress passes the 14th Amendment, as they debate it, they actually keep pretty good records of their conversations. For example, one senator asks the rest of the Senate, won't this give citizenship to the children of Chinese people? Another senator says, yes. The child of an Asian is as much a citizen as the child of a European. The debates over the 14th Amendment matter, because they show that they understood that children of immigrants would become citizens at birth under this rule. So it's with that understanding that birthright citizenship enters the Constitution. A big majority of Congress votes for it, but not everyone. For example, this guy, the one that was concerned about Chinese people becoming citizens, he does not vote for it. And that is actually important. The 14th Amendment becoming law doesn't necessarily mean that everyone likes it. Remember that. It's going to come back later. And after a quick break, we're going to talk about where that debate goes next. And how it creates the 14th Amendment's first big test. I promise this’ll be fast. Hi, I'm Adam, I produced this video. If you're finding it at all interesting, you should know that videos are actually just one part of what we do at Vox. There's a whole staff of reporters at Vox.com whose job it is to help you understand the world. I made this video because I wanted to better understand how we became a country that, on one hand, offers birthright citizenship, but on the other is a place where a lot of people are mad about that. Like we say in the video, it's about 40% of all Americans. As you can see for yourself, it's also about 90% of YouTube commenters. Vox's mission is not necessarily to tell you the news. There's lots of people doing that. It's overwhelming as is. What we try to do is give you the context, and hopefully, the insight, to understand what is important and what is distraction. If that mission sounds like something you might want to lend your support to, you can do that at vox.com/memberships. That's it. Thanks. OK so, so far in this story, we've seen both a president, and a senator, voice kind of the same concern, about, specifically, Chinese people becoming American citizens. And this is actually pretty emblematic of this time period, when there are a growing number of Chinese laborers in the US, along with a growing sentiment from some that they don't belong here. And in 1882, Congress passes the Chinese Exclusion Act. And it says, among other things, that Chinese immigrants can't become citizens. Although, it doesn't say anything about their children... This is only meant to last ten years, but it ends up being the first of several Chinese Exclusion Acts that remain in effect until 1943. And it's in that context that, a few years after the Chinese Exclusion Act, a guy from San Francisco goes to visit his family in China. A few months later, he comes back, and is denied entry to the US. He says, but I was born here, I'm a citizen. And his case eventually goes to the Supreme Court. The guy's name is Wong Kim Ark. He's around 25, works as a cook, has a wife and child back in China, and his case is kind of the perfect test for the 14th Amendment. Which, remember, says you're a citizen if you're born here and if you're subject to the jurisdiction of the US. So here's the question. When Wong was born here, to his Chinese immigrant parents who were not US citizens, was he under the jurisdiction of, and thus a citizen of, the place he was born? Or was he a citizen of the place his parents were from? In 1898, the court makes their decision. Wong Kim Ark is a citizen. The court says there's three types of people in the US who are not subject to the country's jurisdiction. Diplomats, certain Native Americans, and invading forces occupying territory. Their children are not citizens at birth. But other than that, partly because of what is written down in those Congressional debate records, the court rules that “subject to the jurisdiction” was intended to mean pretty much everyone here, including immigrants and their children. Everyone in the US is subject to the jurisdiction of the US. And thus, everyone born here is a citizen. And that basically remains the legal consensus to this day. For more than a century, officials have acted in concert. It is the repeated recognition by everyone within the legal system that this is the correct meaning of the 14th Amendment. But a legal consensus is not necessarily the same as a popular consensus. In the 1980s and 1990s, the population of undocumented immigrants starts to go up. And birthright citizenship comes back as a political issue. A growing chorus of Republican lawmakers are demanding another look at the 14th Amendment. Subject to the jurisdiction, illegals don't fall under that, just like diplomats' children. If the 14th Amendment had not existed, my great grandparents would not have been citizens. Disagreement over birthright citizenship is not new. In fact, I'm going to tell you one more story about the 14th Amendment. Way back when Congress originally voted for it, part of why an amendment giving citizenship to African Americans was able to pass with these kinds of margins, is because, at the end of the Civil War, only these states were even represented in Congress. But for the 14th Amendment to become official, to become part of the Constitution, it also had to be ratified: voted for by three quarters of all the state governments. And that did not happen at first. None of these states wanted to ratify it. And then Congress made them. They said, these states will only be readmitted to Congress if they ratify this amendment. You have lost a war. And these are the terms of peace. And one way to look at that is that this amendment is kind of different. It isn't just some law from a long time ago. It's a treaty. It represented the leaving behind of an old country and the formation of a new one. Today, just like back then, the president is someone who doesn't agree that birthright citizenship should apply to everyone. Even though, to be clear, a majority of Americans think it should. And, once again, it seems like the final call will be up to the US Supreme Court, which, for more than 100 years, has recognized, again and again, that birthright citizenship is the law. We'll see what happens this time." />

komplett ausfällt die Challenge in 24 Stunden von Bayern nach Singapur da kann ich durch einen Fehler am Tanker quasi den ganzen Plan zunichte machen mehr als 12.000 km eine logistische technische und fliegerische Herausforderung aufgrund dessen wusste ich wir haben ein Problem werden sie es am Ende trotzdem schaffen Militärflugplatz Neuburg an der Donau Kampfpilot Holger fliegt mit seinem eurofighterball zum ersten Mal nach Singapur aus Sicherheitsgründen werden nur die Vornamen der Soldaten genannt seit dem Krieg in der Ukraine ist die Bundeswehr vorsichtig gleich geht es in die Luft trainiert wird der Ernstfall der Alarm auch Hupe genannt gibt das Startsignal ja also lange Rede kurzer Sinn wir wollen bitte um 7 Uhr 50 die Hupe um 8 Uhr take off aber ich rufe Dich noch mal an sonst Holger ist seit sechs Jahren Eurofighter Pilot und Teil der sogenannten alarm-rotte im Ernstfall wenn ein unbekanntes Flugzeug in den deutschen Luftraum eindringt ist damit seinem bewaffneten Jet binnen Minuten im Himmel dann lass uns jetzt schnell prüfen wie viel Zeit haben wir 50 halbe Stunde gleich geht's los genau also wir stellen Gegner da für die Staffel soll heißen für den normalen Trainings Flugbetrieb der so tagtäglich stattfindet bei einer Mission wo wir Luftkampf vier gegen vier trainieren wir sind dabei also die Bösen zwei Teams aus je vier euro-vattern trainieren gleich den Ernstfall [Musik] wir simulieren die Schüssel es gibt die Möglichkeit im Cockpit einen Schalter umzulegen zwischen Training und live und wenn man den auf Training setzt kann man tatsächlich den Abzug betätigen und den Flugzeug dieselben Anzeigen bekommen die man bei einem echten Verschluss eines live-flugkörpers hätte Holger geht mit einer bewaffneten Maschine in die Luft denn auch während der Übung ist er in Alarmbereitschaft kommt das Signal geht es für ihn direkt vom Training in den Einsatz dann wird es jetzt gleich ein bisschen laut ziel der Übung das Kampfflugzeug von Holger abschießen natürlich nicht in echt sozusagen ein simulierter Tod gestartet wird wie im Ernstfall Vollschub und dann senkrecht in den Himmel direkt neben der Startbahn Entscheidungstag für die Logistiker später kommt ein australischer Kontrolleur und nimmt jeden Container ganz genau unter die Lupe also der Container sieht jetzt relativ gut aus es ist etwas Flugrost dran aber kein Gras kein Stroh das waren die Sachen die eben den die stören wären und die zu beseitigen werden nach Singapur geht es weiter zu einem großen Manöver in Australien und dort achtet man penibel darauf dass keine fremden Tiere und Stoffe ins Land kommen seit gut zwei Jahren plant die Luftwaffe die gesamte Übung vor allem logistisch ein riesiger Aufwand denn jeder Schraubenschlüssel jedes Ersatzteil jeder Computer sogar Freizeit Equipment muss mitgenommen und vorab gereinigt werden und dann passiert doch was nicht passieren sollte [Applaus] aber der Kontrolleur ist gnädig und lässt trotz der spinneneier nicht noch mal nacharbeiten in nur wenigen Tagen gehen die Container auf die Reise um die Welt zurück am fliegerhaus nach knapp eineinhalb Stunden ist der Luftkampf von Pilot Holger vorbei bist du tot ja also ehrlich gesagt ja ich bin tot ich bin zweimal gestorben das fühlt sich für mich jetzt aber nicht so schlimm an weil das vom Plan her schon so vorgesehen war dass wenn blue er alles richtig macht ich sterben würde in der Regel ist Holger für eineinhalb Stunden in der Luft dann sind die tankste eure Vater leer nach Singapur wird der 8 Stunden am Stück in seiner Maschine sitzen getankt wird dann direkt in der Luft eine große Herausforderung bei einem verlegepflug habe ich halt ganz ganz andere Herausforderungen also da ist er die lange Zeit die man dann im Cockpit verbringt die vielfältigen Einflüsse die zum Beispiel das Wetter haben kann und natürlich auch die luftbetankungsvorgänge da kann ich durch einen Fehler am Tanker quasi den ganzen Plan zunichte machen und damit ist natürlich der Druck der Erfolgsdruck dass das so funktioniert wie es soll noch mal wesentlich höher es gibt aber noch eine ganz andere Herausforderung die Toilette denn so etwas gibt es bei einem Eurofighter natürlich nicht bei 8 Stunden Flugzeit mit all den Klamotten und einem wasserschutzanzug gibt es nur zwei Möglichkeiten für die Piloten Schwierigkeit ist natürlich ich habe hier direkt das also hier vorne direkt das Gurtschloss vor mir hier noch den Steuerknüppel im Flugzeug also es ist insgesamt relativ wenig Platz ich habe hier diesen quer Reißverschluss wo ich mir nicht reingreifen an diese Gummilaschen rankommen kann den dann aufziehen kann und dann quasi eingreifen und ja letztendlich überall reinkommen wo ich reinkommen muss um pinkeln zu können es gibt aber auch Leute die sagen sich schwören zum Beispiel auf eine Windel und ja aber ich kann mir nicht vorstellen dass sieben Stunden oder 8 Stunden auf dieser oder in dieser Windel zu sitzen viel angenehmer ist der 24 Stunden Flug nach Singapur wird vor allem technisch eine Herausforderung das erleben wir gleich selbst wartungsmechanik charlie hat eine Fehlermeldung an einem der Eurofighter festgestellt im Normalfall ist wenig jetzt ist halt hier ein Fehler drauf kann ich jetzt direkt am Flieger die Situation noch nicht einschätzen somit laden wir jetzt die Daten kurz runter es geht ganz schnell und dann bewege ich den jetzt solche Fehler passieren immer wieder auf dem Weg nach Singapur werden die Mechaniker die Eurofighter in Abu Dhabi in Empfang nehmen und prüfen dort soll nichts schief gehen heute muss es schneller gehen denn die Flieger der sogenannten Alarmrotte müssen immer einsatzbereit sein okay kannst du Upload machen [Musik] die Maschine ist jetzt gut hat alles alte Tests waren gut das melde ich jetzt von der Einsatzsteuerung und dann geht's weiter [Musik] 7 Stunden werden die Eurofighter allein nach Abu Dhabi in der Luft sein kann das fehlerlos klappen schwierige Frage nee aber es ist wirklich also manchmal ist er wochenlang gar nichts und dann ist immer wieder dann gibt es über Maschine die zickt vielleicht ein bisschen mehr mal weniger also ausschließen können wir es nicht ja Schlimmste wäre wenn das System wirklich komplett ausfällt dass man irgendwie dann Computer tauschen muss in gut sechs Wochen starten die Kampfjets Richtung Singapur aber der Stopp in Abu Dhabi wird anders laufen als Charlie und sein Team es sich erhoffen [Musik] Mitte August 6 Uhr morgens heute machen sich die Mechaniker auf den Weg Richtung Abu Dhabi einen Tag früher als die Eurofighter sie müssen alles für den kurzen Zwischenstopp der Kampfflieger vorbereiten die sollen mitten in der Nacht in den Emiraten landen wir haben fünf Stunden auf jeden Fall von dem her ich glaube übrigens hin und ich habe keine Bedenken solange uns vertriebwerk in die Treppen gehen wenn man alles in Ordnung die Schwierigkeit tanken Fehlerbehebung pilotentausch das alles muss innerhalb weniger Stunden klappen auf einem fremden Flugplatz Charlie macht sich vor allem Gedanken um die Lage der Ersatzteile zur richtigen Zeit am richtigen Ort ist gerade auf den Drehscheiben bin noch mal alles durchgegangen die letzte Woche es sollte alles passen aber ich kann es in Australien dann bestätigen aber alles so gepackt war und alles richtig ist ja eingespielt knapp sieben Stunden Flug liegen jetzt vor den Soldatinnen und Soldaten [Musik] die Flugstrecke führt über die Alpen entlang der italienischen Adriaküste und den Nahen Osten Pilot Matthias bringt die Crew über Abu Dhabi nach Singapur und bis Darwin in Australien und fliegt dann noch weiter also wir sind insgesamt etwa 14 Tage unterwegs wir gehen dann von Darwin weiter über Sydney und fliegen dann über Tahiti auf die Osterinseln und dann über Bolivien und dann später war Atlantic crossing Azoren wieder zurück nach Wunstorf einmal um die Welt währenddessen im Laderaum Stimmung Netflix und chillen mit meiner Position jetzt ich gehe auch noch mit dem Kopf alles und so ein bisschen durch was wir noch vorbereiten müssen dann in altaflor selber das luftwaffenmanöver hat aber einen ernsten Hintergrund die Bundeswehr will im Indopazifik Präsenz zeigen erneut drohte die chinesische Führung man werde Taiwan notfalls mit Gewalt einnehmen es ist die größte militärische Machtdemonstration seit Jahrzehnten das führt zu erheblichen Spannungen in der ganzen Region [Musik] laut Experten gilt der indupazifik als das drohende Konfliktgebiet der nächsten Jahre ich glaube das kann man so als sich pauschalisieren oder sagen dass es sehr realistisch ist oder unrealistisch für uns ist so wichtig wir üben und trainieren für das immer auch unterwegs und das ist unser Beruf das machen wir jeden Tag und das war einfach den Fall der Fälle auch gewappnet sind nach gut sieben Stunden Flugzeit dann der Landeanflug auf Abu Dhabi und die Piloten stehen vor einer Schwierigkeit es ist kaum etwas zu sehen Sand verringert die Sicht auf unter 900 Meter plötzlich heißt es von Piloten vielleicht müsse er die Landung abbrechen und durchstarten doch gelandet in etwa 24 Stunden werden hier auch die Eurofighter landen dass die Nacht anders laufen wird als gedacht wissen die Mechaniker jetzt noch nicht [Musik] zurück in Neuburg ein paar letzte Checks dann geht es für die eurofather in die Luft die Challenge in 24 Stunden nach Singapur eigens für die Verlegung wurde einer der Flieger neu foliert er übernimmt die symbolische Führung der sechs euro-fighter oberstleutnern dranni wird den sogenannten R Ambassador bis Abu Dhabi fliegen die zweite Strecke bis Singapur übernimmt dann Pilot Holger das ist alles ein großer Herausforderung und etwas was die deutsche Luftwaffe bislang noch nicht gemacht hat soweit in den indupazifik zu verlegen innerhalb dieser Frist von 24 Stunden los geht's der Countdown läuft [Musik] währenddessen in Abu Dhabi Pilot Holger ist mit einer zivilen Maschine angekommen morgen früh soll er den neu folierten eurovater übernehmen und nach Singapur fliegen ja die Aufregung steigt ich bin gespannt ob alles so funktioniert wie wir uns das ausgedacht haben aber ich bin auch sehr zuversichtlich und wir starten gleich nach Sonnenaufgang das heißt ich muss also schon sehr früh aufstehen und dann anschließend lange wach und aufmerksam sein das steht mir vielleicht ein bisschen bevor noch wenige Stunden bis zur Ankunft der Eurofighter kurz vor 21 Uhr die Mechaniker machen sich auf den Weg zur Arbeit die ganzen letzten Monate hat ja mein Diensttag immer Australien irgendwie bekleidet und jetzt ist geht's endlich los und wir wollen ja endlich aussehen dass sie das alles auszahlt wo man darauf hingearbeitet haben Temperaturen von über 35 Grad nachts auf einem fast unbekannten Flugfeld sechs Stunden Zeit für tanken Reparaturen und den pilotentausch das heißt sie werden die Nacht durchmachen ein Uhr nachts pünktliche Ankunft der Eurofighter die Uhr tickt für die Mechaniker zählt jetzt jede Minute sie legen direkt los mit der Wartung der Maschinen System ist [Musik] besser als erwartet doch ausgerechnet mit dem symboljet gibt es Probleme die Kameraden der Instandsetzung müssen ran noch glauben Charlie und sein Team sie könnten das Problem beheben leider ist uns nur beim Testlauf dieses Fehlers ein weiterer Fehler entstanden der dann zu ja flugkritisch war ein hydrauliksensor versagt nur noch gut vier Stunden bis zum geplanten Weiterflug aufgrund dessen wusste ich jetzt muss ich an meinen Action Vorgesetzten melden wir haben ein Problem denn der kaputte Sensor ist nicht bei den Ersatzteilen im Transportflieger dabei mit diesen Problemen haben sie nicht gerechnet am frühen Morgen ist dann klar der Eurofighter kann nicht weiterfliegen die fünf anderen müssen ohne den symboljet weiter nach Singapur der Countdown läuft um die 24 Stunden Challenge noch zu schaffen müssen sie in gut 11 Stunden in Singapur sein ausgerechnet der symbolflieger aber bleibt am Boden ausgerechnet der von Pilot Holger ich habe schon gestern Nacht die Nachricht bekommen dass es ein Problem geben könnte und das hat sich jetzt leider als wahr herausgestellt aber auf anderen Seite sage ich auch safety first also ich bin lieber noch mal hier als das irgendwie in Menschenleben gefährdet wird Frust beim Wartungsteam nach den Ereignissen der Nacht es ist halt Technik manchmal ist der Wurm drin und kann keiner was dafür und jetzt müssen wir halt dann einfach jetzt erstmal so hinnehmen und dann jetzt ist mit unseren Wegen was mir schon eingeleitet haben einfach dann jetzt das beste draus machen jetzt geht's los auch für sie geht es weiter nach Singapur das Ersatzteil soll in den nächsten Stunden nach Abu Dhabi nachgeliefert werden währenddessen in der Luft eine speziell angebrachte Kamera der Bundeswehr zeigt den heiklenbetankungsvorgang der Kampfjets nur so ist die Strecke bis Singapur überhaupt möglich mehr als zehnmal muss jeder der Flieger ran starke Winde können das Einfangen des Korbes erschweren im schlimmsten Fall wird der Eurofighter dabei beschädigt und das könnte die ganze Mission gefährden [Musik] [Applaus] Landeanflug auf Singapur [Musik] nach 20 Stunden und 22 Minuten erreichen die fünf euro-vater erzielt dreieinhalb Stunden vor Ablauf des Ultimatums die 24 Stunden Challenge ist damit zwar geschafft aber eben nur mit fünf der sechs geplanten Maschinen [Musik] auch das Wartungsteam ist kurz vor der Landung in Singapur was ist ihr Fazit der Verlegung eine Maschine leider aus technischen Gründen jetzt noch hinterher hobbeln muss wir freuen uns jetzt einen Singapur endlich anzukommen da haben wir dann letztes mal ein paar Stunden Auszeit Ruhe für uns Landeanflug des A400M auf Singapur die Verlegung ist geschafft allerdings nicht zur problemlos wie von der Bundeswehr erhofft denn die Operation war teurer und aufwendiger als geplant in wenigen Stunden geht es für alle weiter nach Australien gemeinsam mit verbündeten werden die Eurofighter dort erstmals ein großes Militärmanöver fliegen in sechs Wochen sind die Soldatinnen und Soldaten dann wieder zurück in Deutschland [Musik]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="let's go to the latest developments in Gaza and the West Bank where the UN is struggling to get aid into the enclave while the IDF has fired warning shots near foreign diplomats in the West Bank david Sedfield is the director of Rise University's Baker Institute and is a former US envoy for Gaza aid he joins me now from Houston uh good to have you with us David appreciate your time now first to the news you know that the IDF had fired these uh what it calls warning shots at a group of foreign diplomats d touring in Janine in the West Bank how could this possibly have happened and and what you know would those diplomats be thinking you were one yourself uh in in the area i think the answer to this is a very simple one but it's also complex the simple answer is it's it's fog of combat fog of engagement the IDF is is heavily involved in operations in the West Bank as it is in Gaza um there is obviously a deconliction mechanism that's necessary in these kinds of circumstances my understanding is the diplomat's visit had been pre-arranged uh on a cleared route with the IDF what happened there will be the subject of investigation uh but there is obviously no justification uh for any form of risk uh or firing in the vicinity of diplomats yes i mean uh you mentioned fog of war the IDF says that you know this delegation had deviated from an approved path i mean is that is that a good enough excuse for the IDF well it's not a question of excuses it's an issue of of how to ensure that anyone uh who is conducting business that has been cleared by approved by the IDF is able to do so safely if the route was one that was not authorized by the IDF then that needs to come out in the form of investigation but we've seen many many cases in Gaza uh where humanitarian actors following completely approved routes no deviations uh still came under fire from or adjacent to fire by the IDF this kind of of problem deconliction problem uh has to be addressed at the highest levels okay let's uh look at the aid front you know we are still getting reports that the desperately needed food supplies are not really getting into those who really need them they're desperate for for them from your assessment where's the hold up look there there are two issues here first the population of Gaza approximately 2 million people has been denied uh humanitarian assistance since March 2nd uh the need is extreme a few trucks entering a few dozen or even a few hundred on a oneoff or two off basis won't address this need and because the need is so severe you have two problems the aid is inspected and moves to a platform a loading platform just inside Gaza it then has to be moved by the humanitarian agencies to their warehouses and from the warehouses to distribution points this has always been a difficult issue because those aid movements once they're within Gaza are subject to extraordinary security threat whether from lutters criminal gangs or what the humanitarian community calls self-distribution a desperate people taking the aid off of trucks off of lries as they move through my understanding is that the aid that's moved in over the past 72 hours a significant quantity has now been moved to the warehouses of the humanitarian actors away from that Gaza border platform but the point here is not what happened to a 100 trucks or 200 trucks you need hundreds of trucks a day 300 400 every day they're going to suffer predation initially and to keep it going yes and if Israel knows that in uh you know that the people in Gaza Palestinians there do need these hundreds and hundreds of trucks that you're talking about you know just to get by as well is there a a sense that you know this is a deliberate strategy to starve a population when Israel as a matter of declared state policy as it did at the beginning of March halts all movement of food humanitarian assistance that's state policy it started a clock ticking a powerful political international clock ticking which had to be addressed but the difficulty in Israel now and its political problem uh is you have two circles that need to be squared the recognition and I'm quite certain there is full recognition at the highest political levels and certainly within the Israeli Defense Forces they've got to get food in before actual starvation and famine appears that's one imperative the other imperative is purely political it's within the coalition it's within the cabinet of how do you meet that requirement to move assistance without triggering the threatened departure from government uh of two uh extreme nationalist parties from uh Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition it's the attempt to combine both of those imperatives that have created the difficulties but frankly unless the volume of assistance by the international humanitarian community increases and increases rapidly there will be at a point in coming weeks where famine and starvation do appear it's not a controversial point it's well understood it needs to be addressed now while there is time remaining and what's we've seen uh you know international pressure on um on Benjamin Netanyahu we'll speak about that later but can you give us a sense you've been to Gaza of at this moment how Palestinians are then viewing um Hamas as it is because it's it's still a force where it is there is little doubt that the Palestinian population of Gaza does not have strong support for Hamas hamas has brought this disaster this miserable uh situation of suffering onto the Palestinian people no question about that at all indeed the popularity of Hamas is lowest in Gaza if you take polling throughout the Arab world but still Hamas on the ground possesses the gun possesses the ability to influence the population and that's the difficulty where the IDF is not physically present in force hamas is the effective presence it has not been eliminated and and I'll make the point here elimination of Hamas i put the phrase in quotes how do you achieve that it's a goal everyone supports it's a vicious terrorist group it has agency it has produced this suffering it sustains the suffering of the Gazin people but you need both military pressure and you need a political framework and it's the political framework which has been absent uh during these past 19 months who might be responsible for the political framework i we are looking at actors beyond Israel and Gaza here well we are looking primarily at the government of Israel and I don't listen to analysts such as me on this listen to the public calls of the most senior Israeli national security leadersh who said the ability to eliminate Hamas through kinetic through military means only uh that can't be done you do need military pressure absolutely but you also need a framework and that framework is not just important for any resolution in Gaza that addresses Hamas it's critical to bringing in stabilization reconstruction assistance from the Arab world it's vital to the conclusion of the so-called Saudi deal that needs that political commitment from the government of Israel to a negotiated permanent status resolution those are hard words to hear in a traumatized Israel and I fully understand that but hard words are sometimes necessary to be spoken and that political framework is an essential element of anything in Gaza other than a continuation of desperation radicalization and misery and just briefly um are sanction sanctions against Israel or the threat of sanctions by some countries uh going to make any difference i do not believe those threats or application of sanctions are a useful tool in this situation look Hamas as I said has agency hamas created this in the massacre that occurred on October 7th 23 it could end the suffering of the Gazin people tonight this afternoon if it elected to do so it hasn't and it won't why because it believes it will win and a victory by Hamas its survival is a threat first and foremost of course to Israel and Israelis but also to the region as a whole so no I don't believe sanctions are appropriate what is appropriate is continued counseling which I have no doubt is coming from the United States as well as other friends of Israel partners of Israel that this situation needs to change and it cannot change solely through application of military force okay Dr david uh David Satderfield thank you so much for your insights into this thank you so much thank you" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="the police stopped them from getting to the Gaza crossing at Karam Shalom So they held their protest at the side of the road All the pictures of the children here of Gazan children that have been killed uh by our army Yeah And how does that make you feel Furious Um we are here to say no more There have been many demonstrations in Israel about the hostages still being held in Gaza but it's quite unusual to see people holding up pictures of Palestinian children Of course these people are on the left but still there is a growing concern about what is being done in Israel's name Some on the Israeli left thought the war was initially justified because of the October the 7th Hamas attacks but now they see nothing but cruelty Although we are not the majority uh we are the reality is still the same reality of genocide extermination famine uh transfer and expulsion plans Amongst the speakers reserveist Captain Ron Feer who faces 20 days in prison starting on Monday for disobeying orders by refusing to serve in Gaza Those orders are not moral They are not serving the h security interest of Israel They the only thing they will bring is death of more soldiers more Gazan civilians and our hostages I would prefer to not get punished but if this is the the price I have to pay for making my moral decisions and choices I'm okay with it A counterprotester arrives asking why they're holding up pictures of Palestinian children when Israeli children have also died &quot;We mourn both,&quot; she's told before the police move her away Across the road a small group who say that Israel must continue to attack Gaza were praying and cursing their enemies The wicked will perish Those who hate you will be destroyed Some were ready for an argument with any left-wing protester who ventured over We are not attacking civilians If you are taking babies under the ground and taking babies in your basement and you are a terrorist don't think we we not shoot you Okay This is a very very specific orders The Arabs make terror and terrorist And you're disagreeing Of course I disagree because in Egypt we did an agreement with the same Muslims There is peace in Jordan We have peace Agreements make security not military And and when he say they they the children the women they are bombing us I think it's a long war and somebody will give up Okay we are not going to give up because this is the land of the Jewish people I think the land is the land is of of God The land is of God I'm going to leave you two to carry on your argument A few miles away in Gaza they gathered not to protest but to dig out the dead and injured from the wreckage of a house in Jabalia destroyed by an overnight Israeli air strike About 50 people had been sheltering there A baby and a child were amongst the dead Neither protest within Israel nor sensia from European countries is stopping the Israeli government from continuing their onslaught The people of Gaza do not have the luxury of argument just the reality of trying to survive Well joining me now live from Tel Aviv the former Israeli Prime Minister Eh Almouth who was once in the same party as Benjamin Netanyahu but is now one of his biggest critics Thank you for joining us When we see Israelis accusing their government of war crimes of genocide it's a it's a remarkable thing Do you agree with those people that that's what's going on Well I uh may not use necessarily the same terminology of genocide Uh I'll be very hesitant Uh but uh the one thing is obvious What is done now in Gaza is totally unacceptable intolerable and unforgivable We have to stop the war immediately There is nothing that we can achieve by expanding the military operation that can be of any value Uh on the contrary we are likely to use the hostages to lose the hostages and to lose soldiers that will fall in battle and to kill many uninvolved Palestinians in Gaza None of which is something that worse this uh military operation We have to stop it and we have to try and come to some kind of an accommodation that will bring back all the hostages We've seen Netanyahu and his ministers attacking the British prime minister the French president effectively blaming them accusing them of uh of anti-semitism and of feeding anti-semitism with their language I mean what is happening to Israel's international relationships Look uh we certainly uh disagree completely with this uh language which is absolutely obnoxious and outrageous Uh Great Britain prime ministers Mr Sturma uh President Mcron Prime Minister Ki of Canada all are friends of the Jewish people and the state of Israel There's no question about it They may not be friends of the Israeli government I'm not a friend of the Israeli government and the majority of Israelis I believe today are not friends of the Israeli government So uh yeah we are all uh victims of this uh very uh very aggressive u government uh Prime Minister Netanyahu is a captive of these uh messianic groups of extreme right-wingers fundamentalists Benvir and Smriidge and their supporters and uh I think it is going to cost Israel a great deal in the international relations However I I can't criticize President Mcron Prime Minister Sturma or Prime Minister Khani or Prime Minister Melan or or the Prime Ministers of other European countries because I also criticize the Israeli government for more or less the same things So and I think that most of the Israelis feel like me They think that the war should end today and that we should bring all the hostages and there is no reason and no wisdom and no moral foundation for killing so many innocent non-involved people in Gaza has to stop The the opinion polls keep suggesting as you say that a majority are against this going on but the Israeli political process does not deliver that right now and and doesn't look like it will in the foreseeable future Well the you know you are democracy in great you know that sometimes government has a majority uh when everyone knows that the majority of votes in the parliament does not necessarily reflect the attitude of most of the people You were in a similar situation in Great Britain last year For most of the year uh 2024 there was a government and everyone knew that Labor is going to uh win the elections big time but as long as there was a majority in parliament they can do certain things So we are trying we are rioting in the streets hundreds of thousands of Israelis day in day out uh and we are taking all kinds of uh protest actions against this government trying to uh uh overthrow the government in a democratic manner of course uh by adding actions uh against this government and uh maybe also the international pressure and the attitude of countries which are known to be traditionally very friendship to the state of Israel British people French people the Canadian people and their leaderships they never were against the state of Israel They are against the government and if they will carry on uh in expressing their attitudes it may be very helpful to the public opinion of Israel Well I mean should they go beyond that There are calls for sanctions against members of the Israeli government Do you think that kind of pressure would be a good idea by countries like Britain and those in the European Union I'm temp tempted to say something which might sound cynical Uh if Britain will uh put sanctions on Benv and Smidge they will not be allowed to go to Britain And some people would say in Israel they'd better go to Britain and not come back So I don't know uh whether these sanctions I I think that uh I'd not like that the state of Israel and the people of Israel will suffer from for instance economic sanctions as the Europeans are threatening to take and Great Britain talking about a trade agreements with Israel which may be cancelled which will affect the Israeli people I'd very much hope that we will not come to that point But if we will come to that point I think it will be clear that the um guilt uh of for this lies entirely on the shoulders of the uh Israeli government And if you're right that the you know Israel may change its government one day in the future do you would you want to see that government delivering international law to effectively hand over Netanyahu to face criminal charges Well my my desire and I think the desire of many Israelis is that Netanyahu will disappear forever from the landscape of our political and public lives Okay So I think at this time what we are interested in is making a political change that will bring back down this government and will allow more decent more responsible uh and more humane people to take over and that they will be dedicated to what I think is the main objective of Israel to conclude once and for all the historic conflict between us and the Palestinians to proceed rapidly into a two-state solution negotiations between us and the Palestinians which is the only possible way to resolve this conflict This is what I was trying to do when I was my minister Unfortunately at that time Palestinian leadership was was not courageous enough to come along on this path But there is no alternative and this is what the new Israeli government will have to do And I hope that the Palestinian leadership at that time will be compatible in terms of its openness to take part in this effort And what will be the personal fate of Netanyahu is less important in as long as he will disappear completely from the landscape of our political and public lives Hood on Thank you very much indeed" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="At the center of this big factory in the Netherlands, in the midst of a months-long assembly process, there's a revolutionary machine that the whole world has come to rely on. You can see an EUV machine right behind me. The size of a city bus, but working with atomic level precision, these EUV lithography machines are the most expensive step in making every advanced microchip that powers the modern digital age: data centers, cars and every single iPhone. We are the only provider on the planet of this critical technology. These machines are the only way to print miniscule designs on these chips. They cost up to $200 million. And they're only made by a single company: Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography, or ASML. Today, ASML has a monopoly on the fabrication of EUV lithography machines, the most advanced type of lithography equipment that's needed to make every single advanced processor chip that we use today. And this company is one of the most extraordinary organizations in the world. The machines that they produce, each one of them is among the most complicated devices ever made. In the midst of a chip shortage that's caused backorders of everything from PS5s to Teslas, the need for ASML has never been higher. Its stock has skyrocketed since 2018. While it's three main customers, chipmakers TSMC, Intel and Samsung vie to be front-of-line for ASML's next breakthrough technology. The price tag for this next machine, which promises to push the boundaries of known physics, is more than $300 million. It's so expensive that most companies cannot afford it. While the chip was rage on, we wanted to find out what's really going on inside the quiet company making the machines that print them all. This is the optical part of the machine that makes EUV possible. We got a rare tour inside ASML's cleanrooms in California and the Netherlands to see how these machines use precision lasers, exploding molten tin, and the smoothest surface in the world to bring our digital age to life. ASML's crucial role on the chipmaking stage has brought it wild success over the past few years, making it even more valuable today than Intel, one of the biggest chipmakers it supplies. It's double digit growth every year. We're not a startup. No, we have now 32,000 people. Peter Wennink has been CEO since 2013. But he joined ASML back in 1999, just 15 years after its humble beginnings. It started as a subsidiary of Dutch electronics giant Philips in 1984, conducting research out of a leaky shed next to a Philips office building in Eindhoven in the Netherlands. They were in financial dire straits, so we had no money. We were poor. And because the problems Philips had were so big, nobody looked at this little outfit out there that was trying to do something crazy, so they neglected us. Still, in its first year, the company successfully launched a first-of-its-kind machine that used precise rays of light to print tiny designs on silicon to make microchips, a technology known as lithography. The first lithography tool really looked like a projector. There is basically a reticle, which holds the image that you want to project, then there is an optical system, which is going to take this image and project it on the wafer. Semiconductor lithography was invented in a U.S. military lab and for a long time, up through the 1980s, the key lithography firms were American, based in New England. Chris Miller of Tufts University is writing a book called, &quot;The Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology.&quot; When the industry was getting ready to jump into the early stages of EUV research, none of the U.S. firms were ready to take the plunge on what would be an expensive and risky proposition, whereas ASML was. By 1988, ASML had five U.S. offices with 84 employees and a new Dutch office that eventually became its headquarters in Veldhoven, where CNBC took a tour earlier this month. We're walking through the EUV factory, which is about 50,000 square meters of space with 1,500 employees, who are working in shifts seven by 24 to produce 100% of the EUV machines shipped worldwide from this facility. With a breakthrough machine, ASML started turning a profit and went public on the Amsterdam and New York Stock Exchange in 1995. By the 2000s ASML was acquiring California tech companies like Silicon Valley Group, and various key suppliers like Cymer in San Diego, where we also got an inside look at the cleanroom where ASML's light source is produced. So this is actually the nozzle manufacturing area where we actually build the nozzles. This is actually the piece where the tin shoots out of. That's what's going to create your EUV. EUV refers to extreme ultraviolet, an incredibly short wavelength of light that ASML uses to print smaller, more complex chips. But developing this revolutionary technology was incredibly expensive. We didn't have the money. So we went out and we found partners, which actually was the basis of the way that we built the company. So we were forced to be a system architect and a system integrator. In 2012, ASML offered about a quarter of its shares to its biggest three customers: Intel, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or TSMC. They had to accelerate the r&amp;d for EUV and the only way they could do this is to get their largest customers involved. And one way you can make your commitment real is to make them a shareholder. ASML is a Dutch company, but it's also a Dutch company that relies very heavily on U.S. components, in particular for its machines, and at this point, relies also very heavily on one Taiwanese customer for its sales. TSMC made up nearly 40% of ASML's sales last year. In 2019. The Taiwanese chipmaker was the first to deliver high volume chips made with EUV, a milestone that's kept it at the head of the pack ever since, its chip technology at least one node ahead of Samsung and Intel. And it has been TSMC's customers that have gained a lot of benefit, like AMD, Nvidia and others. And yeah, you can argue that this has come at the expense of Intel not executing. Intel is just now producing its first chips with EUV this year, three years behind TSMC. But it's made a bold move in hopes of catching up: an early investment to secure the first prototype of ASML's next machine, High Numerical Aperture. To understand why the success of a giant like Intel hinges on ASML, let's take a look at how EUV lithography revolutionized chipmaking. When you start breaking down, what does it take to make an EUV lithography machine it's sort of Nobel Prize winning in terms of the engineering involved. Chips are made from silicone, an abundant element found in rocks and sand, that's purified, melted down, then sliced into circular wafers, the surface on which chips are built in a grid formation. Each wafer can have dozens of thin layers, making up billions of transistors that determine what the chips can do. These layers are printed using lithography. Extremely precise rays of light are projected through a mask of the chip design. When the light hits the surface of the wafers, which have been coated with photoresist chemicals, it prints the minuscule designs on each layer at extremely high volumes. If you think of a typical processor chip in an iPhone, for example, will have over 10 billion transistors on a chip and Apple will sell 100 million or more iPhones for each model that's rolled out. So you're already talking in numbers that are far bigger than you or I remember how to pronounce. As the wavelength of the light source in making chips gets narrower and narrower. It gives us the ability to make chips with smaller features, which means the chip is faster, the chip can be smaller, the power consumption of the chip can be lower. The smallest transistors are more than 10,000 times thinner than a human hair. The designs have gotten so small ASML had to develop new methods of printing at the very edge of known physics. With the help of customer investments and a consortium of scientists, ASML figured out a way to create large amounts of extreme ultraviolet light with a wavelength so short, it's not only invisible to the human eye, it's absorbed by all natural substances, even air, so the entire process has to happen in a vacuum, a first for lithography. At 13.5 nanometers, ASML's EUV wavelength is the size of just five DNA strands lead side-by-side. The previous generation machines used deep ultraviolet light, or DUV, with a wavelength of 193 nanometers. The vast majority of ASML's business 268 of the 309 machines sold in 2021, still use DUV technology which is used to print the less advanced chips which are in shortest supply. DUV is for anything that is low technology like a toaster, or refrigerator, or even some of the electronics in your car. Today's iPhone 13 is EUV. Both DUV and EUV lithography is so advanced, it requires precision down to the atom. This is an EUV cabin of our cleanroom, which is 10,000 times cleaner than the outside air. We're wearing this clothing not to protect ourselves from the environment, but we're protecting the machine from the contamination that's created by us. This tiny threat may look like the strand of a spiderweb, but it's actually molten tin being shot out at a pressure of 4,000 psi. And it's how the EUV light is created. This is continuous tin. It never ever, ever stops. The tin is streaming through a perfectly calibrated nozzle which we saw being built in San Diego, at a rate of 50,000 droplets per second. A 30 kilowatt carbon dioxide laser hits each droplet twice per second, vaporizing them into plasma. These tiny explosions are what emit photons of EUV light. A huge number of tin explosions need to happen because only about 5% of the photons reach the actual wafer. The light particles are so short they get absorbed by mirrors, the typical method used to precisely aim light through a lens. So ASML partnered with German optics company Zeiss, which makes the flattest surface in the world. The flatness is really just incredible. If you took a mirror element that is maybe this big, and you blew it up to the size of the country that we're in, the biggest bump would only be about one millimeter across the entire surface of a mirror the size of this country. EUV light bounces off these groundbreaking Zeiss mirrors until it hits photoresist chemicals on the surface of the silicon wafer to print miniscule designs that make up the chips. The aim needs to be so precise, TSMC says it's equivalent to shining a laser from the moon to hit a coin on the earth. So your tin is inside a reservoir here, and then you're firing out this way. Pete Mayol has been running this cleanroom for six years. If any kind of defect particle whatsoever is even on the tip of that capillary, it's a fail. We'll remove and start all over again. And the speed and scale at which this has to happen is staggering. ASML says an EUV machine churns out about 3,000 wafers a day. There can be hundreds of chips on a 300 millimeter wafer, and up to 10 billion transistors per chip. They take extraordinary achievements of engineering and physics, and they're able to replicate these on a mass production scale, and at a low enough cost where these machines can be used in chip fabs to churn out thousands and millions of chips for the companies that buy them. A completed EUV machine is actually made up of seven different modules, each built at one of ASML's six manufacturing sites among its 60 total locations around the world, then shipped to and reassembled in Veldhoven for testing. Then it's disassembled again for shipment, which takes 20 trucks and three fully loaded 747s. In 2021, ASML sold 42 EUV machines, bringing the grand total it's ever shipped to just about 140. With each machine costing up to $200 million, only five customers can afford to buy EUV systems: Micron, SK Hynix, Samsung, Intel and TSMC, the last three making up nearly 84% of ASML's business. It certainly has eliminated a lot of players out of that market. So we saw GlobalFoundries back five years ago or more say that they weren't going to pursue a seven-nanometer chip. The handful of huge customers it does have are furiously adding capacity to try to ease the global chip shortage, which is impacting ASML, too. We got a lot of messages from our suppliers that said, hey, we might be late in delivering our modules to you guys because we cannot get the chips. And we said, if we cannot get the chips, we cannot make the machines to make more chips. So there's a catch 22. We're still managing, keep our fingers crossed. But it's a daily struggle. The question is, can ASML keep up with demand? I think the answer is probably yes. Maybe the growth will exceed even their targets, that's possible. But they're certainly preparing to ramp up the production, which is I think good news if you're worried about a chip shortage. The world needs more chips, so we need to make more machines, which by the way will keep growing in average selling price as long as we can drive the cost per transistor down, which is exactly what we've been doing for the last 38 years. And we will keep doing for the next couple decades. Before EUV, chipmakers had three companies they could choose from for their photo lithography tools: ASML, Nikon and Canon. Nikon, in Japan, is still a competitor for DUV, but ASML is the only option for EUV. Experts say it could take decades for any other company to catch up, not only because of ASML's proprietary tech, but because it's built complex, often exclusive, deals with nearly 800 suppliers. And we're unique to our customers, like some of our suppliers are unique to us. And those almost symbiotic relationships, some people say are worse than being married because you cannot divorce. It takes 10 years to not only get the technology but then be accepted. So the buyers for semiconductor manufacturing fabs are very risk averse. One of the ways ASML has insulated itself against supply chain risks is by purchasing some of its suppliers, like Berliner Glas in 2020. A fire broke out there in January. But Wennink says it won't significantly impact system output in 2022. Instead, ASML projects a 20% sales growth this year, and an annual revenue growth rate of 11% until the end of the decade. It's actually driven by you. You're asking for more solutions that will help you to have a better life, to make your life easier, your life more productive. We're changing into a sensing world. There are sensors everywhere. They're in your car, they're in your fridge, they're in your PC, they're everywhere. Sensors, they need semiconductors. All of the world's most advanced semiconductors are made in Asia by two of ASML's biggest customers, TSMC and Samsung. But the chip shortage has raised concerns about overseas dependency. This is why you see all these initiatives around the globe: the U.S. CHIPS Act, the EU Chips Act, the Korean Chips Act, the Japanese Chips Act, the Chinese Chips Act. It's now a very strategic commodity. Intel just announced a $20 billion chip fab in Ohio. And it's also building one in Arizona, just down the road from a massive new fab where TSMC will make advanced chips in the U.S. for the first time. And Samsung is building a $17 billion fab in Texas. All this came after President Joe Biden proposed the CHIPA Act, with $52 billion in subsidies for chip companies to manufacture on U.S. soil. It means that we need to ship our machines sooner, earlier, and at higher volume. So it means we need to hire more people in the U.S. It's talent, it's people. I think that's where the biggest challenge will be. But this movement toward domestic production has another side that poses a challenge for ASML: a desire to stop sharing chipmaking technology with China. China has wanted to get into that race. But there's been politically generated reasons why China has not had access to the same type of technology as other companies. As far back as 2018, the Trump administration reportedly pressed ASML not to sell EUV systems to China. ASML still hasn't sold a single EUV machine to China. 43, 42 countries around the globe have agreed to put export control measures on it because it's so critical. So it's not our choice. It's the choice of governments. ASML also refurbishes older lithography systems and sends many of those to China, more recent DUV machines all the way back to its early systems from the 90s. 96% of all the machines we ever sold, we ever shipped, are still working. There's a lot of debate about whether selling additional DUV equipment to China is also a national security risk by letting China increase its ability to manufacture close-to-cutting-edge semiconductors. So I think there's some chance that in the coming years, there are new restrictions that are imposed on ASML's ability to sell DUV equipment to China as well. If export controls were expanded to include DUV machines, it could greatly impact ASML's bottom line. This is where the biggest demand is. This is where the exponential curve is. So trust me, we need every manufacturing capability on the planet, whether it's in Korea or in China, to just keep adding capacity. Let's go look at the big boy. And then there's the question of whether demand for the most advanced chips will remain high enough to support continued development of ASML's next generation EUV machine, High NA. This is the machine Intel announced it will have first, by 2025. And ASML has already sold four other units. This is the EXE 5000. So this is what we'll be testing for High NA.This will be what makes our next generations even better. But even now, before the bigger, better machines, the whole world's reliance on ASML is only growing, no matter what gets in the way. What can really get in the way is the geopolitics like the Russia and the Ukraine war right now. Those are big geopolitical friction points that can, of course, not only hurt us, but hurt the world economy. But apart from that, let's hope and let's pray that can be controlled, then it's all about execution. And we will keep shrinking the cost per transistor and we will provide the world with ever more powerful semiconductors. That's not going to stop." />

ACUITY IN THE. &gt;&gt; PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. &gt;&gt; THE CURRENT PRESIDENT. THIS WEEKEND, THE PRESIDENT. &gt;&gt; OF THE UNITED STATES ENDORSED. &gt;&gt; A SOCIAL MEDIA POST THAT SAYS THERE IS NO JOE BIDEN EXECUTED IN 2020. BIDEN CLONES, DOUBLES AND ROBOTIC ENGINEERED. &gt;&gt; SOULLESS. &gt;&gt; MINDLESS ENTITIES ARE WHAT YOU SEE. NEEDLESS TO SAY, DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; IS THE ONLY. &gt;&gt; PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. WHO CAN PUBLICLY EMBRACE AND. ACCEPT AND BELIEVE SUCH INSANITY WITHOUT IMMEDIATELY PROVOKING A RUSH OF QUESTIONS BY THE. &gt;&gt; WHITE HOUSE. &gt;&gt; PRESS CORPS AND. NEWS ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE WORLD ABOUT THE SANITY OF THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, WHICH MEANS. THAT THE INSANITY OF THE CURRENT. &gt;&gt; AMERICAN PRESIDENT. &gt;&gt; IS NOW. &gt;&gt; OFFICIALLY TAKEN FOR GRANTED. IN THE NEWS MEDIA. NO HUGE BANNERS. &gt;&gt; OURELY. &gt;&gt; ENGINEER A ROBOTIC. &gt;&gt; SOULLESS, MINDLESS ENTITY TO BE SMARTER. &gt;&gt; THAN DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY. &gt;&gt; OF THE AMERICAN. &gt;&gt; NEWS MEDIA. HAS ABSOLUTELY. &gt;&gt; NO PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; NOW, WITH DONALD TRUMP SAYING. THERE IS. &gt;&gt; NO JOE. &gt;&gt; BIDEN EXECUTED. IN 2020. DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; DIDN'T ACTUALLY WRITE THOSE WORDS. &gt;&gt; HIMSELF, BUT HE FOUND THOSE WORDS IN HIS POISON SOCIAL MEDIA FEED, AND HE DECIDED TO FULLY. &gt;&gt; ENDORSE AND EMBRACE THOSE WORDS. &gt;&gt; THE NEW YORK TIMES REMAINS ONE OF THE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS THAT FINDS THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR IN A PRESIDENT STRANGE. &gt;&gt; THOUGH NOT WORTHY. &gt;&gt; OF BIG FRONT PAGE HEADLINES. AND SO THE NEW YORK. &gt;&gt; TIMES RAN A STORY TITLED. TRUMP AMPLIFIES ANOTHER OUTLANDISH. CONSPIRACY THEORY. BIDEN IS A ROBOTIC. &gt;&gt; CLONE. AND HERE IS THE MOST. &gt;&gt; IMPORTANT LINE IN THAT STORY. &gt;&gt; THE WHITE HOUSE DID NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT. ON THE. &gt;&gt; POST ABOUT MR. BIDEN. &gt;&gt; THAT, OF COURSE, WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR. &gt;&gt; ANY OTHER WHITE HOUSE IF THE PRESIDENT AMPLIFIED. &gt;&gt; QUOTE. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER OUTLANDISH. CONSPIRACY THEORY. IF ANY OTHER PRESIDENT SAID THAT A. &gt;&gt; PREVIOUS LIVING PRESIDENT. &gt;&gt; IS A ROBOTIC. &gt;&gt; CLONE. &gt;&gt; THAT WHITE HOUSE WOULD. &gt;&gt; NOT BE ABLE TO SIMPLY. &gt;&gt; REFUSE TO COMMENT. &gt;&gt; BUT THAT IS HOW FULLY DONALD TRUMP HAS CRUSHED POLITICAL REPORTING AND POLITICAL COVERAGE. &gt;&gt; IN THIS COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE HE HAS CRUSHED IT, HE CAN, IN PUBLICITY TERMS ANYWAY, GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING AND HEITE HOUSE DID NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT ON THE POST ABOUT MR. BIDEN. IF YOU WANT TO RUSH TO DONALD TRUMP'S DEFENSE, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GUESS AT A DEFENSE. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE UP A DEFENSE THAT DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF HAS NOT OFFERED. YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BELIEVE, AS A RESULT OF THAT SINGLE POST ALONE, THAT DONALD TRUMP IS COMPLETELY DERANGED AND HAS NO IDEA WHAT DAY IT IS OR WHAT COUNTRY HE LIVES IN, THAT IS AS DEFENSIBLE A REACTION TO DONALD TRUMP'S POST AS THE NOTION THAT IT'S A JOKE. NEITHER ONE OF THOSE REACTIONS CAN BE PROVED, BUT WHAT IS UNDENIABLE BY ANYONE, ANYWHERE, THE STILL BREATHTAKING STUPIDITY OF DONALD TRUMP TO FIND THAT POST, AND THE POISONOUS FLOW OF HIS SOCIAL MEDIA AND DECIDE THAT THAT'S THE ONE, THAT'S THE ONE HE WANTS TO PUSH THAT DAY. THAT IS A MAN WHOSE STUPIDITY KNOWS NO BOUNDS. THAT IS THE MAN WHOSE STUPIDITY NEVER BUMPS INTO DECENCY, WHICH WOULD THEN PREVENT HIM FROM DOING THE INDECENT, THE STUPID. IN FACT, DONALD TRUMPEN NEVER PARDONED ANYBODY WHO STOLE $200 MILLION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AND JOE BIDEN NEVER APPOINTED ANYONE TO ANYTHING AS INCOMPETENT AND RECKLESS AND CRUEL AS ELON MUSK, WHO BID HIS FAREWELL TO HIS FORMAL ENGAGEMENT OF SERVICE WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ON FRIDAY IN THE OVAL OFFICE, WHERE HIS PHYSICAL BEHAVIOR GAVE MANY INDICATIONS OF POSSIBLY CONFIRMING THE HEADLINE THAT EMERGED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT VERY DAY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, ELON MUSK JUGGLED DRUGS AND FAMILY DRAMA. WE AWAIT AN EXPLANATION OF ELON MUSK'S PHYSICALITY, INCLUDING HIS INEXPLICABLE GAZES AT THE CEILING AND HEAD TWISTING AT THE CEILING IN THE OVAL OFFICE. THE FOX WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, WHO APPEARED TO BE THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES OF THE PRESS CORPS IN THE OVAL OFFICE ON FRIDAY BECAUSE HE WAS ALLOWED TO ASK MANY MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANYONE ELSE, SEEMS TO BE ON HIS WAY TO ASK ABOUT THE NEW YORK TIMES. BREAKING NEWS ABOUT ELON MUSK'S DRUG USE. &gt;&gt; THERE IS A NEW YORK. &gt;&gt; TIMES REPORT TODAY. &gt;&gt; THAT ACCUSES YOU OF BLURRING. &gt;&gt; THE LINE. &gt;&gt; BETWEEN NEW YORK TIMES. IS THAT THE SAME PUBLICATION? &gt;&gt; NOTICE THAT THE FOX REPORTER IMMEDIATELY STOPPED WHEN ELON MUSK ORDERED HIM TO STOP AND WAIT. ELON MUSK THEN WENT INTO A LYING SOLILOQUY ABOUT THE NEW YORK TIMES, ENDING WITH A DIRECT ORDER TO THE FOX FOX REPORTER, TO QUOTE THESE WERE HIS WORDS MOVE ON, AND THE FOX REPORTER DID EXACTLY WHAT RUPERT MURDOCH IS PAYING HIM TO DO IN THAT SITUATION. HE MOVED ON WHEN ORDERED TO MOVE ON BY ANYONE IN TRUMP WORLD. THAT IS THE SAME FOX REPORTER WHO GLEEFULLY JOINED IN THE SCREAMING AT JOE BIDEN OR HIS PRESS SECRETARY IN THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE. EVERY REPORTER WORKING IN THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE KNEW THEY COULD SCREAM AT JOE BIDEN OR SCREAM AT THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY AND NOT BE KICKED OUT OF THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE PERMANENTLY OR EVER. AND LIKE CHILDREN WHO KNOW THEY WON'T GET IN TROUBLE IF THEY DO IT, THEY DID IT. THEY SCREAMED AT JOE BIDEN AND HIS PRESS SECRETARY. AND LIKE CHILDREN WHO KNOW THEY WILL GET IN TROUBLE IF THEY DO IT, THEY DON'T DARE DO IT NOW, BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HAS CRUSHED ALL OF THAT. AND SO DONALD TRUMP AND ELON MUSK GOT AWAY WITH ANOTHER LYING SESSION WITHOUT ANY SERIOUS CHALLENGE FROM A SINGLE WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, NOT ONE OF WHOM ASKED ELON MUSK HOW IT FELT TO KILL CHILDREN. NOT ONE OF THOSE WHITE HOUSE REPORTERS COVERING ELON MUSK'S FAREWELL FROM GOVERNMENT SERVICE ASKED HIM TO REPLY TO BILL GATES DESCRIPTION OF ELON MUSK AS THE WORLD'S RICHEST MAN, KILLING THE WORLD'S POOREST CHILDREN. THAT IS ELON MUSK'S SINGULAR ACHIEVEMENT IN GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE ELON MUSK DECIDED TO DESTROY THE UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, THE AGENCY THAT WAS FEEDING MORE STARVING CHILDREN IN THE WORLD THAN ANY OTHER AGENCY. MORE STARVING CHILDREN IN THE WORLD DEPENDED ON SURPLUS FOOD FROM THE UNITED STATES TO SURVIVE. FOOD WE DO NOT NEED AND CANNOT CONSUME, FOOD WE HAVE OVERPRODUCED IN THIS COUNTRY. AND ELON MUSK DECIDED TO TAKE THAT FOOD AWAY FROM THEM AND LET THEM DIE. AND THAT IS NOT NEWS TO THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS. NO ONE IS COUNTING BECAUSE ELON MUSK FIRED THE PEOPLE WHO WERE COUNTING, COLLECTING STATISTICS AND ADVANCED ECONOMIES IS RELATIVELY EASY, WITH ADVANCED METHODS RELATIVELY ACCURATE. BUT IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD, THE MOST IMPOVERISHED PARTS OF THE WORLD, STATISTICS CAN BE HARD TO COME BY. NOT EVERY BABY GETS A BIRTH CERTIFICATE. NOT EVERY BABY GETS A DEATH CERTIFICATE. THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE COUNTING HOW MANY PEOPLE ELON MUSK KILLED BY KILLING USAID WERE THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ELON MUSK FIRED FROM USAID. SO ELON MUSK COMMITS THE GREATEST CRIME OF THE 21ST CENTURY AGAINST THE POVERTY POPULATION OF THE WORLD, AND FIRES EVERYONE WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO QUANTIFY FOR US THE ENORMITY OF THE CRIME. THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTS, QUOTE, MR. MUSK, MUSK'S DRUG CONSUMPTION WENT WELL BEYOND OCCASIONAL USE. HE TOLD PEOPLE HE WAS TAKING SO MUCH KETAMINE, A POWERFUL ANESTHETIC, THAT IT WAS AFFECTING HIS BLADDER, A KNOWN EFFECT OF CHRONIC USE. HE TOOK ECSTASY AND PSYCHEDELIC MUSHROOMS, AND HE TRAVELED WITH A DAILY MEDICATION BOX THAT HELD ABOUT 20 PILLS, INCLUDING ONES WITH THE MARKINGS OF THE STIMULANT ADDERALL, ACCORDING TO A PHOTO OF THE BOX AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN IT, HE HAD A WHOLE BOX FULL OF DRUGS THAT HE COULD HAVE BEEN USING WHEN HE WAS TAKING LIFE SAVING DRUGS AWAY FROM CHILDREN. THE NEW YORK TIMES ACCOUNT IS ABOUT THE DRUGS ELON MUSK WAS TAKING DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. NBC NEWS HAS NOT INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED, CONFIRMED THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTING ELON MUSK HAS NOT ACTUALLY DENIED A SINGLE WORD OF THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTING. THE NEW YORK TIMES SAYS, QUOTE, WE PROVIDED MUSK WITH MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO REPLY OR REBUT THIS REPORTING BEFORE PUBLICATION, AND HE DECLINED. THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTING SUGGESTS THAT ELON MUSK TOOK FLIGHT ON A CAMPAIGN STAGE WITH DONALD TRUMP THE FIRST TIME HE WAS UP THERE, BECAUSE HE WAS POSSIBLY ON KETAMINE OR ECSTASY OR ADDERALL OR PSYCHEDELIC MUSHROOMS OR ALL OF THE ABOVE. AT THE SAME TIME. THE TIMES OBTAINED A TEXT MESSAGE BEFORE ELON MUSK JOINED THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, IN WHICH ELON MUSK COMPLAINED ABOUT THE INVESTIGATIONS OF HIS BUSINESSES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS DOING. AT THE TIME. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION VIEWS ME AS THE NUMBER TWO THREAT AFTER TRUMP. I CAN'T BE PRESIDENT, BUT I CAN HELP TRUMP DEFEAT BIDEN AND I WILL, HE ADDED. AND THE REST IS TRAGIC HISTORY. THE RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD POURED MONEY INTO A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, MORE MONEY THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS, AND HE DID IT TO END THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS AIMING AT HIS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. AND, OF COURSE, DONALD TRUMP ENDED THOSE INVESTIGATIONS BECAUSE YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR WITH DONALD TRUMP, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE THE RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD. THE WORLDWIDE CRUELTY CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED BY ELON MUSK AND DONALD TRUMP, NOW INCLUDES DEPORTING PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER COMMITTED A CRIME TO COUNTRIES WHERE THEY HAVE NEVER LIVED AND DO NOT SPEAK THE LANGUAGE. ELON MUSK SEEMS TO BELIEVE THAT CRUELTY IS THE ANTIDOTE TO EMPATHY, WHICH HE CONSIDERS A GREAT HUMAN WEAKNESS. ELON MUSK TOLD THE COMEDIAN JOE ROGAN, QUOTE, THE FUNDAMENTAL WEAKNESS OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION IS EMPATHY. ABRAHAM LINCOLN DID NOT KNOW THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN BELIEVED HE SHOULD GOVERN WITH EMPATHY. SO DID FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT. SO DID MOST PRESIDENTS, SOME BETTER THAN OTHERS. IT WAS EMPATHY, COUPLED WITH GEOPOLITICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH WISDOM, THAT LED PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH TO CREATE THE PRESIDENT'S EMERGENCY PLAN FOR AIDS RELIEF, WHICH SAVED 26 MILLION LIVES IN AFRICA ALONE. BEFORE ELON MUSK DECIDED THOSE LIVES WERE NOT WORTH SAVING. &gt;&gt; HAS ANYONE IN THE WORLD DIED BECAUSE OF WHAT ELON MUSK DID? THE YES OR NO? RECLAIMING MY TIME. IF YOU WON'T ANSWER, THAT'S A LOUD ANSWER. &gt;&gt; NO ONE HAS. &gt;&gt; DIED BECAUSE. &gt;&gt; OF USAID. THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; WHO HAVE DIED. &gt;&gt; AS A RESULT. &gt;&gt; OF CUTTING OFF THE OXYGEN OF A WOMAN IN BURMA AND DENYING HIV. &gt;&gt; AIDS TREATMENT &gt;&gt; ASKING ME QUESTIONS? &gt;&gt; MY JOB IS TO ASK YOU QUESTIONS. &gt;&gt; ONE THAT'S CLAIMING THAT. &gt;&gt; SECRETARY. &gt;&gt; I'M RECLAIMING MY TIME. SECRETARY, I'M RECLAIMING MY CLIENT. THIS IS WHY I'M INTRODUCING THE RUBIO ACT. SO YOU FOCUS ON THE ONE JOB. &gt;&gt; THAT THE. &gt;&gt; SENATE GAVE YOU TO. SERVE AS OUR SECRETARY OF STATE, BECAUSE YOU. ARE CLEARLY DISTRACTED. OKAY. AFTER LAST FEW MONTHS, I UNDERSTAND WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SUCH COLORFUL NICKNAMES FOR YOU. YOU'RE OBEDIENT. YOU'RE FOLLOWING THE RULES. YOU WILL DO ANYTHING THE PRESIDENT TELLS YOU TO DO WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE LAW, THE CONSTITUTION, AMERICA'S SECURITY, OR STANDING AS A LEADER IN THE WORLD. UNLIKE YOU, I DO NOT FEAR CROSSING DONALD TRUMP. I REFUSE TO GIVE UP ON THESE CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; MARCO RUBIO DID NOT TELL THE TRUTH TO THE COMMITTEE, AND THE PROOF THAT HE WAS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH IS THAT HE HAS CHANGED HIS STORY. AFTER THAT TESTIMONY, THE WASHINGTON POST FACT CHECKED MARCO RUBIO'S TESTIMONY, SAYING THERE IS NO DISPUTE THAT PEOPLE HAVE DIED BECAUSE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ABRUPTLY SUSPENDED FOREIGN AID. ONE MIGHT QUIBBLE OVER WHETHER TENS OF THOUSANDS OR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS HAVE DIED. IN HIS TESTIMONY, SECRETARY OF STATE RUBIO TRIED TO CONTRADICT REPORTING FROM AFRICA, FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES, NICHOLAS KRISTOF NICHOLAS KRISTOF RESPONDED TO RUBIO'S TESTIMONY, WRITING IN THE NEW YORK TIMES, LET ME HELP RUBIO WITH THE TRUTH. MEET EVAN ONZA, A FIVE YEAR OLD BOY WHO WAS BORN WITH HIV IN SOUTH SUDAN. I MENTIONED EVAN IN A COLUMN IN MARCH FROM SOUTH SUDAN. THIS WAS A CHILD AS PRECIOUS AS YOURS OR MINE. EVAN'S LIFE WAS IN OUR HANDS, AND FOR FIVE YEARS, AMERICA KEPT HIM ALIVE WITH ANTIRETROVIRAL MEDICINES COSTING LESS THAN $0.12 A DAY THROUGH THE PRESIDENT'S EMERGENCY PLAN FOR AIDS RELIEF, OR PEPFAR. THIS WAS A PROGRAM STARTED BY PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH AND HAS SAVED MORE THAN 26 MILLION LIVES SO FAR, AND IT TURNED THE TIDE OF AIDS AROUND THE WORLD AND BUILT ENORMOUS GOODWILL TOWARD THE UNITED STATES. THEN ALONG CAME PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS FREEZE ON MOST HUMANITARIAN AID IN JANUARY. HOW COULD A FIVE YEAR OLD ORPHAN POSSIBLY OBTAIN MEDICINE ON HIS OWN? EVAN WEAKENED AND SOON DIED OF AN OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTION, MARCO RUBIO TOLD THE HOUSE COMMITTEE. NO CHILDREN ARE DYING ON MY WATCH. EVAN DIED ON HIS WATCH. EVAN'S, OF ALL AGES ARE DYING ON MARCO RUBIO'S WATCH, AND NO ONE IS COUNTING. AND SO WE DON'T KNOW AS OF TONIGHT WHETHER IT'S TENS OF THOUSANDS OR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF EVAN'S, BUT WE KNOW IT WILL BE. IN A NEW YORK TIMES COLUMN TITLED, QUOTE, ELON MUSK'S LEGACY IS DISEASE, STARVATION AND DEATH. MICHELLE GOLDBERG REPORTS. BROOKE NICHOLS, AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF GLOBAL HEALTH AT BOSTON UNIVERSITY, HAS ESTIMATED THAT THESE CUTS HAVE ALREADY RESULTED IN ABOUT 300,000 DEATHS, MOST OF THEM OF CHILDREN, AND WILL MOST LIKELY LEAD TO SIGNIFICANTLY MORE BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THIS IS WHAT MUSK'S FORAY INTO POLITICS ACCOMPLISHED. IF THERE WERE JUSTICE IN THE WORLD, MUSK WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO REPAIR HIS REPUTATION, AT LEAST NOT WITHOUT DEVOTING THE BULK OF HIS FORTUNE TO EASING THE MISERY HE'S ENGENDERED. MUSK'S SOJOURN IN GOVERNMENT HAS REVEALED SEVERE FLAWS IN HIS CHARACTER A BLITHE, DEHUMANIZING CRUELTY AND A DEADLY INCURIOSITY. BILL GATES HAS SEEN STARVING CHILDREN IN AFRICA MANY, MANY TIMES AND HAS DEVOTED HIS LIFE AND HIS BILLIONS TO TRYING TO SAVE THEM, WHICH MAKES BILL GATES VERDICT ON THE CURRENT RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD SO IMPORTANT AND POWERFUL. BILL GATES, THE FORMER RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD, SAID THE PICTURE OF THE WORLD'S RICHEST MAN KILLING THE WORLD'S POOREST CHILDREN IS NOT A PRETTY ONE, AND THE PICTURE OF THE RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD CARRYING AROUND HIS DRUG BOX OF ECSTASY, ADDERALL, PSYCHEDELIC MUSHROOMS AND THEN TAKING LIFE SAVING DRUGS AWAY FROM THE POOREST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD IS A PICTURE ONLY DONALD TRUMP COULD HAVE CREATED. AND WITH ELON MUSK AND DONALD TRUMP, SOULLESS, MINDLESS ENTITIES" />

TONIGHT, THE SUPREME COURT ONCE MORE CALLED UPON TO SETTLE A QUESTION OF PRESIDENTIAL POWERS. IN THIS CASE, THE ABILITY OF FEDERAL COURTS TO BLOCK PRESIDENTIAL EXEC OF IT ORDERS. TODAY, THE JUSTICES HEARING ARGUMENTS RELATED TO BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP GUARANTEED IN THE CONSTITUTION. PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS TO TAKE AWAY CITIZEN OF CHILDREN BORN IN THE U.S. TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT, THE ADMINISTRATION ARGUES THE COURTS HAVE BEEN EXCEEDING THEIR AUTHORITIES. IT'S ONE OF DOZENS OF TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS HELD UP BY COURTS. THE ADMINISTRATION ARGUING THE COURTS HAVE BEEN EXCEEDING ITS AUTHORITY, IT MAY HAVE FOUND A SYMPATHETIC EAR AMONG SUPREME COURT CONSERVATIVES WITH THE ORAL ARGUMENTS. IT'S WHERE WE START WITH LAURA JARRETT. &gt;&gt; REACHING THE SUPREME COURT TODAY. &gt;&gt; PRESIDENTS WANT TO GET THINGS DONE. &gt;&gt; THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HOPING TO CONVINCE THE JUSTICES THAT A SINGLE FEDERAL JUDGE IN A SINGLE STATE HAS NO AUTHORITY TO BLOCK AN EXECUTIVE ORDER FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. PRESIDENT TRUMP FACING NEARLY 40 SO-CALLED NATIONWIDE INJUNCTIONS ON A HOST OF ISSUES SO FAR IN HIS SECOND TERM, PARTICULARLY ON IMMIGRATION, INCLUDING TODAY'S CASE OF LOWER COURTS BLOCKING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDER, STRIPPING BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP TO CHILDREN BORN IN THE U.S. TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS. THE COURT'S CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY TODAY SEEMING OPEN TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S ARGUMENTS ON THE DANGERS OF JUDICIAL OVERREACH. &gt;&gt; THERE ARE 680 DISTRICT COURT JUDGES AND THEY ARE DEDICATED AND THEY ARE SCHOLARLY, AND I'M NOT IMPUGNING THEIR MOTIVES IN ANY WAY, BUT YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THEY'RE WRONG. SOME LIBERAL MEMBERS OF THE COURT GRILLING THE ADMINISTRATION ON WHAT HAPPENS IF JUDGES CANNOT BLOCK AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THEY BELIEVE IS ILLEGAL ON A NATIONWIDE BASIS. &gt;&gt; LET'S JUST ASSUME YOU ARE DEAD WRONG. DOES EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT IS AFFECTED BY THIS EO HAVE TO BRING THEIR OWN SUIT? &gt;&gt; DEMOCRATIC STATE OFFICIALS BACKING TODAY'S SUIT ARGUING A PATCHWORK OF CITIZENSHIP WOULD EMERGE IF THE ADMINISTRATION WINS HERE WITH RIGHTS VARYING FROM STATE TO STATE. STILL, THERE HAVE BEEN BIPARTISAN CRITICISM OF JUDGES ABUSING NATIONWIDE INJUNCTION, INCENTIVIZING SO-CALLED JUDGE SHOPPING FOR SYMPATHETIC COURTS. &gt;&gt; WE ARE BEING HIT HARD BY JUDGES THAT I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY THE POWER OF THE PRESIDENCY. &gt;&gt; LAURA IS HERE. THERE ARE NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CASE OF THE WISCONSIN JUDGE WHO WAS JUST INDICTED. &gt;&gt; YES. HANNAH DUGAN MAKING A BRIEF APPEARANCE IN COURT PLEADING NOT GUILTY. SHE'S BEING CHARGED WITH HELPING AN UNDOCUMENTED MAN BEING ESCORTED OUT OF THE COURTROOM SO HE CAN EVADE ARREST. SHE SAYS SHE'S ENTITLED TO JUDICIAL IMMUNITY. &gt;&gt; LAURA, THANKS. &gt;&gt;&gt; IT IS TURNING INTO A NIGHT OF TORNADO SIRENS AND THIS SHOWS A TORNADO TOUCHING DOWN IN WESTERN WISCONSIN, ONE OF SIX REPORTED SO FAR AND THE THREAT REMAINS ACROSS THE MIDWEST AND THE PLAINS. AL ROKER IS HERE AND THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING. &gt;&gt; LESTER, A VOLATILE NIGHT. WE HAVE TORNADO WATCHES AND TORNADO WARNINGS ALL OF THE WAY DOWN FROM ILLINOIS ON UP INTO PARTS OF MINNESOTA THROUGH LATER TONIGHT AND WE'VE GOT SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCHES ALONG THE MID ATLANTIC STATES. 60 MILLION PEOPLE, MINNEAPOLIS, CHICAGO, FORT WAYNE. THIS AREA IN PINK, THAT'S UP TO EF2 TORNADOS AND WE'LL BE WATCHING THAT OVERNIGHT TONIGHT. TOMORROW, 70 MILLION PEOPLE AT RISK FROM LEXINGTON, POPLAR BLUFF, AGAIN, THE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS AND TORNADOES FROM INDIANAPOLIS DOWN TO NASHVILLE AND THEN ON SATURDAY, LESTER, FROM UPSTATE NEW YORK ALL OF THE WAY INTO TEXAS, 56 MILLION PEOPLE. AGAIN, MORE SEVERE WEATHER AND BRUTAL HEAT INTO THE WEEKEND. &gt;&gt; OKAY. AL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. &gt;&gt; WE TURN NOW TO THE TRIAL OF SEAN &quot;DIDDY&quot; COMBS. CASSIE VENTURA WAS BACK ON THE STAND TODAY. HIS FORMER GIRLFRIEND FACED QUESTIONS FROM COMBS' LAWYER SEEKING TO UNDERMINE HER TESTIMONY. OUR CHLOE MELAS REPORTS FROM THE COURTHOUSE. &gt;&gt;&gt; CASSIE VENTURA BACK ON THE WITNESS STAND TODAY, THIS TIME FACING CROSS-EXAMINATION FROM SEAN COMBS' LAWYERS. HIS DEFENSE TEAM FIGHTING BACK AGAINST TESTIMONY THAT VENTURA WAS FORCED TO PARTICIPATE IN DRUG-FUELED SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS KNOWN AS FREAK-OFFS. COMBS' TEAM SUBMITTING OFTEN EXPLICIT TEXT MESSAGES AND EMAILS SENT BETWEEN THE FORMER COUPLE INTO EVIDENCE. IN ONE, VENTURA WRITING TO COMBS IN 2009 AFTER THEY HAD BEEN DATING FOR TWO YEARS, I'M ALSO READY TO FREAK OFF. IN ANOTHER THAT SAME YEAR SHE WRITES WHEN WE USED TO FREAK OFF WHEN WE WERE SO IN LOVE THERE WERE NO QUESTIONS ASKED. IT FELT RIGHT. WHEN ASKED BY COMBS' LAWYER ABOUT A TEXT FROM 2017 WHERE SHE SAID SHE LOVED FREAK-OFFS, VENTURA SAID THEY WERE JUST WORDS AT THAT POINT. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A CHANCE THAT ONE OR MORE OF THE JURORS MIGHT HEAR THIS EVIDENCE THAT SHE CAME BACK TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO COMB, THAT SHE PARTICIPATED IN THESE FREAK-OFFS AND SOME OF THE JURORS MAY CONCLUDE THAT THIS WAS MORE OF A CHOICE THAN IT WAS COERCION. &gt;&gt; THE DEFENSE TEAM ALSO ASKING ABOUT THE COUPLE'S INFIDELITY ON BOTH SIDES, SEEMING TO PAINT THE RELATIONSHIP AS DEEPLY TROUBLED, BUT CONSENSUAL. CASSIE SAID COMBS KICKED HER IN THE BACK AFTER FINDING OUT SHE EXCEEDED ON HIM WITH RAPPER KID CUDDY AND ALSO ADMITTING SHE WAS JEALOUS OF A RELATIONSHIP COMBS WAS HAVING WITH ANOTHER WOMAN. SHE SPOKE ABOUT THE COUPLE'S DRUG USE AND COMBS OVERDOSED IN 2012. IT INFLUENCED SOME OF THE RAPPER'S MOOD SWINGS AND SPOKE ABOUT HER OWN DRUG ADDICTION. CROSS-EXAMINATION COMES TWO DAYS AFTER EMOTIONAL TESTIMONY WHEN SHE SAID COMBS SUBJECTED HER TO YEARS OF PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE. TESTIFYING THAT COMBS BLACKMAILED HER WITH RECORDINGS FROM SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS TO SILENCE HER AND KEEP HER IN THE RELATIONSHIP. COMBS SAID THE FREAK-OFFS WERE CONSENSUAL. &gt;&gt; CHLOE, THERE'S BEEN HEATED BACK AND FORTH ABOUT THE LENGTH OF THIS CROSS-EXAMINATION. DO WE EXPECT TO SEE VENTURA AGAIN? &gt;&gt; YES, LESTER. WE EXPECT FOR VENTURA TO BE BACK ON THE STAND TOMORROW AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT SHE'S GOING TO TESTIFY MORE ABOUT THE DAYS LEADING UP TO THE INCIDENT IN THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL IN 2016 WITH COMBS. THEY WERE GIVEN FIVE MORE HOURS OF EXAMINATION BECAUSE SHE COULD GO INTO THE HOSPITAL THIS WEEKEND. &gt;&gt;&gt; THE LOS ANGELES SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SAYS THEIR INVESTIGATION IS IN ITS EARLY STAGES AND IT COMES AFTER FOUR OF ROBINSON'S FORMER HOUSE KEEPERS ACCUSE HIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT IN A LAWSUIT EARLIER IN MONTH. AN ATTORNEY FOR ROBINSON DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS AND CALLED THEM AN ATTEMPT TO EXTRACT MONEY. &gt;&gt;&gt; WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT ANOTHER AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OUTAGE, THIS TIME IN DENVER. THE CRITICAL AIRPORT HUB FOR BOTH UNITED AND SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. TOM COSTELLO COVERS AVIATION FOR US. TOM, WHAT HAPPENED? &gt;&gt; THIS HAPPENED AT DENVER CENTER WHICH CONTROLS HIGH-ALTITUDE FLIGHTS IN AND AROUND DENVER INTERNATIONAL, ONE OF THE NATION'S BUSIEST AIRPORT. CONTROLLERS LOST SEVERAL RADIO CHANNELS THAT ALLOWED THEM TO COMMUNICATE WITH PILOTS. THE OUTAGE LASTED FOR 90 SECONDS AND CONTROL WAS SWITCHED TO A BACK-UP FREQUENCY, PLANES REMAINED SEPARATED THIS FOLLOWS THE OUTAGES WE SAW AT NEWARK AIRSPACE THAT CONTRIBUTED TO HOURS' LONG DELAYS THERE AND YET ANOTHER INDICATION OF HOW THE COUNTRY'S AGING AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO REPLACE OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS IS SHOWING ITS AGE. LESTER? &gt;&gt; TOM COSTELLO, THANKS. &gt;&gt; NOW TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S HIGH-STAKES TRIP TO THE MIDDLE EAST AND WHAT HE'S SAYING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF LIKE STRIKING A NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN. GARRETT HAAKE REPORTS FROM ABU DHABI. &gt;&gt; TONIGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP STRIKING AN OPTIMISTIC NOTE WITH IRAN. &gt;&gt; YOU PROBABLY READ THE STORY ABOUT IRAN, AND SORT OF AGREED TO THE TERMS. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE OUT, I CALL IT IN A FRIENDLY WAY, NUCLEAR DUST. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BEIC MAING NUCLEAR DUST IN IRAN, AND WANT THEM TO END UP BEING A GREAT COUNTRY, FRANKLY, BUT THEY CAN'T HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON. &gt;&gt; WHILE DELIVERING THIS WARNING. &gt;&gt; THERE ARE TWO STEPS, IT IS A VERY, VERY NICE STEP AND A VIOLENT STEP. I DON'T WANT TO DO THE SECOND STEP. SOME PEOPLE DO, MANY PEOPLE DO, I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT STEP. &gt;&gt; IT COMES AS THE PRESIDENT RECEIVES ANOTHER EXTRAVAGANT WELCOME ON THE FINAL STOP OF THE MIDEAST TRIP IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES. TOURING THE ICONIC GRAND MOSQUE. &gt;&gt; THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE CULTURE. &gt;&gt; AND TOUTING NOW EMIRATI IN THE U.S. &gt;&gt; PRESIDENT TRUMP ADDRESSING A RALLY-LIKE GATHERING OF TROOPS IN AN AMERICAN AIR BASE THERE. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE WITHOUT A DOUBT THE GREATEST FIGHTING FORCE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THAT'S THE WAY IT IS. &gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT CONCEDING THERE WILL LIKELY BE LITTLE PROGRESS IN UKRAINE'S CEASEFIRE TALKS UNTIL HE AND RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN CAN MEET IN PERSON. &gt;&gt; I DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING WILL HAPPEN WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT UNTIL HE AND I GET TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; TODAY IN TURKEY, PRESIDENT PUTIN SKIPPED PEACE TALKS THAT HE HAD CALLED FOR. THE KREMLIN SAID THERE IS NO TAMETABLE FOR A TRUMP MEETING. ALL OF THAT COMES JUST TWO WEEKS AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE BELIEVED PUTIN WAS READY FOR PEACE. LESTER? &gt;&gt; GARRETT HAAKE, THANK YOU. &gt;&gt;&gt; HERE AT HOME, FLORIDA BECAME THE SECOND STATE TO BAN FLOOR IDE IN PUBLIC WATER. GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS SIGNED THE BILL INTO LAW DESCRIBING IT AS FORCED MEDICATION. THE BILL DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY MENTION FLUORIDE, BUT IT EFFECTIVELY BANS IT BY PREVENTING ADDITIVES IN THE STATE'S WATER SYSTEM. &gt;&gt;&gt; WE TURN NOW TO AN NBC NEWS INVESTIGATION. ELON MUSK'S ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COMPANY XAI HAS MADE GIANT LEAPS IN THE INDUSTRY IN THE PAST YEAR THANKS TO THE SUPER COMPUTER IN MEMPHIS. WHILE IT IS KEEPING THE COMPANY COMPETITIVE GLOBALLY, MANY IN THE TENNESSEE COMMUNITY ARE PUSHING BACK. STEPHANIE GOSK REPORTS. &gt;&gt; IN MEMPHIS, ELON MUSK IS MAKING A PLAY TO CONTROL THE FUTURE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. XAI HAS BUILT THE BIGGEST SUPER COMPUTER IN THE WORLD WITH LIGHTNING SPEED. &gt;&gt; IT REPRESENTS AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY, AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE OUR ECONOMY TO THE NEXT LEVEL. &gt;&gt; XAI SAYS IT WILL CREATE THEIR 100 MILLION IN REVENUE AND HUNDREDS OF JOBS, BUT THE DIGITAL FUTURE NEEDS POWER, LOTS OF IT. THESE ARE THE GAS TURBINES FUELING THE SUPER COMPUTER THEY CALL COLOSSUS. THEY EMIT HAZARDOUS POLLUTANTS LIKE FORMALDEHYDE AND NITROGEN OXIDE ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN SEE AND HEAR THE TURBINES CHURNING, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK, 24 HOURS A DAY. WITHOUT IT THEY CANNOT FUNCTION. WHAT'S NOT IN DISPUTE IS THEY ARE POLLUTING THE AIR. WHAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS HOW MUCH OF THAT POLLUTION IS REACHING NEARBY COMMUNITIES. &gt;&gt; EASTER KNOX LIVES TWO MILES AWAY. &gt;&gt; YOU SMELLED IT. &gt;&gt; YES, LORD. &gt;&gt; RIGHT AWAY? &gt;&gt; AFTER THEY GOT SITUATED I STARTED SMELLING IT. &gt;&gt; KNOX LIVES IN BOX TOWN, A MOSTLY BLACK, LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD IN SOUTH MEMPHIS. &gt;&gt; THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT, THEY NEED TO BE A SHAMED. &gt;&gt; WHERE INDUSTRY HAS TAKEN A TOLL FOR GENERATIONS. &gt;&gt; THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE THAT HAVE MEDICAL PROBLEMS LIKE BREATHING ISSUE. &gt;&gt; CANCER IS FOUR TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. CANCER KILLED HER FATHER. LIFE EXPECTANCY IS NINE YEARS LESS THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. ELON MUSK'S COMPANY IS NOT TO BLAME FOR THOSE NUMBERS, BUT THAT LEGACY AND TURBINES HAVE TRIGGERED A BACKLASH AGAINST XAI. &gt;&gt; A RECENT HEALTH DEPARTMENT MEETING TURNED INTO A SHOUTING MATCH. &gt;&gt; AN EXECUTIVE OF XAI DUCKING OUT A SIDE DOOR. &gt;&gt; THE MAYOR SAYS THE CITY IS HOPING TO START TESTING THE AIR IN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS. &gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THAT COMMUNITY THAT FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN RAILROADED BY XAI, THAT THEY WEREN'T A PART OF THE CONVERSATION WHEN IT WAS APPROVED AND NOW THEY'RE BEARING THE BRUNT OF ITS EXISTENCE. &gt;&gt; WELL, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE DIRECT DIALOGUE. I TAKE THEIR CONCERNS DEPPLY SERIOUS. AMONG LESS CON CERTAINS, BUT THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT SAYS THAT'S OKAY FOR THE FIRST YEAR. AFTER SFAE OFFICIALS SAID TLIRP 15 THERMAL, VIDEO AND IT SHOWS THIR ACTIVE. WE HAD A CONVERSATION AND WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THESE ADDITIONAL ONES? &gt;&gt; SO THEY'RE NOT USING THOSE? &gt;&gt; NO. THEY'RE IN IDLE MODE IN CASE THEY ARE NEEDED. &gt;&gt; XAI DECLINED TO BE INTERVIEWED, BUT TELLS NBC NEWS IT IS USING POLLUTION-MINIMIZING TECHNOLOGY AND WORKING WITH PUBLIC OFFICIALS TO STOP RELYING ON THE TURBINES BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. XAI HAD ALSO PLEDGED TO BUILD A WATER TREATMENT FACILITY FOR THE CITY. &gt;&gt; ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE WORKING FOR AND CONSPIRING WITH INDUSTRY IN ORDER TO DRAW PROFITS. &gt;&gt; COMMUNITY ORGANIZER TESEAN PEARSON HAS LIVED IN SOUTH MEMPHIS MOST OF HIS LIFE. HE SAID HE'S SKEPTICAL XAI WILL CREATE HUNDREDS OF JOBS AND DOUBTS THE MAYOR'S PROMISE THAT ITS TAX DOLLARS WILL BE DIRECTED TO IMPROVE THESE NEIGHBORHOODS. &gt;&gt; WE DO NOT WANT MONEY IN EXCHANGE FOR OUR LUNGS OR EXCHANGE FOR OUR LIVES. WE WANT CLEAN AIR, CLEAN WATER, CLEAN SOIL JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. &gt;&gt; XAI IS ALREADY BUILDING A SECOND SUPER COMPUTER NEARBY, EVEN BIGGER THAT WILL NEED VEN MORE POWER RAISING MORE QUESTIONS AND MORE ANGER AMONG RESIDENT, LESTER. &gt;&gt; STEPHANIE, THANK YOU. &gt;&gt;&gt; IN 60 SECONDS COSTS ARE GOING UP IN THE &gt;&gt; THE &gt;&gt;&gt; THE NATION'S LARGEST RETAILER ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT IT WILL RAISE PRICES IN THE COMING WEEKS AS THE FALLOUT FROM THE PRESIDENT'S ONGOING TRADE WAR CONTINUES. CHRISTINE ROMANS REPORTS. &gt;&gt;&gt; IT'S A BRAND BUILT ON EVERYDAY LOW PRICES, BUT WALMART SAYS SOME OF THOSE PRICES ARE ABOUT TO RISE. THE PRESIDENT'S TRADE WAR HITTING THE NATION'S LARGEST RETAILER. &gt;&gt; THE LEVEL OF TARIFFS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSE SIDE PRETTY CHALLENGING AND CERTAINLY OUR CONCERN IS THAT CONSUMERS WILL FEEL SOME OF THAT. &gt;&gt; FEELING THAT, WALMART SAYS IN A MATTER OF WEEKS. SOME PRICES ARE ALREADY HIGHER. WALMART RAISED PRICES ON BANANAS, ONE OF THE MORE FREQUENTLY PURCHASED ITEMS FROM 50 CENTS A POUND TO 54 CENTS A POUND. SHIFTING TRADE POLICIES. &gt;&gt; WE REACHED A BREAKTHROUGH AGREEMENT WITH CHINA. &gt;&gt; DAYS AGO, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND CHINA STRUCK A DEAL, BOTH SIDES AGREEING TO DRAMATICALLY LOWER TARIFFS FOR 90 DAYS AND THE GOODS COMING INTO THE U.S. IS STILL 30%. WALMART SAYS THAT'S NOT LOW ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; WE ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE PROGRESS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE TO GET THEM DOWN TO THIS LEVEL, BUT I WILL SAY IT IS STILL TOO HIGH FOR CONSUMERS AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE THEM COME DOWN MORE. &gt;&gt; WALMART NOT ALONE, AND BLACK &amp; DECKER, HASBRO, PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE AND BLACK SAYING THEY'LL PRICES TOO. &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE POINT THAT THERE COULD BE SKIMPY STORE SHELVES AT SOME POINT? &gt;&gt; MAY IS TYPICALLY THE MONTH WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE PURCHASE ORDERS COME IN FOR THE YEAR-END CHRISTMAS AND HOLIDAY SEASON GOODS. IF WE DON'T GET THOSE IN NOW AT THE RIGHT PRICE POINTS, WE MAY SEE FEWER ITEMS TO SELECT FROM, PROBABLY AT HIGHER PRICES. &gt;&gt; FOR COMPANIES BIG AND SMALL, HIGHER PRICES AT THE PORTS COULD SHOW UP IN THE PRICE YOU PAY SOON. CHRISTINE ROMANS, NBC NEWS, NEW YORK. &gt;&gt; WE'RE BACK IN JUST A MOMENT WITH GOOD NEWS FROM THE MEDICAL WORLD. WHY THIS BABY COULD HELP PAVE THE WAY FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO BE TREATED WITH GENE THERAPY. PLUS ♪♪ &gt;&gt;&gt; WE'RE BACK NOW WITH THE POTENTIAL SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH.

WHO WAS BORN WITH A RARE AND DANGEROUS DISEASE. SCIENTISTS SAY THE TREATMENT COULD TREAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DOWN THE ROAD. &gt;&gt;&gt; WE ALSO HAVE BIG NEWS IN THE SPORTS WORLD. NFL TEAMS REVEALING THEIR SCHEDULES FOR THE FALL SEASON TODAY AND SOME HAD A LOT OF FUN DOING IT. THE L.A. CHARGES PUTTING OUT THIS MINECRAFT THEME VIDEO.

I WAS CRYING AND HUGGING. &gt;&gt; SLATON'S PARENTS IN GEORGIA SAY THEY HADN'T HEARD FROM HER FOR DAYS WHEN THEY REPORTED HER MISSING ON APRIL 29th. A VIDEO SURFACED SHOWING SLATON BIKING IN EARLY APRIL, BUT AFTER NO SIGHTINGS FOR WEEKS, AUTHORITIES BEGAN SCALING BACK THEIR SEARCH. THEN THE OWNER OF A REMOTE MOUNTAIN RESORT WENT TO CHECK ON HIS PROPERTY. THERE, INSIDE A CABIN, SLATON. HER INITIAL REACTION, JUST LIKE HER MOM'S. &gt;&gt; DIDN'T SAY A WORD. JUST RAN UP AND ALL SHE WANTED WAS A HUG. &gt;&gt; AND A PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICH. &gt;&gt; SHE ATE AS MUCH PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY AS SHE COULD STAND TO EAT. &gt;&gt; GUTIERREZ DURING THE WINTER INTENTIONALLY LEAVES THE DOOR OPEN IN CASE SOMEONE NEEDS A SHELTER. &gt;&gt; SHE JUST SAW A CABIN. &gt;&gt; IT'S INCREDIBLE SLATON SURVIVES. &gt;&gt; TWO DAYS, NINE DAYS, THAT'S AMAZING, BUT THREE WEEKS IS UNHEARD OF. &gt;&gt; HER ELATED PARENTS CALLING IT THE PERFECT BIRTHDAY GIFT.

A nouveaux réfugiés, des dizaines de milliers d'entre eux, souvent les plus démunis, contournent les zones tenues par le régime de Damas pour se retrouver dans un des rares territoires à peu près sûrs pour eux : le Nord-Est syrien tenu par les Kurdes. &#10;Là-bas, les 50 000 premiers réfugiés sont arrivés entre octobre et novembre. Leur situation reste pourtant périlleuse entre la misère, l’insécurité terroriste grandissante et la menace d’une nouvelle guerre entre Kurdes et Turcs.

d'habitude seul ceux qui cherchent à voir leur famille de l'autre côté ou qui veulent se faire soigner à Damas passe par ici mais depuis fin septembre ce nom sans âme n'est plus seulement un carrefour mais une porte d'entrée pour les milliers de réfugiés du dernier conflit entre Israël et les forces du hzbollah ça faisait longtemps que je vivais au Liban mais la situation là c'est devenue trop grave a 42 ans arrive du sud de beyouth elle n'est pas libanaise mais syrienne comme l'écrasante majorité des réfugiés qui arrivent ici depuis 2011 1500000 syriens ont été contraint de quitter leur pays pour trouver refuge au [Musique] Liban à l'époque j'ai quitté mon pays parce qu'il n'y avait pas de sécurité ici à cause de la guerre contre le régime de Damas bombardement récent de l'armée israélienne sur le Liban ne leuront laissé d'autre choix que de revenir en Syrie mes enfants avaient tellement peur le jour où les Israéliens ont bombardé c'était un vendredi en fin de journée on revenait du travail et tout le quartier a tremblé on était terrifié moi la première ma fille n'arrêtait pas de pleurer mon fils aussi faisit nétait pas revenu ici c'est la première fois que je rentre pourquoi ne pas vous installer dans les régions contrôlées par le régime grand Dieu non pourquoi certainement pas pas besoin de le dire la raison est évidente non a comme tant d'autres a fui la répression sanglante du régime de Bachar al-Assad aujourd'hui elle vite un deè exil par crainte d'infiltration dans le FL de réfugi les affaires des passagers sont rapidement fouillé par les autorités CDES sous l'il attentif du chauffeur pour ces gens c'est vraiment tragique il y en a qui ont abandonné leur maison leurs affaires ets perdu leur papier parce que les immeubles ont été détruit là on parle de milliers de personnesiciellement N 500 réfugiés syriens venus du Liban officieusement il serait deux fois plus et les responsabl C s'attendent à voir en arrivver bien davantage un affl massif qui fait craindreun crise humanitaire d'ampleur sur un territoire déjà très pauvre d'autant que la situation sécuritaire au Kurdistan syrien est inquiétante depuis un an l'État islamique toujours actif a doublé ici le nombre de ces attaques et cherche toujours à reconstituer ses [Musique] forces en réaction l'administration curde déploie régulièrement des milliers de soldats dans tous les villages de la région lors d'opération d'envergure comme celleci [Musique] c'est seulement des vêtements je cherche quoi c'est bon onabî rien on est juste des pauvres mains de Dieu madame c'est pour votre sécurité oui je sais quand vous c tout chez moi ça me fait pas plaisir des fouilles qui alimentent laenstion déjà for entre les militaires majoritairement C et les villageois arabes tu vas au fond et quelqu'un va au milieu etensite on traverse le CHEM [Musique] dans cette opération on cherche les combattants de DA le plan leurs armes leurs hommes et T le comp on va continuer ça pendant un moment l' c'est ENF de nettoyer notre territoire et d'éliminer totalement nosem une opétion doublement compleis du danger islamiste les milliers de nouveaux réfugiés on accueille tous les réfugiés c'est notre famille on a tout fait pour le ouvrir les portes des portes ouvertes mais des moyens [Musique] dérisoires raka l'ancienne capitale de l'État islamique ici les autorités CDE administre plus de 500000 habitants à majorité arabe madame abdouaziz est coprésidente du Bureau des Affaires sociales depuis quelques semaines elle se rend quotidiennement en ville pour aller à la rencontre des nouveaux arrivants du Liban bonjour la plupart d'entre eux vivent dans des faute de mieux c'est dans cette chambre qu'on a mis nos affaires les enfants dorment aussi là comme tu peux voir ils n'ont pas d'espace pour dorm une femme a TR enfants moi regarde comment on peut faire les personnes revenant du Liban sont considérés de la même manière que les autres habitants de raka beaucoup sont de toute façon des personnes qui ont quitté cette ville il y a plus de 10 ans et qui reviennent aujourd'hui chez eux à ce jour on a déjà accueilli environ 6000 familles dans la ville la plupart de ceux qui reviennent nont aucun moyen lorsqu'il y a autant d'arrivé comme maintenant on est vraiment dans l'incapacité de gérer tout et on peut pas contrôler tous les aspects surtout au niveau sécuritaire on le sait les gens sont ressources sont capbl de tout pour nourir leur famille ils sont facilement manipulabl et peuvent se transformer en terrorist c'est un vrai danger les groupes terroristes C particulièrement les jeunes on s'inquiète vraiment de ça mais nous esserons autant que possible d'assumer nos responsabilités [Musique] pour tenter de relever le défi humanitaire et sécuritaire les autorités du Nord-Est syrien ont construit dès 2017 une vingtaine de camps accueillant déjà 1500000 déplacés du conflit syrien l'administration kurde a décidé d'envoyer les réfugiés du Liban sans domicile dans trois d'entre eux [Musique] au camp de marmoudli à une demi-heure à l'ouest de raka 17 nouvelles familles arabes viennent de s'installer au Liban Abed était Barbier désormais il survit ici comme il peut quand nous sommes arrivés il n'avait pas prévu d'endroit spécial pour nous ils nous ont juste mis là où il pouvaiit on est rarti entre différentes sections on a seulement de PS par jour et par personne est-ce que de pains ça suffit pour une personne c'est pas suffisant pour la journée tu imagines les gens ici ils ont besoin de 4 ou C pains pour chaque repas et nous il nous en donne que de quand il a plu il y a 2 jours la plupart des gens ici ont été inondés par de l'eau glacée qui est monté jusqu'à 30 cm et qui a traversé les tentes les autres réfugiés du camp nous ont aidé et ont fait tout ce qu'il pouvait mais un mort vivant ne peut pas aider un autre mort vivant dans ce camp certaines familles s'entassent jusqu'à 10 personnes partantes je rentre pour vous voir pauvre parmi les pauvres lié par ce nouveau drame les réfugiés partagent lesépreuve de leur exil organisé par des groupes mafieux le trajet avec les passeurs m'a coûté 650 dollars il m'ont arnaqué de 100 dollars cet argent que j'ai payé à la base c'est un emprunt que j'ai fait à plusieurs de mes amis à certains membres de la famille moi je suis arrivé ici les poches vides nous la première nuit du trajet on ne savait pas où dormir résultat on a dormi dehors et seulement le lendemain matin les passeurs sont arrivés l'un deux a accepté de nous transporter plus de 1000 dollars et entre celui-ci et un autre j'ai dû rajouter 200 dollars de plus et un autre 100 dollars encore mais c'est juste de l'arnaque et de la frude il profite de nous un moment on a même dormi sous la pluie avec mes enfants sans rien manger sans toilett un mois comme ça ici j'espère surtout qu'on va trouver du travail dans ce genre d'endroit on ne doit compter que sur nous-même au Liban on était actif travaillit nous n'étions pas dépendants des aides humanitaires au Liban chaque famille syrienne en plus de leur salaire percevait malgré tout une aide mensuelle de l'U de 100 à 150 dollars à Marmoud rien de tout cela une situation très préoccupante pour Abed perd de TR enfants nous sommes très attentifs au questions d'éducation enants étudier c'est le plus important pour la prochaine génération pour qu'on construise enfin une société éduquée [Musique] [Musique] égalit bénéficie d'aucune aide financière les autorités curdes des camp s'efforcent d'offrir à leurs enfants un enseignement de base grâce au soutien de diverses ONG local et [Musique] [Applaudissements] [Musique] international etci vous collez les lettres ensemble ou vous les séparer est-ce qu'on peut les coller avec le B non lle pour nous

important c'est leur apprendre comment lire et écrire et le calcul mental on se focalise sur elle en lui donnant le plus d'enseignement possible et des cours supplémentaires pour compenser son retard on l'a placé dans le niveau correspondant pas moins pas plus une intégration qui reste difficile cont a la guerre de plein fouet il y avait beaucoup de bombardement notre maison s'est fait bombarder 10 minutes après qu'on soit sorti de chez [Musique] nous quand Laquette a frappé j'étais terrifié c'est vraiment effrayant le bruit de l'avion la guerre c'est horrible le trajet aussi était difficile dès qu'on est monté dans la voiture il y a eu des bombardements toutes les minutes à peine on a démarré que la maison à côté a été visée après nous sommes venus jusqu'ici et on a laissé derrière nous

en Syrie a déplacé un demi millions d'enfants dans le nord-est du pays aujourd'hui les autorités CDES n'arrivent à en scolariser dans les camps que 10000 pour beaucoup de jeunes syriens ayant fui le Liban les bans de l'école dans leur propre pays resteront un rêve [Musique] kamichli à 300 km au nord du camp de [Musique] [Musique] Marmoud les plantes sont bien entretenues ici une semaine après son arrivée nous retrouvons a et ses enfants chez sa sœur ça aurait été mieux si tu étais venu t'installer chez moi à beyouth quand j'y étais et si tu étais venu j'aurais convaincu maman de venir aussi sielle était venue avec toi ça aa été génial j'ai passé 12 ans loin d'elle elle m'a tellement manqué elle n'avait pas vu mes enfants jusqu'à présent parce qu'ils sont nés au Liban oui c'est vrai on n pas pu voir ces deux enfants elle n'a pas vu grandir ma fille Rania qui a 11 ans maintenant si les bombardements israéliens au Liban sont loin désormais malgré le calme apparent une autre menace inquiète à seulement quelques centaines de mètres d'ici là-bas c'est la Turquie entre ici et là il y a une frontière et des militaires personne ne peut s'en approcher car il tire immédiatement depuis 2019 la Turquie mène régulièrement des attaques dans le nord-est syrien contre les indépendantistes CDES du PKK à ce jour ces opérations militaires ont fait plusieurs centaines de morts dont de nombreux civils quand le bruit des bombardementson nous paralyse si quelqu'un ose sortir il sera ciblé et tué sur le champ à qui peut-on se confier si ce n'est à Dieu on cherche avant tout à améliorer notre condition sociale et financière pour nos enfants pour pouvoir enfin vivre sans cette peur il faut qu'on puisse dormir tranquille sans avoir l'angoisse au ventre cela fait maintenant 6 jours que je suis arrivée et je n'ai pas fermé l'œil une seule nuit je suis épuisée et c'est de pire en pire ça se voit quoi que je fasse je sais que je devrais toujours essayer d'oublier ces horreurs il n'y a ni tranquillité ni sécurité dans cette existence toi tu as peur oui j'ai tellement peur de la guerre pourquoi parce qu'ils vont tous nous [Applaudissements] tuer l'après-midi RIIA se rent au cimetière avec ses enfants pour rendre hommage aux membres de sa famille mort au début de la guerre civile syrienne toute cette jeunesse quelle horreur que Dieu vous rende justice voici Beran toi aussi tu es parti Beran que Dieu te garde [Musique] celle-là et celle-là sont les enfants de ma sœur ce sont mes nièes celle-là avait 8 ans et celle-ci 17 ans celle-ci a grandi parmi nous c'était Berivan elles

          <attvalue for="7" value="sono molto felice di essere con voi sono commossa sono la prima donna palestinese che parla pubblicamente a una piazza una piazza piena di affetto di amore di solidarietà tutti i genocidi iniziano con le parole parole che negono l'umanità di un popolo parole che criminalizzano le vittime trasformandole in una minaccia esistenziale contro cui tutto permesso le parole sono fondamentali perché giustificano crimini e determino azioni sono fondamentali anche per resistere io credo che le cose vanno chiamate col loro giusto nome altrimenti non le vediamo è importantissimo definire quello che sta accadendo a Gazza è un genocidio perché è l'unico modo per fermarlo termini come crisi umanitaria crimini di guerra sono un inganno e non bastano per far scattare imperativi morali legali per fermare il genocidio imperativi che costringono la comunità internazionale a a mobilizzarsi per fermare lo sterminio in corso lo sterminio del mio popolo qualificarlo come genocidio fa scattare la dottrina e la responsabilità di proteggere proteggere i civili abbiamo necessità di applicare tutti gli strumenti a nostra disposizione la nostra responsabilità in questo momento non è proteggere l'establishment i propagandisti e i lobbisti dalle verità scomode e il nostro dovere morale in questo momento uno solo salvare vite umane e abbiamo a disposizione uno strumento straordinario la convenzione sul genocidio ratificata da 153 paesi che impone a tutti gli Stati compreso l'Italia l'obbligo di prevenire atti genocidari di fare il possibile per fermare il governo criminale israeliano che richiede imporre sanzioni un imbargo totale di armi non solo quelle che vengono esportati ma quelle che vengono importati e sto parlando chiaramente delle tecnologie di sorveglianze Paragon quelle che questo governo usa per spiare giornalisti giuristi e organizzazioni umanitarie ci sono tre ordini tre ordinanze dalla Corte di Giustizia Internazionale che hanno riconosciuto il rischio plausibile di un genocidio in Palestina c'è anche la la sentenza di condanna contro Israele per l'occupazione militare e per la colonizzazione che dovrebbe far scattare per tutti l'obbligo di prevenzione e punizione per i mandanti i loro complici ma sono 20 mesi che il popolo palestinese documenta il proprio antintamento il proprio sterminio nella speranza che la comunità internazionale agisca e applichi il diritto internazionale ma fino a ora ha raccolto soltanto silenzi omertà complicità e indifferenza totale israele è l'unica potenza nucleare Medio Oriente che sta usando tecnologie avanzate militari con bombe da due o 5 tonnellate contro i civili e contro i bambini affamati bambini che vivono nelle tende sotto le macerie nei campi profughi negli ospedali tutto questo inaccettabile nessuna nazione che si divisce democratica può annientare intere famiglie bombardare campi e profughi sparare sulla falla affamata in cerca di un pezzo di pane a G sono stati distrutti ospedali scuole università panetterie 90% degli acquidotti e delle infrastrutture civili tutto quello che sostiene la vita è stato distrutto dall'esercito senza pietà e se il governo israeliano non vuole essere accusato di commettere crimini di guerra o genocidio ha di fronte una soluzione molto semplice di smettere di bombardare i civili i bambini e aggiungerei potrebbe anche fare processare i criminali di guerra quelle che invocano l'uso della fame le malattie per sterminare la popolazione ciò che avviene oggi in Palestina un'anticipazione del destino della nostra umanità e il paradigma del futuro che aspetta a tutti i popoli iniziando col sud globale un futuro barbarico dominato dalla legge della giungla senza diritto internazionale dove non c'è distinzione tra un terrorista e un bambino siamo di fronte siamo di fronte a un bivio e abbiamo due scelte molto chiare: coesistenza dignità e libertà per tutti e l'altra scelta quello che ha scelto questo governo criminale israeliano è la colonizzazione che significa guerre infinite stermini e polizia etnico io sogno un mondo dove i genitori palestinesi non sono costretti a scrivere sulle braccia e le gambe dei loro figli i loro nomi per poterli identificare quando vengono fatti a pezzi massacrati dalle bombe bombe che sono anche made in Italy un mondo dove i giornalisti i giuristi intellettuali i medici vengono celebrati non giustiziati per il semplice crimine di aver di essere testimoni scomodi di un massacro coloniale israele ha ucciso 230 giornalisti palestinesi e ha ucciso anche 500 medici e ha preso 160 medici palestinesi come ostaggi in questo momento vengono tortati nelle carceri israeliane tra di loro il dottor Hus Abu Safia che da 160 giorni non sappiamo che fine ha fatto a Gazz muore l'umanità muore la civiltà occidentale stiamo anche assistendo alla gazzificazione dell'ordine globale con un primo ministro israeliano che ieri c'è un video si vanta a mette pubblicamente che Israele sta armando l'ISIS a Gazza parlano di combattere l'estremismo ma stanno invece armando i terroristi dell'ISES a Gazza che vengono pagati per saccheggiare aiuti umanitari intanto negli Stati Uniti stanno sanzionando tutti i giudici della Corte Penale Internazionale fammi ripetere questo stanno non sanzionando Criminale di guerra ma i giudici della Corte Pinale Internazionale lo stesso tribunale attaccato da questo nostro governo che usa voli di stato per fare per trasportare un criminale di guerra libico un stupratore e continua a fornire armi al governo israeliano nella mia terra che è la terra di profeti di poeti noi siamo 7 milioni di israeliani e 7 milioni di palestinesi ma vorrei dire che in questo momento che sia chiaro noi tutti tutti i popoli che vivono tra il Mediterraneo e il Giordano nessuno di noi sarà sicuro e nessuno di noi sarà libero finché non saremo tutti sicuri e tutti liberi" />

This recently completed 3. 5-million-square-foot building is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's first Arizona chip fabrication plant– or fab- making history not only for its enormous size- but because it's by far the most advanced chip fab on U.S. soil. So pilot production has started in this building when we are here. Three years ago, it was steel beams and dirt. What kind of investment has it taken to get to this point? About $20 billion. When we first visited, TSMC was far from a household name. But the chip shortage and AI boom has thrust it into the spotlight. TSMC manufactures some 92% of the world's most advanced chips, in everything from Nvidia GPUs to Apple iPhones. And now, for the first time in history, TSMC is starting to make those advanced chips here in the U.S. customers like Apple are starting to make their chips here, with two more fabs planned by the end of the decade. The facility over here is our fab 2. You can see the steel has been completed. But bringing advanced chip manufacturing to the U.S. has proven difficult. Volume production, is supposed to begin this year, is delayed until 2025. The Commerce Department recently hit TSMC with new shipping bans after its chips ended up in Huawei devices, despite export controls. And incoming President Donald Trump stirred up fears when he expressed opposition to the CHIPS Act during his campaign. TSMC is getting $6.6 billion from the bill. The CHIPS Act was bipartisan and it had huge Republican support when it passed. Right now, we buy every single AI chip from one company in Taiwan. That makes America less safe, and so repealing the CHIPS Act would make Americans less safe, I just don't think they'll do that. CNBC visited northern Phoenix for an exclusive first look at TSMC's first completed fab – and asked its top executives exactly what's in store for U.S. manufacturing - under an incoming Trump administration, and ever-mounting need for advanced chips. Inside the huge new fab just completed in Arizona, there's enough concrete to make ten Empire State Buildings; over 15-million-feet of cable and wire that could stretch from New York City to Los Angeles; and steel that weighs as much as 970 Boeing Triple Sevens. Now, pilot production is officially underway. Running actual product through to make sure that the entire line works end to end. And then you use those wafers to sample the customer so that they can decide if we've met their standards. Now chairman of TSMC Arizona, Rick Cassidy has been with the company 27 years. And how close are we to full production in this building? Very close, very close. But according to TSMC's initial timeline, full production should already be happening. Getting the right talent and of course, doing so during a pandemic when there were shortages, you couldn't build a house, let alone build a chip foundry. It gives you some idea for like what is required to build like massive scale in this industry. Like, it's not a game for sissies. Like it's hard and it's expensive. When we came to the U.S., we knew we were going to go through a learning process. And I want to tell you, no surprise, we had a lot of learning that we went, whether it was permitting, learning how to work with the trades, learning how to work with the unions, local labor laws, lots of learnings that went on. Now we've overcome those. But maybe the biggest challenge that we had was MEP– mechanical, electrical and plumbing. The fab is filled with billions of dollars of machinery operating at the very edge of what scientifically possible – like these bus-sized EUV machines made by a single company, ASML - the only machines in the world able to perform the extreme ultraviolet lithography necessary for etching minuscule designs on the most advanced chips. So these are quarter-billion dollar tools. In order to hook one up requires something over 2,000 electrical connections, over two kilometers of cabling, 100,000 parts, 40,000 bolts. We're talking about massive. So learning how to overcome that challenge was something that was good for TSMC. Good for the trades, good for Phoenix, good for the U.S. And yes, we're dang near back on the original schedule. So far, TSMC has 2,000 people working around the clock to run the operation. Cassidy showed us the &quot;gowning&quot; building, where workers suit up in ultra-sterile &quot;bunny suits&quot; before crossing a skybridge into the new fab. Dust particles are the bane of wafer fabrication. If it lands on a wafer, it'll kill a die. And what kind of yield are you anticipating to get out of fab 1? You know, yields vary, but we intend to be right on par with our Taiwan compatriots. The yield - what percentage of chips coming out of the fab are usable – depends on that sterile environment and precision of the machines. But even with great yields, the biggest volume of chips will still come out of Taiwan for years to come. So the U.S. is far from self-reliant. It's difficult or impossible for the U.S. or any country to be fully self-sufficient in everything that they need to build semiconductors. I think that's a pipe dream. And although the first fab was originally slated to make 5-nanometer – it's now on track to pump out even more advanced 4-nanometer chips at a rate of at least 20,000 wafers per month. Wafers that cost upwards of $18,000 and continue to rise in price, taking TSMC's stock value with it. Over the past couple of years. We've seen TSMC been able to kind of name its price, and everyone's going to pay it because right now it's the dependability and the quality that is needed. Despite being the birthplace of microchips in the 1950s – and remaining a top chip design hub - the U.S. now manufactures only 10% of the world's chips – and none of the most advanced ones. When supply chain chaos collided with booming demand for consumer electronics during the pandemic, the resulting chip shortage exposed the big risks of relying on outsiders for such critical technology. How important is it for supply to come from elsewhere than just Taiwan? I think the pandemic is probably a good example that highlighted supply chain diversification requirements, and customers want us in the U.S., they want us in Japan, they want us in Europe. Talks with TSMC about bringing advanced production to the U.S. actually began in 2018, under President Trump's first term, and his then commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross. Well, it began with select USA, which is an annual event that the Commerce Department puts on to encourage U.S. investment by foreign companies. TSMC came to that session. TSMC has actually been manufacturing in the U.S. since 1998, at an older generation chip fab in Washington state, where Cassidy says TSMC is currently investing to upgrade and expand. But Ross says some major customers wanted advanced chips made on U.S. soil. I set up a phone call between the chairman of TSMC and the head of Apple, where Apple would became very strongly supportive of the idea of TSMC coming. By 2020, TSMC announced its Arizona plans, then broke ground there in April 2021. And now you've got, you know, atrium and building, and you'll be seeing all of the fab in the back. 26-year company veteran Rose Castanares is the newly appointed president of TSMC Arizona. It was one of my customers that had first requested that TSMC build a fab in the United States. They wanted supply resilience. The world's massive reliance on TSMC's fabs in Taiwan has made the global chip supply vulnerable to risks of the region. We can't be sure that we can make enough chips here in the U.S. in the event of, say, some sort of aggression between China and Taiwan, some sort of even earthquakes and events that take down that particular island for a period of time, the entire market, the entire world, could suffer from lack of availability of leading edge nodes. A deadly 7.4 magnitude earthquake in April briefly halted production and led to a $92 million loss for TSMC. We're used to earthquakes. We are well prepared for earthquakes. We build for earthquakes. We've overbuilt this structure because we use the same designs as in Taiwan. Relying on chips from Asia has also kept the U.S. from full control over its position in the constant race for technological dominance. Being the global technology leader in AI is the most important thing to preserve over the next two decades for economic prosperity. That's why President Biden has hit the chip industry, with export controls meant to keep China from pulling ahead with advanced tech. But in October, TSMC alerted the U.S. that some of its chips were spotted in Huawei devices, despite bans on selling to the Chinese company. This problem is as old as time. There's a lot of complex rerouting of goods to different countries that have limited access to Leading edge or the most advanced technology. But of course, TSMC, a big, successful company, is supposed to be a good partner to the U.S. It is seen as extra problematic that that happened. And of course that's going to be monitored very carefully. We stopped shipment right on schedule. We're very law abiding. Just down the road in Chandler, Arizona, another chip giant-Intel-is also building two huge new fabs. The U.S. company's business model is far different - designing and manufacturing its own chips, while TSMC is what's known as a pure play foundry, only manufacturing chips for others. Cassidy says the relationship between the two is solid. We meet with them weekly and the feedback is, is we're helping them increase their ranks. We're helping them train on the most advanced stuff. So I think they're pretty happy with what we're doing. Both companies have delayed the timelines for full production at their new Arizona fabs. But where TSMC has remained the uncontested leader in advanced chips, Intel has stumbled time and again. They're in a tough spot, you know? And I don't want to see Intel go under like we need Intel. Intel is the largest recipient of funds from the $52 billion CHIPS act, signed by President Biden in 2022, meant to offset the incredible cost of building a fab to make chips in the U.S. TSMC has said the cost of U.S. construction could be at least four times what it would cost in Taiwan. Once complete, TSMC estimates all three fabs will cost $65 billion. If you take a look at the State Farm Glendale Stadium, that was roughly about $500 million. That $65 billion that we're committed to do on this site for three fabs means 130 Glendale stadiums, and that's a huge number. In November – after some complaints over delays - the Commerce Department finalized $7.9 billion for Intel, and days before, $6.6 billion for TSMC. So their deal is done completed. They're expanding hugely in Arizona. It's incredibly exciting. The race to complete the CHIPS Act deals has sped up in the weeks since the election. Trump criticized the CHIPS act as &quot;so bad&quot; in October, suggesting tariffs could be the answer instead. If there are tariffs, that will affect our customers, consumers and the broader economy, and we're at the foundational part of that economy where we are building chips that power data centers and computers and phones. So in that respect, everyone will be affected as well as TSMC. While federal funds start getting doled out to TSMC, Intel - and other recipients like Samsung, Micron, GlobalFoundries and Texas Instruments. They'll also be competing for another scarce resource in the U.S. chip industry: workers. When we finished the construction of this fab, it was really the first advanced manufacturing fab that had been built in the United States for at least ten years. And semiconductors is a very, very tough technology. You have to build upon what you learned in the previous node. And so once you stop with one particular node, you don't have the learnings to continue. The experience is just not here in the United States. So TSMC sent some 600 engineers to train in Taiwan – like Jeff Patz, who left in 2021 for an 18- month stint there. At the time, there was no facility in Arizona, and the purpose was to go and actually make things right? And learn how they're made. So you have to have a kitchen to cook, like to physically touch the $200 million piece of equipment. Like you can't do that anywhere other than at the Fab in Taiwan. Now, Patz has had the chance to see the EUV machines inside the new fab in Arizona too. I went in once very recently, and I think the 3 to 6 month gap of when I was on the construction team to where we are now, I think was astounding. It's like, oh, it looks like it did in Taiwan. TSMC plans to hire at least 6,000 workers by the time all three fabs are complete at the end of the decade. For engineers, we are actively recruiting at universities in Arizona and all across the U.S. ASU even has what they call a TSMC day. TSMC has also brought experts over from Taiwan on 3-year temporary assignments. Getting to meet like 20-30 year old industry veterans that brought us down from micron scale to nanometer scale, and get to have conversations with them about how we were going to do that in the U.S. We've brought that to Arizona. The biggest culture difference is Hawaiian Shirt Fridays, so we don't have that in Taiwan. Arizona, we have. Water scarcity, meanwhile, is something Taiwan. and Arizona have shared. A recent drought in Taiwan means TSMC is no stranger to recycling the massive amount of water it needs to make chips. TSMC says it will take 4.7 million gallons of water daily to run the first Arizona fab, but it will bring that demand down to 1 million gallons a day by recycling some 65% of that. We are working on an air WC in industrial reclamation water center. When we get that in place, we will have near zero discharge to waste, which means basically the only water we'll lose is through evaporation. Another concern: the massive amount of power it takes to make chips. TSMC did build solar on site –but it's not nearly enough to cover the 2.85 gigawatt-hours per day needed by the first fab –equivalent to the power used by roughly 100,000 U.S. homes. TSMC says it's purchasing renewable energy credits to offset all that. Still, amid the AI-fueled data center boom. Arizona's largest utility warned it could run out of transmission capacity before the end of the decade. That's also when TSMC plans to start production at its third Arizona fab. Fab 3, which you can't see, but it's down this way. It's probably going to be 2 nanometer and more advanced. The most advanced in the world? Most advanced in the world. Its global ambitions also reach far beyond Arizona. TSMC opened its first fab in Japan in February, broke ground on an $11 billion fab in Germany in August, and has been in talks about building in the United Arab Emirates – although nothing is concrete as TSMC navigates export controls on its chips into China, a UAE trading partner. Within the U.S., TSMC's plans are likely to grow too. What about other fabs in the future? There's space, right? Well, there's space for more. I don't want to speculate on what the future might bring, but we've got 1,100 acres here plus, so there's room for lots of fabs." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Getting to Egypt, by the way, was the most hassle I've ever had on a reporting trip. It was the fact that when I arrived in Egypt, absolutely no one wanted to talk to me. By going to the Suez Canal, I visited the Suez Canal control tower and seeing for myself how things worked. It was only by going to the litigation in the court, in Ismailia, and hearing the lawyers talk about the problems on the bridge, that we learned all this new information. A giant container ship is blocking the Suez Canal. One of the world's busiest waterways, the route is vital for the movement of everything from oil to consumer goods. Initially people blamed strong winds, but you know, it was never a very satisfactory explanation, simply because strong winds in that part of the world happened for about half the year. Bad weather may not be the main reason why the ship got stuck. It could have been a technical or a human error. That will be revealed through the investigation. According to evidence that was presented in an Egyptian court, the pilots at one point were arguing, shouting at each other, trading insults. So if this lasts for anything more than a day, it could cause major headaches for global shipping and energy markets. Why did this situation even occur in the first place? This ship is so huge. It's as long as the Empire State Building is tall. And it is blocking the entire width of the Suez Canal since it ran aground on Tuesday. I think most of us aren't aware of just how much global trade hangs by a thread. Hi, my name's Kit and I'm a reporter for Bloomberg. I thought it was critical to actually go to Egypt to report this story. I visited the Suez Canal Authority, I spoke to the chief pilots. I attended a couple of the court hearings and saw the ship owners lawyers make the argument for the first time that there had been some fault in the hands of the Suez Canal pilots. I'm Matthew Campbell. I am a reporter and editor for Bloomberg Businessweek. So modern ships of all sizes really, have something called a voyage data recorder on the bridge. The idea is to capture audio of everything that goes on. So in the case of the Ever Given, as in so many marine accidents, the evidence from the VDR became really critical to determining what actually occurred. The urgent effort to dislodge a cargo ship stuck in the Suez Canal, blocking a key global trading route. This is a traffic jam like no other. There was this rippling cascade of disruption to global trade, and therefore lots and lots of people who might argue that they lost money as a result of what occurred on board the Ever Given in late March. Then, the happenings on the bridge, what was recorded by the VDR, becomes a matter of incredible sensitivity because it is just crucial evidence. Ships have, with some exceptions, just gotten bigger and bigger over the last 30 or 40 years. The Ever Given, if you include the value of the ship, the value of the fuel on board, and the 17,000 odd containers it was carrying, it comes to about a billion dollars. This is one of the largest objects that humans have ever put on the ocean. There was a crew of 25 led by a captain named Krishnan Kanthavel, a very experienced mariner from Tamil Nadu. It had set sail from Asia, and was due to arrive in Rotterdam a couple of weeks later. In the Suez Canal, you typically transit early in the morning. So the Ever Given would've been emerging from the Red Sea, coming into the Suez Canal. There were terrible winds at that point, a whipping sand, a really severe storm. And enough wind, in fact, that some vessels decided that they did not want to proceed through the canal on that day. The captain of the Ever Given, Captain Kanthavel, would have had a choice about whether to proceed. It is always the final decision of the captain. But there are huge financial pressures on a captain in this situation. The shipping industry is a just in time business. A captain of his experience would be keenly aware that there were huge amounts of money riding on getting his cargo to Europe on time. If you look at the Suez Canal from a satellite, it looks like a fairly straight shot through the desert, with a couple of lakes on the way. And you would imagine, I imagined, that it wouldn't be particularly difficult to steer a ship straight through the passage. But actually, it's a very stressful thing to do, we're told by all all the sailors and captains that we spoke to. It's a very narrow gap in places, 200 meters or so wide, and quite shallow. So any mistake is liable to cause an incident of some kind. So when big ships come into narrow waterways, typically they will take on board at least one pilot. And a pilot is someone who really intimately knows a particular area and can advise the captain and the helmsmen of a ship who may not be familiar with that waterway on what to avoid, dangerous currents, submerged hazards, that kind of thing. They don't actually steer the ship, but they give instructions as to the best way to get through. They have to communicate with the captain and the other crew on the bridge of the Ever Given, which is a difficult conversation to have because the captain and the crew are mostly using English. The Egyptian pilots would mostly have been speaking in Arabic. So it would have been quite difficult for them to have a proper conversation. We were told by almost everyone we interviewed that the dynamic between the captain and the crew, and the local Egyptian officials, can be a tense one when they're going through Suez. And there's a few reasons for that. The captain is the master of his ship. In normal circumstances he has complete control over the crew. He's the boss. But when you go through Suez, you have to surrender some of that control to the local pilots whose job it is to steer the vessel through the canal. When you do speak to people in the shipping industry, you will quickly learn that Suez pilots have a pretty mixed reputation. We had lots of reports of pilots asking for cigarettes, for example, asking for other gifts in return for their cooperation in getting through the canal. And all of these things add up to make it quite a fraught situation. So the Ever Given comes into the canal in these very windy conditions, and you have to think about the scale here. This is a vessel that is 400 meters long. It's also, at the top of its containers, more than 50 meters above the waterline. So it really is an enormous surface for the wind to smack against. And what appears to have happened is the Ever Given began to act as a sort of sail and was swerving back and forth in the canal. And we know from some of the evidence that's come out in legal proceedings, that there was an argument on the bridge between the two Egyptian pilots. They were arguing about speed, the weather. And we know that when the captain tried to get in the middle of the argument and calm things down, one of the Egyptian pilots threatened to leave the ship, leave his post. At some point, as the vessel was swerving back and forth, one of the pilots, according to what we know from the voyage data recorder, gave the order to go full ahead. And that would have taken the Ever Given's speed to about 13 knots. And speeding up is supposed to give you more control. It gives you more purchase on the rudder when you're trying to steer one of these enormous ships. And in normal circumstances, that would be a good way to regain control. But, the situation at that moment, it was the worst thing they could've done because the ship is in such a narrow channel that increasing the speed actually, conversely, can make it much harder to control because of something called Bernoulli's Principle. And the basic idea is that as water rushes faster, or any fluid rushes faster, the pressure decreases. And because there's less pressure, the vessel is sucked toward one bank or the other. That then became a problem as the captain, and the helm, and the bridge crew, fought to keep control of the vessel. There were, according to what we know from the voyage data recorder, orders given in rapid succession from the pilots to go hard to port or hard to starboard. So eventually one of these turns went past the point where it could be recovered, and the bow of the Ever Given lodged right into the sand. The ship just slows down, and then suddenly you realize you've crashed. So the Ever Given was stuck in one of the southern reaches of the canal, quite close to the southern entrance. Now, the Suez has been expanded over the years. Most recently in 2015. Critically, those expansions have been aimed at allowing two-way traffic, for the most part. Because, originally, the canal was only wide enough for vessels to go in one direction at once. However, where the Ever Given was stuck was a one-way section, there was no bypass around it. Somehow when they crashed, they managed to not only wedge the front into the deserts, but the back of the ship also grounded as well. So the ship was left diagonally wedged, completely blocking the channel. By the end of the first day, there would've been a hundred or so vessels anchored waiting to transit. And that number grew steadily hour by hour. Every day, goods worth $10 billion were arriving at the canal waiting to go through. Look around you in any room you happen to be in right now, the vast majority of the objects in that room will have come to you on boats. And if you live in Western Europe, if you live in North America, it is very likely that those boats pass through the Suez Canal. So every company that deals with physical stuff depends on this waterway in one fashion or another. So having it blocked is just a titanically important problem. And one that there were billions of dollars riding on resolving quickly. The 400-meter long cargo ship, the Ever Given, is stuck in the Suez Canal. And it is fouling up global trade. 50 ships a day normally pass through the canal, carrying 12% of the world's trade. So the pressure is really on to get her refloated. The ship crashed at such speed that the front went six or seven meters directly into quite rocky sand. Two tug boats arrived very quickly. They were just routine tug boats, they weren't especially large or powerful. But they immediately made efforts to pull the ship free. And it didn't move an inch. It was clear it was firmly stuck. The main entity with responsibility for clearing the canal and freeing the ship is the Suez Canal Authority, which is the Egyptian government entity that controls the canal. And the man in charge of the pilots at least is the chief pilot, Captain El-Sayed. And he was one of the first on the scene. And he, with his boss, chairman Rabie, put together a plan to try and get the ship free. Initially they realized that that simply pulling probably wasn't going to be enough. They would have to dig as well. The front of the ship was wedged so deep in the bank that they would need to do some digging. One of the earliest photos we have is of a small yellow excavator, right up against the front of the ship, just scooping out scoop after scoop of sand. And you know, it looks ridiculous next to the size of the vessel, it looks hopeless. This somewhat anonymous Egyptian guy became a global internet celebrity when photos of this went viral. Just a kind of metaphor for being stuck in a hopeless task. The vessel's owners quite quickly hired a Dutch firm called Smit, who are one of the most prominent salvage firms in the world. So a team of experts from Smit flew in, from the Netherlands and elsewhere, and see if there was a way that they could help get this ship off. Salvage teams are awarded a percentage of whatever they save, generally. There are different ways to pay them, but that's the traditional fashion. Now, if you're a salvage crew and you save a big, fully-loaded oil tanker, for example, from sinking, you could be in line for tens of millions of dollars. So the team from Smit arrived on the morning of March 25th. So that's about two days after the grounding. The view of these salvage experts from Smit was that preparations needed to be made immediately to begin bringing containers off, hiring a crane, coming up with a plan to offload these big, very heavy boxes, in order to lighten the vessel. Now, there were some people at the Suez Canal Authority, is our understanding, who were more reluctant to consider that option. I think they worked out it was gonna take months to completely offload the containers from the Ever Given. So they were facing a much longer delay, and a much longer blockage, if they had to try and take the containers off. So the compromise that was arrived at was towing would proceed until the time that a crane arrived. And then, if at that point, the vessel was still stuck, they would begin unloading it. In a situation where every day the canal is closed costs the world economy billions of dollars, no one felt they had time to wait. On the 28th of March, that was a Sunday, you had two very powerful tugs turn up from the south. Combined had something like 200 or 300 tons of pulling power. The tide is, of course, very important. You want more water, that means more buoyancy, more ability to lift the ship clear of whatever it's stuck on. There was actually, at the end of March, a supermoon, a time when the moon is unusually close to Earth. Tidal peaks are higher. So if you happen to be trying to get a 400 meter container ship off of a sandy bank, that's potentially quite important because you have more water to work with. So everyone knew that March 28th to March 29th was the best opportunity for weeks that the salvers were going to have to pull the Ever Given clear. There was no sudden movement or noise. They just suddenly realized their tugs, instead of treading water, were moving, and they were moving because the back had very slowly started to move away from the bank. So the rear was freed first, but the front was still wedged. One of the worries was that when the bow did finally come free, it would swing clear across the canal. First of all, potentially doing terrible damage to anyone who was in the way, which included lots of vessels from the Suez Canal Authority, and potentially also swinging right into the opposite bank, grounding itself again. So during the towing operations, the crew of the Ever Given had helped set up cables from the bow of their vessel to shore, four in total, so that when the bow did finally come clear, it could be held from swinging right across the canal. Smit came up with an idea to take on ballast water into the ballast tanks of the rear of the Ever Given. The back is pushed down and the front is lifted ever so slightly. That slight lift of the front turned out to be just enough to help them lift out of the sand. So when the tide changed, and the waters were flowing out, and the two powerful tugs were pulling in the same direction, that was when the front finally came clear. And when that happened, everything happened quite quickly. There was jubilation, as you can imagine. They all sounded their horns at the same time, it could be heard from miles away. One of the Egyptian dredges was cheering and shouting number one, number one. So once the Ever Given was free, it was towed up to the Great Bitter Lake, which is a body of water partway up the canal. And it sat there during what became a pretty tense legal standoff. You had the Suez Canal Authority, which is part of the Egyptian government, demanding compensation of more than $900 million in exchange for letting the vessel go. Now, the Egyptians claimed that part of this was a so-called salvage award, which is the percentage of value that you're entitled to when you rescue a vessel. Part was also for what amounted to reputational damages. The owners of the Ever Given, and frankly, a lot of people observing this around the world, thought that figure was absurd. The Egyptian government reduced their ask to 550 million. I think it's probably a safe bet that the settlement came in somewhat below that, but we just don't know. In any case, it is a great deal of money. One of the amazing things about shipping is that it's kind of invisible to most of us. The ships have become too big for ports in Manhattan, or in East London, so the ports have moved elsewhere. So actually, shipping has kind of receded from view. But in that time, it has become an even more important part of our lives than ever before. Everything we depend on, all the material goods, all the energy, all the oil we put in our cars, everything we shop for at a place like Ikea or Walmart, it all comes on ships. For about a week, the whole world was riveted by shipping, and also understood in some ways how fragile it is. And all it took was one wrong turn, effectively, for that to all be shut down." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="welcome to the battle for hostel Airfield the battle that decided the fate of Ukraine before we get into the battle itself let's take a look at the Russian plan using dozens of helicopters based in barus hundreds of crack paratroopers will be flown to the Airfield to seize it and its Runway once secure the runway will be used to land transport planes carrying around a thousand more soldiers from Russia itself in an operation known as an airlift a third wave of reinforcements will then arrive Overland from Belarus this combined force will advance into the capital kill or capture the Ukrainian government and from there take over the country at least that's the plan this is the blow-by-blow account of the battle that saved Ukraine from immediate collapse and the tactics that ensured Ukrainian Victory this is the battle for hostel Airfield and this is Battle Board we're now looking at a close-up map of Ukraine you can see the Belarus border and where the denpro river crosses it and how it flows down into the Ukrainian capital and this is Hosto Airfield a large air strip about 15 mil from the center as the clock ticks over to 0900 hours Putin's plan swings into action at bokov Airfield a little outside the town of Maia in bellarus around 30 Russian helicopters get airborne among them are 10 k85 to attack helicopter and a handful of older M24 attack helicopters and two waves of mi8 Transport planes with 10 helicopters in each wave on board the transports are 300 men from the 31st guards Air Assault Brigade otherwise known as the vdv Russia's Elite paratroopers and the 45th spats Brigade The kremlin's feared Special Forces the helicopter Pilots quickly navigate from maer to the denpro river and then begin to follow it South towards the Ukraine border Kev has two large air defense sites scanning the skies north of the capital for threats even though Russia's missile barrage should have destroyed these sites the helicopter Pilots are taking no chances they are flying very low known as a nap of the earth approach to pass underneath the Ukrainian radar around 9:30 they cross the border unnoticed and continue to follow the river South towards the Ukrainian Capital emerging from the Waterway the helicopters skim the surface of the KV Reservoir until they get within sight of a large Dam just to the north of KV at last the ukrainians spot them and air defenses immediately open fire Downing one M24 and damaging a Ka 52 which crash lands already it appears things are not going to plan for the Russians Putin's Security Forces had assured him that the ukrainians would not resist a Russian invasion in fact they would be thankful to get rid of their government and rejoin the so-called motherland for that reason the force on its way to hostel is not particularly large or well-armed they face having to hold the airport for hours at least before reinforcements arrive and even when backup gets there they will all be surrounded this operation was always going to be risky but if the ukrainians are resisting then the odds are heavily stacked against Russia perhaps this occurs to some of the men on the helicopters but they press on regardless and make a sharp Westward turn away from the Ukrainian capital and towards hosel Airfield at 1030 hours they arrive this is hosil Airfield otherwise known as Antonov airport because the Antonov company a Ukrainian plane maker has one of its two main bases there it compromises two large hangers where the company stores some of their Fleet including the Maria one of the largest aircraft that ever flew there is a radar array at the North End of the Airfield a collection of military buildings in the Southeast including a barracks and beyond that some residential buildings and the city itself then there is the all important Runway a little over 2 mil long and made of reinforced concrete rather than tarmac to handle the Maria's weight the perfect spot in other words to land a bunch of heavy military equipment as the Russian helicopters arrive from the East they find the ukrainians waiting for them around 200 soldiers have been on alert since 6:00 a.m. when two rockets slammed into the Airfield aiming for their barracks and administrative buildings both missed around 20 men are guarding the radar while the rest are spread out near the hangers these men are equipped with a Zu 232 anti-aircraft gun while these men are armed with only rifles and igler anti-air rocket launchers as a precaution they have parked Vehicles all across the runway meaning no aircraft can land until they are moved these men are mostly from the fourth rapid reaction Brigade the unit is NATO trained but the troops at the airport at this moment are far from Elite that's because Ukraine thought Russia's initial attack would take place in the donbass hundreds of miles to the East and it has moved all of its best men there those remaining at the Airfield are largely conscripts and administrative officers who never expected to see Frontline combat though they don't know it yet for the next 2 hours they will be all that stands between a free and Sovereign Ukraine and one under Russia's boot at 1100 hours the real battle begins Russia's helicopters split into two groups the attack helicopters go to the Northern end of the runway to take out the anti-aircraft gun while the transports head south to try and land their men near the barracks the k85 2s and m24s open fire with their Auto cannons and unguided Rockets and the ukrainians shoot back with everything at their disposal within a few moments one of the KA 52s is shot down by an anti-air rocket it crash lands in the middle of the runway creating another obstacle in the ensuing battle another 2K five twos are lost one of which crashes and explodes and another of which crash lands intact in a field just to the north of the air strip an MI 24 is blown up south of the runway one an mi8 is damaged and forced to land on the air strip where it is later blown up heavy damage is caused to the airport as missiles go flying the Maria which was in its hanger at the time is set on fire and burns fuel tanks dotted around the air strip are also set a blaze and the burning of crashed helicopters fills the sky with black smoke making it even harder for Russia to land but eventually the Ukrainian resistance can hold out no longer the troops are out of ammunition and the order is given to fall back towards the barracks with the skies now clear of rockets the Russians begin Landing troops to the west and Northeast of the Airfield who quickly move out and begin to seize their targets the soldiers guarding the radar at the Northern end of the Airfield are overwhelmed and surrender becoming the first ukrainians to be captured by Russia as the Russians move towards the southeast corner of the Airfield a gun battle breaks out with the remaining Defenders near one of the heers however the ukrainians are badly outmatched and are soon forced to withdraw into the nearby residential buildings the Russians raised their flag over the airport barracks and at 1300 hours around 2 hours after the battle began hostel Airfield is under their control for the second phase of Russia's plan we need to take a look at this map we shows a zoomed out view of Ukraine Belarus and Russia atov Airfield 500 mil to the north of hostel 18 IL 76 transport planes get airborne carrying an estimated 1,000 troops it is thought these men come from the 76th guards Air Assault division which is based inov and is considered one of the most combat ready units in the Russian military flight time from pcov to hosl is about 2 hours but the planes will never make it instead about 2third of the way through their Journey they are forced to abandon their mission and land at an unknown location somewhere in barus and that's because the ukrainians managed to get their own reinforcements to the Airfield first this is a close-in view of the Ukrainian Capital Kev and two nearby cities Jamir and biserra where Ukrainian reinforcements are position almost as soon as the battle at hostel started the ukrainians realized Russia's main Invasion wasn't coming from the East and that stopping the airlift was vital to their survival what they needed was time to get extra men to the airport and retake it and this is exactly what the brave 200 Defenders have bought them if those men had retreated Ukraine May well have fallen instead they held out for two crucial hours in that time Ukraine managed to move three brigades to the airport the 72nd mechanize part of which was in KV and part of which was stationed in bisera around 50 Mi to the South along with the 80th air assault and 95th Air Assault which were located in joton around 70 Mi to the West bit by bit these forces arrived at hos for the Airborne their Journey was relatively simple they loaded onto helicopters and flew the short distance much as the Russians did but for the 72nd with tanks and artillery guns to move the task was harder luckily Ukrainian civilians helped out bringing commercial trucks and trailers to take the heavy armor North in a mission that the commander dubbed the march of life let's take another look at this close-up map of host at Airfield as the big guns start arriving at the Airfield they open fire on the road Runway cratering it so that Russian aircraft cannot land this is what forces them to call off the airlift the paratroopers already at the Airfield are now stranded they have no heavy weapons or air support to hit back at the artillery with and venturing out into the open is a nogo their only hope is to hold out long enough for the ground forces advancing from bellarus to arrive so they dig in a little after 1500 hours the last of the Ukrainian reinforcements arrived at 15:30 Vladimir zilinski announces that the Airfield is totally surrounded with the world watching he gives the troops the order to attack and retake it the Ukrainian Airborne move in from the west and the 72 mechanize move him from the East encircling hosl and quickly overwhelming the Russian Defenders artillery now backed by Ukrainian s25 bombers unleash a salvo explosives on the runway and put it out of action for good Ukrainian M24 helicopters join the providing close air support to the Troops on the ground clearing the buildings the Russians fight back but they cannot hold out for long the column of reinforcements they are waiting on has snarled up somewhere south of Chernobyl as poor Logistics and Ukrainian attacks take their toll no reinforcements are coming hopelessly outnumbered and outgunned the Russian paratroopers are driven off the Airfield and suffered for heavy casualties those not killed in the fighting are chased into the nearby fields and lack the strength to mount any kind of Counterattack by 2100 the airport is fully back under Ukrainian control and the fighting has stopped it is not until the following day that the Russian armored column arrives rather than defend the Airfield the ukrainians now withdraw but shell the airport one last time to ensure it can not be easily repaired hosl would ultimately be as close to Kev as Russia's troops would get after leaving the air strip Ukraine set up a defensive line running through hostel and neighboring bua and Erin where they bogged the Russians down for weeks and inflicted heavy casualties on April 1st Putin's generals made the decision to withdraw from the area and all areas north of Kiev giving up any hope of taking the Ukrainian capital and leaving plentiful evidence of war crimes in their way the battle for hosl was one Russia was forced to refocus its war effort on the donbass when Ukraine thought it would strike in the first place Putin thought he could take the whole country in just a few days but more than two years later the fighting continues so why did the Russian attack fail let's clear the board and talk about some of the tactics involved in the battle and why the Russian plan failed the keys to the kremlin's plan were surprise speed and sequencing first they had to capture the Airfield without the ukrainians realizing what they were up to then they had to get their planes on the ground before Kiev could organize a defense finally ground troops had to arrive at precisely the right moment so they could Advance into the City and take over initially the plan worked Ukraine was not expecting an attack on the capital and did not see the helicopters cross the border but from the moment the Choppers were spotted close to the ukrainians guessed exactly what they were up to and moved to thwart their plan so how did they work it out so fast because this was far from the first time the Russians have used this tactic Czechoslovakia was the first to full victim to it back in 1968 when the Soviet Union invaded its own Ally to put down a rebellion known as the Prague spring months of protests had prompted liberal political reforms in the country which the Soviets could not abide overnight on August the 20th they invaded along with allies Poland Bulgaria and Hungary the battle plan mirrored the Ukraine Invasion almost exactly as hundreds of thousands of troops and tanks rolled across the border and into Czechoslovakia crack paratroopers were flown to prague's main airport which they quickly seized once the airport was taken more troops were flown in using the runway and spread out through the capital to capture key sites like military headquarters radio stations and government buildings before they knew what was happening the country's leaders were loaded onto planes and flown to Russia with their posts taken over by Kremlin loyalists ground troops then occupied the country for the next several months until all resistance have been crushed the plan came off almost without a hitch and was repeated again during the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan following the assassination of pro Soviet leadership and reforms by those took over the USSR again invaded Russia's Airborne forces captured carbal airport used it to land reinforcements took the Afghan leadership back to Russia and then sent his army to occupy the country that occupation ended badly but it seems a young Vladimir Putin then just starting out as a KGB agent observed and remembered the invasion plan because he would later use it himself in 20140 during Russia's first invasion of Ukraine Putin wheeled out the tactic to sees control of Crimea this time targeting the main airport in sevastopol for the airlift Crimea was occupied almost without a shot being fired and then later annexed in a sham referendum the West stunned by The Audacity Of The Move imposed sanctions but did Little Else handing Putin a near bloodless Victory ordinary Russians loved him for it and his popularity soared almost certainly inspiring him to try the same plan again a decade later but on a Countrywide scale this meant the ukrainians were almost certainly aware of the tactic from their own history but even if they weren't then their generals would have known about it from their training at Soviet military acmy Valeri jalni Ukraine's top General on the day the allout War Began was schooled on sovet Doctrine and has gone on record saying he read every book that Valeri gasimov his opposite number in Moscow ever wrote all of which is to say jalni and Ukraine's other generals know how the Russians think because they were trained to think the same way so when news spread during the chaos of the first day of the invasion that helicopters have been spotted heading for hostel they would have known instantly what their enemies were up to that meant the Russians lost the element of surprise it was then down to the discipline and bravery of Ukraine soldiers to do the rest the 200 100 men who held the airport for two crucial hours were responsible for robbing the Russians with speed had these men fled without a fight the Russian airlift would have been completed before the Ukrainian support brigades from Basera and Jamir arrived and a combination of poor Russian Logistics and Ukrainian resistance north of hosl wrecked the sequencing by the time the Overland column of reinforcements arrived from bellarus and seized the Airfield the ukrainians had crated the runway and rendered it useless and K now aware of Russia's plan to storm the capital was able to organize a defensive perimeter around the city that Putin's troops never managed to break and that is why Putin's plan for victory in 3 days failed and why Ukraine was able to maintain control of the country hey everyone thanks for watching the first episode of Battle Board if you liked it and you want more war content stick around for a minute of our other show war on T this is an American Abram's tank being hit by a Russian drone near the city of adiva back in February and this is the very first piece of footage we've seen of one being destroyed by the Russian army the Abrams is among the world's best but the ukrainians managed to lose three of them in a little over a week and they have lost even more since then which begs the question does the Abrams have a place on the battlefields of the future we'll analyze this footage delve into the history of the Abrams and speak to an expert to find out this is one of 31 Abram's M1 A1 tanks given to the ukrainians by the US and used to equip the 47th Brigade the M1 A1 entered service in 1986 it weighs around 60 tons is powered by a gas turbine engine that'll run on pretty much any kind of fuel and is armed with a 120 mm main Cannon it is coated in choam composite armor which provides some of the best protection in the world to the crew of four who sit inside the turret at the back of the turret is an armored compartment where the ammunition is stored which is separated from the turret by blast doors that means even if the ammo explodes during battle the crew will be protected and on top of the compartment are blowout panels deliberately weak sections which pop off and vent the Blast away from the crew thanks for

          <attvalue for="7" value="ونستضيف من عمان اللواء فايز الدويري الخبير العسكري والاستراتيجي لواء فاز دويري اهلا بك باعتقادك وفق هذه المعلومات الوارده في بيان ابو عبيده التحذيري ما طبيعه ما يجري في هذا الموقع حيث الاسير ماتان سنجاوكر و ما تهدد قوات الاحتلال بالقيام به داخل هذا الموقع يعني اولا هناك توجيه صدر قبل عده اشهر صدر قبل عده اشهر بان القرار النهائي للتعامل مع الاسرى هذا كان بعد حادث تقريبا شبه مماثل القرار النهائي لجماعه الظل الذي تحرس الاسير وبالتالي كان ملخص الرساله يجب على قوات الاحتلال ان لا تجبر قوات الظل على اتخاذ قرار يفضي الى انتهاء حياه الاسير لانه سيكون البديل انتهاء حياه الاسير وحياه من يقوم بحمايه الاسير الان هذه الرساله هي رساله تحذيريه لجيش الاحتلال وهي رساله موجهه الى الكيان والى البعد المجتمعي في هذا الكيان ان يضغط ل توقف القوات قوات الاحتلال عمليات العسكريه في هذه النقطه بالذات اذا ارادت الحفاظ على حياه الاسياخ لانه يبدو الموقف العسكري اصبح صعبا جدا في هذه النقطه لا مجال لنقل الاسير بطريقه امنه لا من خلال الانفاق ولا من خلال فوق الارض وبالتالي اصبحت المنطقه محاصره بالمطلق واي عمليه عسكريه القسام كمقاتلين وتحديدا قوات النخبه وقوات الظل كلمه الاستسلام غير موجوده في قاموسه امم وبالتالي في اللحظه الفارقه ستنتهي حياه حياه قوات الظل التي تقوم بالحراسه وحياه الاسير بغض النظر عن الطريقه التي تنتهي فيها دويري سيناريو العمليه المفترضه او الممكن ان تقوم بها قوه الاحتلال لمحاوله تحرير الاسير متان باعتقادك كيف هو وكيف يمكن ان تواجهه هذه القوه قوه المقاومه الموجوده في حراسه الاسير اذا ارادت اذا ارادت ان تبذل جهدا قوات الاحتلال اذا ارادت ان تبذل جهدا ل لاخذ فرصه ولو 1% ان تاخذ الاسير حي يجب ان يتوقف القصف الجوي والمدفعي تتولى العمليه قوات النقبه تتقدم لعلها يكون بها مجموعه من القناصين تقوم بالاشتباك وقد ياخذ الاشتباك ساعات مع قوات الحراسه حتى يصلوا الى الاسير ام دون ذلك دون ذلك لن يستطيعوا هذه العمليه محفوظه بالمخاطر من اكثر من جان بالتالي في ظل الظروف الحاليه ما احتمالات ان يصلوا اليه حيا هذا ما ساجيبك عليه في هذه الحاله الاحتمالات الموجوده من حيث النجاه ضئيله اولا لا اقول ان القسام سيستخدمه درعا بشريا القسام اخلاقيا وموروثا دينيا غير موجوده في قاموسه لكن تبدا دائره الاشتباك تضيق وعلينا ان نتذكر ما جرى مع يحيى السنوار ستضيق دائره الاشتباكات كلما ضاقت دائره الاشتباكات الاسير موجود مع المقاتلين وبالتالي اذا حوصلوا في بنايه واحده ستكون النهايه الحتميه القضائي على الجميع لماذا؟ لان الاسير بين المقاتلين والنار تطلق من جهات متعدده على المقاتلين ولن يتم القضاء على المقاتلين الا بالقضاء على الاسير مع المق مع المقاتلين مع مجموعه الظل لهذا السبب فرصه النجاه شبه معدومه فاذا كانوا ان يريدوا ان يحافظوا عليه حيا عليهم ان يوقفوا العمليه العسكريه في مستويات ايقاف القصف الجوي والمدفعي وعدم المغامره بجلب قوات قوات خاصه قوات مثل دوفدوفان او غيرها لتقوم بالعم باجزاء النهائيه من العمليه لانها في النهايه ستبقى مستمره في الاشتباك مع المقاومه حتى تنتهي ويتم ال القضاء على المقاومين وعلى الاسير مع المقاومين طيب في حالات ممثله لواء ادويري ايه عند اتخاذ قرار القيام بعمليه تحرير اسير تحت اي ظروف يمكن لصاحب هذا القرار التراجع عنه واصدار اوامر للقوه الموجوده هناك بالتراجع خاصه مع هذا البيان التحذيري من ابو عبيده يعني الان اعياد القائد الميداني مكبله امم اذا الان ما هي حجم القوه المحاصره هو يقع ضمن اثار عمل كتيبه الان هذا القرار لن يصدر من قائد الكتيبه هذا القض القرار يبدا التعامل معه من مستوى قائد الفرقه الان هل هو في قاطع الفرقه 36 163 162 143 252 بغض النظر الفرقه 98 القوات الاحت المظليين حسب ال حسب الفرقه القرار من قائد الفرقه وسيكون على الخط الساخن مع رئيس الاركان ورئيس الاركان سيكون مؤكد مع وزير الدفاع ومع نتنياهو الان هم يتحدثوا ان هدف الحرب والعوده الى الحرب من اجل اطلاق سراح الرهائن يوجد رهينه والقسام يقول الرهينه على قيد الحياه ولا تغامروا وتلعبوا بالاوراق ام اوقفوا العمليه للمحافظه على حياته عليكم الانسحاب ولاحظي الان حتى ايقاف العمليه لن يكون مقنعا للقسام لانه يمكن استئنافها في اي لحظه بما انه تم تحديد مكان الاسير عليهم ان يتراجعوا من المنطقه عليهم ان يعطوا فرصه للقسام لنقل الرهينه لمكان امن غير معروف دون ذلك لا جدوه من وقف العمليه اذا تم الاضاء عليه اذا لنفترض انه محتجز في بيت ما فائده ايقاف العمليه وابقاء الفوق العسكري المعادي حول هذا البيت اذا في لحظه ما سيتم اقتحامه القسام اذكى من ان تقدم هذه الفرصه عليهم ايقاف العمليه التراجع من منطقه العمليات اعطاء القسام فرصه لنقله لمكان امن او عليهم ان يتسلموا هذه الرهينه جثه هامل من خلال تعامل الاحتلالي وادويري مع هذا الملف مع الاسرى الموجودين لدى المقاومه داخل قطاع غزه وا تسبب الاحتلال في مقتل عدد كبير منهم منذ بدايه هذه الحرب هل باعتقادك سيهتم الاحتلال كثيرا لمساله الوصول الى الاسير ماتان حيا لا اعتقد ان حياه الاسير مهمه لدى نتنياهو ام لا اعتقد ذلك لانه اي قانون هاني بعل واضح جدا قانون اني بعل الذي طبق مرات ومرات ومرات لا واضح جدا الاسير الميت خير من الاسير الحيث وبالتالي اذا تم تطبيق قانون هاني بعل فلا هناك حتميه بال بانتهاء حياه الاسير والقضاء عليه وهذا ما ارجح ام بالتالي هذا هو السيناريو الذي ترجحه ما الذي يمكن ان يجعل سيناريو اخر مختلفا هو الذي سيحدث كما قلت لك هناك سيناريوهات تعدد اثنين ام اما الاستجابه للنداء او تطبيق قانون هاني بعل اذا اراد تطبيق قانون هاني بعل عليه ان يتسلمه جثي هامدا بغض النظر عن الطريقه التي يقتل بها في اللحظه الفارقه في اللحظه الفارقه خولت قوات الظل منذ اكثر من عام خولت قوات الظل منذ اكثر من عام بانها صاحبه القرار حول حياه الاسرى امم اذا القرار من جانب القسام حسم منذ اكثر من عام لان اللحظه الفارقه لا تعود لابو عبيده لا تعود لقائد اللواء او قائد الكتيبه في كتاب القسام القرار لقائد قوه الظل المجموعه التي تحمل اسير وهذا ب من ابو عبيده قبل اكثر من عام بعد العمليات اللي تمت وتحديدا بعد العمليه التي تمت في مخيمات الوسط والعمليه الشهيره التي راح المئات من ابناء غزه ضحيه لها الان ادي المقاربه الاولى المقاربه الثانيه قانون هاني بعل نعم اذا اراد ان يستمر تحت ذريعه قتل من يحرسه والوصول اليه فهو يطبق قانون هني بعل الان هذا التطبيق على يد جيش الاحتلال وعلى يد غير جيش الاحتلال هذا هو قانون هني بعل القسام يقول ان اللحظه الفارقه هي بيد قائد مجموعه الحراسه هذا الامر تحدث بها ابو عبيده منذ اكثر من عام اذا القرار واضح ومحسوم والتقييم النهائي لقائد مجموعه الظل فعلى جيش الاحتلال اما ان يستجيب لكلمه لما كتبه ابو عبيده او عليه اذا اشر ان يتسلمه جثه هامده وبعدها يصيغ البيان الذي يشاء ان يصيغه نتنياهو لكن العمليه اصبحت واضحه للكيان ولشارع الكيان Ja" />

As the patrol was nearing its end, the crew spotted a German submarine, the U-1225. The Catalina turned towards it and started an attack run on the Germans, who replied with their anti-aircraft cannons. The Catalina managed to drop it’s depth charges but was badly damaged by the German defense. The Canadian crew were forced to ditch into the freezing waters. Stranded in the Norwegian Sea, the crew fought to try and survive the cold and high waves for more than 20 hours.&#10;&#10;The main sources we used for this film are:&#10;Archive Report, RCAF No 162 Squadron Catalina 9754, 24 June 1944.&#10;Summary of Events June 24, 1944, by B.

          <attvalue for="7" value="It’s the afternoon of June 24th, 1944, and Flight Lieutenant David “Pop” Hornell pilots his Catalina flying boat. He is on an anti-submarine patrol over the rough Norwegian seas when over the intercom, the Port gunner asks : “Hey, you are seeing what I see on the portside?” He checks to his left and, sure enough, in the distance, there is a distinct form of a U-Boat floating in the sea. “I sure do!” Hornell activates the action station's alarm, and the flying boat turns towards the enemy with four depth charges at the ready. Below, spotters in the German U-Boat 1225 see the incoming aircraft and sound the alarm. Oberleutnant zur See Ernst Sauerberg doesn’t waste a second. “Turn to port!” The submarine turns in evasive maneuvers as twin 20mm cannons and a single 37mm Flak cannon are turned towards the Catalina. “Fire!” The Catalina is rocked by 37 mm flak. The plane is already shuddering under hits on the fuselage. “Cole! Radio the base. Keep them updated!” &quot;Copy that.&quot; Hornell orders the Radio Operator, Sydney Cole, to tell the base their location and situation. But before Cole has a chance to send the first message, a flak shell punctures the radio compartment. Cole groans and puts pressure on his wound but doesn’t report it. Instead, he pushes through the pain and keys the transmission. Little does he know that the radio equipment has been damaged by the German fire. Hornell dives towards the target, unaware that none of their transmissions are being sent. As they get closer, 20 mm cannons join the fray, and tracers zip all around. The impacts get ever more frequent, punching holes in the aircraft’s thin skin. &quot;It's getting rough, boys. Hold on.&quot; The crew feel a violent shake and are horrified to see pieces of the right wing being torn off. Flak bursts by their right engine, and it starts shaking violently. Hornell fights with the aircraft as it starts to drift off course, the mounting damage making it ever harder to steer. At the nose of the aircraft, the Front Gunner opens fire at the U-boat with his twin .303 Brownings. Bullets rain around Sauerberg. The Catalina’s fire zeroes in on the conning tower as they get closer. Sauerberg's men are struck and the guns go silent. “You men! Get on the guns or we’re all dead!” But the incoming fire is too accurate. The Germans can’t move as the Catalina's machine guns rip into the conning tower. But then, one of the Catalina’s guns jams. The U-Boat commander, hearing the strikes slow, seizes the opportunity. “Man the guns! Now!” The crew jump into position, and they open fire on the incoming Catalina. Hornell’s blood runs cold as he sees once more a wall of tracers coming up at them. The Catalina is hit again with German fire ripping through the wings and fuselage. A glow comes from above, and Hornell looks up to see the damaged engine with flames gushing out of its cowling. &quot;Starboard engine on fire!&quot; &quot;Shutting it down.&quot; The second pilot shuts off the engine, but it doesn’t stop the fuel leak. The ball of fire grows as the plane barrels towards the enemy submarine. Sauerberg is staring at a rapidly approaching ball of fire and orders evasive maneuvers. &quot;Full to port!&quot; Above, Hornell is fully committed. Seeing the submarine turn left, he makes an adjustment at the last possible moment. And then he releases the depth charges. Below, Sauerberg watches the Catalina roar overhead as it drops its payload. &quot;Good heavens!&quot; The depth charges splash perfectly around the submarine. “It’s a hit! It’s a hit!” The aircraft shakes even more violently. Hornell looks up at the flaming engine spinning in the wind. He sees it shake its own mounts apart, the rivets and bolts come undone. The fuel and parts of the engine rip away from the wing. Hornell knows they’re not going to make it home. “We’re going down! Brace yourselves, men!” The men all hold on except Cole, who frantically signals S.O.S. messages as Hornell prepares to land. The sea below is rough, but they have no other choice. Hornell turns his Catalina into the wind and prepares for landing. The floats lower, and the remaining engine is brought to idle. The waves only appear to get bigger as the plane gets closer to the surface. “Brace for impact!” Cole keeps keying S.O.S. until the last possible moment, when he stops and braces for impact. The Catalina hits the first wave, but there’s a strong headwind. The force bounces the airplane, and it surges 150 feet back up into the air. Hornell wrestles with the controls, and in a split second, he aligns the Catalina for a second impact. They slam into the next wave, and the plane once again launches, reaching 50 feet before plunging back down towards the water. The still burning Catalina bursts through multiple waves before finally coming to a rest. “Get out!” Hornell urges on his men as he knows the Catalina can explode at any second. Flight Engineer Donald Scott inflates a dinghy out of the left blister, while fellow engineer Fernand Laurent inflates one from the right. “You all get on board. I’ll push it.” Hornell and some of the men jump into the freezing cold water to push the dinghy away. Cole bundles onto the dinghy and makes sure to secure the survival rations as the men start pushing, but then he remembers the radio. “Wait! The radio!” Hornell barely has time to understand what Cole has just said before Cole starts swimming back towards the Catalina. “What are you doing?!” “We need the radio! They won’t find us!” “Don’t! It’s too late!” Hornell is right… The men watch painfully as the Catalina is engulfed in flames and sinks under the waves. They begin helping one another onto the dinghy. The inside of the dinghy is already beginning to flood as the men try to board. Hornell uses a helmet to throw water overboard. But then there’s a cry. “We’re missing someone!” Hornell is filled with dread and immediately gets to the edge and counts the heads. There is only seven. There is meant to be eight. &quot;It's Laurent!&quot; Fighting down panic, Hornell scours the rolling waves for his missing man. They see nothing as the dinghy rises and falls in the heavy waves. They catch a glimpse of a second dinghy, it’s also cresting a wave in the distance. “There he is!” They push furiously through the swell, rushing to catch up with their friend. The men on the dinghy direct as they see their friend also paddling towards them. But then they crest another wave and see Laurent’s dinghy empty. “Go! Go faster!” They redouble their efforts and reach Laurent, who’s managed to struggle back onto his dinghy. The relief of having 2 dinghies is palpable, and two of the crew move to get onto Laurent’s dinghy, but then… Laurent’s dinghy explodes and drops the men into the ice-cold seawater. They all start to pile onto the remaining dinghy, but they can’t fit. Hornell volunteers to stay in the freezing water with two more men. “Hang on. We sent those distress calls. Rescue will be here soon.” But he doesn’t know that none of them were sent. For three hours, Hornell organizes a rotation, swapping who waits in the water, hoping to delay hypothermia. Hornell assigns himself to stay in the freezing water the longest. But it's unbearable. His strength is fading. &quot;We have to figure out how to get everyone aboard.&quot; &quot;Look! There!&quot; An aircraft is spotted in the sky. It’s another Catalina. “Get the flare gun!” The flare fires off into the sky, lingering in the air for a minute before falling into the sea, but the Catalina keeps on its path. &quot;Another!&quot; They send out a second flare, and yet again, the aircraft doesn’t react. “Come on! Come on! Another.” A third flare is shot into the air. Seconds drag on, and finally, &quot;They saw us!&quot; the Catalina turns towards them. “We have survivors adrift, 63 degrees north, 0 degrees 30 minutes west, unable to land due to bad weather. We need a boat.&quot; Over 100 miles away, in the Shetland Islands, rescue boat HSL 2507 is deployed. The Catalina stays circling over the stranded men. And they signal in morse code. ‘High-speed launch on the way. Help coming.’ Then some time later it signals &quot;U-boat killed.&quot; The men cheer. They might just make it out of this. Every wave is torture, and they are having trouble holding on. A wave lifts up their dinghy and throws the entire crew overboard. Hornell emerges from the water, disoriented. The dinghy is getting pushed by the wind, and his men lay scattered around him. He clings to the lifeboat, counting heads. “Everyone’s here?&quot; They struggle to turn it over in heavy waves, and one by one, they help each other climb aboard and rebuild their barely stable setup. Water starts to fill the dinghy and without the bucket and their strength fading, the small dinghy floats lower and lower, partially submerging some of the men in the freezing sea. The situation is desperate. Hornell's vision starts to blur. The men huddle in search of any warmth. Laurent starts to go delirious. &quot;Laurent?&quot; &quot;Stay awake! Please!&quot; &quot;Laurent?&quot; Hornell and his men try to talk with him to keep him focused. But it's no use. He's gone. The men are devastated. Hornell makes the difficult decision to push Laurent’s body overboard. Up above, the Catalina is running out of fuel. There's no choice. The crew radios the men’s position one last time and turns for home. The men stifle back tears as they watch their hope fly away. They float alone in the sea. But then they see something in the sky. It’s a huge aircraft. The men perk up, they start waving their hands, and they see a big bomber turn towards them It drops something from its belly. The men watch. It’s a wooden boat! But the wind is strong, and the boat gets carried away, flying off until it disappears from sight behind a wave. They bob up and down in the waves and see it floating… 500 yards away. &quot;Let's swim. We can make it.&quot; &quot;No, it's too far!&quot; Despite being completely blind from the salt water and having no idea where the boat is, Hornell drags himself towards the water. The men swim after him, reaching out — grabbing his arms, trying to hold him back. Hornell pleads, but his men know it’s no use and they watch their lifeboat float away. A spotlight appears over the waves, illuminating the men. The rescue boat has finally arrived. “Contact! We’ve found them!” After 21 long hours, the survivors of the Catalina are pulled from the sea. Laying on the dinghy, Hornell looks up, staring through his blurred eyes at the scene of his men being lifted out of the water. A sense of accomplishment washes over him, and with the last of his strength, he musters the smallest of smiles. His eyes close, never to open again. The sailors on the rescue boat attempt to revive him for four hours, but it's no use. Thanks to Hornell, 5 survivors would all make a full recovery and survive the war. David Ernest Hornell was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. And it was received by his wife. Of his late commander, second pilot Denomy later stated, “Outstanding about Flight Lieutenant Hornell was his marvelous ability in flying such a badly damaged aircraft, especially in the face of strong enemy fire. His courage and bravery throughout marked him as a great man. Words cannot do justice to the fine job he has done.” “Poor souls, those U-boat hunters have a devil of a job. Have you heard of an American destroyer who had fist fight with U-boat crew? Watch this story and see the whole thing.&quot;" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="It’s the early morning of February 28th, 1994, and six volunteer pilots are on a bombing mission in violation of a NATO no fly zone. The leader of the flight is pilot Ranko Vukmirović from the Bosnian Serb airforce. He and his men are in Jastreb J-21 jets which are no match for the NATO F-16s in speed, maneuverability or weapons. The Jastreb pilots are trying to keep below radar height but now with the target getting close they are forced to ascend to 2000 meters to start the attack run on a weapons factory. In doing so, the aging Serbian jets light up the watching NATO radars. Fifty miles away, two patrolling F-16s are informed of the J-21s’ presence. “Black Flight, you have six bogeys, BRAA 320 for 52 at 7,000. Flanking.” &quot;Copy that.&quot; The F-16s bank towards the target. In an attempt to shorten the war, NATO has set up a no-fly zone, and the F-16s have been sent on a route to intercept. Vukmirović gets a visual on his target and arms his bombs. The flight positions themselves in pairs, one after the other, when suddenly a transmission comes through the radio. “American aircraft ahead of you.” A pit grows in Vukmirović’s stomach. He can clearly see the trails of the two American Air Force jets dead ahead of them. He takes a deep breath. “I see. Let’s go.” In previous missions, the American jets have only watched and warned the enemy but not engaged. Vukmirović knows: if the F-16s had wanted to shoot him, they could have done so from miles away. But his eyes go wide as he sees the two F-16s approach at breakneck speed and roar through and past the Bosnian Serb flight. &quot;Haha, American Ferraris...&quot; “Focus on the target.” &quot;Jesus, did you see those old yugos? Ha ha&quot; Despite the show of force, the Serbian pilots are not distracted and keep their eyes on their objective. The Jastrebs are old tech and still use optical sights. And as the target drifts into the crosshairs, the aging planes release and drop their rudimentary but effective 550-pound bombs on target, striking them from different directions. &quot;They dropped bombs.&quot; &quot;Understood. You're clear to engage. Weapons free.&quot; &quot;Roger, moving to engage. This is going to be shooting fish in a barrel.&quot; At the very rear of the formation, pilot Zlatan Crnalić watches the last of the bombs strike. “Target is hit.” “Copy that. Objective complete. Turn for home.” The six J-21s turn back towards their airbase, but their speed is no match for the F-16s, who sweep in behind them, lining up their sights on the very rear of the formation. The pilot switches to air-to-air mode and selects an AIM-120 missile on his right display computer. On his head-up display (HUD) a box designates the target. The F-16 pilot gets a lock and presses the weapons release button. &quot;Fox 3.&quot; The missile flies off from the wingtip. The AIM-120 AMRAAM radar-guided missile fires and locks onto the running J-21’s radar signature, rapidly approaching its target. Crnalić is scanning the skies for the Americans when he sees an enormous flash. He wonders if he’s been hit, but then he sees the explosion on his wingman’s left wing, immediately shredding half of it off. “The Americans are behind us.” “Scatter! Run!” The five remaining J-21s turn over and dive for the ground. One of the F-16s gives chase, following them all the way down into the valleys between the Bosnian hills. Each pair of J-21s goes its own way, leaving Crnalić completely on his own. He frantically looks over his shoulder as he flies through the terrain, catching the terrifying sight of an American fighter hot on his heels. “He’s on my tail.” “Fox 2.” The F-16 fires an AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking missile. It locks onto Crnalić’s hot engines and chases him down across the sky. Crnalić flying low skims over some electrical transmission wires. The missile explodes near the wires and his tail, cutting part of his vertical stabilizer, but he’s still flying. “I’m hit. I can’t shake him off!” He reports his situation but finds his radio completely dead. Alone and vulnerable, Crnalić looks over his shoulder, expecting a second impact at any moment. But instead, he sees the F-16 turning away. “Crnalić, respond!” “They got him... Keep going!” Back with Mikerević, he and his wingman push their aircraft to their limits, racing through the valleys. But the F-16 relentlessly closes the distance. &quot;Fox 3!&quot; He releases another AMRAAM missile which rockets towards its target. Mikerević is still looking across the sky to catch a glimpse of an enemy fighter when the missile flies in and disintegrates his wingman. The Jastreb explodes into flame and scrap. “Pesić is down! The American is on me!” He breaks into evasive maneuvers once again as the F-16 fires another missile. It slams straight into his engines. The explosion shreds the fuselage, and flames pour out of the holes. “I’m hit! I’m on fire!” He wrestles the dying aircraft, pulling hard on the stick and willing it to ascend as it burns all around him. As flames engulf the cockpit Mikerević pulls the canopy emergency handle and ejects. The F-16 roars past as Mikerević parachutes safely down. The F-16s continue towards the next pair of targets. They swap positions, with the covering F-16 diving into action, armed with a fresh set of missiles. But their fuel is running low, and in a few minutes, they’ll be forced to turn back. “Approaching bingo fuel. Two bandits trying to escape. I may be able to get one shot.” &quot;Roger that.&quot; South of the F-16 pair, Vukmirović and his wingman Goran Zarić have been forced to hear their friends taken down one by one in rapid succession. Any hope they have is crushed by the sight of an F-16 appearing over the hills behind them. “Behind us!” The pair break formation as the American jet sweeps in. With just enough fuel left to make it back, the F-16 gets a lock. &quot;Fox 2.&quot; Vukmirović sees the missile launch off the rail and turn toward him. He turns hard, trying to outmaneuver it, but it’s no use. It rapidly approaches from his right and explodes just off his wing. He is stunned, but the fragmentation does no significant damage. He looks back, expecting more, but instead, the F-16 pulls off the chase, out of fuel. “He’s turning away.” “We made it?” But NATO command has dispatched two more F-16s. Vukmirović looks back up. “Two incoming! Run!” Two J-21s scramble for speed, diving down as far as they dare into the valleys. They skim the treetops, racing between the hills with the F-16s all the while shadowing them and keeping up. They look over their shoulders to see the F-16s closing the gap. There is nothing they can do to come out on top. In desperation, Vukmirović tries a last-ditch idea. “Follow me.” He turns straight towards a cliff at maximum speed, Zarić keeping close formation behind him. “We pull up as late as possible!” His heart races as the two jets head straight towards the earth. “Pull up!” The two pilots pull their controls as hard as they can. Zarić is crushed down by the G-forces as the ground rapidly approaches his windshield. “Come on...” Vukmirović’s jet clips the ground and bursts into flames. Zarić looks back, there is no parachute. “No! No!” The F-16s burst through the smoke, still in pursuit. He pulls back into a dive, rushing to use the terrain as cover, but they’re far too close. &quot;Fox 2!&quot; The missile closes the gap and explodes into Zarić’s tail. His fighter bursts into flames, and he loses all control. He releases the canopy and ejects, but he is far too low. The parachute has no time to open, and he falls into the fireball of his own crashed jet. “Splash one. There is another bandit on the radar. Engaging.” The F-16s leave the scene and catch up to another J-21 flying low over the countryside. It’s Crnalić, limping his damaged jet home to safety. He’s keeping an eye on his gauges when the F-16 roars past. He is filled with dread and immediately pulls on the stick. His only plan is to gain enough altitude to eject before the American can finish him off. The F-16 gets behind him, and he grabs the canopy emergency handle. But then, the F-16 pulls up alongside, matching his speed. He locks eyes with the enemy pilot. The American salutes him and flies away. Out of the six Jastreb pilots that volunteered for that dangerous mission, three never returned home. Crnalić would later say: “I don't have any bad feelings towards the American pilots... We had our task, they had theirs.” This event is usually referred to as the Banja Luka incident and represents the first NATO combat engagement in its history. Robert “Wilbur” Wright was credited with three victories, the highest score by a USAF pilot in a single mission since the Korean War, while pilot Stephen “Yogi” Allen was credited with one victory. “God help them if we use our F-117s.” “Ha ha! No one told us they were invisible...&quot; Watch this film and see how the F-117 was shot down!”" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="JEFFREY GOLDBERG: So, here's a partial list  of deals and moves Donald Trump has done that   would have sunk any other president. He's  accepted a $400 million plane as a gift   from a Middle East autocracy that hosts both  Hamas and the Taliban, and also may be the   home of a new Trump hotel. He's dined with top  investors in one of his cryptocurrency projects   and reportedly promised to promote the crypto  industry from the White House. He's pardoned   prominent Republicans and reality T.V. stars,  including a man convicted of securities fraud,   who, with his wife, donated $1.8 million to  Trump's reelection campaign, for good measure. By the way, he commuted the sentence  of the leader of the murder of Chicago   criminal and organization, the Gangster Disciples,  Trump's family is charging half a million dollars   to join a private club in Washington, D.C.  He's building a golf resort in Vietnam,   a country seeking tariff relief for $1.5 billion,  and a Trump skyscraper in Ho Chi Minh City,   a fact, ho Chi Minh himself would've  undoubtedly found darkly amusing. The Trump organization is planning  to build a Trump Tower in Riyadh,   for good measure. After a dinner at Mar-a-Lago,  Jeff Bezos agreed to pay $40 million to license   a documentary about Melania Trump, the most  expensive licensing fee ever paid for a   documentary. I could go on. I. But I won't because  I want our panel to tell us what this all means. Joining me tonight, Peter Baker, the chief  White House correspondent at The New York Times,   Leigh Ann Caldwell is the chief  Washington correspondent for Puck,   and Steven Hayes is the editor of The  Dispatch. Thank you for joining me. I want to read you all something from my  colleague, David Frum, just wrote about   Trump and his relationship to corruption. Quote,  nothing like this has ever been attempted or even   imagined in the history of the American  presidency. Throw away the history books,   discard people, comparisons to scandals  of the past. There is no analogy with any   previous action by any past president.  The brazenness of the self-enrichment   resembles nothing seen in any earlier White  House. This is American corruption on the   scale of a post-Soviet republic or a  post-colonial African dictatorship. Peter, agree, disagree, is there any precedent  for what we're seeing in American history? PETER BAKER, Chief White House Correspondent, The  New York Times: No, I mean, there really isn't.   Nothing comes close at this point, no. There have  been presidents who have monetized the presidency   on some level or another. They used it to benefit  their family businesses or whatever. Certainly,   there have been family members who tried  to trade off their famous presidents. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: That's more  happens more often than not. PETER BAKER: It happens. PETER BAKER: It happened in the last  administration, let's face it. Hunter Biden   certainly traded off his father's name, but it was  penny-ante compared to what we're talking about   now. Even if you believe all the worst allegations  against Hunter Biden, it would be a tiny fraction   of what we're seeing now in terms of the scale  and scope of these billions of dollars. Literally   this cryptocurrency thing alone, his family and  businesses have got $320 million in fees just in   the four months since he started it for creating  nothing, by the way. I'm not much of an expert   on crypto stuff, but that seems to be you don't  actually have anything. There's no actual tower   at the end of the day. It's just this coin, and  he's already made hundreds of millions of dollars. So, now, the question is what does that do in  terms of policy? That's the next question. You   can certainly make some connections, right?  The guy who shows up at this crypto dinner,   Justin Sun, just had the SEC say, we're going  to pause our fraud case against him. So,   he comes back to the country where  he hadn't been in a couple years   after paying tens of millions of dollars  for this crypto coin that he's bought. Is there a direct connection? It doesn't  look good, obviously. And that's the   problem with conflict of interest. Even if  you're doing everything on the up and up,   the appearance usually makes most presidents say,   let's not do that because it might give the  wrong impression. Trump has no problem with this. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Peter, you're giving  me the impression that you have not yet   purchased the Washington Week  meme coin. I'm a little -- PETER BAKER: I'm looking for the discount. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: I don't know  if we're going to see you back at   this table. Yes, I don't know if we're  going to see you back at this table. Leigh Ann, it's interesting, you know, like  in Watergate, you know, by August of 1974,   Republican leaders, House and Senate, bring  Barry Goldwater with them as top cover to the   White House, tell Richard Nixon, your support  is evaporating across Congress, Democrat,   obviously, but Republican as well. By, you know,  the next day, Nixon resigns even before, you know,   impeachment. Something remarkable has changed  in Washington, and maybe it's a tribalism,   maybe it's fear. But where is Congress  on all of this. As Peter points out,   Republicans were very activated by Hunter Biden's  activities. No activation here, whatsoever. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, Chief Washington  Correspondent, Puck: Yes. Remember they   were trying to impeach President Biden  because of Hunter Biden's activities.   Yes, Republicans are completely silent about it.  In fact, there's legislation on the Hill, in the   Senate, right now called the Genius Act, which is  about crypto, that was stalled for several weeks.   Because once this crypto news with the president  came out, Democrats demanded that there be some   constraints on the administration when it comes to  deals like this. They never reached an agreement,   and this bipartisan legislation is moving forward  without those constraints on the administration   trying to rein in and make some of this maybe  not illegal, but some guardrails around it. But another thing is the president is  immune from any sort of repercussions   other than congressional impeachment, right?  The Supreme Court has already ruled that the   president cannot be charged with anything.  And Republicans do not have any motivation,   political, or any way, to break with  the president on this. This is not   something that they think is worth  getting in front of the president on. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Can I ask you this, though?  I mean, and I know this probably will sound   naive to you, but you said they have no  political motivation, but what about just   being shocked ethically or morally by this kind  of brazen business dealing in the White House? LEIGH ANN CALDWELL: Yes. So, yes, you  think that is how it should play out. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: I mean, you talk  to people all the time and you talk   to them privately as well. Is there any  private anxiety about this, private anger? LEIGH ANN CALDWELL: I mean, privately they're  like, yes, this isn't great. Publicly,   you seem some, you see some who say, you know,  well, we would prefer if it wasn't like this,   like Senator Josh Hawley is one of those  people who has said something publicly,   but they're not willing to do anything about it. And let me flip the question around,  because even the Democrats aren't   really making this much of an issue. And the  reason they're not talking to Democrats is,   first of all, the flood the zone thing is  absolutely working. They can barely keep up.   But also Democrats are telling me, look,  everyone knows that Donald Trump is   corrupt. It is already baked in what people  think about him. They also think that all   politicians are corrupt. And so this is not  a political argument that works right now. And so they are trying to refocus everything  on chaos, on how Donald Trump is not helping   inflation and cost and not helping your  pocketbook specifically because they   found that people just don't really  care and respond to the corruption. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: I guess one of the things I'm  surprised at, Steve, is, throughout American   history, there have been consequences for this  kind of self-dealing, right, whether it's Ulysses   Grant whose reputation suffered because of  a corruption in the cabinet, Warren Harding,   the Teapot Dome scandal, up to Watergate,  obviously, and more minor incident. This   seems completely novel in American history. How  do you explain the fact that no one seems to care? STEPHEN HAYES, Editor, The Dispatch: Yes.  I mean, I think, you know, what you read   from David Frum was accurate. I agree with  Peter. This is unprecedented. And, you know,   during the first Trump term, I think too many of  our colleagues said things were unprecedented that   weren't in fact unprecedented. This is truly  unprecedented. We haven't seen this before. And I think one of the reasons that there's  not more outrage, as Leigh Ann's last point,   there's a general sense, certainly on the  Republican side, rank and file Republican   voters believe that everybody does this. This  is what's been going on in Washington. Remember,   Donald Trump ran and he was going to drain the  swamp. This is the way that people perceive   Washington working. And Trump just does  it with a little -- he's a little bigger,   does it with a little more flare. He's a little  more aggressive, right, right. And I think that's   how you get Republican voters who can rationalize  this, having talked to some of them about it. And in Congress, you know, I think there's  a divide on the Republican side. You have   the sort of hardcore MAGA supporters who say,  this is great. I'm glad he is doing this. I   don't care. This is what everybody's  done all along. Then you have the,   I'd say a quiet majority who thinks it's awful and  they will tell you it's awful off the record or   in private conversation. But they don't love it.  They're not going to step up to do much about it. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Are any of them,  not to be overly cynical now,   are any of them making money on any of this? STEPHEN HAYES: I mean, that's a real question,  I think, you know, and it's a question about   the tariffs and what he is doing with  the tariffs every single day. I mean,   if you know that these things are coming,  you know, he announced he wants to now   double the steel tariffs suddenly. People  weren't expecting this. But if you knew   that this was coming and you could potentially  place bets that way, it could be profitable. PETER BAKER: Well, and that's the thing, right?  The president may be immune for actions that   are officially, you know, part of his job. People  around him aren't. And, normally, administrations,   in fact, find, you mentioned a couple of examples  where presidents themselves didn't get in trouble,   but the people around them had done a lot  of things, well, we don't know, right? If   somebody playing the market here, if they know the  president, as you say, is going to say something   and it'll tank the market or the other way around,  you can time it. There's no regulation right   now. There's no regulatory authority right  now that seems eager to look at that. Why? JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Well, I want to come  back to that point in one minute, but,   Steve, I want to ask you a question  about the foreign entanglements here.   It's one thing to have this guy who's  like, you know, got pardoned because of   some securities thing or some of these other  characters who make donations to his campaign,   but it's quite another thing to get into bed  with Middle East autocracies, communist nations,   communist governments from Asia. There are  national security consequences here, yes? STEPHEN HAYES: Huge potential. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Talk about those. STEPHEN HAYES: Well, look, I mean, I remember  it wasn't that long ago when people like me were   obsessed with reporting on Hillary Clinton  and the Clinton Foundation. And those were,   you know, I suppose if you wanted to -- I still  have problems with them. I thought it was grubby   at the time. But at least they were sort of a  bank shot to the person who's not still in charge. These are just open and aggressive. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: But what do you mean  by that? Go into that a little bit. STEPHEN HAYES: Well, I mean, you know,  the $400 million plane that you mentioned. STEPHEN HAYES: I mean, this is --  you know, Donald Trump is accepting   this. He's celebrating it. He's got his  people on his staff who are justifying it,   rationalizing it, saying, we'd be crazy  not to do this. That's far worse than   anything we reported on with respect  to the Clinton Foundation back in 2016. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Maybe you could  help me understand something about   the Trumpian mentality. I want you to  watch something. This was from a meeting   President Trump had in the Oval Office  with the president of South Africa   a little while back, a little while  ago. Let's just watch this for a second. CYRIL RAMAPHOSA, South African President: I  am sorry I don't have a plane to give you. DONALD TRUMP, U.S. President: I  wish you did. I would take it. If   your country offered the United States  Air Force a plane, I would take it. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: He's serious. STEPHEN HAYES: Yes. I think he's serious. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL: Yes. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Is he serious? PETER BAKER: He's not smiling. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL: Yes. PETER BAKER: No. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: What's the thought process  there? Why would he do this in the Oval Office?   I mean, it seems degrading to the United  States, the richest country in the world,   to say, pay me tribute in your -- give me old  planes and I'll take them. I don't understand. STEPHEN HAYES: Yes. I mean, look, I think  he likes it when people sort of kowtow to   him and go in and kiss the ring. I think that's  exactly what was happening there. And, you know,   it's part -- Peter alluded to this earlier.  Part of what makes it hard to keep up with is   that is the volume of it and that it is so out  in the open. And, you know, you have talked to   Republicans on the hill and they will say, hey,  you know, the Hunter Biden stuff was all hush,   hush. And, you know, these payments for his bad  art that, God, and we had to subpoena people   to find out about this. Trump's doing it in the  open, so it must be justifiable. You're actually   seeing Republicans make those arguments  and I think it's a strength of Trump's. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL: They're  literally comparing it to France,   giving us the Statue of Liberty, like the  airplane equates the Statue of Liberty. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Yes. I mean, you know, there  is something interesting here that in journalism,   obviously, a lot of the energy of investigative  journalism goes into exposing the cover-up. But,   Leigh Ann, there's no cover-up,  period. There's just business,   like business that would have been considered  scandalous in any other administration. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL: And when Donald Trump Jr.  goes overseas to help ink these deals, they're   very open about it. And, yes, and there are --  and no investigations on the Republican side into   this. There are a couple letters and inquiries  from the Democratic side in Congress into this. But, you know, Republicans are still investigating  President Biden's administration. The Oversight   Committee in the House just opened another  investigation into the auto pen. And so they   are still obsessed with that while all of this,  like you said, is completely out in the open. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Could you just do  20 seconds for all the normal people   at home that don't follow the autopen  scandal, what the Autopen scandal is. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL: Yes. Should  I look into camera and explain? JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Yes. Talk to America  about the autopen for a minute. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL: The fact that President  Biden, Republicans say, was so incapacitated   that staffers were running the government  using his signature with an autopen. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right, which is not  actually scandalous because presidents   often use autopens to sign vast numbers of -- PETER BAKER: Also produced zero facts on  this. This is simply them trying to say,   well, he's so doddering, he must have had  aides with the autopen, they have no idea. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL: Correct. PETER BAKER: And it doesn't matter  that there are no facts behind it. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL: But they are  subpoenaing people to come in. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: And, Peter, one more angle  on this that I'm interested in. Congress is   obviously not providing muscular oversight  now, but there used to be in government,   various bodies within the executive  branch that would provide self-oversight. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: I want to read you  something that you just wrote. Mr. Trump,   the first convicted felon elected president,  has erased ethical boundaries and dismantled the   instruments of accountability that constrained  his predecessors. There will be no official   investigations because Mr. Trump has made sure  of it. He has fired government inspectors general   and ethics watchdogs, installed partisan loyalists  around the Justice Department, FBI and regulatory   agency and dominated Republican-controlled  Congress unwilling to hold hearings.   Talk about the changes that have been made in the  inspector general system in the last five months. PETER BAKER: Yes. I mean, these are the  mechanisms of accountability of a normal   government, right? And he has made very clear  by firing the people who held jobs like that,   by putting people in, like Pam Bondi and Kash  Patel at the Justice Department and the FBI,   what his expectations are? His expectations are  you're going to go after my enemies and you're not   going to go after my friends. And he's done that  through the pardons. He has done that through,   you know, retribution time and time again. What happened in his first term when a  special counsel was appointed by his own   deputy attorney general, and he then spent  the rest of his term and ever since then,   you know, lambasting, Rod Rosenstein  for doing that, for appointing   Bob Mueller to look into things. That  is not going to happen in this term. And that's what's so different. Like under  Reagan, when they investigated people in the   Reagan administration, under Clinton, when they  investigated people in the Clinton administration,   there were multiple special counsels.  Anytime you had a cabinet officer or   somebody in there, even the president,  do something that was questionable,   there was this expectation that you would have  a Justice Department appoint special counsel,   independent counsel, whichever the structure they  used, because you didn't trust the government to   investigate itself. And people wanted to  have, you know, independent investigation. STEPHEN HAYES: There's no expectation that's  ever going to happen in the next four years. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL: And he fired the  special counsel and then put into place   an ally into the special counsel's office, who's  only, I think out of law school three years. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: So, there was a  system here, there's a deliberate -- PETER BAKER: There's a system that will never be  used under the next -- in this administration. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right." />

          <attvalue for="3" value="Avdiivka had been a thorn in the Russian side for more than a decade - a city on the outskirts of Donetsk that the Ukrainians had been defending since 2014 and had turned into a fortress. Beginning in October 2023, Russia launched an all-out assault to capture the city which turned into one of the longest and bloodiest clashes of the entire war. Despite suffering an acute shell shortage, Ukraine managed to inflict punishing losses on the Russians through the pioneering use of FPV drone tactics which were so effective they’re now standard practice up and down the frontlines. Here, Battle Board explains how they work and the effect they had on the battle.&#10;&#10;#battleboard #ukraine #ukrainewar #russiaukrainewar #avdiivka &#10;&#10;Daily Mail Website: https://www.dailymail.co.uk&#10;Daily Mail Facebook:   / dailymail  &#10;Daily Mail IG:   / dailymail  &#10;Daily Mail Snap:   / daily-ma.  .&#10;Daily Mail Twitter:   / mailonline  &#10;&#10;Daily Mail Pinterest: https://pinterest.co.uk/dailymail&#10; &#10;Get the free Daily Mail mobile app: https://dailymail.co.uk/mobile" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="this is the battle for Avdka a bloody contest of innovation where both sides used new tactics and weapons for the first time to devastating effect Where Russian glide bombs flattened Ukrainian defenses but Ukraine's FPV drones blew Russian armored columns to bits We're going to get into the battle and the tactics behind it in just a moment but first let's take a look at the Russian plan This is Ukraine The Denipro River is here Kiev is here And this is the eastern region known as the Donbass Abdiva is right here It's an industrial city which used to make coing coal for Ukraine's huge steel mills and was once a suburb of nearby Donetsk City But in 2014 it found itself on the front line of Russia's war on Ukraine after Moscow backed separatists seized all of this territory severing it from Donetsk The two sides fought over Abdra in 2014 then again in 2017 Both times it was held by the Ukrainians who turned it into a fortress pinning the Russians back inside Donetsk When fighting resumed in 2022 this time on a much larger scale Avdka once again found itself in the thick of the fighting Putin planned to take the whole of Ukraine with attacks from the north on Kiev from Crimea on the south and a two-pronged offensive from Donetsk and Luhansk on the Donbass But the Kiev attack quickly went wrong and was abandoned The Crimea offensive met with some success but then stalled leaving just the Donbass attack going Slowly but surely cities in this area began to fall to Russia The first was Marupole in May 2022 Then several Daetsesk and Lyshansk in June and July of the same year Bakmoot followed in May 2023 The Russians were making ground in every direction except northwards out of Donetsk City because Fortress Avdka was in the way This wasn't for lack of trying All throughout this period the city was heavily bombed and attacked And while Russian troops made some progress by capturing small outlying towns they could not take the city itself All that changed in the latter half of 2023 The battle for Bakmoot had been long slow and bloody but it taught the Russians one important thing How to take a fortress Grinding human wave assaults backed by huge amounts of artillery and bombs They now planned to use this tactic to take down Avdka a thorn that had been in their side for more than a decade that the Ukrainians had also been learning a new way of warfare one that didn't rely on trenches and howitzers but on high-tech drones and FPV goggles Avdka was the place where these two tactics would meet with horrifying results This is the battle where Ukraine smashed some of the largest Russian attacks of the whole war using cuttingedge technology and where Moscow had to resort to First World War tunneling tactics and improvised glide bombs to grind the Ukrainians down This is the battle for Avdka and this is Battleboard This is Avdka a once thriving industrial city that was once home to 32,000 people Its natural defenses are a series of lakes which largely block attack routes to the northeast and wide open fields which leave attackers with almost no cover to the southwest But what really makes a fortress are the man-made defenses built up over a decade of warfare At the northern end of the city these are anchored around two points First the Coke plant the largest in Europe A sprawling complex six miles around that's filled with a warren of buildings staircases chimneys railways and above ground pipes Many of the buildings are made of reinforced concrete making them resistant to bombing and they look out over fields to the north and west and have the city at their south To the east is a second defensive position a slag heap a pile of toxic industrial waste over a 100 ft high at points known to the Ukrainians as Terracon In an otherwise flat piece of country this provides much needed high ground from which the enemy can be spotted and fired upon At the southern end of the city are three more defensive positions which sit along the main roads into the city from Russian occupied Donetsk The first is another industrial zone made up of reinforced buildings with trenches dug between them The second is Sarska located here which is a complex of restaurants and hotels that the Ukrainians have turned into a military base Finally and perhaps most importantly there's Zenit a Soviet era air defense site that once guarded a nearby airfield which now anchors Advivka's southern defenses a complex of reinforced concrete bunkers and underground tunnels meant to withstand a nuclear strike It sits at top a hill which commands a view of the surrounding countryside It is these defenses which Russia has spent the last 18 months trying and failing to breach In January 2022 the front line between the two sides was here But by September 2023 the Russians had advanced around the city like so On the northern flank they've captured Coutabala Kamyanka and Kratnarivka And in the south they have taken Opia and Vodana As October begins it is from these flanks that Russia will launch its latest assault attempting to bypass Abdivka's fearsome defenses altogether in a pinser movement The goal is to cut the lone supply road that comes into the city from the west the 00542 which is located just here Leading the charge on the northern flank is the 114th Brigade Once a part of the Donetsk People's Republic a Sham government based out of Donetsk City all pretense of independence has now gone and it has been absorbed into the regular Russian army They are backed by the 21st brigade also formerly of the DPR and Russia's 15th brigade Their mission is to head south and west from their starting point in Kranovar through Steepov and Berdichi and into Olivka which sits on this key road On the southern flank are the 9inth and 110th brigades also formerly of the DPR and the 55th Brigade of the regular Russian army Their objective is to attack from Vodana up through Pavishnet and Tonenke and then cut the 00542 road from the south Then there's two more Russian brigades attacking Abdivka from the southeast The first brigade who have been given the unenviable task of assaulting Zenit and the 57th who are attacking up this road towards Sarska orka Leading the defense of the city are the Ukrainian 110th Brigade Formed at the start of the 2022 invasion they were sent straight to Abdivka and have been here ever since Ukraine typically tries to rotate their units every few months to rest and recuperate But the 110th has now been here for 18 months with no break They're spread out across the south and east One detachment is holding Zenit Another is spread between Satska or Hotka and the southern industrial zone And a third is guarding the eastern approaches to the city Helping them cover the southern flank are the 53rd Brigade and 36th Marine Brigade stationed just north of Vodana And on the northern flank is the 116th territorial defense brigade reinforced by the second presidential battalion along with Omega and third special forces groups Assuming roughly 5,000 men per brigade this gives us a total Russian strength of 40,000 men roughly in line with Ukrainian estimates made during the battle and 20,000 men on the Ukrainian side though some sources put it slightly lower at 15,000 The battle begins on October the 10th when the Russians gather roughly 3,000 of their men and launch a huge attack southwards from Krano Harivka and northwards from Bodane Tanks equipped with mine plows lead the charge Their job is to clear a path through Ukrainian minefields and other obstacles while using their armor to soak up damage from artillery shells and anti-tank rockets Lined up behind them in single file are dozens of more lightly armored vehicles filled with troops They're hoping to use the protection of the tanks to get as close to Ukrainian lines as possible before unloading their infantry who will storm the defenses But what they're not counting on are Ukrainian FPV drones Small fast highly maneuverable aircraft strapped with explosives and piloted using onboard cameras linked to virtual reality headsets Using just a few hundred of components these can make extremely precise hits on tanks and armored vehicles ripping them to shreds They prove extraordinarily effective and Russia's initial attacks in both north and south are devastated The Russians take a little time to regroup bringing in the 30th brigade on the northern flank and then launch another huge armored attack on October the 23rd The assault was caught on camera in this area by drones of the 110th Brigade who said 500 troops and 50 tanks and armored vehicles were involved In it you can see how Ukraine has incorporated drones into layered anti-tank defenses First to hit the tanks are artillery guns which have the longest range Then come anti-tank missiles like the US Javelin followed by landmines Once the vehicles are damaged or disabled they're sitting ducks for the drones You can see what happens here when a drone hits a weak spot of this tank This forces the Russians to change tactics and they abandon their pinser plan along with their tanks and armor vehicles Instead infantry are split up into small groups told to advance on foot and thrown at Ukrainian defenses in waves aiming to grind them down Though brutal and bloody this tactic is effective On October the 28th the Russians capture Terracon and raise their flag on top of it It's too close to Ukrainian lines for them to use as an attack position but it means the Ukrainians can no longer use it to shoot at them to head off any further Russian advances Ukraine now deploys the 47th Brigade near the Coke plant This is one of the country's best fighting units and is equipped with American M1 Bradley fighting vehicles which prove adept at destroying their Russian counterparts The 47th help stop any further Russian advances in the north In the south the 53rd and 36th are also doing a good job holding this line helped out by the wide open fields that provide the Russians with almost no cover And in the southeast these dugin fortifications are still proving too difficult for Russia to take It is now November and the rains arrive making the job of advancing even harder It is at this moment that Putin's generals unleash their own brand new weapon The weapon in question is a glide bomb This is basically a big Soviet era dumb bomb originally designed to fall straight down from an aircraft but which has been modified with a glide module This allows the bomb to glide to its target meaning they can be dropped away from air defenses giving the Ukrainians almost no chance to stop them They are nowhere near as accurate as Ukraine's drones so they're no use against moving targets like vehicles but they're very very effective against fixed defenses like these Russia has huge stockpiles of these bombs and uses them relentlessly sometimes more than 70 per day In December this advantage begins to tell One by one Ukraine's three defensive positions in the south begin to buckle First is the industrial zone Russia redeploys the 55th brigade from the southern flank and sends it in In addition to the glide bombs soldiers use First World War tunneling tactics to break these defenses Teams of sappers dig underneath Ukrainian positions plant explosives then detonate them blowing a hole in the defensive line Russian troops then rush through the tunnel and into the brereech pushing the Ukrainians back Then comes Sarska Ahotka Again the Russians use tunnels to their advantage This time they don't dig them themselves but make use of what's already there Unbeknownst to the Ukrainians Putin's troops spend weeks clearing out an old pipe that runs underneath their feet Then on January 17th 150 soldiers from the 60th Sabotage Assault Battalion are sent crawling through it They pop up here behind Ukrainian defenses and cause havoc Savvska Ahotka quickly falls as does this residential neighborhood Ukraine takes troops from the north and throws them into a counterattack which retakes the restaurant complex This succeeds but the damage is already done Russia has a foothold in this neighborhood and cannot be dislodged Then on January the 22nd Russia's first brigade almost succeeds in cutting off Zenit the third and final defensive position Setting off around the bunker in a pinser movement Their aim is to join up with the 60th brigade and cut this road which connects Zenit to the rest of Avdka After a couple of days of heavy fighting the Ukrainians manage to keep this road open but only just The defenses in the south of Avdka are now on the verge of collapse Around the same time Russia also begins to make progress towards the coke plant in the north In late December they capture a set of railway tracks that used to serve as the first Ukrainian defensive position In early January they begin pushing beyond these train tracks and into the open fields where troops and tanks alike are hammered by the Bradley's of the 47th Brigade In one famous battle in this area a Bradley which is really only designed for fighting infantry and other armored vehicles manages to take out one of Russia's newest tanks The T90M is blinded by the Bradley's autoc cannon fire disabled and sent careening into a tree where a Ukrainian FPV drone finishes it off Struggling to advance on the coke plant directly Russian forces in the north take lessons from those in the south and bypass the defenses altogether In early February the 114th Brigade with fresh reinforcements from the 74th Brigade launch an attack here the Ivushka neighborhood just to the south of the coke plant This is a Ukrainian weak spot Troops which were defending here have been moved away to help in the south and the Russians punch through Advancing with frightening speed the Russians quickly approach the 00542 road upon which all of Avdka's defenses depend On February the 4th Ukraine reacts by sending the third assault brigade into the city This is one of their most elite units known for winning battles against all the odds The brigade arrives with a bang charging headlong into Russian lines and successfully pushing them back from the road A post on the unit's Facebook page claimed to have inflicted 4,200 casualties including virtually wiping out the 114th and 74th brigades The unit said the 15th 21st and 30th also took casualties and that the 55th Brigade which was previously down here and a new brigade the 35th were also in the area While we can't verify those claims videos they posted did show heavy fighting Despite the Third Brigade's heroics Adivka's defenses are now fatally punctured and instead of holding the city the brigade will actually help cover the retreat The third assault brigade seems to have provided cover for those in the south holding open routes for them to travel out of the city while the 47th seems to provided cover for those retreating from the coke plant While not a route the retreat seems to have been disorganized Some units said they were given orders to withdraw while others said they took the decision for themselves to avoid being cut off and surrounded The most complicated evacuation played out down here at the Zenit position This is Zenit The complex the Ukrainians are defending is here The road leading into Abdiva is here And here's where the Russians are Inside the bunker at this moment are units of the 110th Brigade who are preparing to leave it for the first time in 18 months Their situation is dire Ever since January the unit has been having to ration ammunition food and water after being almost cut off Now with what little supplies they have they're going to have to run a gauntlet of Russian troops to try to make it back to their own lines for safety On February 13th they're given the order to withdraw Under the cover of darkness small groups of men head off towards our Diva They're repeatedly ambushed along the way Glide bombs and artillery rain down on the soldiers whilst evacuation vehicles are blown up by Russian FPV drones Soldiers lose track of their comrades in the dark Amid the falling shells some of those who vanish into the night are never seen again But some do make it out alive following their comrades through the city and out to safety In the end there are just two groups left inside Zenit A small detachment of soldiers and six wounded men They're trying to get out With badly injured legs these men cannot make it on their own But time is fast running out as the Russians close this gap Eventually these men are left with no other option but to leave their comrades behind with a promise to send vehicles to collect them as soon as they can They leave Zenit as fog rolls in reportedly traversing a gap in Russian lines just 120 yards across and then humping it 4 miles across open fields and to safety The wounded men are left alone to wait for vehicles that never come Instead they're greeted by Russians from the first brigade who take the bunker on February 16th Here's video which shows the Russians raising their flag over this former Ukrainian bastion More video which we're not showing reveals the bodies of the six men left behind Ukraine says Russia shot them dead in cold blood We're back in Abdiva The Zenit position we just saw is down here And here's where we left the rest of the battle One by one units are falling back towards the coke plant and then along the 00542 road out of the city Russian forces realizing a full retreat is underway swarm the city raising their flags as they go The last building to be evacuated is the Coke plant By the morning of February the 16th there are around a thousand soldiers still inside That includes units of the Third Assault and 47th Brigade The third assault are given orders to withdraw on February 16th and make it out by the following morning The 47th leave last shortly before Alexander Cerski the newly promoted head of the Ukrainian army publicly announces the withdrawal Fortress Avdka has fallen but it has cost the Russians dearly to take it One of Putin's own soldiers claimed afterwards that 16,000 Russian troops died in the effort We simply don't know if that's true And Ukrainian losses are even harder to work out President Zalinski later claimed that for every seven Russian soldiers lost in the battle Ukraine lost just one man which would put Ukrainian casualties around 2,000 But again we simply do not have the information to verify or dispute those claims Whatever the truth it seems very likely that the Russians lost more men in large part thanks to Ukraine's defensive tactics Throughout the battle Ukraine was desperately short of artillery ammunition thanks in large part to its Western allies failing to deliver promised shipments of shells But the Ukrainians adapted to use FPV drones instead which proved devastatingly effective In fact these tactics have now become standard practice across the front line tactics which work something like this Say we have a Ukrainian defensive position here a typical trench dug into a tree line to provide some cover And here's a Russian armored column coming to attack it If the Ukrainians have had time they would have laid a first line of defenses somewhere out in the fields They're guarding a line of landmines perhaps also some barbed wire and tank traps In order to get at the Ukrainians the Russians will first have to navigate this If they're lucky they'll have a tank with a mine plow leading the column that can clear a gap Otherwise they'll just have to hope they can steer between the explosives maybe losing a couple of vehicles along the way Behind that line of defenses will be artillery and anti-tank weapons pre-sighted on routes of attack ready to open fire the second the Russians drive into them In the early days of the war this would have been Ukraine's main line of defense But both anti-tank missiles and artillery shells are now in very short supply The main line of defense is now here a drone zone that is within range of FPVs which will hunt down any vehicles which survive these defenses For the FPVs to work surveillance drones have to be in the skies spotting the Russian columns advancing Orders are then relayed to a drone unit which deploys behind the front line and launches their drones Guided by the surveillance drones these FPVs then spread out and hunt down any remaining Russian tanks or armored vehicles to blow up Sometimes that's all that's needed The FPVs are enough to blow the Russian vehicles to pieces Other times they'll merely disable the vehicles Then grenade dropping drones similar to the FPVs but with a mechanical grabber underneath that drops a grenade will move in They will target the open hatches of tanks or vehicles dropping explosives through to set fire to the fuel or ammo guaranteeing the vehicle cannot be used again It was this defensive tactic that proved so effective in repelling the early attacks on Avdka and why we believe the Russian casualty count was so much higher than Ukraine In fact these tactics were so effective they're now standard practice for Ukrainian units all the way up and down the front line Already it seems likely that Ukraine will be remembered as the war that pioneered the use of drones on the battlefield And if that's the case then Avdka deserves to be remembered as the battle where the full power of drones was realized for the first time Thanks for watching If you like this kind of content and want to see more in your feed don't forget to hit like and subscribe or click the buttons on screen to watch other episodes" />

ROLE OF DONALD TRUMP'S. &gt;&gt; EXECUTIONER. &gt;&gt; THE WORLD TURNED AGAINST ELON MUSK. WITH TESLA SALES DROPPING. AROUND THE WORLD WHILE ELON MUSK WAS DECIDING TO TAKE FOOD. AWAY FROM STARVING BABIES, FROM STARVING CHILDREN, FROM STARVING. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE OF ALL. &gt;&gt; AGES WHO DEPEND ON FAMINE RELIEF FROM THE. &gt;&gt; UNITED STATES. &gt;&gt; AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH ELON MUSK PERSONALLY. DECIDED TO. &gt;&gt; DESTROY. &gt;&gt; AND ELON MUSK NOW WANTS US TO FEEL SORRY FOR HIM. ABOUT THE COST. &gt;&gt; AND THE. RISK THAT. &gt;&gt; HE SUFFERED WHILE. &gt;&gt; BEING. &gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP'S EXECUTIONER. &gt;&gt; SEVEN MINUTES. AFTER THAT TWEET. &gt;&gt; AT 2:14 A.M, ELON MUSK. TWEETED. THIS IMMENSE LEVEL OF OVERSPENDING WILL DRIVE. &gt;&gt; AMERICA INTO DEBT SLAVERY. NO. &gt;&gt; IT WON'T, BUT IT IS MORE DEBT THAN THE. COUNTRY HAS EVER HAD. AND 14. &gt;&gt; MINUTES. &gt;&gt; AFTER THAT, AT 2:28 A.M, ELON MUSK ATTACKED DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; AND HIS BUDGET BILL AGAIN, SAYING INTEREST PAYMENTS. &gt;&gt; ALREADY CONSUME. &gt;&gt; 25% OF ALL. &gt;&gt; GOVERNMENT REVENUE. &gt;&gt; THIS IS. &gt;&gt; ELON MUSK SPEAKING. &gt;&gt; SO OF COURSE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT TRUE. &gt;&gt; INTEREST ON THE DEBT IS NOT THAT HIGH. IT'S HIGH. &gt;&gt; BUT NOT THAT HIGH. ELON MUSK. &gt;&gt; THEN PUT. &gt;&gt; DOWN HIS TWITTER MACHINE FOR. &gt;&gt; ALMOST EIGHT HOURS. &gt;&gt; AND THEN. &gt;&gt; BEGAN ATTACKING. DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; AND HIS BUDGET BILL. &gt;&gt; AGAIN JUST AFTER NOONTIME TODAY. &gt;&gt; AND THEN DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; FINALLY AROSE FROM HIS TWITTER. SILENCE ABOUT. ELON MUSK ATTACKING HIM. AND AT 1:59 P.M, JUST OVER 24 HOURS AFTER ELON. MUSK LAUNCHED HIS DIRECT ATTACK. &gt;&gt; ON DONALD. &gt;&gt; TRUMP, CALLING DONALD TRUMP'S BUDGET BILL A DISGUSTING ABOMINATION AND SAYING ANYONE WHO SUPPORTED. &gt;&gt; IT SHOULD BE. &gt;&gt; TURNED OUT OF OFFICE. DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; BRAVELY. &gt;&gt; TWEETED ABOUT ELON MUSK WITHOUT COMMENT SIMPLY BY RETWEETING. THE OLD ELLEN. ELLEN FROM MAY 28TH, SEVEN DAYS AGO, WHEN ELON MUSK TWEETED AS MY SCHEDULED TIME AS A SPECIAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE COMES TO AN END, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE WASTEFUL SPENDING. AND THEN IN THAT SAME TWEET, ELON MUSK TOLD THIS LIE THE DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY MISSION WILL ONLY STRENGTHEN. &gt;&gt; OVER. &gt;&gt; TIME AS IT. BECOMES A WAY OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; THROUGHOUT THE GOVERNMENT. &gt;&gt; AND THAT WAS ONLY SEVEN DAYS AGO THAT HE WAS TELLING THAT LIE. AND NOW ELON MUSK IS TELLING YOU THAT HIS BUDGET CUTTING MISSION HAS NOT JUST COMPLETELY COLLAPSED, IT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY OVERRUN BY THE TRUMP. BUDGET BILL, WHICH THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE SAID TODAY WILL INCREASE THE NATIONAL DEBT BY $2.4 TRILLION. NOW IMAGINE HOW DEEP DONALD TRUMP'S FEAR IS THAT WHEN HE COULDN'T STAND IT ANYMORE TODAY AND HE HAD TO TWEET SOMETHING ABOUT ELON MUSK ATTACKING HIM FOR 24 HOURS, DONALD. TRUMP'S ATTACK THE ONLY THING DONALD TRUMP DARED TO TWEET WAS AN OLD ELON MUSK TWEET WITH NO COMMENT AT ALL. AND TWO MINUTES BEFORE DONALD TRUMP TWEETED THAT OLD ELON MUSK TWEET. &gt;&gt; ELON MUSK. &gt;&gt; TWEETED A NEW ONE, TELLING THE REPUBLICANS THEY NEEDED A NEW BILL. AND SIX MINUTES AFTER DONALD TRUMP'S TWEET, ELON MUSK TWEETED ANOTHER NEW ONE. NO ONE WHO ACTUALLY READS THE BILL SHOULD BE ABLE TO STOMACH IT. THAT MEANS YOU, DONALD TRUMP. AND THEN 44 MINUTES LATER, AT 2:50 P.M, ELON MUSK TWEETED, CALL YOUR SENATOR, CALL YOUR CONGRESSMAN. BANKRUPTING AMERICA IS NOT OKAY. KILL THE BILL. AND IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR THE CHILDISH MIND OF ELON MUSK SEEING THE WORDS KILL AND BILL SO CLOSE TOGETHER TO JUST TURN THAT INTO A MOVIE POSTER VERSION IN HIS NEXT TWEET EIGHT MINUTES LATER, USING THE TITLE OF THE MOVIE KILL BILL, THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE ESTIMATE OF THE IMPACTS OF THE BILL RELEASED TODAY, SHOWS THAT CLOSE TO 16 MILLION PEOPLE WOULD LOSE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE BECAUSE OF THE TRUMP REPUBLICAN BUDGET BILL. REPUBLICAN SENATOR JONI ERNST RESPONDS TO CONCERNS ABOUT LOSING HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AT A TOWN HALL IN IOWA WAS TO SAY, QUOTE, WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE, WHICH SHE SEEMED TO MEAN SORT OF MAYBE AS A JOKE. BUT THEN INSTEAD OF APOLOGIZING FOR WHAT SHE SAID OR ANY MISUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT SHE INTENDED WHEN SHE SAID IT, SHE DECIDED TO MOCK PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T LIKE HER RESPONSE AND INSULT THOSE PEOPLE BY PRETENDING THAT THOSE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE SOMEDAY. TODAY, THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC LEADER, CHUCK SCHUMER, SAID THIS. &gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP IS. &gt;&gt; JUST LYING. &gt;&gt; ABOUT THE BILL. LYING ABOUT THE BILL. &gt;&gt; WELL. &gt;&gt; HERE'S THE WE ARE ALL GOING TO. &gt;&gt; DIE ACT. &gt;&gt; IT SAYS. &gt;&gt; NEARLY 14 MILLION. &gt;&gt; IT'S 16. &gt;&gt; MILLION GETTING CLOSER TO 16 MILLION, ACCORDING TO CBO'S NUMBERS. WE'VE BEEN. &gt;&gt; TOLD 16 MILLION PEOPLE LOSING HEALTH INSURANCE THANKS TO REPUBLICANS VOTING FOR DONALD TRUMP'S DISGUSTING ABOMINATION. MIKE JOHNSON, THE PERPETUALLY IN-OVER-HIS-HEAD GUY WHO GOT THE JOB OF SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE WHEN KEVIN MCCARTHY WAS KICKED OUT AND NO ONE ELSE WANTED THE JOB, IS THE KIND OF IN OVER HIS HEAD GUY WHO'S WILLING TO TELL YOU PUBLICLY, WHO WON'T RETURN HIS CALLS. &gt;&gt; WELL, I'LL TELL YOU. I CALLED ELLEN LAST NIGHT AND HE DIDN'T ANSWER, BUT I HOPE TO TALK TO HIM TODAY. I MEAN, IT'S NOT YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY FRIENDLY AND WE CAN AND WE'VE LAUGHED ABOUT OUR DIFFERENCES ON POLICY BEFORE. I'M NOT UPSET ABOUT THIS. &gt;&gt; NO, HE'S NOT UPSET ABOUT IT. HE DOESN'T LOOK UPSET ABOUT IT. WHY SHOULD HE BE? HE WAS A JUNIOR MEMBER OF THE HOUSE WHO GOT CATAPULTED INTO THE SPEAKERSHIP FROM OBSCURITY AFTER A COUP. HE GETS THE BIGGEST OFFICE IN THE CAPITOL. HE GETS A BIGGER PAYCHECK THAN THE OTHER HOUSE MEMBERS. HE GETS SECRET SERVICE PROTECTION. HE'S SECOND IN LINE FOR THE PRESIDENCY IN THE IN THE LINE OF SUCCESSION. WHY WOULD HE BE UPSET THAT ELON MUSK IS TRYING TO DESTROY HIS DISGUSTING ABOMINATION AND WON'T RETURN HIS CALLS? MIKE JOHNSON'S LUCKY TO BE THERE, SO OF COURSE MIKE JOHNSON'S NOT UPSET ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; I'D LOVE TO TALK TO HIM THIS WEEK AND HOPE HE CALLS HIM BACK TODAY. I'VE TALKED TO I TALKED TO PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOU KNOW, ALL THE TIME, MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY. OBVIOUSLY WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS. HE'S YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT HE'S NOT DELIGHTED ELLEN DID A 180 ON THAT OKAY. &gt;&gt; SO WE GOT IT. SO TRUMP EASY TO GET ON THE PHONE TIMES A DAY. MUSK WON'T RETURN THE CALL. THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. SO THERE'S THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE WANDERING THE HALLS OF THE CAPITOL SOUNDING LIKE A HIGH SCHOOL KID ON A TOUR, SAYING HE REALLY HOPES THE RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD CALLS HIM BACK TODAY OR SOMEDAY. AND HERE'S WHAT THE RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD DID AFTER MIKE JOHNSON SAID THAT ELON MUSK TOOK THAT VIDEO OF MIKE JOHNSON SAYING, I HOPE HE CALLS ME BACK TODAY. AND HE PUT IT IN HIS TWEET AT 2:05 P.M. SAYING, NO ONE WHO ACTUALLY READS THE BILL SHOULD BE ABLE TO STOMACH IT, WHICH MEANS NO ONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO STOMACH WHAT THEY HEARD MIKE JOHNSON SAY IN THAT VIDEO WHEN HE'S HOPING ELON MUSK WILL CALL HIM BACK TODAY. CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP HAS NEVER LOOKED MORE PATHETIC, MORE CHAOTIC, MORE CHILDISH, OR MORE, TO USE ELON MUSK'S WORD, DISGUSTING. IF THE SENATE FAILS TO PASS THE BILL, THEN THE REPUBLICANS WILL HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN. AND TONIGHT, SENATOR RAND PAUL HAS SAID HE WILL VOTE AGAINST IT. AND HE SOUNDS LIKE HE MEANS IT. SENATOR RON JOHNSON HAS YELLED ABOUT THE BILL, SOUNDING AS IF HE WILL VOTE AGAINST IT. BUT THERE'S NO REASON TO BELIEVE ANY OF THE RANTINGS OF RON JOHNSON. REPUBLICAN SENATOR JOSH HAWLEY SAYS HE WON'T VOTE FOR THE BILL WITH WHAT HE CALLS MEDICAID BENEFIT CUTS, BUT HE HAS SAID HE WILL VOTE FOR WORK REQUIREMENTS BEING IMPOSED ON MEDICAID, WHICH WILL BE USED TO KICK PEOPLE OFF MEDICAID WHO ARE UNABLE TO FIND A JOB. THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOSE THEIR ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE. TRUCK DRIVERS AT THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES, FOR EXAMPLE, AND OTHER PORTS AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO ARE LOSING THEIR JOBS NOW BECAUSE OF THE TRUMP TARIFFS, WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TURN TO MEDICAID, AND JOSHUA HAWLEY WILL VOTE FOR THAT. SOUNDS LIKE HE'S GOING TO BE FINE WITH THAT. THE ONLY REPUBLICAN SENATOR WILLING TO SAY PUBLICLY THAT HE IS IGNORING ELON MUSK IS NORTH DAKOTA'S KEVIN CRAMER. &gt;&gt; IF ELON WAS GOING TO GIVE ME ADVICE ON HOW. &gt;&gt; TO. &gt;&gt; GET TO. &gt;&gt; THE. &gt;&gt; MOON. &gt;&gt; I'D LISTEN. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, IF HE WAS. &gt;&gt; GIVING. &gt;&gt; ME ADVICE ON HOW. &gt;&gt; TO RAISE A. &gt;&gt; SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS. &gt;&gt; FROM OTHER BILLIONAIRES, I'D LISTEN. BUT HE'S. &gt;&gt; NOT HE DOESN'T. &gt;&gt; GOVERN, YOU KNOW, AND SO, TO. &gt;&gt; BE HONEST. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I JUST IT'S NOT THAT BIG A FACTOR. I KNOW HE'S A GLAMOROUS SORT OF CELEBRITY, BUT. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT. &gt;&gt; A BIG FACTOR IN. &gt;&gt; KEVIN CRAMER IS IN YEAR ONE OF A SIX YEAR SENATE TERM. AND THAT'S ALWAYS THE YEAR WHEN SENATORS ARE AT THEIR BRAVEST. SENATOR JOHN THUNE OF SOUTH DAKOTA, NOW THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE, SAID AFTER A MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH DONALD TRUMP TODAY. THE PLAN TO DEAL WITH ELON MUSK IS TO SIMPLY LIE ABOUT THE BILL. &gt;&gt; WHY DO. &gt;&gt; YOU THINK ELON MUSK IS TRYING. &gt;&gt; TO. &gt;&gt; KILL. &gt;&gt; THIS BILL? &gt;&gt; WELL, I CAN'T SPEAK. &gt;&gt; TO, YOU KNOW. HIS REASONS OTHER THAN WHAT. &gt;&gt; HE STATED. AND I. &gt;&gt; THINK THAT WHAT HE STATED WAS THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WOULD. &gt;&gt; ADD TO. &gt;&gt; THE DEFICIT. &gt;&gt; AND WE. &gt;&gt; WE BELIEVE THE OPPOSITE. &gt;&gt; AND THAT IS LIKE BELIEVING THAT THE EARTH IS FLAT. BUT REPUBLICANS ARE WILLING TO PUBLICLY BELIEVE ANYTHING TO DELIVER MASSIVE TAX CUTS TO DONALD TRUMP AND HIS BILLIONAIRE FRIENDS. JOHN THUNE IS SAYING THAT REPUBLICANS ARE SIMPLY GOING TO LIE AND SAY THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, IS WRONG WHEN THEY ARE TELLING US THAT LEGISLATION WILL INCREASE THE NATIONAL DEBT. THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE HAS NEVER BEEN WRONG ABOUT THE OVERALL BUDGET IMPACT OF LEGISLATION. THEY MIGHT NOT. THEY MIGHT NOT PROJECT EXACTLY THE RIGHT NUMBER. BUT WHEN THEY SAY THE LEGISLATION WILL REDUCE THE DEFICIT, IT ALWAYS DOES. AND WHEN THEY SAY THE LEGISLATION WILL INCREASE THE DEFICIT AND THE DEBT, IT ALWAYS DOES. AND ANY SLIGHTLY SHARP HIGH SCHOOL MATH STUDENT COULD TELL YOU THAT THE REPUBLICAN BUDGET BILL WILL DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE NATIONAL DEBT. BUT DONALD TRUMP HAS SPENT YEARS LEADING UP TO THIS MOMENT, YEARS TEACHING REPUBLICANS JUST HOW MUCH THEY CAN LIE. AND SO IT WILL BE LYING SEASON ABOUT THE NATIONAL DEBT FOR REPUBLICANS. WITH ELON MUSK CONTINUING HIS ATTACKS ON DONALD TRUMP AND WHAT ELON MUSK CALLS THE DISGUSTING ABOMINATION THAT IS THE TRUMP REPUBLICAN BUDGET BILL. AND THERE'S JOHN THUNE ADMITTING THAT IT IS SUCH AN INDEFENSIBLE ABOMINATION" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="democracy depends on a free press please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org/give president Trump's crackdown on academic institutions in the United States was the focus of protests and commencement speeches this week as universities like Harvard held commencement ceremonies the Trump administration's now directed federal agencies to review all contracts with Harvard after it already cancelled nearly $3 billion in federal research grants for the university and moved last week to revoke its ability to enroll international students harvard has two separate suits pending against Trump arguing the moves violate due process as well as free speech protections under the First Amendment because they target the university staff curriculum and enrollment in his address at Harvard's commencement ceremony Thursday Stanford University professor doctor and novelist Abraham Bergiz praised the school's defiance of Trump and spoke to students facing threats of deportation or having their visas revoked when legal immigrants and others who are lawfully in this country including so many of your international students worry about being wrongly detained and even deported perhaps it's fitting that you hear from an immigrant like me perhaps it's fitting that you hear from someone who was born in Ethiopia when it was ruled by an emperor someone who then lived under the harsh military leader who overthrew the emperor someone who had at least who had at least one of his medical school classmates tortured and disappear more than a quarter of the physicians in this country are foreign medical graduates [Applause] so a part of what makes America great if I may use that phrase is that it allows an immigrant like me to blossom here just as generations of other immigrants and their children have flourished and contributed in every walk of life working to keep America great that's the novelist and medical doctor Ethiopian Indian American Dr abraham Vergiz addressing Harvard's commencement ceremony on Thursday his latest book The Covenant of Water meanwhile down the road in Cambridge the IndianAmerican class president at MIT the Massachusetts Institute of Technology spoke about how MIT's undergraduate body and graduate student union had voted overwhelmingly to cut ties with Israel mega Viruri wore a red and white kafia and said MIT students would never support a genocide and praised them for continuing to protest despite quote threats intimidation and suppression coming from all directions especially she said your own university officials last spring MIT's undergraduate body and graduate student union voted overwhelmingly to cut ties with the genocidal Israeli military you called for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and you stood in solidarity with the pro Palestine activists on campus you faced threats intimidation and suppression coming from all directions especially your own university officials but you prevailed because the MIT community that I know would never tolerate a genocide [Applause] right now while we prepare to graduate and move forward with our lives there are no universities left in Gaza we are watching Israel try to wipe Palestine off the face of the earth and it is a shame that MIT is a part of it the Israeli occupation forces are the only foreign military that MIT has research ties with this means that Israel's assault on the Palestinian people is not only aided and embedded by our country but our school as scientists engineers academics and leaders we have a commitment to support life support aid efforts and call for an arms embargo and keep demanding now as alumni that MIT cuts the ties that was MIT class president Mega Vuri now Indian-American graduate of MIT this comes as Galani Cobb the dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism another school facing attacks by the Trump administration writes for the New Yorker magazine this week about how quote academic freedom in the United States has found itself periodically under siege in his piece headlined A tumultuous spring semester finally comes to a close he describes how he consulted with Ellen Shreker a historian and the author of No Ivory Tower McCarthyism in the Universities along with other deans at Colombia they spoke about government repression on college campuses in the 1950s through to the present shreker told him quote &quot;I've studied McCarthyism's impact on higher education for 50 years what's happening now is worse,&quot; he quoted her saying well we begin today with Ellen Shreker in person joining us in our New York studio she's the author of Many are the crimes McCarthyism in America No Ivory Tower McCarthyism and the Universities shreker is also the author of the right to learn resisting the right-wing attack on academic freedom and she just wrote a piece for the nation headlined worse than McCarthyism universities in the age of Trump shreker has been active in the American Association of University Professors AUP since the 1990s i should note she has three degrees from Radcliffe Harvard and formerly taught there she's a graduate of Radcliffe 1960 ellen Shreker welcome to Democracy Now it's great to have you with us um as we look at these universities under attack you've studied higher education for over half a century let's talk about what was happening then and what's happening today okay uh the main thing that happened then to universities was that about a hundred faculty members most of them with tenure were fired and blacklisted that happened in every major institution of civil society within the United States and although the uh universities pride themselves on academic freedom whatever that means uh they collaborated with the forces of repression uh through that were actively imposing a climate of fear and selfcensorship throughout American society today what's happening is worse so much worse that we have to really find a new phrase for it i don't know what it'll be but um during the McCarthy period it was attacking only individual professors and only about their sort of extracurricular political activities on the left uh in the past and in the present then present uh today the repression that's coming out of Washington DC it attacks everything that happens on American campuses i'd like you to start off we have a very young audience we also have their parents and their grandparents around the world and I'd like you to start off by talking about who McCarthy is what do we mean by the McCarthyism of for example the 1950s okay that's a very good way to start because McCarthyism unfortunately is misnamed it is not just the career of Senator Joseph McCarthy who came in onto the stage of history in 1950 after uh the ism that he gave his name to uh had been really dominating American domestic politics since the late 1940s 47 is when the Truman administration imposed a loyalty test uh an anti-communist loyalty test on its employees so uh if we wanted to name this phenomenon of political repression anti-communist political repression and I want to specify that it didn't attack randomly people on the left but very specifically people who had some kind of connection usually in the past with uh the communist movement uh that during the 1930s and 40s was the most dynamic dynamic force on the left even though it was a very flawed very flawed uh uh political group it was nonetheless uh very uh influential on the left and um if we wanted to give that political repression of the 1940s and50s a name it should have been Hooverism after the FBI director Jay Edgar Hoover um you know the move uh the movie Good Night and Good Luck um they showed real black and white footage of McCarthy and test audiences thought he was too harsh unrealistic not realizing it was actual footage and now you have Good Night and Good Luck on Broadway uh George Clooney starring in it um and it is the financially most successful Broadway show we've seen is going to be now for free on CNN in a few days but the significance of that that that what people feel today was a cartoon character was in fact much harsher and sharper than people ever dreamed yeah um he was beyond the pale because like the current president he had no guard rails as it were not to mention Roy Cohen his sidekick in the hearings who would later go on to mentor Donald Trump until at the very end of his life Donald Trump rejected him when he was dying of AIDS exactly so there are lots of similarities with the fact that uh there's this very aberrant character at the heart or at the uh sort of public heart in of this repressive movement but what we should have known in the 40s and 50s and should know now is it's not just a one-man show it has been this moment of trying to crack down on dissent constitutional disscent free speech uh the ability to say uh what Israel is doing in Gaza is a terrible thing uh that is something that has been uh building up for decades and what that was the same thing during McCarthyism there was a kind of network of right-wing activists uh similar to groups today like the Heritage Society that brought us the uh 2025 project blueprint for Trump's attack on the institutions of civil uh liberties and uh civil society uh that uh has come to fruition since he uh entered the White House so I mean you speak as a Jewish author active member of the American Association of University Professors would you say that the McCarthyism of yestery year is the charges that President Trump with his sidekick Elon Musk giving the Hal Hitler salute charging anti-semitism for what he's doing anti-semitism is a pretext we know that Trump has been all his life a racist uh clearly befriending these uh fascist individuals and groups uh for years and uh what we're seeing is a kind of uh a melding of uh Trump's own uh right-wing proclivities reactionary proclivities pro-fascist proclivities with a uh long-term attempt within some pro-Zionist organizations to eliminate uh all uh uh support for Palestinian freedom and Palestinian liberation from American uh universities uh in particular but from uh within American society you have uh earlier this month a federal judge Jeffrey Crawford ordering uh the release of Columbia University graduate Palestinian activist Mosan Madawi from uh prison in Vermont he was picked up by masked hooded ICE agents at his naturalization interview in Vermont he was beyond holding a green card um the judge writing in his ruling quote &quot;Our nation's seen times like this before especially during the Red Scare and Palmer raids of 1919 1920 and during the McCarthy period of the 1950s and I I wanted to take it beyond that um you note that you know that we're not just talking about individual professors anymore we're talking about current attacks being much broader and you write that um this interesting paradox quote despite higher education's much larger footprint within American society today the academy is in a much weaker position to resist political intervention why is it weaker it's weaker for two reasons one because the state is stronger the state does much more in with regard to higher education than it did in the 1950s you know it supports most important basic scientific research it regulates things on campus with regard to uh shall we say diversity equity and inclusion uh with trying to uh ensure that all Americans have a good shot at higher education that was a push by the federal government so you can see that uh the government is much more involved it funds student loans most uh smaller universities without huge endowments rely on students who have to get federal loans in order to pay tuitions so what he's doing by withdrawing federal money from higher education is essentially threatening to destroy American higher education today i wanted to turn to the clip of Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaking in March following the arrest of the Colombia graduate student now graduated graduate student albeit he was in jail in Louisiana when he got his diploma at Colombia mahm Khalil if you tell us when you apply hi I'm trying to get into the United States on a student visa i am a big supporter of Hamas a murderous barbaric group that kidnaps children that rapes teenage girls that takes hostages that allows them to die in captivity that returns bo more bodies than live hostages if you tell us that you are in favor of a group like this and if you tell us when you apply for your visa and by the way I intend to come to your country as a student and rile up all kinds of anti-Jewish student anti-Semitic activities I intend to shut down your universities if you told us all these things when you applied for a visa we would deny your visa i hope we would if you actually end up doing that once you're in this country on such a visa we will revoke it and if you end up having a green card not citizenship but a green card as a result of that visa while you're here in those activities we're going to kick you out of course uh the Trump administration not proven any of this um and a number of students have been released from prison with very angry judges talking about where are the grounds for these people to be imprisoned mahmood Khalil has been now imprisoned for three months as his little baby was born um here in New York uh if you can talk about what this leads to these kind of harsh attacks when it comes to speech and when it comes to universities you were just addressing the deans at Columbia University some compare Harvard not uh fighting Harvard fighting back against the Trump administration and Colombia conceding and the pressure it's put on its students yeah um this has been a constant in the history of American higher education to collaborate with political repression uh they universities do not fight back they didn't fight back during the McCarthy period they're not were not fighting back until of this miracle it really was a miracle totally unexpected of the president at Harvard saying no I cannot uh go along with what you were asking and what they were asked the Jewish president right Alan Garber who um President Trump has accusing of anti-semitism well of course we're all anti-semites as long as we feel that maybe you shouldn't be killing babies in uh Gaza every day but uh what we're seeing is the beginning of a push back against uh what Trump is doing what his entire apparatus of hoodlams I think is trying to do to the universities and that wonderful quote you had from Secretary of State Rubio when he said you know paraphrasing these supposed terrorists that they wanted to shut down the universities he's doing more to shut down the universities than probably anybody else in America at this moment threatening to revoke the visas of all international students what about the role of your organization the AAUP the American Association of University Professors we are a group that is over a hundred years old and when we were founded it was a period very much like today where outsiders politicians and especially very wealthy business people uh on boards of trustees were interfering with what faculty members were saying and doing with regard to at that point there was a lot of labor unrest and attempts to create unions and university professors were sort of saying well look at the working conditions under which uh American workers are are uh being uh oppressed uh let's do something about industrial accidents and things like that uh today we're seeing uh that uh in every way uh the federal government state legislators interfering with the academic work of university professors and that is what my organization is trying to do is to protect the integrity and the educational value of what goes on on American campuses do you hold out hope in this last minute we have together uh yes because unfortunately we have no model we can follow from McCarthyism because there was no push back but today we're seeing people marching to commencement at Harvard uh wearing labels saying you know enough is enough President Trump we're seeing uh huge crowds showing up to welcome uh Mosen coming back from uh Vermont after having been picked up by ICE we're seeing a growing movement within civil society that has to be maintained and has to be maintained for years i mean the damage that the Trump administration is doing is absolutely beyond the pale and has never never been equaled in American life with regard to higher education so we've got to get out there in the trenches and even begin to think some more about okay if they're not paying attention to the judges if the Supreme Court folds and let us pray that it does not um what do we have to do we're going to have to leave it there ellen Shreker author of Many Are the Crimes: McCarthyism in America No Ivory Tower MacArthurism and the Universities also the author of The Right to Learn: Resisting the Right-wing Attack on Academic Freedom we'll link to your piece in the Nation headlined Worse Than McCarthyism Universities in the Age of Trump as well as Galani Cobb's piece in the New Yorker that extensively quotes you Ellen Shreker at democracynow.org democracy Now is funded by viewers like you please give today at

capacity we go now to Nasser Hospital in Kyunas where we're joined by Dr victoria Rose a British senior plastic and reconstructive surgeon with the National Health Service she's been on three medical missions to Gaza since October 2023 we're talking to her on the day um this week um after it's been announced by Britain that they're going to pause trade talks uh with Israel given what is happening in Gaza right now dr victoria Rose tell us what's happening there what are you finding so um we arrived about uh just well we arrived on the 13th of May and we've been at working at NASA hospital in Carunis since the 15th um as you said it's it's um it's not my first trip so there's some comparisons here but the the main thing that's different really is the state of the population i mean it's it's it's very clear that we're dealing with a completely different patient population now these people haven't had any food in since the 2nd of March they are malnourished the children are particularly taking the brunt of this they are all a lot shorter than they than their uh western counterparts that's that's always been a problem from their chronic mal malnutrition but they are very very thin we are having a lot of problems with wound healing because obviously if you're not getting enough nutrients and vitamins your cells are not turning over in a timely fashion and you can't heal your wounds on top of that we are having dire problems with infection this is related to the malnutrition but also related to the situation that the people are in they are living in tents it's dirty we're running out of clean water israel have stopped the vaccination programs it's the worst it's ever been and Dr rose if you could say you know what kinds of injuries are you seeing most often and particularly on children so they're all blast and bomb injuries and there's a couple of well there's two types of wounds that you see from a a bomb going off or an explosion the first is a burn from the heat of the explosion and we're seeing some huge burns 40 50% burns in children the sort of burns that are very rarely survivable in the UK uh when we have all of our intens intensive care colleagues around us and specialist hospitals we still have problems supporting children with this size burn in the UK so you can imagine what that burn is like over here the other injuries that we're seeing are due to the penetration of the missiles so what happens in a blast is whatever is around you either the local masonry or a car or whatever was blown up with you is ejected at a very high speed and it hits the civilians like a missile this will either penetrate the head chest or abdomen and if it does that you're unlikely to survive if it penetrates a limb you're likely to survive and you'll be brought to the hospital what we're seeing is traumatic amputations of hands fingers feet toes legs arms and what isn't amputated is severely destructed so we are trying to piece together bones patch missing bits of skin nerves are damaged really really severe injuries so Dr rose you're describing these severe injuries uh on a large number of children but you're also working with very little medicine if you could uh you know explain how you're doing this uh surgical work with access to such little such few anesthetics yeah I mean the main thing that we're we're low on at the moment is antibiotics we ran out of um augmentin or coamoxic which is the most standard antibiotic that we use in these type of injuries and we're down to a very weaker substitute kerizone which which we don't actually use in the UK now and that's our real problem is that we're not giving adequate antibiotics to these people we just don't have them and Dr rose uh you know Nasser Hospital is not far uh from the fighting uh could you talk about your concerns about a possible forced evacuation and if such were to occur where the patients at NASA would go yeah we're checking the um the IDF website which is IDF.IL and if you're in Gaza it picks up your location immediately and they've gritted the entirety of the strip we are basically a grid away from the active fighting so about four streets uh about a K and a half from the evacuation zone we had dire problems on Tuesday when that zone was announced in that quite a lot of my team had to leave me to go and evacuate their families my anthetist today on Tuesday walked 20k with his five and six and eight year old to evacuate them from where they lived in East Carunis into Alawasi which is the humanitarian zone so we had a real problem with staff on Tuesday but our our main issue is we are the last standing hospital in the south of Gaza the European Gaza Hospital was taken on Wednesday of LA uh last week and the only other hospitals around us are field hospitals so there's some good field hospitals there's the UK Med ICRC MSF MSF Belgium there's also the Jordanian and the Q8 hospital but but they are all tents these are all tent hospitals that don't have any ICU capacity and they don't have any generated oxygen the only standing hospital around us is the Palestinian uh Red Cross Society but that's part tense and that again doesn't have an ICU and it can't generate its own oxygen so if NASA closes we have a huge issue on our hands because we have a adult ICU and a pediatric ICU and we have nowhere to send these patients anyone here at the moment that's dependent on oxygen is also at risk if NASA closes hundreds of patients will die let me ask you Dr rose if news of what's happening in the outside world is coming to you in a moment we're going to talk to the former labor leader of Britain Jeremy Corbin but the fact that Israel's staunchest allies um well UK your own country where um the prime minister Stormer has said that the suffering of the innocent children being bombed again is utterly intolerable and we're going to speak with an EU representative where the European Union is also um putting pressure on Israel does that make a difference and what are you ultimately calling for it has made a difference it does feel like finally our voices are being heard but it is a shame that it comes so late and I think we need a little bit more action than what we're seeing really what we need is an end to this enforced blockade as I said we haven't had any aid or any food in since the 2nd of March and the nine trucks that came in yesterday are still parked in Israeli territory in Gaza and the Palestinian trucks have not been allowed to pick them up so it's it's really dire i think we need to put the politics aside here it's a humanitarian crisis and Israel has got to open the borders to let food in to let medical aid in and to let aid workers in and then you need to let us work safely i want to thank you Dr victoria Rose for being with us british senior plastic and reconstructive surgeon with the National Health Service has been on three medical missions to Gaza since October 2023 my final question is your colleagues and yourself why do you put yourself in this incredibly dangerous situation where hundreds of health workers doctors nurses have been killed have been imprisoned it's it's difficult to understand unless you come here and see the difference that you make we always worry when we come here that we might not be of any use that we might get all our kit confiscated that we might not have a hospital to go to but what we always say is the main thing is to come here to bear witness because you're not seeing what I'm seeing because there's been a complete block to all media so I'm here number one to bear witness number two I'm here to stand with my colleagues and these are people that I worked with before this war started and every time I come they are so pleased to see me and they need a break and I'm an extra pair of hands and it makes a huge difference and thirdly it's one case at a time but I'm definitely making a difference and I know we've saved some lives

e la mia squadra eravamo Cecchini ho prestato servizio in tutta la Cis Giordania anche nel Libano meridionale e a Gaza e dopo il servizio militare ho deciso di rompere il mio silenzio e di unirmi all'organizzazione Sil di cui sono membro attivo dal 2011 Negli ultimi 12 anni ho combattuto contro l'occupazione israeliana siamo in CIS Giordania a sud di hebron e nadav ci guida tra le colline e i villaggi palestinesi gli chiediamo Le ragioni della sua scelta dopo aver terminato l'addestramento siamo stati mandati nel campo profughi di genin per fare un'operazione dovevamo trasformare una casa privata palestinese in una postazione militare per i Cecchini ogni casa in Ces Giordania e a gasa ha un numero e i servizi segreti sanno che ci abita solo se tutti i membri della famiglia non hanno precedenti ci daranno l'ok a quel punto Ass saltiamo la casa tiriamo fuori tutti i membri della famiglia dai loro letti poi lì si butta in una stanza e da quel momento la loro casa è diventata la mia mi ricordo di essere entrato nella prima stanza e di aver preso il primo palestinese dal letto quando aperto gli occhi era terrorizzato perché avevo la mimetica sul M1 sua sua faccia era un bambino aveva al massimo 11 anni poi ci hanno detto Ok bravi ora avete davvero finito l'addestramento quello è stato il momento della mia vita in cui ho capito che noi ci addestriamo sui palestinesi e ho capito cosa è veramente l'occupazione militare la cortina di fumo che chiamiamo sicurezza non serve alla sicurezza di Israele questo è sicuro tante colonie presenti in Giordania sono questi insediamenti israeliani in blu ci spiega che le colonie sono state strategicamente costruite per spezzare la continuità della terra dei palestinesi e separare così un villaggio dall'altro Guarda là quella è una delle strade bloccate Questa era l'entrata principale per andare alla città diatta vedi il blocco che ha messo l'esercito Questa è una strada che AV pagato con Soi dei contribuenti perché è stata costruita dall'ue poi arriva l'esercito israeliano e la blocca proprio come gli insediamenti e gli avamposti non autorizzati qui questi avamposti vengono sempre costruiti come satelliti di insediamenti esistenti perché hanno bisogno di attingere all'acqua o all'elettricità se Guardate qui al limite della linea degli alberi vedete le case Laggiù e i pali dell'Elettricità quello è un avamposto non autorizzato che è stato costruito durante il covid quindi l'avamposto di oggi diventa una colonia domani Sì esatto una delle prime cose che il nuovo governo ha fatto un anno fa appena insediato è stata quella di condonare nove avamposti non autorizzati e trasformarli in insediamenti legali arriviamo al villaggio di hirb zanuta questa è una delle comunità che è fuggita dalla violenza dei coloni dopo l'ultimo attacco violento I pastori se ne sono andati hanno distrutto e dato fuoco a tutto una delle cose che hanno bruciato è la [Musica] scuola la scuola era finanziata dalla comunità europea Civil Protection e aiuti umanitari Sì con i soldi dei vostri contribuenti hirb zanuta un villaggio che ospitava circa 200 pastori è completamente deserto alcuni sono tornati a vedere cosa resta delle loro case distrutte dai coloni nella speranza di poter ritornare insieme a loro troviamo un gruppo di attivisti ebrei che li accompagna per sicurezza ci spiegano che l'amministrazione e la polizia sono arrivate e hanno detto gli abitanti del Villaggio che se vogliono tornare non potranno costruire nulla né rimettere i tetti sopra le loro case cercano di legalizzare questo esproprio i coloni lo hanno fatto illegalmente con la violenza e ora l'amministrazione è un colono si è trasferito qui 3 anni fa ha cominciato ad aggredirci veniva Soprattutto di notte e noi abbiamo donne nel villaggio e i nostri bambini piccoli la peggiore aggressione è avvenuta a mezzanotte il colono ha spaccato le finestre ha terrorizzato i nostri bambini piccoli ha fatto di tutto ci ha minacciato armato ci ha picchiati abbiamo resistito per un mese Poi non ce l'abbiamo fatta più siamo scappati siamo via dove andare tutt'ora siamo in terre che non sono nostre non abbiamo né il gregge né acqua non abbiamo una scuola per i figli è tutto difficilissimo voglio tornare in ogni caso anche se i coloni ci aggrediscono Anche se dovessi morire sarebbe comunque meglio morire qui ho vissuto qui tutta la mia vita Mio padre ha vissuto qui per 70 anni e anche mio nonno ha vissuto in questo villaggio La storia di Amin è la storia di tan dall'inizio del 2023 i coloni hanno commesso più di 2410 attacchi contro cittadini palestinesi le loro proprietà le loro terre secondo una ricerca di herem navot una Ong che monitora L'attività dei coloni solo nell'ultimo anno circa 110 km qu della CIS Giordania sono stati annessi dai coloni ai loro avamposti illegali negli ultimi 5 anni hanno di fatto preso il controllo del 10% della terra dei palestinesi [Musica] andiamo nel villaggio di attui a parlare con Basel ladra che ha 27 anni e da sempre vive lì come tutta la sua famiglia troviamo anche giovani attivisti ebrei e internazionali che dormono nelle comunità di pastori Sperando che la loro presenza possa offrire un po' di protezione dagli attacchi dei coloni Io sono nato qui e vivo qui anche la mia famiglia è originaria di qui siamo sotto il piano controllo delle forze di occupazione israeliane viviamo sotto un regime militare regole militari leggi militari hanno costruito questi tre insediamenti e poi altri cinque avamposti dal 2000 nel frattempo hanno ampliato i loro edifici e lo stato ha agevolato la costruzione di strade case elettricità acqua e fattorie Invece noi qualsiasi cosa vogliamo costruire nell'Area C dobbiamo chiedere il permesso all'esercito israeliano e il 99% di questi permessi viene respinto la politica è quella di svuotare la terra dai palestinesi e di annet di rubare questa terra sono cresciuto vedendo i coloni indossare i passamontagna e attaccarci il 12 ottobre uno dei coloni ha colpito mio cugino al petto poi ha fatto un passo indietro e gli ha sparato alla mano e allo stomaco una follia è stato terribile queste immagini testimoniano l'aggressione dei coloni Alino di Basel [Musica] Fatemi fare un video di questo cartello si legge tornare a Gaza costruire insediamenti a gasa è un annuncio che i coloni hanno messo dopo il 7 ottobre dicono tornare a Gaza solo un insediamento porterà sicurezza Il che è assurdo perché avevamo scelto di andarcene perché non portavano sicurezza i soldati morivano ogni giorno ogni settimana per proteggere i coloni e anche i coloni morivano è una follia Israele vuole espandersi su tutta la Palestina storica dal Mediterraneo alla valle del Giordano molti dei coloni sono stati inseriti nell'esercito c'è un'unità speciale di coloni che si chiama Desert Frontier prendono questi coloni violenti quelli che noi chiamiamo i giovani delle colline e gli danno uniformi e armi e per ogni piccolo villaggio che costringono ad abbandonare si prendono anche centinaia e centinaia di ettari di terra che appartenevano a quel villaggio falper è un antropologo israelo americano fondatore del comitato israeliano contro le demolizioni delle case palestinesi e nominato al Nobel per la pace nel 2006 gli chiediamo ma se le colonie secondo il diritto internazionale sono illegali come fa Israele a difenderle Israele già Dal 1967 dice che non c'è occupazione che non c'è nessuno a cui deve restituire il territorio occupato perché secondo Israele un'occupazione c'è Quando un paese sovrano conquista il territorio di un altro paese sovrano quindi non c'è mai stato un paese sovrano in CIS Giordania e a Gaza prima dell'occupazione israeliana e i palestinesi non sono nemmeno considerati una parte con cui discutere perché non hanno mai avuto uno stato biden ha detto che quando la guerra di Gaza si fermerà gli Stati Uniti e l'Europa chiederanno una soluzione a due stati Ma gli Stati Uniti e l'Europa non daranno indietro ai palestinesi la cisgiordania occupata e permetteranno a Israele di mantenere le colonie di conservare la terra e spingeranno i palestinesi in piccole enclave ecco è qualcosa del genere si vede che Israele è presente sull' 85% del paese e i palestinesi sono bloccati in una 2 3 4 enclave Quindi quello che Israele sta faccendo qui nell'Area C della Ces Giordania è una pulizia etnica in preparazione al fatto che nei prossimi 23 4 o 5 mesi verrà Imposta la soluzione dei due stati quindi mentre tutti a gaz Ecco cosa sta succedendo in CIS jordania tante piccole isole palestinesi non collegate sono confinati in queste piccole aree perché ci sono 600 posti di blocco tra tutte queste isolette percorriamo la strada che da ramalla porta genin e Attraversiamo la Cis Giordania costellata da bandiere israeliane lungo il percorso ci sono decine di posti di blocco con soldati israeliani armati partendo al mattino non si sa se si riuscirà ad arrivare alla sera percorrere un tratto che richiederebbe meno di 2 ore di auto l'esercito israeliano può decidere di bloccare le strade anche senza un pericolo imminente e impedire qualunque movimento arriviamo a genin di notte è il primo giorno dell'inizio dell'operazione di terra a Gaza dalla finestra sentiamo il richiamo ad una manifestazione spontanea c'è tanta tensione e rabbia vi dico chi di voi torna a casa disobbedisce a Dio e al suo profeta e diventa complice dell'assassinio dei suoi fratelli a Gaza E chi vuole restare qui alzi la [Musica] mano il giorno dopo la manifestazione resta un presidio permanente di tende in mezzo alla strada in solidarietà a Gaza cerchiamo l'uomo che incitava la folla Noi siamo civili disarmati Ma grazie a Dio abbiamo a genin dei giovani armati in grado di fermare gli israeliani che hanno già paura di genin così come sono impauriti dalla resistenza a Gaza noi di genin appoggiamo i combattenti e la popolazione di Gaza la situazione a Gaza non è molto diversa dalla nostra anche se loro sono sotto assedio a genin non siamo liberi per niente in tutta la Cis Giordania non ci possiamo spostare ma bisogna entrare nello storico campo profughi di genin creato per accogliere i palestinesi cacciati dalle loro terre nel 48 per vedere i segni della guerra nel fronte della CIS Giordania Il campo è densamente popolato e qui tutte le case sono coperte di segni di proiettili quasi ogni due giorni l'esercito israeliano conduce raide entrando con carri armati e Bulldozer negli ultimi Bam aerei con droni Quando è entrato l'esercito di occupazione sono arrivati Bulldozer hanno distrutto la strada l'esercito era davanti alla porta di casa i missili hanno iniziato a colpire e quindi siamo dovuti uscire dalla finestra bombardavano da terra o dal cielo No dal cielo come in guerra vedi Queste Scritte sul muro Qui hanno scritto anche il nome del loro squadrone e Qui hanno sparato fanno come a Gaza bombardano luoghi residenziali e zone piene di gente a Gaza lo fanno per spostarli dal nord al sud e dal sud Al Sinai Ma noi qui siamo nati e qui moriremo a distanza di qualche via dal campo profughi principale luogo di guerra ci sono i quartieri residenziali della città di genin qui al termine di una notte di incurs il 28 novembre 2023 sono stati uccisi due bambini di 15 e 8 anni l'uccisione è stata ripresa dalle telecamere di sorveglianza dei negozi della via come ci racconta il cugino che giocava con loro mi chiamo Ashraf algul ho 13 anni Questo è mio cugino aveva 8 anni lo hanno ucciso le forze di occupazione A sangue freddo mentre stava giocando intorno a casa sua questo è Basel Abu al wafa aveva 15 anni anche lui di questo quartiere i soldati hanno sparato da dentro la jeep Una pallottola ha colpito alla testa Adam e mentre il mi altro cugino lo ha provato ad aiutare gli hanno sparato contro e qui è stato ucciso Basel io ero qui con Basel dietro di lui e quando ho visto i Jeep militari gli ho detto di tornare indietro ero in piedi lì e quando il soldato mi ha sparato mi sono nascosto dietro quelle scale di metallo lì mi sono nascosto così e mi sparavano contro il piede che era rimasto fuori l'esercito israeliano Ha dichiarato che i bambini stavano lanciando un oggetto sospetto Per questo hanno sparato nonostante fossero protetti da veicoli militari Come si vede nelle immagini quando scendono per fotografare il cadavere del bambino dal 7 ottobre ad oggi sono stati uccisi solo in CIS Giordania 372 palestinesi il 20% di questi è minorenne un'intera generazione di ragazzi sta perdendo la vita non solo in zone molto violente come genino o hebron ma anche a Gerusalemme dal 7 ottobre ai giovani palestinesi è impedito l'accesso alla moschea di alaxa il venerdì giorno di preghiera sono frequenti gli scontri con la polizia in tutta la città Gerusalemme est quartiere di siluan vicino alla città vecchia durante uno di questi scontri due giovani palestinesi vengono uccisi Abdel rahman faray 18 anni e Ali abbasi 24 anni il piano sopra casa mia è stato occupato da una famiglia di coloni che non fa altro che provocare Sono loro questi coloni responsabili dell'uccisione di mio fratello hanno impedito ai soccorritori di arrivare ed è morto di c'ero ambulanze una di ebrei ed una di palestinesi li hanno minacciati con le armi da fuoco e gli hanno impedito di avvicinarsi a mio fratello ferito e al suo amico Abdel rahman Questi non hanno un briciolo di umanità Guarda come l'hanno trascinato dalle gambe indifferenti al fatto che Sanguin e la sua testa rimbalzava sui gradini era armato No il fratello di al porta sul luogo della morte abdulrahman è stato colpito all testa in sette parti del corpo e mio fratello era con lui l'esercito li ha inseguiti e ha aperto la porta da questa parte e gli hanno sparato da questa posizione in modo molto intenso poi hanno sparato anche a mio fratello mentre cercava di aiutare l'amico e hanno sparato di nuovo Anche al corpo di abdulrahman a mio fratello hanno sparato in questo posto qui e lo hanno lasciato sanguinare per un'ora e mezza come vediamo questo è il sangue dei due corpi anche dopo 14 giorni si vedono ancora i resti del sangue venite da me a vedere il sangue il sangue scorreva da qui io sono la vicina vivo qui lo stava interrogando poliziotto ha preso la sua carta d'identità e l'hanno assassinato Ho sentito la sua voce mentre lo interrogavano lui era cosciente ed era vivo ma l'hanno tenuto per du ore io ho assistito a tutto questo con i miei figli che lo conoscevano bene Ha paura di vivere in questo quartiere La mia bambina ha molta paura Io ho molta paura i miei figli hanno molta paura ci sono sempre scontri sempre bombe a gas e ho detto a mio marito che non resterò in questo quartiere" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Congresswoman, welcome back here. Let's start with the Republican spending bill. You called it BS. You called it a cruel bill as well too. It's going to eliminate Medicaid health insurance for 130,000 constituents of jurors, SNAP benefits or food stamps for another 115,000. You spent the week hearing from constituents. What kind of questions do they have about this? This is the first time you've talked to them, I presume since it passed. Yeah, yeah. You know, I think that it's always important that we go home and we talk to the people that are going to be impacted and find out what it is that they know and find out what it is that concerns them the most. The number one question I had is do people understand why this bill is bad and why there is nothing beautiful in it? And I can tell you the Texas 30, God bless them because they listen to real news and they absolutely understand that these cuts are devastating and there is. No good reason for the cuts, so that's #1. #2, um, you know, I think that the Republican Party has tried to run away from Elon Musk for sure, but Elon Musk still looms and so there were definitely still questions about the things that Doge did because honestly now we're talking about cuts to SNAP now we're talking about cuts to Medicaid and so. People are trying to kind of figure out what was this Doge what's happening, what is Doge doing and so I had to actually go through and explain that Doge really was supposed to be advisory that is all it ever was supposed to do. I had to go ahead and reassert that it is Congress that has the power of the purse and that Congress should have been listening to recommendations and then making a final decision. But ultimately Doge was going in and doing all kinds of random stuff, things that we still don't know the full extent of what it is that -- they've done -- without at all without Congress and your constituents were asking about this. They were, they were asking about Elon, which Elon is synonymous for Doge, um, and then, you know, they were concerned about their Social Security, so they said, are the Social Security cuts in this as well? and I said no, but I did explain to them that they are trying to choke off resources. in a lot of different ways so while it may not be on the balance sheet when you start to shut down Social Security offices when you start to get rid of the personnel, you end up in this bottleneck where people cannot access the resources that they need and so this is a better way of saying oh this is just inefficient government instead of saying that we directly targeted Social Security it's a more indirect targeting that they are doing on things such as Social Security as well as Veterans Affairs. Republican spending bill also it it increases property tax deductions, uh, which is helpful to Texas. Uh, it also eliminates taxes from tips and overtime that that's a benefit for your constituents as well, isn't it? Yeah, you can say that not really. I mean, here's the reality. There are so many of our workers that work on tips that literally are not making ends meet to the extent that they even are required to pay a hefty portion as it relates to income taxes in the first place. That's number one. Number 2, if you were talking about an impact that was somewhat proportional, then yeah, maybe I would agree with you but if you're going to get rid of tax on tips, a lot of people that work on tips don't necessarily even have health care, right? And so now it's like, well you know what? I do need those extra dollars that I'm gonna have in my pocket because guess what? The cost of my healthcare is going up. Guess what the cost of all the goods around me are going up because of the horrible or some would say horrific. Tariff policies that have been implemented like it's not really giving you anything because we're taking more away from you than we're giving you so it's just a gimmick so that hopefully they can build upon um a group of people that is beyond just the billionaires they need to bring somebody else in to believe that this bill is going to help them as well. What do you expect the bill to look like though when it leaves this. You think it'll it'll resemble what the House passed? No, I don't. I think that so here's, here's the deal. When you look at House members, our districts are approximately 766,000 people, and depending on your district, you may not have one hospital in it, but when you start talking about say the Senate side, especially some of our senators that are coming from these big, very rural states. They understand a lot better than somebody who say I'm gonna vote this way because I don't want to be on Trump's bad side versus that senator who says you know what this means we're gonna have less hospitals. I'm gonna have X amount of hospitals in my state that are going to shut down because of a lack of resources or it's the senators that understand that more people in rural America use SNAP benefits than urban America and they're saying listen. These people aren't gonna be able to eat, but more importantly because I'm from this big rural state, my farmers, they're not going to be able to survive either because just because you remove 30 $30 billion from the ecosystem which is the amount that they pulled out for Snap it doesn't mean that that money comes back in. So if you're that farmer that is trying to anticipate and plant. You know what, now there's gonna be this money that's out it doesn't just reappear because we removed it from the federal government so now you're talking about the farmers that are gonna struggle so I think that the senators because their constituency is an entire state and they have to deal with all the issues I know that the Senate is gonna give us something different now how different and where those differences will lie. -- We'll only find out in time -- and there's a deadline for this. I mean they can't mess with it all summer, right? Well, uh the, the speaker when he was making his argument during the wee hours of the morning, uh, to get this stupid bill passed, um, he was saying that the Senate had until July 4th, so I don't know that feels like an internal deadline that they put on themselves, um. But even saying that there really was an error in my opinion as it relates to the calculation of the speaker. Now the speaker on one hand may have said, you know what, I gotta work throughout the night hopefully some of the Democrats will be asleep and will miss the vote or something. I've got to do this when everybody else is asleep so hopefully America will not know. Um, how bad this bill is and we can do this in in the middle of the night, but it may have just been, you know what, let me get this passed so that I can say I got it out the house and I can get a. Good boy from the president, right? Like I think it could have been that mind you this bill passed with one vote with one vote is all it passed with and we've lost 3 members of Congress since I've sworn in just this cycle and one of them we lost just this week, so literally losing 3 members of Congress, them all being on the Democratic side, and we're talking about a bill that passed by 1 vote. At the same time allowing all of this time to kind of sit around and allowing people to start digging through this bill. I think that that's one of the reasons, one of the many reasons that the Senate is going to be obligated or at least gonna feel obligated to turn out a better bill. Yeah, people will take it apart you're interested in taking the Democrat's top spot on the House Oversight Committee, the, the, the main, uh, uh investigative committee there in the house. Why do you want that position? I. I don't know how bad I want it, but I absolutely think that my team needs me. I think that this is where the country needs me and where the caucus needs me to be in this moment if we didn't have such a lawless administration then I wouldn't be running because the truth. Tradition within the house is that it's kind of a seniority thing whoever's kind of been there longest that's who should end up kind of rising to the ranks but in this scenario my experience with being a trial lawyer as I'm the only trial lawyer that's actually in this race, I know how to put a case together. Um, and I know how to defend the case as well, and that is gonna be really important because I need to make the case to the American people that not only is Trump a problem, but each and every one of these House Republicans that has decided to go along to get along, they are a problem as well they are complicit in all of the. Harm that is now being inflicted on the American people so you know once we get to the majority, which I'm hoping and praying we get to, um, next cycle that allows me to start to open up and do the things that would look like an impeachment now whether or not we would put it to a vote, you know, he's been impeached twice, couldn't get convicted. There's a lot of things to consider about whether or not to go forward, but one of the things that we saw that they did very effectively last cycle is that they decided that they were gonna put Joe Biden into the trial of public opinion, and they went after his son Hunter Biden and they were saying because Hunter was having issues that Joe must have issues and so what they were doing is they were tearing down Joe Biden as. Well as the Democrats at the same time and so I think that there's something to be said for us digging in when there's real things to look at such as this $400 million plane from the Qataris and whether or not that's a violation of the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution. I think that we need to dig into all this crypto nonsense that he's got going on. I think we need to dig into the fact that it looks like he's given. Out pardons for play. You give me money. I will give you, your friends, your whoever you want a pardon like these things are the things that we typically consider to be ethical issues at a very minimum and at a very high corruption and so you know I'll tell you that if everybody in this race, Donald Trump doesn't call their names if there's one person that he probably does not want on the other side of him. It is me going after him and digging in and making sure that the American people understand why he has a problem and you know maybe we can even get some Republicans on our side to recognize that this is really bad and the public, Democrats, Republicans or independents don't believe that he is fit or qualified to be our president. Let's say you were elected to ranking member and the Democrats take the house and you become chair of that committee, would you pursue impeachment? I would absolutely at least do an inquiry absolutely I mean I I think that there's more than enough to inquire about, you know, we know well we don't know we still don't even know I brought up Elon Musk a little bit earlier we don't understand what all they were doing, what kind of deals were even made for Elon to be given this amount of privilege, the firing of the inspectors generals, you know, he went in next thing you know. generals that were investigating Elon, they're getting fired and then the pressure that he's put on various organizations we saw that the merger with Verizon was able to take place only once they said no diversity, equity or inclusion we know that they have um put a ridiculous amount of pressure and seemingly are trying to pull back resources from the likes of Harvard because Harvard decided that they were gonna put. Back against his illegality we know that he's shaken down so many of these law firms for free legal fees because he's gonna need them because the one thing that we know is that he likes to violate the law whether it's criminal or civil so these things need to be fleshed out and we need to fully understand and and and in fact this that's the Trump stuff and the reason I bring up the Trump stuff is because there is one committee. In the Congress that has the authority to actually do oversight over the president it's the oversight committee. It is the only one that has that ability and so I think that we need to make sure that we do it. I think that no matter what happens, history needs to know the truth. Two last questions here. You said recently it's time for Republicans to start talking more about President Trump's mental acuity and. Obviously they did that when when President Biden was in office. why do you think that uh they should do that now? Well, listen, and, and I'll tell you, I mean, I'll go down defending Joe. I can't tell you that I've ever had um an incident where I questioned Joe Biden's mental acuity and definitely had no questions about the people that he surrounded himself with that's for sure. Now when you are at a West Point graduation. And you spend time talking about trophy wives when you spend time talking about how you've been investigated um to the likes of Al Capone, when you like spend your time like literally in a very serious um. Um, solemn moment that should be one of solemnness but also of celebration for people that have decided that they are going to commit themselves and some of them may even end up losing their lives in service of our freedoms in this country and this is what you decide to do while wearing a MAGA hat like I I just. I, I don't know how you can look at that. I don't know how you can look at and maybe he's just illiterate because you know there also was the issue with him reading a teleprompter recently and he could not say the words that were on the teleprompter as it relates to crypto so I'm like I, I just think that we really, really, really need to wonder this is the guy that would go off about sharks and whales and windmills and all the thing I mean seriously, if it was me. As as just a member of Congress, I, I wouldn't be anywhere near being a US representative so how he's become the president of the United States is still beyond me and how he continues to operate in this very. Ridiculous fashion. I mean, all you gotta do is read the script, sir, just read and I know that stuff isn't on the script, right? And he can't even do that. Yeah, he, he does, uh, freelance quite a bit on on his scripts or on his speeches. um, last thing here for you, your name is showing up on polling for 2028. Do you have aspirations to lead your party or run for a national office? No. -- What do you make of that then your name showing up on this -- polling. Um, I think that people just have found a way to connect with me, and I think you know there was a point in which people in the party, well within parties, not within our specific party felt like oh she's black and she's proud so only black people will listen to her and then it's like, well, well wait a minute maybe just liberals will listen to her and now it's become clear as I have been out. In various cities throughout this country where I've had Republicans walk up to me and tell me how much they like me, tell me that they are you serious? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, you, you'd be surprised. Oh yeah, but considering all that, you wouldn't have aspirations, uh, you know, going to 2026, looking forward, looking at something bigger. 2026? Yeah, well, I mean going into going into 2026, you know, as as people start looking at, you know, who's gonna run for 2028. Yeah, no, I wanna do what I can to hopefully make sure that we win so I'm a team player, so just like I was. Win the majority back in Congress but also win the presidency going into 2028 um as you know, I traveled the country on behalf of Kamala Harris and ultimately wherever we get with the nominee I wanna support in any way that I can um so I'm gonna do my part but you know what I don't know that politics is really. My place it is, it's a different life, you know you and I have known each other for some time and so you know that I did criminal defense work and I worked with true blue criminals and never had to worry about death threats and waking up and having to deal with death threats, having to think about, you know, where I go, how much security I have on me because of all the hateful rhetoric that is is circling and a lot of it is viewed directly from the president of the United States himself. I just don't know that that's really uh a life that I want to live for an extended amount of time, but I can tell you that I am so honored to have an opportunity to serve in the role that I serve in and uh I will continue to serve so long as the people of Texas 30 give me this opportunity. Congresswoman, thank you. Great to see you again. Good to see you too." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="you're watching the legal breakdown glenn we have some breaking news here as it relates to contempt charges for members of the Trump administration can you explain what just happened in court yeah Brian the Trump administration in the Abrego Garcia case moves closer and closer to contempt of court every day but we're not there yet so here's what's happened um because the judge um has a sense that the Trump administration has not been complying with the order to facilitate the release of Abrego Garcia and treat his case as it should have been treated had he not been unlawfully and unconstitutionally deported she ordered discovery in other words she told Abrego Garcia's legal team &quot;You can get documents and depositions and your questions answered under oath by government officials by Trump administration officials who are involved in this ugly unconstitutional deportation.&quot; So we can see whether one they're complying with my orders and they're doing anything to facilitate his release and two whether they have already defied her court orders Judge Cen's court orders such that she should initiate formal contempt proceedings so what she did was she ordered discovery she said I'm ordering the Trump administration to sit for depositions that is answering questions under oath i am ordering them to produce the documents that Abrego Garcia's legal team requests of them and she ordered other discovery so now what's happened we can glean from this sanctions motion is that the Trump administration is essentially saying um yeah we're not complying with those discovery orders so here's what we know we know that Abrego Garcia's lawyers just filed a motion requesting permission to seek sanctions against the Trump administration for failing to comply with discovery orders now what we don't know is any more than that because the motion the substantive motion with the facts and the information um is under seal but here's what we do know judge Cenis granted the motion for Abrego Garcia's legal team to seek sanctions the reason that tells us quite a bit is because think about it lawyers can't just file sanctions motions willy-nilly because it would make the other side look bad if in fact the other side wasn't doing anything wrong wasn't violating any court orders so you need to seek permission and you need to make a showing that your opponent is violating court orders before you are permitted to file that sanctions motion and the judge just gave them permission to file the sanctions motion she ordered that it be filed on June 11th and then the Trump administration will have to respond so because they're moving forward with with uh contempt proceedings given that the Trump administration seems unlikely to comply does that mean they've given up on trying to get the administration to facilitate the release of Kilimar Bgo Garcia absolutely not they're not giving up they're saying &quot;Judge you need to start bringing the hammer down for their failure to comply with the discovery.&quot; In other words providing the evidence we need so we can figure out what if anything they're doing to facilitate his release and what the court should directly order them to do concretely because Brian one thing that we've railed against all along is you know hey why don't you go ahead and facilitate the release of somebody what the hell does that mean you need to be more definitive you need to draw a line in the judicial sand and say for example I'm hereby ordering the Trump administration to secure the release of Abrego Garcia by I'll pick an arbitrary date June 15 and return him to the United States by June 17 that would be an order that is clear concrete definitive and if the Trump administration violates it now we are into formal contempt proceedings with sanctions that can include imprisoning Trump administration officials for defying court orders but because this sort of why don't you go ahead and facilitate something is just not clearly enough to find that's why we have been spinning our wheels it's all going to come to a head eventually unfortunately it has not come to a head yet well look I I sympathize with the legal team for Garcia because it's been how long since the Supreme Court ruled unanimously against the Trump administration and it got kicked back into Judge Cen's courtroom what are we doing here how has this not been been adjudicated sooner than this i mean I feel like for weeks we have been sitting here it started off where we were supposed to see daily updates at 5:00 every day and like it's been a month this has completely fallen off the the zeitgeist here and and it and it's not just bad enough unto itself in the fact that um that this case in particular isn't being resolved but it also just in a broad sense emboldens the Trump administration to know that they just don't have to comply with the courts because eventually the courts aren't really going to show much teeth yeah and what I will say is the courts typically move at a glacial pace now urgency is certainly of the moment with Abrego Garcia who even the Trump administration admitted it wrongfully deported to El Salvador and you know arranged to have him imprisoned in El Salvador on the US taxpayers dime i mean you can't make this kind of crap up so yes urgency is of the moment but what I experienced in my 30 years as a federal prosecutor Brian even in urgent situations getting the courts to move forward you know at light speed was you know it took a herculean effort so I'm not going to say that Judge Scene should not be moving more quickly um setting shorter deadlines i'm not going to say that i'm saying that it seems like she's trying to keep on top of this you know as best she can and keep everything moving forward that is very you know small consolation cold comfort for Abrego Garcia and his family but you know this is where we are in the process a sanctions motion has been filed people might want to know okay what do sanctions look like what that was literally literally going to be my next question is just for posterity here can you explain what sanctions even mean in the context of this case yeah so ultimately sanctions are not contempt right we're we're on our way we're on the road to contempt and we're going to get there but sanctions are kind of an intram step so for example if the Trump administration says &quot;Yeah you know what we're not sitting for depositions we're not answering interrogatories a fancy word for having to answer written questions under oath and we're not producing documents like the judge ordered us to do.&quot; Well then the judge can order the payment of expenses to Abrego Garcia's lawyers they can she can order attorneys fees be paid to Abrego Garcia's lawyers she can preclude the government the Trump administration from using any evidence that might be helpful to them in future hearings and ultimately a judge can order what's called the default judgment if one party says &quot;Guess what i'm not participating in discovery i'm not complying with court orders a judge can say &quot;Oh guess what then you lose case closed.&quot; Now all of those things feel like they are of limited utility in the context of the Abrego Garcia case because you know we're trying to have returned to the United States somebody who should never have been unconstitutionally deported in the first place so attorney's fees and expenses and default judgment ending the case doesn't really accomplish the goal here but mind you this sanctions motion is kind of a run-of-the-mill motion under the federal rules of civil procedure rule 37 for anybody scoring at home and usually it's when there is ongoing litigation there's an active case between two litigants that is headed toward a trial that's where sanctions can be really impactful um here less so but you know the judge I think is trying to do whatever she can do to move the Trump administration forward to comply with her orders but you know let's all you know keep an eye out for the coming contempt proceedings because they're coming now to that exact point uh the Trump administration knows that they want to defy all of these court rulings and they know that the one recourse that the courts have here is to impose uh both sanctions and to engage in these contempt proceedings which is why they inserted in this Republican budget bill a provision that would strip the courts of their ability to um engage in these contempt proceedings so can you explain uh explain that provision and what it would mean in terms of the courts actually being able to enforce their rulings moving forward brian I'm going to make a prediction at my own peril that proposal that part of the the pending bill is dead it will be killed either in the Senate or if it makes it it is so blatantly unconstitutional as a violation of the separation of powers you can't tell the court you're not allowed to enforce your own damn court orders because if you do that you're bringing an end to the co-equal branch status that the judiciary enjoys so ultimately that will be struck down by courts i don't happen to think it will remain in the final bill i could certainly be wrong about that but um yeah that is just absolute nonsense that they have that provision in the bill yeah but Brian in the horrific event that passed it would mean the courts could continue to function the courts could continue to issue court orders with a view towards sort of the orderly administration of cases civil and criminal but if litigants including the federal government decided to disobey blow off the court orders there would be no enforcement mechanism now it also is tied to the litigant having to post a bond in the amount that might represent the damage done if the judge is wrong about issuing an injunction i don't want to turn this into a a civil or criminal procedure class but basically it would be neutering the court and the court's ability to actually function effectively it would be like well the court is really there for show because if we defy their orders there's not a damn thing they can do about it right you know more broadly though what does it say that this administration is looking for other ways not to just comply with the court's rulings not to respect the the autonomy of a co-equal branch of government but trying to figure out ways to strip other branches of government other co-equal branches of their of government of their authority to enforce um to enforce their own power dictators gonna dictate that's what they do donald Trump is grasping for all of the dictatorial power he can possibly get and then hope that the courts will rule in his favor you know Brian I'm almost beginning to feel like in the Abrego Garcia case they are goating the judge Judge Senesis into holding contempt proceedings and finding that the Trump administration and its officials are in contempt because maybe they want to then bubble that up through the appellet court to the Supreme Court and then they will take their cues from whether the Supreme Court says &quot;Yeah this kind contempt proceeding is not only appropriate but it's lawful constitutional and necessary or maybe they strike down the contempt proceeding and what does that do well that emboldens Donald Trump to be even more lawless more the tyrant more the autocrat that he has such an appetite to become so that may be actually part of DOJ's dirty strategy here well look we will of course stay on top of this issue especially as it relates to the prospect of sanctions or beyond that contempt charges against this administration so for those who are watching if you'd like to follow along please make sure to subscribe the links to both of our channels are right here on the screen it's the best way to support our work and independent media more broadly i'm Brian Tyler Cohen and I'm Glenn Kersner you're watching the Legal Breakdown" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="https://www.raiplay.it/programmi/pres... - Per risolvere la crisi dell'automotive, il Governo italiano vorrebbe aprire il mercato delle auto ad altri produttori. L'Ad di Stellantis Carlos Tavares chiede investimenti e incentivi dal Governo per continuare a mantenere la produzione in Italia. Ma il settore intanto langue. Da anni, Torino non è più la capitale dell'automobile. Fabbricati abbandonati, aziende chiuse, la città un tempo &quot;stalingrado d'Italia&quot; ha perso il suo primato. Nel 2023 a Mirafiori sono state prodotte appena 80 mila auto. La crisi produttiva non colpisce solo gli addetti diretti dell'impianto, ma anche le aziende dell'indotto. A Grugliasco lo stabilimento Maserati, fiore all'occhiello del rilancio Marchionne, è un fabbricato abbandonato. A pagare di più sono i lavoratori, come gli operai del gruppo Lear che oggi sono in presidio permanente in attesa di sapere quale sarà il loro futuro. Le cose non vanno bene nemmeno negli altri stabilimenti del gruppo. A Pomigliano i lavoratori devono fare i conti con la decisione del gruppo Stellantis di produrre la nuova Panda in Serbia per contenere i costi." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Musica] è stata una stagione fitta di incontri quella del ministro delle imprese e del made in Italy Adolfo Urso obiettivo convincere stellantis l'unico grande produttore di automobili rimasto in Italia ad utilizzare al massimo gli stabilimenti ereditati da Fiat Pomigliano Mirafiori Melfi Atessa oggi dalle nostre fabriche eso l'anno il ministro Urso ne ha promess il doppio Si insedia finalmente per la prima volta un tavolo per l'auto italiana con l'obiettivo di raggiungere con stellantis almeno un milione di veicoli prodotti nel nostro [Musica] paese l'obiettivo dei volumi dire ma dire un milione di di auto in Italia significa raddoppiare le produzioni che in un arco temporale è complicato farlo senza la partenza di nuovi modelli non c'è l'obiettivo di un milione di veicoli per i sindacati La promessa fatta dal ministro Urso di un milione di autovetture Non è credibile A meno che in Italia non entri un altro produttore di auto il 28 febbraio in un'audizione alla camera il ministro Urso Ha dichiarato che sta lavorando proio solo con una seconda case automobilistica potremmo raggiungere l'obiettivo complessivo di 1300.000 veicoli abbiamo pertanto avviato da tempo interlocuzioni con produttori di vari paesi non soltanto orientali ma anche occidentali sull'apertura del mercato italiano a nuovi produttori di auto laad di stellantis Carlos Tavares aveva già risposto duramente qualche settimana prima se il governo vuole portare un altro produttore lo faccia siamo pronti a lottare ma bisogna pensare anche alle conseguenze vedremo se sarà stata una decisione positiva per l'Italia c'è quindi un braccio di ferro tra governo e stellantis con l'Italia che accusa l'azienda di produrre più in Francia che da noi e stellantis che per aumentare la produzione in Italia chiede investimenti pubblici nelle infrastrutture incentivi all'acquisto di auto elettriche e forti sconti sul costo dell'energia fino al 40% in meno Ladies and Gentlemen here it is Fiat [Musica] [Applauso] [Musica] Topolino Qui siamo a Torino a Lingotto è il 4 luglio del 2023 e stellantis presenta ai media e alla stampa specializzata i suoi due nuovi modelli del marchio FIAT la Topolino e la 600 elettrica non saranno prodotti in Italia però ma in Marocco e Polonia La verità è che per ora mancano i nuovi modelli da produrre negli stabilimenti italiani ad oggi gli unici investimenti di stellantis su Mirafiori sono il Battery Technology Center dove si collaudano le batterie e l'ab per l'economia circolare per il riciclo dei componenti oggi Torino non è più la capitale italiana dell'automotive questo è la parte dello stabilimento storico costruito negli anni 20 da qua entrava il senatore Giovanni Agnelli Qua invece c'è la centrale elettrica questo è anche un mostro che genera energia per tutto il Fabbricone mentre invece Qua ci sono aree praticamente vuote tutte vuote Queste sono vuote Poi più avanti c'è la meccanica dove sono vuote perché Eh inutilizzate non c'è più non c'è più niente non c'è più niente anche da questa parte questa vuoto quello sì sì sì tutto vuoto [Musica] a Mirafiori i volumi nello stabilimento si sono ridotti nel 2023 La produzione si è attestata intorno alle 880.000 unità dove la parte del leone la fa la 500 elettrica mentre Maserati nel giro di pochi anni è passata da 55.000 unità a poco più di 8.000 Il calo della produzione ha comportato la chiusura progressiva di aziende della filiera di stellantis Eddie Lazzi segretario generale della Fiom CG di Torino ci porta nella zona ovest della città un tempo veniva definita la Stalingrado d'Italia perché una zona piena di fabbriche piena di lavoratori di lavoratrici purtroppo di quella Stalingrado non è rimasto praticamente più nulla fra un po' passeremo vicino a una storica azienda che è la Pininfarina Addirittura C'è via Pin in farina qui e questa è chiusa in questo momento è chiusa è totalmente chiusa totalmente chiusa a fianco alla Pinin farina adesso lo vediamo c'era un'azienda che si chiamava itka che era un super fornitore di componenti per la Fiat lavoravano 700 persone non c'è più nessuno qui si facevano le scocche della Maserati e adesso boh fine c'è più niente ma queste erano tutte aziende che lavoravano nell'indotto della Fiat la stragrande maggioranza poco fuori Torino a Grugliasco andiamo a vedere gli stabilimenti di Maserati il fiore all'occhiello del polo del lusso tanto voluto da Marchionne Quello su cui si sarebbe dovuta basare La rinascita di Fiat Chrysler a Torino e che oggi è in queste condizioni c'è ancora una macchina c'è una macchina dentro Cì è la quattro porte La Maserati qu porte è rimasta qua dentro Eh sì quella lì è penso che sia forse il primo modello che avevano fatto Tant'è vero che ci dovrebbero essere anche le firme degli operai sì che è successo ma è successo che hanno deciso che era uno stabilimento di troppo hanno trasferito le poche produzioni rimaste a Mirafiori tutti i lavoratori a Mirafiori quanta gente lavorava qui dentro siamo arrivati anche a 25500 abbiamo visto chiudere centinaia di imprese ne abbiamo quantificate 370 solo nel settore metalmeccanico persone che hanno perso il posto di lavoro e che ancora oggi stanno faccendo la cassa integrazione sembra che il film non si fermi questo film dell'orrore sembra non fermarsi mai lo stabilimento Maserati è stato messo in vendita da stellantis su immobiliare.it come fosse un edificio siasi e non uno degli insediamenti industriali tra i più importanti dell'automotive italiana qui Siamo davanti alla Lear in questa fabbrica si producono i sedili per le Maserati il calo dei volumi ha messo l'azienda in crisi e i 300 lavoratori ora rischiano di finire per strada Sono in presidio permanente davanti ai cancelli in attesa di sapere quale sarà il loro futuro Avrei preferito passare le mie giornate in un altro modo magari lavorando e invece siamo qui cercando di salvare il nostro posto di lavoro quanto state lavorando in questo momento adesso nulla siamo fuori è una conseguenza di quello che sta faccendo stellantis qua a Torino eh cioè che sta facendo stellantis Eh beh Ormai sta Pando fuori portando il lavoro fuori a fine anno vanno fuori produzione alcune Maserati endotermiche e quindi si riducono ancora notevolmente i volumi e su 420 dipendenti c'è un esubero strutturale che supera le 300 persone quindi uno stabilimento che ha diciamo così una vita segnata se in questa città non si producono nuove auto Eppure una volta alla Lear la situazione era diversa non trovavi parcheggio qualche anno fa per venire a lavorare dovevi partire più di un'ora prima perché non c'era Non c'era il posto di mettere la macchina e adesso in deserto io è 32 anni e mezzo che lavoro per questa azienda ho 57 anni e se perdo questo lavoro non so se potrò mai ricollocami altra parte ma io dico Chi governa non si rende conto che sta morendo tutto Non si rendono conto che fine stiamo facendo il lavoro va nei Paesi poveri in Polonia non possiamo competere con questa gente allora o si fa qualcosa davvero chi sta a governare senò Qua davvero diventa una catastrofe c'era forse la possibilità per la Lear di salvarsi se si fosse aggiudicata un'altra commessa ma l'affare è andato alla martur azienda turca che ha aperto a poche centinaia di metri dalla Lear e prende i sedili della 500 elettrica che si fanno a Mirafiori che avrebbe potuto prendere la Liar perché li prende perché fa un prezzo inferiore Abbassa i costi Abbassa i costi e quindi prende la commessa andiamo davanti ai cancelli di Mirafiori dove gli operai di stellantis hanno organizzato un volantinaggio in solida operai della Lear perché tutto parte da qui da stellantis se stellantis non produce auto Lear non produce i sedili Proma non produce le ossature e via così abbiamo bisogno di altri modelli per poter andare avanti per poter sopravvivere Credo che solo la 500 non basti e nell'hub dell'economia circolare progetto inaugurato a fine dicembre 2023 da stellantis e su cui sono stati messi a lavorare operai Cosa si fa tanto per cominciare si tratta di recuperare pezzi parti mobili dei vari veicoli non marcianti poi c'è il ripristino invece di veicoli marcianti con pochi chilometri che viene data una tagliando una rimessa a posto è rimesso in vendita Comunque non è proprio la tua mansione no no no no no io quando lavoravo in per Maserati montavo le plance sei il più giovane tu in questo momento tu quanti anni hai Sì sì Io ho 50 anni e c'è tutta gente che S appresta ad arrivare alla pensione chi gli manca 2 anni chi tre a me piacerebbe girarmi e vedere dietro di me che ci sia un Giovan di 26 25 28 anni che insomma che subentra giusto per avere lungimiranza vuol dire che c'è un progetto invece che c'è accanto a te non c'è nessuno ci sono io e se mi giro dietro non c'è più nessuno alcuni stabilimenti producono più cassa integrazione Che auto Mirafiori è al 14o anno di cassa integrazione è una cosa che grida allo scandalo il lavoro non manca solo per gli operai ma anche per gli impiegati a cu stellanti Soffre un esodo volontario in cambio di soldi Ciao Fabio Di Gioia ci mostra una mail che ha ricevuto dall'azienda sei interessato al programma Costruisci il tuo futuro di seguito trovi una stima dell'importo globale che ti sarebbe riconosciuto €1 6.41 lordi vuol dire che l'azienda sta dicendo Noi ti aiutiamo economicamente per uscire avessero investito gli stessi soldi che stanno investendo per F andar via le persone probabilmente facevamo uno o due modelli nuovi nel frattempo Carlos Tavares ha chiesto alle aziende della componentistica di esternalizzare la produzione in paesi extraeuropei per poter contenere i costi e continuare quindi a rifornirsi da loro la tecnologia elettrica costa il 40% di più di quella termica i nostri fornitori dovranno ridurre i prezzi del 40% per contribuire anche loro alla riduzione Tavares è considerato un grande risparmiatore dal punto di vista industriale è un grande razionalizzato per capirci Quindi lui risparmia su tutto dalle imprese di pulizia agli spazi che occupano tutte le volte che stellantis ha preso un impianto in Europa l'ha ristretto l'ha compattato ha ridotto gli SP cioè risparmiano sul riscaldamento sugli affitti e si figuri se non risparmi sui fornitori ci sono molti fornitori preoccupati perché hanno ricevuto pressioni Dal produttore stellantis per avere un socio in un paese low cost e per collocare almeno l'80 del fatturato fuori dall'Europa Preferibilmente in India e in Asia se io devo fornire stellantis con queste condizioni faccio fatica a tenere aperti impianti in Italia e occupazione io non vedo nulla di strano nel richiedere costi di componenti più bassi è una richiesta di mercato noi dobbiamo rispondere a questa richiesta di mercato innovando sviluppando cercando di offrire dei prodotti che siano complessivamente allineati a quelle che sono le richieste del cliente in termini di [Musica] costi Edoardo pavesio è il presidente della Sila azienda che produce sistemi di cambio a sei fabbriche nel mondo e stellantis le garantisce circa il 50% del fatturato diav hanno messo in allarme tutta la filiera italiana dei fornitori Anch'io sono preoccupato di questa affermazione perché comunque c'è una spinta sulla riduzione dei costi e quindi questo vuol dire ridurre marginalità e quindi anche capacità di investimento che ne consegue però bisogna dare una reazione a questo ci sono degli standard qualitativi nel settore automotiv che non possono essere derogati quindi Sotto quel livello non si può non si può scendere È ovvio che non posso dire che deve essere tutto fatto in Italia la scommessa di pavesio quindi è mantenere Ric in Italia e far valere la qualità del nostro prodotto nella speranza che una parte della produzione rimanga qui ma c'è anche chi ha deciso di seguire il cliente in giro per il mondo Noi siamo presenti in Italia in Francia in Ungheria in Romania in Repubblica Ceca e in Brasile Cioè quindi praticamente dove il settore dell'automotive si è spostata negli anni si è spostato nel tempo esatto Quindi se i nostri clienti si sono spostati nei paesi dell'Est in Sud America ci siamo attrezzati per seguirli Ma ci siamo posti il problema di che cosa fare in Italia in Italia sviluppano un prodotto innovativo per raffreddare i grandi container dell lng il gas propano liquefatto e con questa produzione tengono aperto lo stabilimento italiano il mondo era cambiato e quindi la subfornitura industriale per un mercato locale perdeva di senso quindi riduzione dei fatturati riduzione dei margini e poca possibilità di crescita in alcuni casi c'è la necessità di seguire il mercato nei suoi processi e questo è un fatto ineluttabile lasciamo Torino per spostarci allo stabilimento stellantis di Pomigliano 4.150 addetti e una produzione di 215.000 veicoli Qui si fanno l'Alfa Romeo Tonale la Dodge Hornet Ma soprattutto si produce la panda che ha venduto nel 2023 oltre 100.000 unità è grazie a questi numeri che dal primo gennaio a Pomigliano si è raggiunta la piena occupazione però a dicembre 2023 durante un incontro tra la presidente del consiglio meloni e il presidente serbo vucic arriva l'annuncio che stellantis produrrà la Panda elettrica in Serbia siamo molto felici perché stellantis ha deciso di venire a produrre la Panda elettrica in Serbia sono particolarmente grato a Giorgia c'è già molta Italia in Serbia molte aziende italiane che qui investono che contribuiscono più o meno co cca 50.000 laori ma si può fare di più andiamo ai cancelli di Pomigliano per sapere cosa ne pensano gli operai la domanda te la lancio a te il futuro di pomiano è questo e questi messaggi che lancia la Panda elettrica la facciamo in Serbia prospettive solo con la Tonale Cioè basta per 4200 opai qua non basta la Tonale siamo in una fase in cui ci chiedono di lavorare tantissimo sabato domenica ci sono turni massacranti in questa azienda in questo momento ma magari già fra 6 mesi 7 mesi ci ritroveremo di nuovo con con gli ammortizzatori sociali per l'ennesima volta Mario Di Costanzo segretario della Fiom CGL di Napoli nella sede di Pomigliano ci dice subito Quanto è importante la Panda per questo stabilimento su 100 lavoratori 70 vengono impiegati su Panda e 30 vengono impiegati sul Tonale quindi questo ti dà la fotografia reale del fatto che la vera occupazione la crea la Panda c'è un annuncio e noi lo dobbiamo solo prendere e leggere quell'annuncio cioè la Panda elettrica verrà prodotta in Serbia punto uno schiaffo ai lavoratori due schiaffi ai lavoratori perché l'impegno che i lavoratori hanno profuso per realizzare il progetto Marchionne oggi non lo vedono ripagato si ritrovano invece a dover competere con degli stabilimenti in cui tu non puoi competere per perché se tu vai a paragonare il costo del lavoro in Serbia il costo del lavoro in Italia è evidente che lì non c'è competizione perdiamo" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="in June 1989 something incredible and extremely memorable happened in Iran but it barely made news headlines in the west because it happened on the same day as the tianan Square massacre in Beijing but once you see this event you're never going to forget it on the 6th of June 1989 a helicopter was approaching the paradise of Zara Cemetery in the southern suburbs of the Iranian capital Iran on board was the body of the supreme leader of Iran two Iranian people this day is the day of great sadness we have lost a great leader and we are all mourning for such a great man an estimated 10 million Iranians in Black Funeral dress clamored to catch a glimpse of the body of their supreme leader Ayatollah rahah Ki his supporters gathered like tiny insult covering every stretch of ground as far as the eye could see several people were crushed to death in the hysterical crowd which was standing outside in 40° heat the helicopter seemed safer than going by road but then it landed almost on top of the crowd the mobs swamped the helicopter after touchdown hysterical mourners pulled the coffin from the helicopter and began parading it around the site the crowd was in a frenzy the body fell out of the coffin in the melee the body of the spiritual leader of Iran was mauled and appeared to drop to the ground the burial shroud he was wrapped in was torn off and came apart as mourners tried to grab bits of it for themselves in the chaos some people fell into the empty grave officials fired warning shots to get the crowd to move back they stuffed the body back into the helicopter and announced that the burial was cancelled the helicopter took off with people hanging onto the bottom of it and trying to pull the supreme leader back out as the helicopter flew away the body was partially hanging out the door many hours later the helicopter returned the funeral casket was enveloped by soldiers but finally Ayatollah heni was found his resting place to stop people digging up the body the guards used a crane to build a pyramid of shipping containers on top of the grave thousands kissed the containers some passed their children up to the guards so they could kiss the containers closer to the center of the pyramid it was one of the largest Gatherings of human beings in history and probably the most chaotic funeral ever caught on film his son ammed says Ayatollah H is on his way to heaven it's been a rough trip so far this funeral was for a man who had led his country for just 10 years not long for an Iranian leader 10 years in which hundreds of thousands of of young Iranian men had been killed in a war 10 years which had seen a 60% drop in GDP per person 10 years which had seen Iran become a global Pariah virtually friendless in the International Community and yet Millions were hysterically grieving his death mourners beat their heads in distress distraught to see the last glimpse of the man considered almost to be a prophet such is the power of a revolutionary leader or more specifically a revolutionary idea this is our third episode about the history of the escalating conflict between the US and Iran you can go back if you want to hear more but today the story of raahi and how his revolutionary idea changed the course of Middle Eastern history and is still affecting us today I'm Matt bevon and this is if you're listening 1960s Iran was a place that was changing very quickly thanks to the policies of the Sha Iran's King of Kings he has tried to reshape Iran virtually overnight into a modern industrial capitalist State while at the same time preserving the unquestioned authority of the ancient Persian kings the Sha a man installed by the British and kept in power by a CIA Le coup in 1953 was rapidly westernizing his country with American help even so most Iranians were devout followers of a subset of Islam called TWA shiism more than 90% of Iran's population of 35 million belong to the shate branch of Islam they believe that the 12th Iman a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad has been in hiding for 1200 years waiting to return at the end of time and create an Islamic caliphate on Earth for 1200 years most twers believed they should just sit tight wait for the 12th Imam to return and follow the five pillars of Islam that all Muslims learn as children to be a good Muslim you have to believe in Allah and believe that Muhammad was the last prophet and you have to fast in the Ramadan and then you have to pray five times a day and you have to give charity to the poor and um you have to go to Haj in to Mecca so sit back follow the pillars of Islam enjoy a modern westernized Iran and wait for the imam's return but a man named rahah H had other ideas Hai was a religious leader a teacher and a scholar who had gained a big enough following to be given the title of grand Ayatollah by 1964 he was well known across Iran as the instigator of a number of big political protests Iran sheras and the holy city of K were the scenes of the most violent disturbances Street B battling in which 20 were killed and hundreds injured you see heri had a very big very revolutionary idea what if instead of just following the five pillars of Islam and waiting for the imam's return to create the new caliphate we just start creating the caliphate now prioritize political activism even over the traditional Five Pillars don't separate church and state Let the church run the state by the rules set out in the Coran Islam is not only a religion but a total system derived from the Quran and the traditions of the prophet in the Quran a clear guidelines for every aspect of personal social and political life westernizing the country was not his idea of how to build a caliphate the shate leaders known as the mullers believe that the Sha's great plan for a modern western style Nation built on the oil wealth is not only a waste of time but it's also morally wrong the protests continued the Sha sent in in the Army Ki was arrested briefly jailed and then put under house arrest Ayatollah Ki has become a symbol of political opposition in a nation where political opposition has for many years been brutally suppressed now the Prime Minister Hassan Ali manur who was in charge of running the government for the Sha called Ki in to ask him politely to stop he asked to stay out of politics and go back to being like every other cleric focus on the Five Pillars wait for the 12th imam's return hum refused repeatedly the Prime Minister flew into a fit of rage shouting and yelling and finally he marched Up To Hai and smacked him across the face Hai was taken to the Tyran airport and put on a plane to Turkey he had been exiled 2 months later the Prime Minister was assassinated by supporters of Ki don't slap a guy with hundreds of thousands of fanatical followers now the old saying of out of sight out of mind really doesn't apply to revolutionaries plenty of revolutions have been orchestrated by people in Exile Vladimir lenon overthrew the Russian Zars in a revolution and did it all from Switzerland in fact it can be an advantage when someone's in your country you have some kind of control over them you can silence them but if they're outside your country it's much harder so ayat Ed as loud as he could from his bases in Turkey Iraq and France the ayat recorded antisha sermons onto cassette tapes which were smuggled into Iran and played in mosques he did interviews with International TV and radio stations which were then broadcast into Iran in his surprisingly calm tone of voice he railed against the Shar of Iran the king of Saudi Arabia the dictator of Iraq and of course the Zionist state of Israel as we discussed in the last episode the Sha thought that he had a special connection with his people and that just about everyone loved him Thea has conceded that perhaps 1% of the people might oppose him turns out it was a little bit more than that some recent reports have labeled the Sha's opponents as conservative religious Fanatics others have described them as revolutionary extremists the Sha himself has called them Islamic marxists Communists revolutionaries religious conservatives throw in workers students business owners their ultimate aims may be dissimilar but for the moment they have won catch cry the Sha must go but they all agreed they wanted the Sha gone when the demonstrators sh death to the Sha their next cry is usually Long Live Ki in October 1977 K's oldest son Mustafa died in an Iraqi jail humi blamed the death on the savak secret police saying that that they had murdered his son now the Sha has a military government a seriously disrupted economy and a nation at the brink of Revolution Memorial services to Mustafa Ki turned into deadly protests the Iranian Revolution had begun with soldiers firing indiscriminately into crowds of demonstrators leaving hundreds dead and many more wounded it was really only a matter of time before the Sha was forced out the priests have armed the mobs pistols and petrol bombs are the new symbols of power in Iran in February 1979 the Sha fled and a plane arrived in tyan carrying the country's new leader home from 16 years in Exile the holiest of men the Ayatollah Ki The Alliance of Democrats Communists and clerics who got together to oppose the Sha disintegrated and the clerics took charge now K and the Quran rule where once the Sha claimed to be United with his people Iran's 500y old monarchy was Swept Away in favor of a theocracy under the eye of the clerics a unique hybrid constitutional model was created the country would have regular elections a parliament and a president like most democracies around the world but a top that would sit a supreme leader an Islamic cleric who gets to decide who can run for office which of the government's policies can be implemented and how to use the country's resources under Islam oil like all natural resources is god-given and God controlled the supreme leader is appointed for Life by a council of clerics is in charge of the Armed Forces and cannot be disputed the constitution of the new Islamic Republic of Iran was more liberal than many expected women and some religious minorities had far more rights in Iran than they did in Saudi Arabia and other Arab monarchies but despite the appearance of modernity the regime was just as brutal as the Sha Islamic justice as interpreted by Ki will cut off the hands of those who disobey the reported savagery of the secret police has not died with the secret policeman Ki ordered a purge of the top levels of the military justice system and secret police with thousands publicly executed to make way for the new incoming clerical Elite Ki was officially named as the Imam a title previously reserved in Iran for the 12 descendants of Muhammad humi didn't just change the trajectory of Iran's future his vision of Islam had a ripple effect across the Middle East the incredible success of his Revolution triggered copycat actions from people in other countries who wanted to accelerate the rise of a global caliphate an uprising began in Saudi Arabia an American Military Base was bombed in Lebanon the president of Egypt was assassinated and H started encouraging followers living in neighboring Iraq to overthrow the country's dictator now the dictator of Iraq was a cool nice guy with a cool nice mustache who would never ever dare to cause any problems for the West Iraq's president Saddam Hussein Saddam Hussein Saddam Hussein Saddam Hussein it's unclear how much us involvement there was in saddam's decision to invade Iraq but what is clear is that once he did invade the US was all in the Iraqis began the war eagerly and with confidence that they could route an enemy already weaken from the revolution of the ayatollahi and purges within the armed forces the United States government had invested a lot of time and effort in keeping the Sha in power and now the Sha was gone and the Ayatollah had more than 50 American hostages in the US Embassy in tyan they wanted Saddam to topple Ki it was a war in which most outside has predicted a quick Iraqi Victory followed by the destabilization or overthrow of Iran's fundamentalist Islamic regime it backfired spectacularly far from undermining the Iranian Administration the war with Iraq served to strengthen the regime nothing galvanizes a population like an invasion just ask Ukraine Saddam quickly realized that he was fighting an uphill battle and tried to find a way out but humi wouldn't let him Ayatollah Hai declared there was no question of compromise the fighting would go on until the last Iraqi was driven from Iranian soil after 8 years and at least a million deaths heni agreed to end the fighting the Border was unmoved a year later heni was dead and given what may very well be the most extraordinary funeral in history that war is known as the Iran Iraq war but it's not a great name for it it was really just the first phase of a war against followers of K's idea of a global Islamic caliphate being established today rather than at some time in the distant future and extreme islamists have taken up that fight it's not fought in the Iranian mountains it's fought by iran-backed groups like Hamas in Gaza and Israel Hezbollah in Lebanon and the houthis in the waters of the Red Sea the houthi say this latest attack is in response to American British aggression Ayatollah H's Legacy is complex he overthrew the increasingly despotic sha when most thought that was impossible but then he instituted a regime that was just as brutal and corrupt which has been forced to quash multiple uprisings against it from the people it oppresses now Iran is isolated corrupt economically desperate and in a permanent Cold War which is now getting hotter by the day" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="america got hit with a Twitter hurricane and now it's time to assess the damage this is just another day well it was a loud and very entertaining fight but now America finds itself sweeping up the wreckage between these two maybe someone wants to check in on how they're doing president Trump says Elon Musk wants to talk to him but that the president's not particularly interested as their very public feud is playing out huh i'm a little stunned to be honest rather than engage in petty squables Donald Trump has finally learned how to take the high road and not engage is this dare I say it a new tone from the president trump told our John Carl earlier on the phone that Musk has quote lost his mind he's got a problem the poor guy's got a problem the quote from President Trump is this elon has totally lost it there's our guy when the country is looking for a disciplined leader to set an example as to how to handle tense disputes Trump's answer keep looking he is incapable of striking any tone that even remotely resembles consiliatory granted the other guy confided in 220 million of his closest friends that our president might be a pedophile so not exactly swimming in goodwill on that side either but still Trump is not a guy who lets things go no matter what people say people around the president say he seems to be more sad about all of this than angry okay let me ask you a question and I really want you to think about this has anyone ever even once seen Donald Trump express sadness this is a guy who looks pissed off at a wreath laying ceremony if America suddenly witnessed Trump somehow inexplicably cry out of sadness he'd go on Truth Social and post &quot;My emotions were rigged.&quot; Trump doesn't get sad he gets petty we have something that we don't usually have when we join you from the north lawn we have a live picture of the driveway that is in between the White House and the EEOB okay you see right there red Tesla with Florida tags we can report today that this Tesla that President Trump bought for staff to use as part of a South Lawn demo to help Tesla the plan is now for it to be given away or sold wow i'm surprised Trump didn't follow the rest of America and just torch that baby but the parting of possessions is a classic part of any breakup right i mean one day you're using your democratically elected position to lovingly boost the sales of your partner's company by buying one of their cars in a blatantly transparent quid proquo and the next you're wondering what you ever even saw in the guy besides his ability to bankroll your campaign so Trump gets a bunch of Elon stuff Elon gets a bunch of Trump stuff both guys agree that no one wants Eric and that's just the way it's going to be but this is obviously not just about Trump and Elon everyone in the world bore witness to this billionaire brawl which means everyone has an opinion as to what actually happened many see transparency as this and the hallmark of the fact that this is laid bare on the public square is in a stark contrast to the prior administration hallmarked by opacity but also that it's simply sort of dealing out in platforms that they own so that we can see how the sausage is made totally yesterday was essentially a modern-day civics lesson for Americans who are curious about the inner workings of government and also have a light curiosity as to whether their sitting president dabbled in some underground billionaire sex trafficking i mean my god what a horrendous task it must be having to downplay and sanewash every single piece of Trump's completely unprofessional behavior trump lashes out like an unhinged toddler in its an education on transparency kind of like how him grabbing women by the was locker room talk fox News could find dismembered bodies vacuum-sealed in Trump's basement and they'd spin it as organic meal prepping but these are simply pundits trying to interpret the situation it'd be great to hear from someone who actually has a working relationship with the president these are these are two titans um I respect them uh both i'm I'm of course a huge fan and supporter of President Trump i was with him in the Oval Office yesterday afternoon when some of this was unfolding and um he was disappointed i was disappointed yeah I can't think of anything worse than having a ketamine loving billionaire put you on blast as a pedophile but a close second would be having to be in the room when Trump saw that tweet i'm surprised Trump's iPhone is not currently lodged in Mike Johnson's head but what's done is done tweets were sent lines were crossed the big question now is where do we go from here you know I think it is important for us to uh pray you know for peace and the unification of these two guys because as Bill Aman said and you've said yourself the country's in a lot better spot when those two are united yeah that's current member of Congress Eli Crane recommending that Americans pray for a peaceful resolution between two men at war and somehow isn't talking about these two but I got to say when Republicans start wheeling out thoughts and prayers this thing is never getting resolved that is Republican speak for wrap it up folks we're done here this puppy's cooked and sorry to break it to you but there is no amount of thoughts or prayers that's going to heal this relationship as much as I hate to do it let's put aside the spiteful car sales and the accusations of pedophilia because when you take away the specifics you realize that this is nothing new donald Trump does this to literally everyone he will turn on you the moment you lose your usefulness and while everyone may not have a billion-dollar war chest or even an oddly pale literal chest it's always the same routine trump surrounds himself with a parade of graveling sick of fans who refuse to believe that they'll ever have a target on their backs because they're just that drunk on their proximity to power and just like being drunk no one ever considers what's going to happen when the party's over everybody at the bar loves a spur-ofthe- moment trip to trip to Cabo but hours later when the buzz is worn off and you're sitting under those fluorescent lights at the airport terminal eating a $20 tuna sandwich and waiting for your Spirit Airlines flight to board reality starts to set in that maybe this was a bad idea the list of people who have fallen for this routine is embarrassingly long but it is a crystal clear road map for how we got here trump cares about Elon as much as he cared about Ronald McDaniel the former head of the RNC who he openly mocked about his loyal donor and EU ambassador Gordon Sland who he fired about his former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson who he called dumb as a rock about his other secretary of state Mike Pompeo who had his security clearance revoked by Trump about former press secretary Kaye Mciny who he trashed online about his former donor and campaign adviser George Papadopoulos who he threw under the bus and denied really even knowing about Christopher Ray his pick to run the FBI in his first term who he then trashed and forced out to make way for Cash Patel and about his former vice president who he was ready to fit with a noose after Pence refused to certify an election that Donald Trump lost and if this president can discard all of those people if he's willing to throw MAGA loyalists and billion dollar donors under the bus people who at one time had genuine value to him imagine what he'll do to workingclass Americans you think for one single second that Donald Trump cares about the mom of three who needs Medicaid and food stamps to survive that he cares about small businesses that are getting uh thrown under the bus as the result of his liberating trade policies not a chance look not to get all graduation speechy here but if I could impart one lesson to the class of 2025 it would be this your future is bright there's lots of years ahead but if you think Donald Trump gives two shits about you then like Mike Johnson you're gonna want to get your head checked before you go if you

          <attvalue for="7" value="Most of the stuff you buy crosses the world by sea. But shipping containers don't just hold goods. They hold something else, too: power. And China is all in. That’s why they've been investing massively in ports. All over the world. China probably has stakes in a port near you. They're creating a network. And it goes beyond trade. This is a story about promises, sprawling ambition... and a plan to dominate the seas. But let’s start small. Let's go to Kribi in Cameroon. It's a coastal town known for its sandy beaches and fresh fish. Now it's also home to a deepwater sea port built by China just down the coast. This is what the coast by Kribi looked like on satellite images about 20 years ago. Not too much going on. In 2011 a Chinese state-owned construction company started building the port with the help of the Cameroonian government. You can see how quickly it pops up here, along with a highway, that connects Kribi to the rest of the country. China invested over 1 billion dollars to open the port in 2018. The idea, as outlined in this promotional video: to turn Kribi into a key trade hub for all of Central and West Africa. China promised fireworks. And locals say the port has certainly changed things here. And it isn't just Kribi and Cameroon. China's port promise is attractive for governments. They lend you money, you hire a Chinese state-owned construction firm, they quickly build you a port .... and that connects you to global trade. China very efficient in doing so because China has a strong state-owned enterprises. China very efficient, it has hard workers. So that's basically what the Global South will need from China. That’s Wang Yiwei. He’s Director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University of China in Beijing and is a former Chinese diplomat. Also China needs those markets. I think that's a mutual benefit. And in return, China promises not to get involved in your politics no matter what. By the way, China's involvement isn't the same in every port. For example, it can vary from 100 percent ownership to a minority stake. But the pitch has been successful in the Global South. Especially in African countries. Out of around 160 ports that China has stakes in, 53 are on the African continent. Another reason why African countries might be wary of Western investment is – well – the last few hundred years of Western colonialism. China still calls itself a developing country and says it's an equal partner – as opposed to the West. But China's deals with Global South countries still serve China's interests. Like in Kribi. Because as we’ll see, each of these ports is just one small part of a bigger strategy. Enter: The Belt and Road Initiative. By building roads, railways and sea ports, China wants to connect the world in one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects ever conceived. When the Belt and Road Initiative Launched in 2013, it was initially supposed to connect China and Europe – just like China's ancient Silk Road. Now China is tapping into markets in the Global South. So we needed to find a new market for China. And those countries are also very eager to share in the experience of Chinese modernization. Like the Chinese slogan goes, &quot;If you want to get rich, build a road.&quot; Here's the network China has built up. The orange lines are overland routes. The blue lines are maritime routes. In the last few years, China has increasingly expanded the maritime part of the network. And that strategy makes sense: because remember, most traded goods cross the world by sea. These are the main routes they take. And these are some of the world's most vital chokepoints: ships with goods important to world trade need to pass through here to get from one region to another. Now take another look at those ports. They give China pretty crucial access. Which is important for the country as the world's biggest exporter. The real question to my mind has to do with whether or not these infrastructure projects that leave China as the lender, as the builder, as an owner, as an operator accord them undue influence in foreign countries. This is Isaac Kardon. He is a China expert at the US-based Carnegie think tank. His research focuses on China's maritime power. This use of economic coercion against trading partners, the threat or actuality of withholding certain trade and the sort of control over the trading network itself helps give China a bunch of different mechanisms by which it can accomplish that. Meaning: China has gained leverage over many countries. In 2022 China was accused of having used it in the UN human rights council. There was a proposal to talk – just TALK - about Chinese human rights violations against the country's Uyghur Muslim minority in internment camps. Here are the 47 countries in the council at the time. These countries said yes to talking, these countries said no, these abstained. Note that a lot of the African countries in the council voted NO. China has invested in infrastructure projects in some of the countries that voted YES and ALL of the countries that voted NO. The proposal was rejected. Of course, it could have been a coincidence. China's influence has increased, because of lots of investment into those countries. They even learn from China, learn Chinese, you know. Maybe they prefer more like more Chinese model, but that that's their choice. One thing is for sure: China's involvement in ports is cementing a global network - with political allies and trade ties. Now that China has built that trade network, it's anxious to protect it. Let's look at one of those key chokepoints we mentioned before. This narrow strait between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula is called Bab el-Mandeb. The Suez Canal is on the other end of the Red Sea here. Around 12% of world trade usually passes through here. And you guessed it - China has a port here. In the small country of Djibouti. China also has its only official foreign naval base here - right next to the commercial port it has stakes in. China said the reason for opening a base in Djibouti is to secure trade from piracy. And it's not the only country with a military base in Djibouti. Take a look. By the way, the US base is around 13 kilometers from China's base. But we'll get to that rivalry later. So many countries have set up on the strait by Djibouti... ...in part because of attacks like THESE. Most recently Houthi rebels from Yemen have been targeting commercial ships in the Red Sea. Those attacks have been so intense... ... that they changed global trade routes. Many ships are now avoiding the Red Sea altogether. And taking this, much longer route, to get to Europe. Along with Russia, China reportedly even struck a deal with the Houthis to avoid their ships being hit. The UN says disruptions to trade in general are increasing all over the world. A worry especially for the Chinese. The country is not only a big exporter, but also needs to import resources like oil and minerals to keep its economy running. There is a risk to China of the disruption of that network and that would really cause significant problems for their economic model. And political rivalries could also lead to disruption. There is this perception in China that they're vulnerable to US sanctions, to US naval interdiction, to other US efforts alongside allies to essentially cut China out of the global trading system. So it’s no surprise that giant container vessels aren't the only ships from China showing up at these ports now. Meet: the People’s Liberation Army Navy, the PLAN. The navy’s official mission is to &quot;safeguard China's overseas interests.&quot; That includes securing trade. Military doesn't just mean war, rivalry. Military also means providing public goods, securing public goods. In the last few years, China has been massively building up its navy. China can now rival the US in some important military capabilities and already has a larger fleet if you only look at ship numbers. And it's building even more. Plus, there have been rumors about potential new naval bases beyond Djibouti for a while. The most likely spots for them are – you guessed it – some of the overseas ports China is involved in. The US research lab “AidData” found eight ports that they think could become Chinese military bases within the next five years. Remember Kribi in Cameroon? Well, it's on the list. China is the port operator there, the port is deep enough to harbor big warships, ...and China and Cameroon are on good terms politically. And even without ports like Kribi OFFICIALLY becoming naval bases: The People's Liberation Army has made quite extensive use of this network of port facilities. All of the ports and virtually any commercial port is intrinsically a dual-use facility because naval ships need some of the same things that any commercial ship does, in particular fuel and water and food and the ability to rest their crews. And there's more. The US is concerned Chinese involvement in ports could block or limit US commercial – and military – access to them. And that China is using ports to spy. Like here at the Port of Khalifa in the United Arab Emirates. US intelligence said a new planned terminal there was actually a secret military facility. Just to put the US accusations in context: China has one foreign military base, and the US has... well, see for yourself. The bigger the bubble in each country, the more US military bases there are there. In the Chinese case, they're not at that level. They don't have anything resembling the US basing network. But what they have is an interesting alternative. China says it has a different foreign policy, it says it doesn’t intervene in other countries. But the ports certainly expand China’s presence around the world. The existence of this port network and the political relationships and political influence that's associated with it have really created a much more permissive international environment for Chinese military forces to be a kind of regular feature of some of these regional security environments where they didn't used to be present at all. We don’t know how the use of this port network will ultimately play out. The US is watching warily as China expands into what they perceive as their backyard in Latin America. One of the new ports: Chancay in Peru. It will supposedly slash shipping times between South America and Asia. A Chinese shipping company will be the sole operator of the port, which is why US officials have repeatedly voiced concern about the project. But China's port promise remains attractive around the world. As they expand their port network, they are gaining new allies willing to harbor their ambitions. gpersonalcordula_johannis_dw_comEuksdsYyeLlItjLa05mHI3YBtYcj5bcZFoxWmoPcaXQiMg?e=bkAvcR" />

If we look at the focus of these exercises the concept the structure of the deployment of forces the forces themselves their quality the tasks that are formulated for these exercises then this is a fight against a comparable adversary just a little backgrounder here Kosovo broke away from Serbia after a brutal war in the late 1990s a conflict that ended with NATO air strikes against Serbian forces since then it's been under western protection in 2008 Kosovo declared independence from Serbia but not universally accepted serbia which is backed by Russia still considers Kosovo a breakaway province and that unresolved history makes Kosovo's NATO ambition all the more interesting and significant so while the drills may be over the stakes are definitely not they're only rising and Kosovo wants in NATO is divided russia is watching very very closely tragedy struck the city of Bengaluru in India at least 11 people have died many have been injured after a stampede like situation occurred outside the Chiniswami stadium there the Indian Prime Minister has called the incident heartrening scores of Royal Challengers Bengaluru fans gathered outside RCB's home stadium to celebrate their team's maiden IPL title roads in and around the stadium were choked traffic police had earlier cancelled the team's victory parade predicting traffic congestion and to avoid any mishap but the felicitation ceremony at the team's home stadium went ahead and the situation went out of hand remember this event was organized by RCB and Karnataka's cricket association the overwhelming crowd led to a stampedelike situation at multiple entry points forcing the police to intervene with a baton charge charge to control the surging crowds the Karnataka Chief Minister has said around 200,000 to 300,000 people came to the stadium which has a capacity of 35,000 there are small gates the people entered the entered through the gates uh they have broken the gates uh they have broken the gates also so stampede has taken place nobody has expected so much of crowd will come because the capacity of the stadium is only 35,000 people only 35,000 seats are there but two to three lakh people have come to participate in the celebration indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also reacted to the incident he said and I'm quoting &quot;The mishap in Bengaluru is absolutely heart-rending in this tragic hour my thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones i pray that those who are injured have a speedy recovery the BCCI secretary meanwhile has blamed the authorities for clear mismanagement saying and I'm quoting here &quot;When one organizes a victory celebration of this magnitude proper precautions safety and security measures need to be taken there have been some lapses in some corner somewhere due diligence should have been done.&quot;

IT WAS SLIGHTLY EASIER THAN OTHER CASES. &gt;&gt; LONGTIME PROSECUTOR BROCK LUNGSFORD, ONE THOSE IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WHO ORIGINALLY SUPPORTED RESENTENCING FOR THE BROTHERS SAYS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS NOW WORKING IN THEIR FAVOR, THEIR GOOD BEHAVIOR AND LACK OF VIOLENCE BEHIND BARS FOR THE PAST THREE DECADES. &gt;&gt; THEY'VE ALWAYS SAID THEY KILLED THEIR PARENTS AND THEY REHABILITATED AND TRIED TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE AND THAT'S -- THAT'S RARE. &gt;&gt; LUNSFORD NOW SUING NATHAN HOCHMAN ALLEGING HE WAS SIDELINED IN THE D.A.'S OFFICE FOR SUPPORTING ERIC AND LYLE'S BID FOR RELEASE, AN ACCUSATION HOCHMAN DENIES. ONE POTENTIAL HURDLE STILL LEFT FOR THE BROTHER, A RECENT ASSESSMENT FROM THE STATE PAROLE BOARD FINDING A MODERATE RISK OF DANGER TO THE PUBLIC IF THEY ARE RELEASED.

THEY MADE A SUB-HUMAN OUT OF ME. &gt;&gt; DHS ACCUSED KHAN SURI HERE ON A STUDENT VISA OF PROMOTING ANTISEMITISM ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND HAVING CLOSE CONNECTIONS TO A SENIOR ADVISER TO HAMAS WHICH HE DENIES. THE JUDGE RULING HIS FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND DUE PROCESS RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED. THIS AS DHS SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM WAS PRESSED BY DEMOCRATS ABOUT KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA, REMOVED TO AN EL SALVADOR PRISON AND ACCUSED OF BEING A GANG MEMBER WHICH HE DENIES. &gt;&gt; IT MUST -- NOT FIGHT FOR THEM IS EXTREMELY ALARMING. &gt;&gt; I'M FIGHTING FOR DUE PROCESS AND THAT'S UNDER THE CONSTITUTION. &gt;&gt; HE WAS ASKED ABOUT SUSPENDING HABEAS CORPUS WHICH ALLOWS PEOPLE TO CHALLENGE THEIR DETENTION. &gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK IT FALLS UNDER THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUIDELINES THAT I JUST READ TO YOU? &gt;&gt; I'M NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER, BUT I BELIEVE IT DOES. THIS IS THE PRESIDENT'S PREROGATIVE TO PURSUE, AND HE HAS NOT INDICATED TO ME THAT HE WILL OR WILL NOT BE TAKING THAT ACTION. &gt;&gt; WHILE IN ANOTHER HEARING HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR., PRESSED ON THE JUMP IN MEASLES CASES AND HIS VACCINE SKEPTICISM. &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAD A CHILD TODAY WOULD YOU VACCINATE THAT CHILD FOR MEASLES? &gt;&gt; FOR MEASLES? PROBABLY FOR MEASLES. I DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE TAKING ADVICE, MEDICAL ADVICE FROM ME. &gt;&gt; AND IN A SHIFT, FBI FIELD OFFICES HAVE BEEN ORDERED TO SHIFT MORE OFFICERS TO IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT.

THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY IS SUFFERING AND MANY TELL US THEY WANT TO END THEIR INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION. TODAY WE SAT DOWN WITH ALI SHAMKHANI, THE MILITARY POLITICAL AND NUCLEAR ADVISER TO IRAN'S SUPREME LEADER. HE SAID IRAN ALSO WANTS A DEAL. &gt;&gt; YES, WE ARE READY. &gt;&gt; SHAMKHANI IS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE IN IRAN AUTHORIZED TO SPEAK ABOUT THE SENSITIVE NEGOTIATIONS. &gt;&gt; Translator: WE CAN DEFINITELY HAVE BETTER RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. &gt;&gt; SHAMKHANI SAID THAT IRAN IS WILLING TO COMMIT TO NEVER HAVING A NUCLEAR WEAPON, TO GETTING RID OF ITS STOCKPILES OF HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM TO ONLY ENRICHING TO A LEVEL NEEDED FOR CIVILIAN USE AND TO ALLOW INSPECTORS IN TO OVERSEE IT ALL IN EXCHANGE FOR LIFTING ALL SANCTIONS IMMEDIATELY.

          <attvalue for="7" value="Hi there. I'm Caitríona Perry, and this is The Global Story. At the height of the Covid 19 pandemic the working world went through a revolution. Workers, particularly white collar office workers, were ordered to work from home to stop the spread of the virus, and it seemed like a permanent change. Hybrid working has remained incredibly popular years after the Covid lockdowns were lifted. But now more and more companies are ordering employees back to work. And many employers have slammed working from home as inefficient and bad for the bottom line. So is the work from home revolution over now? Joining me from London is the BBC's employment correspondent, Zoe Conway. Hello. And also with me, Nick Bloom, an economist at Stanford University in the US, who has studied the effect that all of this is having on productivity. Hey there. Great to have you both with us today. Now, before we go any further, I just want to establish the status here. Are you working from home or in the office? Nick. You first. I'm actually at home. Although I have to say, for me, it's 8:00 in the morning, so I am going in later. But right now, yes, this is the spare bedroom. But ordinarily you're in the office full time? When I teach. So I teach obviously students because I'm at Stanford. That's definitely in person. Big meetings is in person, but I do spend a couple of days a week on zoom taking calls, working from home. And what about you, Zoe? I'm definitely at the BBC today. I like coming into the office. Actually, I work with a team of incredibly clever, interesting, and funny people, and I like the camaraderie of the office. But I travel around the UK for work quite a lot as well, so I don't really work from home. Okay, so we've established where you both stand on the working from home. I obviously am not working from home. Can't be a presenter and work from home unfortunately, although I did suggest it from time to time during the pandemic. But before the pandemic I was working here in the US and I mean, it was really very rare in this country that you would have encountered anyone really working from home. Nick, are there certain countries or certain industries that have always had this tradition of remote working or working from home? Yeah, so tech has always been pretty work from home friendly. So you can think of if you're on a keyboard using computers, you often don't need to be in the office. You know, it's also actually interesting that a lot of English speaking countries, it's not clear why, but you're right. Northern Europe, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand have been pretty high. We tend to see the lowest levels in Asia. So there are big international differences. So Asia you know typically back in the office pretty much full time, but northern Europe, US, we still see tech, some finance working from home two or three days a week. But of course, everything changed for everyone, didn't it? In the spring of 2020, with the arrival of this thing we'd never heard of before. Covid 19 and the pandemic and how that changed everything at that time. Governments rushing to announce stay at home orders, lockdowns to try and keep everyone away from each other and limit the number of infections. It was a crucial step, we were told at the time, to keep the hospitals from getting overloaded and to get everyone safe, and suddenly employers had to adapt to a situation where their employees could not come into work. So tell us a little bit about that transition. Who was working from home and who wasn't, and what did it all mean for people? It was the most incredible adjustment for so many of us. There were all these forms of technology we'd never used before, whether it's zoom calls or team chats that some of us are still fairly useless at using. certainly in my unit, Everyone still mutes themselves. Everyone seems to be on mute. So it was an incredible adjustment. And I think what we're seeing in many cases in the UK are people who have learnt that they can be very productive at home and that they can juggle it very successfully with, you know, perhaps raising a young family or looking after elderly relatives. And so there's a lot more flexibility that we're seeing. But I think there's still a huge amount of uncertainty here in the UK about whether we're going to see a big switch back. Because as well as having more time with your family and your children. I mean, there are other benefits for people from working from home as well. Financially commuting time. Tell us a bit about those. We went to Bank underground station. Now that is right in the heart of the city in London. It's the sort of place where you're going to see a lot of people very smartly dressed, walking incredibly fast to get to their law firm or their bank where they work. And we went on a Thursday morning and we went again on a Friday morning during rush hour. And there was a big drop in numbers. And the data shows that now on a Friday, if you go to Bank underground station, you'll see that the commuters are roughly at just just over half what they were before the pandemic. So a big drop. Nick, on that point, I mean, individuals might save because they can make their lunch at home. They're not spending on fuel for their cars, train tickets and so on. But what's been the economic impact on businesses from this situation where people are working from home? Well, there's two ways to look at it. Mostly for businesses hybrid, which is when you come in, say two or three days a week and work from home two or three days a week, it's actually pretty profitable, and it's why it's stuck. It's why if you look at the Fortune 500. So these are the largest 500 companies in the world. 80% of them are on hybrid because it makes them a lot of money. And why is that? Well, if you look at the research, if you work from home a couple of days a week, it doesn't really seem to damage productivity. So, yes you need to be in for mentoring, for connectivity, for building culture, for innovating. But by the time you're coming in three days a week, it looks like you kind of have your fill. And the other two days are good for quiet time and for recharging without a commute. So productivity is not affected. What businesses gain is turnovers a lot lower. So in one study we published actually last year in Nature, you see quit rates fall by about a third. And you know you can see why like folks are like 'I really like working from home a couple of days a week. I'm less likely to change jobs.' And for businesses, that saves them an enormous amount of money because every person that quits, you've got to go out. You've got to re-interview, rehire. And has that passion been replicated across the world? This moved from a full time working from home to that hybrid model you're talking about. If you look at Southern Europe and Asia, take Tokyo. There's very little working from home going on. So Tokyo is kind of unchanged. It's a weird world, you know, in 2019, these cities look similar. Suddenly, five years later, you know, six years later, we've now seen a surge of work from home in much of Europe and the US, and pretty much everyone's return to the office in Asia. And so what has that meant for how people might move between jobs if you can potentially be working from home for a company that is no longer based in your town or in a nearby city, as may have been the case in the past when you sought employment adjacent to where you live. I think there has been a shift in terms of the balance of power that when you apply for a job, it has become the norm to ask for flexible working, or certainly more normalized and to expect it. Zoe is exactly right. It's funny talking to recruiters. They said, look, pre-pandemic, if you're recruiting folks, you tell them about the salary and obviously the role, but they're always going to ask about the perks. And, you know, there's the big two, which is pension and is there any kind of health care plan. Now they said, look, it's the big three. Pension, health care plan and work from home. And so yes, it's become a critical part of recruitment. Then normal numbers that I hear from recruiters I see in research is 8%. So folks say look, if I can be hybrid, you know, I'll accept basically 8% less pay to be hybrid versus come in the office five days a week. So you can twist it around and say, if you're a boss and you want your folks in five days a week, you have to pay people basically 8% more. So what are the major negatives that have been reported to you from employers? We went and interviewed the CEO of a record label in East London, and he set up this company himself. It's his baby, and he has a lot of young staff. And it's interesting because he's been allowing his young workers to be at home coming in for two days a week, and he's now asked them to come back in for three days a week. I can't help but have this nagging feeling that sort of continual remote working has affected our bottom line. It's his business, and he feels that it's the kind of industry where people can and should be networking, should be part of this team. Not just in spirit, but but physically together sharing ideas. And I think he also wonders about what effect it's having on the mental health of his young workforce to be at home too much of the time. You know, I firmly believe that the music industry is all about relationships. And so the one single way to really, for any of us to be able to build those kind of meaningful relationships is to do it in person. Perhaps for him, it's a bit of a slight sense of loss of control that he just doesn't quite know what everybody's up to. Which I think he might feel is a bit of a disadvantage. And he found it difficult to just be communicating via, you know, video conferencing. So I think there are some disadvantages that he would say. Do those arguments extend out to the point where the whole economy would benefit from everyone being back at work, what did you find? For an in-depth bit of reporting for the BBC that I've been doing in recent weeks, we spoke to Lord Stuart Rose, and he used to run two of the biggest retailers in the UK, supermarkets called Marks and Spencers and Asda, and he came out very strongly in favour of people coming in for most of the time. People who drive trains have to go to work. People who work in operating theatres have to go to work. People who work in service industries like retail have to go to work and others don't. Well, you know, what's different? They have children, they have problems. They have issues. You deal with it. And what he said to us was that he just thinks it's really bad for productivity in the UK. It's really bad for economic growth in the UK if people are spending too much time working from home. Do you want to jump in there with your stats and research? There's a number of folks who can only work if they're allowed to work from home. So we see in the data that employment of folks with a disability, people looking after young kids, folks close to retirement, has been surging post-pandemic. And this is, you know, hundreds of thousands of millions of people literally, who can work. And if they're working, they're paying taxes, providing goods and services for the rest of us. And that's a win win. So actually, I think these are typically, you know, kind of older in their career CEOs, typically men, if you look in the data who are very against work from home, you know, they're judging on their experience. That might have been right 20 or 30 years ago, but in 2025, it's actually good for the economy. And that's interesting that there are certain jobs that can only be done in the workplace, but there are certain people who can only work if they're at home. And it's sort of setting up a bit of a divide between workers. I mean, just to to broaden it out a little bit. We heard Elon Musk, of course, aide to President Trump and billionaire businessman tell CNBC recently that not only did he think working from home made people less productive. He also thought it was a symbol of class division between white collar and blue collar workers to use those terms. Nick, what do you make of that argument? Well, you know, Musk's views are really problematic. So I'll give you an example. There's someone I was speaking to last week who a couple of years ago, broke their neck in an accident. And so he used to be, you know, pretty senior exec. Poor guy is now basically disabled from the neck down. And he said, look, if I've got to go into work, it takes me about three hours and I was like three hours? He said, yeah, my carer has to get me up, wash me, get me dressed, take me to the car. And then my dad would normally drive me into work. He said if I can work from home, it's about 20 minutes. Now, this is someone that's highly productive. If you force someone like that to come into work every day, he said, to be honest, I'd probably stop working. And so the Musk view of trying to turn it into a crusade to force everyone back to the office is going to lose folks like that. People with young kids, folks close to retirement and is a loss to all of us. You know, if there are more people working and paying taxes, it's less taxes for the rest of us to pay. Nick, why do you think this has become such a politically charged issue? I mean, it's almost a cultural issue here in the US. And obviously, as we've been talking about, it's a huge issue in the UK at the moment now as well. Politics comes into everything eventually. Unfortunately, and politics has come into work from home. It's pretty natural in a sense, because if you look at who can and who can't work from home. So think about who can work from home. They tend to be university educated folks. They tend to be professionals, managers. They're higher earners. You know, they tend to have a certain type of politics. And at the other end, who can't work from home tend to be they're more likely to be frontline service workers. Maybe they left school at 16 or 17. They're lower earning. Certainly in the US. that group tends to vote for Trump. And as a result, if you're Trump or Musk, your vote base is people that can't work from home. And it's appealing to then ban work from home because it appeals to the base. You know, if you can kind of poke in the eye the other half of the population, it's a win for your base. So you tend to see populist parties that tend to appeal to lower income, more kind of frontline service workers, frontline workers. They tend to be against work from home. And if you look at parties that tend to have more university educated people that have office jobs, they tend to be more supportive of work from home. And, you know, sadly, that's nothing about whether it's good or bad. It really just predicts who votes for these politicians and politicians know who their voters are and they appeal to them. And I suppose the other side of things, though really is that some countries are actually taking steps to make remote working part of workers' rights or workers' entitlements. Spain has guaranteed the right to flexible arrangements. Last year, Ireland made a legal right to request to work remotely, and the UK government is including the right to work from home in an upcoming bill. So there are places where working from home, the right, is being protected, aren't there? That's right. In the UK, the Employment Rights Bill is going through Parliament right now. It's due to become law in June. But the critical question is how this is going to be implemented, because there's something that's going to have to be worked out, a code of practice over the next year or so. And that means there's going to be yet more consultation. And there is concern by campaigners who want to see more flexibility, that business is going to lobby government hard and reduce the amount of working from home that's made possible by employers. So I think it's really still up for grabs and the government at the moment is desperate to prove to business that its number one priority is economic growth. So I think it's a bit unclear at the moment exactly how this legislation is going to be implemented, how it's going to work, and whether it is actually going to increase flexibility at work, whether it's really going to lead to an increase in the number of people working from home. Okay, so final question. After all that we have been discussing here, what do you both think the future of work will look like? Will hybrid work be as popular ten years, even five years from now as it is as we're talking today? Nick, what's your final thought on this? So working from home is going to follow a Nike swoosh. So you know it dropped from 2021 - 2022. It fell pretty clearly. It's now in the flat bit. We can see in the data. It's not really changed for the last year and a half. Long run, it's up. So you know 2030 work from home is going to be higher than it is now. Why is that? Three drivers. One is companies have office leases and they last typically 10, 15 years as they expire. Companies think, oh, now's a good time to downsize. And we've been seeing that. Two is younger CEOs, younger firms tend to be more remote. And as current CEOs kind of age out, retire and replaced by younger folks, they're more sympathetic. And finally, actually most importantly is technology. I'm in my 50s. I grew up in the UK in the early 70s, and both my parents worked for the British government, actually. And I remember as a kid, one of four kids, occasionally my mum or dad would have to work from home because there'd be something, I would be sick off school or something. And I was talking to them the other day and my mum was saying like, it was terrible. You'd have to be carrying in the 80s piles of paper home you could phone in to work, but it's really expensive. And technology's just got ever better. So in the 90s we had computers. We then got the internet, cloud, you know, video calls, all of this stuff. If you look 2030, it's probably going to look like the Star Wars Jedi Council with holograms and amazing headsets, and it's just going to be easier to work remotely. So what do you think? Where will working from home or hybrid working be in ten years, say, from now? I think there's a really interesting question about what do companies in this country really think about working from home? How many CEOs think like Lord Rose? But don't say so publicly. I say that because working in the business unit here at the BBC, you hear things and I've been talking to colleagues about this, and they think there are probably more chief executives out there that want their workers back in more, possibly back in full time than are actually letting on. We do hear that anecdotally in the business unit. So I think there's a bit of a question there about how the chief executives of our biggest companies think about this. But I also think there's another question in terms of what this is going to look like in, let's say, five years time. And that's just the state of the economy, the state of the labour market. It's a supply and demand thing at the moment. Workers seem to have more power to demand these things. But let's say there's an uptick in unemployment. Let's say it's harder to find work. Will that balance shift back towards employers? And so for those employers that don't want their staff working from home, will it be easier for them to say no because there's a bigger pool of people looking for work? I think those are two things we're just not really clear about at the moment. Fascinating discussion. Thanks to you both for being here. Thank you. Thanks very much for having me.

          <attvalue for="3" value="https://www.raiplay.it/programmi/pres... - Nel cuore delle dolomiti bellunesi, ad Agordo si trova lo stabilimento produttivo della Luxottica, il colosso mondiale dell'occhiale. Dal 2024 nella fabbrica è iniziata la sperimentazione della settimana corta a parità di salario. Un'iniziativa che soddisfa operai e sindacati. A rendere possibile questo progetto non sono solo le nuove tecnologie, ma anche gli investimenti in formazione che rendono i lavoratori interscambiali coprendo così diverse mansioni. Anche il gruppo Lamborghini ha deciso quest'anno di introdurre la settimana corta in azienda. Per i sindacati dell'azienda si tratta di una rivoluzione sostenuta dalla transizione digitale ed ecologica. Per Lamborghini investire nel lavoratore vuol dire motivare i lavoratori e rendere più attrattiva l'azienda. All'estero, la settimana corta è in fase di sperimentazione in molti paesi. Ad Amburgo, in Germania, le organizzazioni sindacali stanno lavorando da tempo sulla sua introduzione. Anche in Spagna e Portogallo si sta lavorano su questa idea con sperimentazioni in aziende e società molto diverse fra loro. A Lisbona, i lavoratori di un asilo comunale, riorganizzando il loro lavoro, hanno iniziato la settimana corta. L'economista Pedro Gomes spiega le opportunità legate a questo nuovo approccio al lavoro." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Musica] in mezzo alle Dolomiti bellunesi ad Agordo paese di 4.000 abitanti c'è la sede e il cuore di Lux ottica uno dei simboli del made in Italy nel mondo una fabbrica da oltre 5.000 operai ma sono 12.000 in tutta Italia L'azienda è stata fondata proprio qui nel 61 da Leonardo Del Vecchio che ne è stato presidente fino alla scomparsa nel 2022 [Musica] Una storia incredibile quella di del vecchio che è partito producendo per conto terzi in questa piccola officina con sei operai fino a creare il colosso mondiale dell'occhiale capace di acquisire Marchi come Persol ryban oley e oggi di lavorare anche per il lusso e i grandi Brand della moda in questa fabbrica da aprile per tutto il 2024 si sperimenterà la settimana corta uno storico accordo che è stato inserito nel nuovo contratto integrativo lo hanno chiamato Time for You perché si lavora 4 giorni anziché cinque da lunedì a giovedì mantenendo lo stesso stipendio siamo entrati in azienda proprio mentre si stanno raccogliendo le adesioni tra gli operai e come prevedibile Sono moltissime ho famiglia ho due figli appena ho saputo la notizia ero stracontenta ha già pensato a come utilizz i suoi venerdì liberi Certo in famiglia fare qualche sport stare più con i miei figli Chi è fuori dicono siete fortunati è veramente siamo fortunati e per lei concretamente invece cosa cambia come potrà produrre in 4 giorni quello che fino adesso ho fatto in cinque perché siamo più rilassati più tranquilli facciamo di più adesso che so che venerdì sto a casa Sono già ancora più contenta prima di cominciare lavorare felici per produrre uguale Certo è da tanti anni che lavora ottica ottica sono 34 anni quest'anno e lei ha aderito subito alla settimana Cora Eh sì Appena ho sentito per me è stato come un sollievo perché ho più tempo libero anche per riposare anche per la famiglia le persone chiedono tempo tempo di vita che non è soltanto lavorare meno Certo lo è 20 settimane all'anno a qu giorni alla settimana quindi una settimana su due di 4 giorni a parità di salato L'azienda non ha paura di non lavorare il venerdì qui che si consegnano migliaia di occhiali ogni giorno in tutto il mondo Noi sappiamo un paio di mesi prima cosa preved prevedono le collezioni lavorando come nella moda su due grandi collezioni autunno inverno primavera estate il lavoro si può organizzare anche in 32 ore a settimana credono in Lux ottica grazie a nuove tecnologie più spazi e 15 500 assunzioni Qui siamo in finitura Dove si producono 40.000 occhiali al giorno lavorano 900 persone e il 90% sono [Musica] donne sarà il primo reparto a iniziare con la settimana corta con un gruppo di 60 volontarie ma con l'idea di estendere a tutti se andrà bene È possibile farlo grazie agli investimenti Nella formazione che hanno reso le lavoratrici polivalenti e intercambia tra di loro ho iniziato in saldatura come operaia ed è arrivata e sono un caposettore in finitura la settimana corta è importante anche per la parità di genere la donna non per volontà ma per pretta esigenza aderiva al part-time o richiedeva al part-time questo cosa comportava però logicamente Sì una riduzione di orario ma anche una riduzione di stipendio e poi una riduzione di contribuzione perché nella settimana corta non rimane uguale solo lo stipendio anche tutto il resto sì sì si matura del vecchio pensava che il lavoratore felice lavora meglio per questo Lux ottica è stata la prima azienda in Italia a offrire la mensa gratuita per i dipendenti la prima a istituire il Welfare per i lavoratori nel 2009 come risposta alla crisi economica innescata dal crollo di lemman Brothers più soldi ai lavoratori in beni e servizi per esempio il carrello della spesa ma è vero che vi rimborsano anche i libri scolastici libri scolastici sì sì no no abbiamo non ci manca niente Ho una figlia di 14 anni fine mese sarà premiata per la borsa di studio lei ha preso €1600 perché è uscita col 10 poi è stata incentivata la possibilità di lavorare 6 ore quando non ci sono picchi di lavoro più spazio alle persone una misura che ha fatto diminuire gli infortuni in fabbrica è il cosiddetto Welfare del tempo di cui la settimana corta Oggi è il completamento naturale un cambiamento anche culturale si è molto più flessibili e si va a cercare una miglior qualità di vita lo sa che però di solito si dice il contrario per essere competitivi Bisogna lavorare di più abbiamo Fior Fior di studi che provano che la produzione aumenta e di corrispettivo anche la qualità del prodotto stesso Certo è la famosa motivazione anche dei Lavoratori No qui è un'isola felice o si può fare dappertutto può essere veramente una linea guida altri apparati industriali la settimana corta in Italia fin era stata sperimentata in una grande banca come Banca Intesa San Paolo mai in una fabbrica e invece adesso non c'è solo Lux ottica anche un'altra grande fabbrica ha deciso di fare lo stesso siamo a Sant'Agata Bolognese sede storica di Lamborghini la fabbrica di auto Super sportive di lusso che dal 98 fa parte del gruppo tedesco Audi è un'azienda all'avanguardia tecnologica e anche nelle relazioni sindacali ci eravamo stati ai tempi del Jobs quando avevano deciso di mantenere l'articolo 18 per i lavoratori Oggi sono pronti a iniziare con la settimana corta da settembre per tutti i 2000 lavoratori non è scontato lavorare un giorno in meno nell'automotive dove le operazioni sono scandite al secondo sono stati innovazione e investimenti nella fabbrica 4.0 a permettere di recuperare tempo prezioso tempo da riconsegnare al lavoratore se tu investi per togliere vicenze pui recuperare del tempo ciclo e il lavoratore e la lavoratrice si affatica di meno Quindi riuscendo a migliorare l'ergonomia si chiama il carico biomeccanico riesce a recuperare dei secondi che in una giornata su tanti lavoratori ed ecco che significa fare della produzione in più alla fine vincono tutti Assolutamente sì ci crediamo fortemente chi lavora su due turni alternerà una settimana corta e una di 5 giorni sui tre turni Invece le settimane corte saranno due di fila in cambio i lavoratori hanno allungato di 15 minuti l'orario Diurno e di un'ora alla notte ma il progetto ha avuto grande riscontro 96% ha dato esito positivo e quindi solo in quel momento ne abbiamo iniziato a discutere con l'azienda la novità dell'accordo Lamborghini poi è che la settimana corta riguarderà anche i settori amministrativi Seppur con delle differenze l'azienda da mezz'ora al giorno ad ogni lavoratore Quindi ogni trimestre avrò tre giorni in più da pianificare e gestire proprio in più nel senso rimane lo smart Working rimane tutto rimane lo smart Working 12 giornate di Smart Working che sono tante tante è soddisfatta molto ci riteniamo fortunati ma soprattutto vogliamo essere da modello per le altre aziende per l'Italia in generale siamo dentro una vera e propria rivoluzione industriale la transizione digitale ma anche quella ecologica stanno modificando sostanzialmente la modalità il modo di lavorare il prodotto e le prospettive ogni rivoluzione industriale ha portato a una modifica dell'organizzazione del lavoro con una riduzione dell'orario di lavoro il salario in questo accordo sulla settimana corta non solo rimarrà lo stesso ma verrà aumentato con un premio di produzione che in due anni arriverà a €200 per tutti di fatto una mensilità In più ho chiesto anche all'azienda Come fanno a lavorare di meno e nello stesso tempo a rimanere competitivi sul mercato La competizione non si può fare a ribasso non possiamo semplicemente spingere la leva del lavorare di più senza pensare a dove andiamo a competere la motivazione e l'attrattività del datore di lavoro sono dei fattori competitivi importanti e che risultati vi aspettate in termini di produttività noi ci aspettiamo chiaramente Maggiore attaccamento e più voglia più creatività e più risultati e crede che la possano fare tutte le aziende in teoria io posso dire sì ma la realtà è che va fatta un'analisi di quali sono le dise efficienze magari che ci sono rispetto alle innovazioni tecnologiche nel sistema di lavoro ecco eliminando quelle di efficienze è possibile fare una ridistribuzione di questo tempo in favore delle persone perché no la settimana corta è stata già testata con successo in sei paesi europei il 90% delle aziende non sono più tornate indietro ora una sperimentazione Nazionale Sta iniziando anche in Germania per raccontarla siamo venuti ad hamburgo una le grandi città industriali tedesche Dove sono le grandi organizzazioni sindacali a lavorare sulla settimana corta e a chiederla al governo Stiamo chiedendo di inserire la settimana corta nei rinnovi contrattuali di categoria si può fare nel settore Metal meccanico e in altri settori Ritengo che sarebbe ancora più facile nella pubblica amministrazione ad esempio ce lo stanno chiedendo diverse aziende in molte città la settimana corta poi migliora le condizioni di sicurezza sul lavoro in tuttii all'aumentare dell'orario lavorativo aumentano gli infortuni in altri paesi come la Spagna a chiederle il governo questi i risultati della sperimentazione di Valencia salute migliore per un lavoratore su C 10% in meno di traffico e meno inquinamento il tutto mantenendo la stessa produttività Questa sarà la legislatura del tempo del tempo della vita delle persone lo faremo riducendo la giornata lavorativa senza ridurre il [Musica] salario anche in Portogallo da 6 mesi è iniziata una sperimentazione di settimana corta su 41 aziende e 20.000 lavoratori in tutto il paese su iniziativa del precedente governo Pedro Gomes è l'economista che sta coordinando la sperimentazione per conto del Ministero del Lavoro abbiamo chiesto alle aziende di ridurre a 32 34 o massimo 36 ore a settimana le adesioni sono volontarie è una cosa importante è non aver dato incentivi economici alle aziende in modo che possano calcolare davvero costi e benefici della settimana corta e quali sono i risultati dei primi 6 mesi di sperimentazione una cosa sorprendente è che i lavoratori all'inizio non erano solo entusiasti ma anche un po' spaventati pensavano di non farcela ma in soli 3 mesi abbiamo avuto meno 20% di ansia stress depressione e insonnia nei lavoratori e la percentuale di chi non riesce a conciliare vita privata e lavoro è scesa dal 46 all' 88% la sperimentazione si sta facendo su aziende molto diverse tra di loro per vedere se la settimana corta è applicabile ovunque tra loro c'è una delle più grandi banche europee di cellule nata 2 anni fa riceve ogni giorno i campioni di sangue e di cordone ombelicale raccolti alla nascita Crio conservati a meno 200° per futuri usi clinici 10.000 di questi campioni arrivano anche dall'Italia perché per legge non possono essere tenuti nel nostro paese siamo aperti 7 giorni a settimana i campioni vengono lavorati e conservati in modo che anche tra 25 o 30 anni possono essere utilizzabili terap per il bambino o parenti compatibili nel mondo già più di 60.000 trapianti sono stati fatti con queste cellule che curano leucemie malattie autoimmuni e con cui si può fare medicina rigenerativa anche in questo laboratorio sempre aperto si sta facendo la settimana corta questi tecnici di laboratorio già avevano turni su qu giorni di lavoro e ora abbiamo esteso i qu giorni a tutta l'azienda perché in questo reparto abbiamo capito che 5 giorni consecutivi a settimana non era produttivo i tecnici si stancavano di più con 4 giorni invece stavano meglio e lavoravano di più può essere un esempio anche per gli ospedali che lavorano 7 giorni su set Sì è così e Bastano un paio di mesi per sentire la differenza il modello della settimana corta non è rigido si può adattare non solo alle esigenze dell'azienda Ma quelle di ogni singolo reparto è rimasta la stessa e le persone ora sono più rilassate tranquille hanno meno stress fanno meno assenze la settimana corta non è così difficile come sembra si può fare Basta provarla Questo invece è uno studio professionale di Lisbona fanno visualizzazione per architettura ci lavorano 20 persone ed è stato fondato da un italiano che vive in Portogallo da 22 anni anche loro stanno sperimentando le 32 ore a settimana di F ore anche il venerdì Se necessario abbiamo soddisfazione abbiamo voglia di fare bene quello che facciamo e riusciamo a farlo bene in miglior tempo con le 4 ore fino oggi non abbiamo quasi mai usate e poi nella sperimentazione ci sono anche i luoghi che mai ti aspetteresti come questo asilo comunale frequentatissimo a Lisbona stanno continuando il loro servizio dal lunedì al venerdì garantendo stesso orario e pieno personale ma i lavoratori e le lavoratrici fanno la settimana corta com'è possibile Abbiamo cinque persone che ruotano tra di loro e Ognuno sceglie il giorno libero della settimana in cui fermarsi abbiamo assunto una nuova persona E così siamo riusciti a riorganizzare i turni all'inizio i genitori pensavano che fossimo un po' pazzi Ma poi non hanno visto nessuna differenza per i loro bambini e per il servizio e adesso ci dicono di continuare con questo progetto e non vogliono che cambi e invece per voi lavoratrici Che cosa è cambiato la qualità della vita il tempo siamo più attente sai con di bambini è un lavoro davvero impegnativo fisicamente e anche psicologicamente ora lavoriamo meglio quante altre scuole fanno parte del progetto No siamo i primi al mondo ma adesso tante scuole ci chiamano per sapere come abbiamo fatto e vogliono farlo anche loro lavorare 5 giorni 40 ore è una costruzione sociale politica economica non c'è niente di naturale o biologico fino al 19 secolo si lavorava 6 giorni quando all'inizio del 900 Le prime aziende americane decisero di lavorarne cinque fu visto come molto radicale e se guardi i giornali dell'epoca le critiche sono le stesse che vengono fatte oggi alla settimana corta è un'utopia non si può fare in tutte le aziende farà male all'economia ai salari le persone non hanno voglia di lavorare ma oggi dopo un secolo l'economia è Completamente cambiata pensa solo negli ultimi 50 anni alla rivoluzione tecnologica digitale informatica la velocità della comunicazione e cambiamenti demografici viviamo più a lungo le donne partecipano attivamente al lavoro tutto è cambiato L'unica cosa che è rimasta uguale è l'organizzazione del lavoro sulla settimana di quro giorni lavorativi Pedro Gomes ha scritto questo libro tradotto in cinque lingue al contrario di quel che si dice Lui dimostra che la settimana corta non è solo per i lavoratori ma è un'innovazione sociale che andrebbe adottata per il bene dell'economia l'idea che lavorare il 20% del tempo in meno farà decrescere l'economia è semplicemente falsa un altro errore è considerare il tempo libero come qualcosa che non ha effetti sull'economia ma hry Ford diceva Chi comprerà le mie macchine se tengo gli operai in fabbrica per 6 giorni cinema hotel ristoranti turismo molti settori dell'economia avrebbero benefici da un weekend di 3 giorni ma c'è di più Quante realtà di successo sono nate da imprenditori che avevano un lavoro e che nel loro tempo libero hanno creato la propria azienda Apple Nike il tempo libero stimola la creatività l'innovazione molti la sperimentazione in Portogallo stanno usando il giorno libero per aggiornarsi prendere una laurea un master Ma nella nostra società abbiamo anche un problema demografico meno bambini sempre meno persone al lavoro come lo risolviamo il problema è proprio questo abbiamo messo troppa pressione sui lavoratori la mancanza di tempo si traduce in problemi nella vita familiare più divorzi tassi di fertilità bassi perché se tu hai un figlio e non hai tempo per il bambino perché entrambi i genitori lavorano 40 ore ne puoi fare un secondo questo argomento piacerebbe anche ai conservatori ma la settimana corta è di destra o di sinistra né di destra né di sinistra è solo il modo migliore in cui possiamo organizzare il lavoro nel 21o secolo Non dico che accadrà subito ma in 5 o 6 anni potrà essere il futuro del lavoro e servono delle leggi nazionali perché il cambiamento non avverrà da solo" />

I know not all kids are as lucky. Some of my friends, some kids at my school and many around the world. And I would really like to help change that. Thanks to scientists, we now know just how important the first five years are for our health and development, especially our brains. Ari started learning long before he was even born, from inside his mommy’s tummy. When Ari was born, he was tiny and he cried all the time. He was always hungry and he pooped a lot. [Laughter] Now he laughs and giggles and makes funny noises. But those are just the changes we hear and see. That’s way more going on inside. So, let’s talk more about our brains. The blue bag is a rough size and weight of a healthy baby’s brain at birth. The red one is a baby’s brain after the first year. It almost doubles in volume. And by my age, it's almost 90 percent the volume of an adult brain. Our brains develop faster in our early years than at any other time in our lives. It can create up to one million neural connections every second. But we need your help. Our healthy development depends on these top five things, One, connecting; two, talking; three, playing; four, a healthy home, five; community. All of this helps our brains and us reach our full potential. So what’s something you can do that can really make a difference? Scientists call it serve and return. That’s just a grown-up way of saying connect, talk and play with us. And here’s the really big news. Amarjot, Ari, you ready? (Audio) Amajat: Ready? Molly Wright: Copycat games build imagination and empathy. (Amarjot and Ari laughing) Naming games build vocabulary and attention. Amarjot: Daddy. Ari. Daddy. Ari. MW: And games like peekabo -- yep, peekaboo -- actually build memory and trust. Amarjot: Peekaboo! MW: Each time you talk to us, play with us, make us laugh, it not only builds and strengthens our relationships and mental health, it actually teaches us some of the most important life skills, from making friends to taking the test, to getting a job, to one day maybe even starting a family of our own. Interactions early and often matter. Take it from me, the seven-year-old up here talking about brain science. (Laughter) OK, now let’s see what happens when the connection is taken away. So now he’s trying to get his dad’s attention again. He’s reaching out like, “That was fun, why have you stopped?” (Ari cries) I know it’s important for adults to use their devices sometimes, but kids are hardwired to seek out meaningful connections, not receiving them causes confusion and stress. OK, Amarjot, please re-engage. Amarjot: Ah, there’s Ari. (Ari laughs) MW: Now what if our whole childhood was like that last 30 seconds? How hard it would be for a child to feel calm. To feel safe. To learn to trust anyone. And the lifelong impact that would have. That makes me feel sad. Ari only reacted the way he did and recovered so quickly because the connection between him and his dad is usually so strong. The positive relationships with the grown-ups in our lives gives kids the confidence we need to try new things, to explore and be a kid. So please, try to remember the most special period for our development is the first five years. Starting from inside mommy’s tummy. What’s something really impactful you can do? Serve and return. And when? Early and often. Please give it up for a Amarjot and Ari. (Applause) Every moment together is an opportunity to connect, talk and play. Imagine the difference we could make if everyone everywhere did this. To us, the children, it’s so much more than just a game. It's our future. Thank you. (Applause) See? Peekaboo really can change the world. (Applause)" />

before the lives of civilians reports on Myanmar 2019 Sri Lanka 2012 Sabrina Rwanda both in 1999 pointed to our collective failure to speak to the scale of violations while they were committed what more evidence do you need now briefing you again on this subject is a grim undertaking before starting I ask you to reflect for a moment on what action we will tell future generations we each took to stop the 21st century atrocity to which we bear daily witness in Gaza it is a question we will hear sometimes incredulous sometimes furious but always there for the rest of our lives we will surely all claim to have been against it maybe we will say we issued a statement or that we trusted that private pressure might work despite so much evidence to the contrary or pretend that we thought a more brutal military offensive had more chance of bringing the hostages home than the negotiations which brought so many hostages home maybe some will recall that in a transactional world we had other priorities or maybe we will use those empty words we did all we could mr president let me start with what we see and are mandated by this council to report israel is deliberately and unashamedly imposing inhumane conditions on civilians in the occupied Palestinian territory for more than 10 weeks nothing has entered Gaza no food medicine water or tents hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have again been forcibly displaced and confined into evershrinking spaces as 70% of Gaza's territory is either within Israeli militarized zones or under displacement orders as my colleague from the FAO will explain every single one of the 2.1 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip face the risk of famine one in five face starvation despite the fact that you have funded the food that could save them the few hospitals that have somehow survived bombardment are overwhelmed the medics who have somehow survived drone and sniper attacks cannot keep up with the trauma and the spread of disease even today the European Gaza Hospital in Khan Ununice was bombed again with even more civilian casualties reported i can tell you from having visited what's left of Gaza's medical system that death on this scale has a sound and a smell that does not leave you as one hospital worker described it children scream as we peel burnt fabric from their skin and yet we hear that we did all we could mr president our response as humanitarians is to make a single ask of the council let us work the UN and our partners are desperate to resume humanitarian aid at scale across Gaza in line with the fundamental principles of humanity impartiality independence and neutrality we have a plan we have shown we can deliver with tens of thousands of trucks reaching civilians during the ceasefire we have life-saving supplies ready now at the borders we can save hundreds of thousands of survivors we have rigorous mechanisms to ensure our aid gets to civilians and not to Hamas but Israel denies us access placing the objective of depopulating Gaza before the lives of civilians it is bad enough that the blockade continues how do you react when Israeli ministers boast of it or when attacks on humanitarian workers and violations of the UN's privileges and immunities continue along with restrictions on international and non-governmental organizations mr president this council has adopted resolutions that demand all parties to the conflict comply with international humanitarian law and protection of civilians including humanitarian personnel a reminder that Israel also has clear obligations under international humanitarian law it must treat civilians humanely with respect for their inherent human dignity it must not forcibly transfer deport or displace the civilian population of an occupied territory as the occupying power it must agree to aid and facilitate it so for anyone still pretending to be in any doubt the Israeli designed distribution modality is not the answer it practically excludes many including people with disabilities women children the elderly the wounded it forces further displacement it exposes thousands of people to harm it sets an unacceptable precedent for aid delivery not just in the OPT but around the world it restricts aid to only one part of Gaza while leaving leaving other dire needs unmet it makes aid conditional on political and military aims it makes starvation a bargaining chip it is a cynical sideshow a deliberate distraction a fig leaf for further violence and displacement if any of that still matters have no part in it mr president for the record we have tried the UN has met 12 times and again this morning with the Israeli authorities to discuss this proposed modality we wanted to find a way to make it possible we repeatedly explained the minimum conditions for our involvement on the basis of long settled fundamental principles aid based on independent assessments of who needs it the globally tested and donor demanded basic requirement and the ability to deliver aid to all those in need wherever they are the Secretary General set out the relevant international law in his submissions to the International Court of Justice and your resolutions have strongly condemned starvation of civilians as a method of warfare and the unlawful denial of humanitarian access resolution 2417 demands the council's full attention to widespread conflict induced food insecurity mr president it's not just Gaza appalling violence is also increasing in the West Bank where the situation is the worst in decades the use of heavy weaponry military methods of war excessive force forcible displacement demolitions and movement restrictions ongoing illegal settlement expansion entire communities destroyed refugee camps depopulated settlements expanding and settler violence continuing at alarming levels sometimes with the support of Israeli forces recently settlers abducted a 13-year-old girl and her three-year-old brother they were found tied to a tree do we also say to them that we did all we could mr president there is I fear a broader context here for the past 19 months Palestinian journalists civil society and individuals have live streamed their destruction to the world many have been targeted and killed for their testimony and during this time international aid workers have been the only international civilian presence in Gaza watching and reporting the unfolding horror we are your eyes and your ears and be in no doubt that we feel the weight of that responsibility to you to the communities we serve and to the world and so we have briefed this council in great detail on the extensive civilian harm that we witness daily death injury destruction hunger disease torture other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment repeated displacement on a large scale we have described the deliberate obstruction of aid operations and the systematic dismantling of Palestinian life and that which sustains it in Gaza so you have that information and now the ICJ is considering whether a genocide is taking place in Gaza it will weigh the testimony that we have shared but it will be too late recognizing the urgency the ICJ has indicated clear provisional measures that must be imple implemented now yet they have not previous reviews of the UN's conduct in cases of large-scale violations of international human rights and humanitarian law reports on Myanmar 2019 Sri Lanka 2012 Sabrina Rwanda both in 1999 pointed to our collective failure to speak to the scale of violations while they were committed so for those killed and those whose voices are silenced what more evidence do you need now will you act decisively to prevent genocide and to ensure respect for international humanitarian law or will you say instead that we did all we could mr president this degradation of international law is corrosive and infectious it is undermining decades of progress on rules to protect civilians from inhumity and the violent and lawless among us who use who act with impunity humanity the law and reason must prevail this council must prevail demand this ends stop arming it insist on accountability to the Israeli authorities stop killing and injuring civilians lift this brutal blockade let humanitarians save lives to Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups release all hostages immediately and unconditionally stop putting civilians at risk during military operations and for those who will not survive what we fear is coming in plain sight it will be no consolation to know that future generations will hold us in this chamber to account but they will and if we have not seriously done all we could then we should fear that judgment" />
