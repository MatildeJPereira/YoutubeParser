          <attvalue for="6" value="good afternoon welcome to our weekly Ukraine war Q&amp;A with Professor Michael Clark and me Kamali Melbourne it is the 4th of June professor Clark is here as always michael how are you good afternoon to you are you well i'm doing all right well as you can another busy day absolutely you've been on another topic today on telly um talking about the stuff that's going on in Gaza but we're going to have you on Ukraine for the next 40 minutes or so thank you very much for submitting all your questions as always we do appreciate it um and as we always say you can submit questions as we are go along going along if anything occurs to you that you want the good professor to answer let's get straight into this we've had um some amazing Ukrainian action for the past sort of week or so Michael there have been quite a few incidents uh not least the um drone attacks on those Russian bomber fleets so let's start with uh with some of that and the potential Russian response so Sean asks &quot;Will Russia go nuclear in response to these recent attacks um and if that were to happen how would the West respond?&quot; Yeah two questions what one's got a very standard answer and one's got a very different answer the second part the the standard answer and this question comes up again and again people always ask about you know would Russia use nuclear weapons and the answer doesn't change but people keep asking it so it deserves to be answered because it obviously is on people's minds fair enough and so I mean the so the standard answer and this answer hasn't changed since from the beginning of the war is no very very unlikely firstly the Russians have shown no indication any physical indication of bringing their tactical nuclear weapons forward or bringing any of the preparations together which we would see because it would take some time um they talk about nuclear issues all the time because they use the sort of nuclear rhetoric to frighten everybody and that is you know has had some effect but in practical terms no there's there's no preparation that we can detect for any sort of nuclear use not only that there's there's no real advantage on the battlefield that the Russians could really get because Ukraine is a very big country and uh you know if they were to try to use a tactical nuclear weapon against Ukrainian forces they'd have to use several of And again I could go into the technicality of this if people want to but you but effectively they'd have to use something like five or six Hashima sized bombs right to get rid of to actually destroy one Ukrainian brigade dispersed as they normally are one brigade of 5,000 troops and its equipment so they would have to go in for a nuclear war in a big way um and even then that would not you know it would destroy one Ukrainian brigade or maybe a little bit more or they'd have to launch two or three nuclear weapons at a at a city or a town as a retaliatory measure and that brings in the other issue that the the the taboo against nuclear use is very very strong since the Second World War sometime somebody's going to break it i mean that you know at some point in human history that will be broken i mean Putin wants to wants to go down in history as a great Russian leader i'm pretty sure he doesn't want to go down in history as the man who broke the taboo the first man to use nuclear weapons in an aggressive mode not even to defend his own country against the final some sort of final attack i mean that's what nuclear weapons do they provide a final guarantee that if all else fails and your country is under a threat of complete destruction you might then go nuclear that's what that's and Russia's nuclear doctrine is actually all about that so I think that the chances are very very very low now the second part of the question what would the west do if a nuclear weapon were used the answer used to be under the Biden administration and this answer was never explicitly said by Biden but you know David Petraeus General David Petraeus independent he works for KKR now but he was director of CIA he was Britain's most America's most I say Britain because he's in Britain a lot he's he was America's most famous general during Afghanistan and Iraq well and he often would speak with the sort of private authority of the White House he didn't say things that were antithetical to White House thinking and he said a couple of times when this issue came up in 2023 he said &quot;If the Russians ever used a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine I'd be fairly confident.&quot; He said that the United States would would reply with conventional weapons we would destroy the Black Sea fleet we would attack every base from which tactical nuclear weapons had been used we would take out the strategic air force of Russia that had done it with with conventional weapons the the response would be massive and conventional and would really hurt now that's what he said apparently independently but obviously consistent with American thinking so that was then this is now would the Trump administration do that no no you don't think so do you think they would if it I think they would well it'd be in a terrible mess if a nuclear weapon would you was used but I don't believe that Trump would initiate that sort of response because um as everyone who knows him and knows his relationship with Russia and people like Fiona Hill the British academic you know associate with our defense who used to work for him she worked for three presidents including Trump she's written books about it and she says look he's frightened of Putin you know he admires Putin but he's frightened of him and he is um Trump is very frightened or very res very very resistant to using um American firepower in a strategic way he might use American firepower against the Houthies and he might use it against uh you know against terrorist groups or small groups um where it's a very one-way process but the idea of using American firepower in a you know another uh Iraq operation say or something like that or I mean against Iran which is is you know on on the table at the moment is quite is hard to imagine and the idea of using American firepower explicitly against Russia is almost completely off the table with that's so That's interesting and Putin would of course know that because Putin the exy would have calculated worked it out and perhaps knows that there is a threshold but it's interesting isn't it Michael because that threshold from what Petraeus was saying even in the event that nuclear weapons are used the response from the from the most powerful country on on earth under Petraeus or under under Biden would not be to go nuclear either because they know that is a threshold that you just can't cross but if a nuclear weapon were used you you couldn't ignore it you couldn't say &quot;Well that's unfortunate and where do we go from here?&quot; There would have to be a response and then the other thing I didn't mention about that is that it's very unlikely that China would stick with Putin if he used a nuclear weapon because that would go down so badly in the rest of the global south and India would not stick with Putin i mean Putin would lose his most important supporters and backers if he broke this taboo so it's it's very very unlikely that that would happen it's certainly I mean I'm I could say with you know 99.99% certainty that in response to let's say an attack on the Kersh bridge his pride and joy he would not use nuclear weapons in response he would want to respond but not with a nuclear weapon we'll probably we'll come back to the coach bridge of course later on but it occurred to me as you were answering your question mark because it's something that I've asked you since the very beginning of the invasion we've talked about it a lot and you've been very clear in your in your thinking and reassuring to me in in your responses but you know nuclear weapons aren't the only weapon of mass destruction you know that the Russians have been using gas on the front lines to try and flush out Ukrainian um trench positions is there any suggestion that the Russians could use another kind of of weapon that doesn't reach the threshold of nuclear but it's more than conventional chemical or biological yes there is i mean I mean you know the Russians always believe in retaliating against these sorts of big Ukrainian attacks and their retaliation has generally speaking been um more bombing you know fairly conventional bombing with drones and and ballistic missiles so I'm one would expect them to try to really step that up and have say you know four or five days of very intensive air attacks and make it very clear that that is their response so the Ukrainians know and the Ukrainians will have decided that that was likely they'll have already priced that in to their to their response but you can't rule out the idea that the Russians might begin to step over other thresholds say in biological warfare and chemical warfare i mean they've used CS gas which is illegal interestingly to use on the battlefield riots that's right you can use it in riots because it can disperse but used on the battlefield it can be used in lethal con or is used in lethal concentrations and has the effect of driving people into the open where they can be shot very easily so it is actually a banned weapon on the battlefield but the Russians there's lots and lots of reports of them using it using a lot of nerve agents um there were uh uh accusations they've been using sarin which I thought were credible before Christmas but then I I tried to track some of them down and they they sounded credible but then I couldn't find any really strong information well sarin in people's minds from Syria of course that's right yeah a lot of sarin was used in Syria um but there's but there's a lot of um chlorine elements used CS gas um but I can't pin down other than accusations that sarin's been used i can't pin down any specific instances which proved but yes um and biological weapons no of the sort of things we've seen the Russians used in Britain is not impossible that they might go for their own sort of spectacular with a biological attack on a civilian population somewhere and that's that's plausible and it would be extremely unpleasant and it would be another threshold cross wouldn't it um next question here from a a poster called never the question thank you for this um and another one that I've asked you many many times Michael what psychological effect do these attacks have on Putin put yourself in Vladimir's mind oh these attacks um are believed to annoy him i was talking to somebody who keeps track on these things and he said that Putin's disappeared in the last 48 hours he's he's he's just not made any appearances which is unlike him um I because last week he was out quite a lot it was marked how how often you saw him popping up doing things i was talking to somebody last night who tracks these things and he said we haven't seen him for 48 hours um that could be a coincidence i don't know maybe he's got a cold who knows um but um he does these do affect him they really do because the the more um audacious they are the more humiliating it is for Russian defense forces I mean Russian air defenses and of course he always makes sure one of the reasons he doesn't come onto TV immediately is because it would look as if the blame was his and so he always makes sure that the blame is laid on the regional governor or somebody lower down in the air defense control or whatever it might be and always you go back to you know the puzzin um attempted coup which was very serious i mean he was very shaken by that you when Pgoin and the Vagna group began to advance from Rostov on Moscow and was shooting incredible Saturday afternoon that was astonishing yeah were you on then i I well I was I was on and then I went home and I was watching it watching it go along cuz you you didn't know where it was going to end no I was on for part of it and then missed the rest of it on air anyway but um yeah but I mean you know they were shooting down their own Russian aircraft it was astonishing and he went missing he went missing for days um and you know when he came back he looked shaken and so on but he makes sure to deflect attention from these things and they're always put down as as terrorist acts you know extensive terrorist acts and we're dealing with it and interestingly after the um the the airfield bombs at the weekend on Sunday they arrested lots of people they always do that they always arrest somebody within 24 hours oh we've got the perpetrators they always say that strung them up somebody Yes somebody gets arrested every time within hours what is the narrative as to as to what went so badly wrong for the Russian security services that allowed this to happen well only that it was some ingenious terrorist attacks and I haven't heard I may be wrong about this but so far I haven't heard a a really strong uh account from Russia as to how it happened the Russian bloggers are are circulating what's circulating in the west these these um uh uh containers where the roof kind of peels back and reveals all these firsterson drones i mean that's astonishingly clever and that's going around on the bloggerphere in Russia but I don't think Russian main channels have have used that material so far they've just talked about um attacks terrorist attacks on their airfields as if it's been groups of terrorists as far away as uh um beluga beliga ink yeah i mean they went all the way across Russia just incredible the fact and in Mamman in the north yeah to get there um because this this sorry I said ble the air base is is ble ink because of course it's a special military operations it's not it's not a war it's not a war so these can't be acts of war can't be happening like right and so they can't blame the SBU they can't blame the Ukrainian security services or or can Well they can no that what they say is that the SBU are setting off terrorist groups they're sending Ukrainian terrorists or Russian terrorists working for Ukraine to commit these acts so everything is everything that happens in Russia is a terrorist act even though you we can argue about it but these are are by most standards legitimate acts of war against military targets in a state that has invaded its neighbor just on that because that's interesting these are legitimate there's nothing that you could in terms of international law whether or not you can strike that deep into Yeah well no you can certainly strike deep into an an opposing country if you're at war with it um the the marginal line is assassinations of individuals and so if uh and again assassination of a military officer which has happened um is a bit more questionable you could argue that that's a terrorist act but there is a legal precedent for saying well there's no other way of getting at that officer and that officer is intrinsic to the war that they're waging against you so you have a right if you take reasonable precautions only to kill that officer or to affect that officer then that's arguable but it does get close to the borderline with terrorism but attack so individual attacks on individuals are difficult to justify more difficult but attacks on bases and facilities are straightforward in in legal terms get on with that okay next question here from HJ um could Ukraine destroy the Kirch Bridge outright or is it enough to keep targeting it and causing inconvenience after inconvenience for Russia so I think this is the third time they've targeted the Kirch Bridge um we saw that truck bomb or explosion very early October 22 and then July 23 was a sort of baby drone attack which sea drones sea drones which got underneath and damaged and so this is the third one yeah um yes very hard to destroy the bridge in total it's 12 mi long so it's the longest bridge in Europe um it's I'm pretty sure it's the biggest bridge the Russians have ever built or the longest bridge they've ever built i think I'm going to check the figure 12 mi long is I think is fairly secure and I know it's it's Europe's longest bridge i'm trying to work out exactly when they when it came into sort of use because uh 2018 I think okay so 2018 so I'm right it was post them annexing Crimea oh yeah that was the idea they annexed Crimea in 2014 or or or conquer Crimea in 2014 which is illegal then built a bridge to Crimea which is which is also illegal because it's a a bridge that the Ukrainians certainly didn't agree to uh there used to be a ferry the Kurish ferry when the when the 2014 um uh seizure of Crimea took place and I was at Rousi then we were looking very carefully at the Kurish ferry we had a really good Russian specialist with us who said &quot;You look at this ferry.&quot; He said &quot;It can only take about six vehicles you know three times a day completely inadequate for Yeah he said there's no way they can supply you know Crimea as it as it then stood with the Kurish ferry.&quot; And he said &quot;They'll have to build a bridge.&quot; And we said &quot;You know really Eagle are you sure?&quot; He said &quot;Yeah yeah they'll build a bridge they will.&quot; He was absolutely right yeah and you were right 2018 it came in 2018 yeah so it took him four years to build it but it's it's Putin's pride and joy um all bridges can be repaired which is why the when the Ukraans have tried to attack it they try to attack the vulnerable part which is the part with the arches on it which is that is where the bridge can let shipping through underneath the rest of it is quite low on the water so you can't get ships underneath because it's easier to build a bridge which is only you know 20 ft above the water as opposed to 200 feet above so the the vulnerable part is where you see the big arches and that's each time it's been attacked that's where it's been attacked could you destroy the bridge completely no not really but you could keep on damaging it so that it becomes unviable for the use of military supplies and this attack um less spectacular than the others because it's against the the support is to try to make the bridge unsafe to to to make it vulnerable structurally vulnerable yeah mainly so that the Russians can't send heavy um train loads of supplies over it it's not so much I mean the traffic is one thing and they they like the symbolism of be of having to have the bridge closed but it's actually the train line that they're really after because that's what a lot of stuff goes the train line is next to the to the roads like two bridges in effect and what they want to do is to is to stop the Russians or make it unsafe for the Russians to send ammunition and supplies on this train line into Crimea which is a major supply hub or was for all of their forces in Zaparisia but I suppose the engineering of that is that if you knock out parts of the track that can be easily replaced by by engineers oh you can go back to bomber command in the second world war and ask them how difficult is it to bomb very first of all it's difficult to hit them and secondly it's difficult to hit them well enough um to stop them being repaired so I think implicit in the question here from HJ probably thinking about those tourist missiles that we've been talking about for the last few weeks is if they can knock it out they have lots of missile defense around the bridge they probably massive to stop from aerial attacks is that why that they're going for sort of explosives on the structures because you could if you can get to it by sea it's it's an easier way of Yeah exactly i mean every time there is an attack the Russians close that loophole and so the Ukrainians have to be more careful so the first attack looked like a truck bomb i'm still not entirely convinced about that but it seemed to be based on a truck bomb the second attack was with you know sea drones getting just sailing up to it basically under the water and so the Russians have put a stop to any any repetition that the this third one somehow they've got charges placed i don't know how they did it and we you know perhaps we'll find out in the next few months but they managed to get some charges placed that obviously went off quite remotely and about a ton of explosives i don't know how they did that but we'll see the Russians will definitely find out how they did it and they'll block that off as well so the Ukrainians will have to keep on being inventive but they could try as and when they get tourist missiles they could try just putting holes in the bridge further along not at the most vulnerable part yeah just to make it difficult for everybody five holes in the thing is gonna be repaired but they could they could keep the they could make the bridge a real nuisance for the Russians to keep open that's what they could do and that's part of the tactic isn't it of these kind of sabotage attacks to make it really difficult i mean just on the the drone attacks and the fact that those drones are brought in by truck uh an individual on a podcast I listen to regularly said that now the Russians are going to have to be checking every single truck that comes in the logistical nightmare that has been caused by the fact you can't trust any vehicle that's passing over your borders that's right because there were apparently Russian drivers driving trucks they didn't know what was in them they were just told to take this container to some area and there were wonderful report or interesting report of one driver who said I was just told to go to a layby and stop there and somebody would come and meet me and of course that that tells you this is all part of the black economy you know he wasn't told to take it to a depot where the where the load was properly recorded and scanned and everything no no he was taking it to a layby where a gentleman would come and meet him so he presumably didn't care what was in the truck and he was getting paid for what he was doing and there's enough of that of course there's so much of that going on in Russia and in Ukraine as well that what the SBU the Ukrainian intelligence service obviously did is that they got enough people into Russia not difficult you know Ukrainian you know Russian speaking Russians who are working for Ukraine into Russia doing deals with drivers or making arrangements with false companies to send this fleet of lries off with all these first person drones in them and two of the lries we we are told were self-destructed because something went wrong and the Ukrainians again had thought of this they didn't want the lries captured as they were so two lorries self-destructed before they got to the point where they would have opened their roofs and released all these attack drones which again was a remote operation it folded back and the drones came out now when I saw you it must have been Monday after the after the attacks you said that this is the most extraordinary bit of sort of espionage sabotage since the pager attack on by the Israelis on Hezbollah that's right i mean last September last year wasn't it um around the third week of September I think it was was the the um Israeli the MSAD attacks on Hezbollah i mean giving them a series of p all I mean setting up companies that supplied them with pages which must have been over years ago oh yeah several years in the making and they they've been supplying them with perfectly good pages until they started supplying them with ones that blew up in their hand and then they sent the message and those pages were specially designed because they gone out of production from the Taiwanese company that produced them they they were specially designed that you needed both hands to actually answer so you couldn't just pick it up and answer you had to use both hands you know because two buttons on it so that you were holding it in both hands to pick it up in front of your face to your ear and then it exploded and blew people's hands off or killed them whatever and it was and the idea was that only Hezbollah people would have these pages because it was what Hezbollah was using it was what Hezbollah had given people so the Israelis in a sense could say this is absolutely legitimate although there were some um other casualties some children because people Yeah exactly and other people were involved but they had a reasonable case for saying we created a system whereby only our enemies our our expressed enemies would be affected by these pages because they were for them only and they would blow up only in their hands and with one or two exceptions that was true it's the ingenuity of it as well and that I mean yeah in the in the writings on intelligence successes in years to come um the Hezbollah pages and Ukraine's um drone lorries whatever they get called will go down as two of the big coup intelligent coups of modern times does make me think of of the other ones and prior to that there was uh an assassination on a Iranian nuclear scientist and I think the Israelis used a sentry gun a remote controlled machine gun or that was certainly the reporting that's right yeah i can't I can't remember his name now um but that was going back to the 1990s I think it was quite a while ago quite a while check him out yeah quite a while ago but it was again this sort of ingenuity of of the um security forces to be able to do this sort of stuff now Rick White has got a question here on these drones the Ukrainians declared about 40 aircraft were destroyed by drone but the footage showed only a handful of aircraft hit uh Rick asks &quot;How accurate is the Ukrainian number?&quot; Well um in so far as we it can be verified bits of it are accurate we don't know about the rest so the Blea airfield in Kusk which is a Siberia one that's been overflown now by a couple of companies maxar Technologies have overflown it with one of their satellites and taken photographs and this Capella space have overflown it with synthetic aperture radars which also can see through cloud and so on because it's a basically it's a radar beam that bounces off the ground and shows you shapes in great detail and what that both both those companies separately independent companies have shown that at least eight aircraft are destroyed at that air base which is what the Ukrainians said mhm so it looks as if um some of their uh the TU22s and the TU95s that's the uh the Bear and the Blackjack bombers which are the ones the Ukraans were really after um they seem to have got a group of those bombers they also um confirmed at a different base I think at a different base that they got one of the A50s which is the um Awax aircraft the airborne air control aircraft exactly now and they've got they've had one of those before they might even have got two of them and the Ukrainians have caught one of them before last year uh actually shot it down or arranged for it to be shot down even by Russian systems and the the Russians have only got about seven or eight of those operational so it looks as if they've lost about half of their Awax force yeah and they're very very valuable because that's the sort of control center it's an aircraft that flies you know near to the battlefield and controls everything going on they're very very expensive we run them as well and you know you don't have 20 or 30 of them you have a dozen or so or in our case you have two or three um and you you know you you you look after them so impacts on their ability to be able to control it will do the battlefield so what what the Ukraans are saying is we have destroyed they said 34% of Russia's strategic bomber force now that is not verified but but what we've seen so far links in to what they have claimed at the the ble so the Ukrainians say 41 um have done 34% so the institute for war studies who I know of course we we listen to who've got excellent detail on all of this they've they're quoting Colonel Yur uh Colonel Yuri Inhut uh who said that 10 out of 12 of Russia's 19 TU160 bombers and 36 of the uh 57 TU95 bombers were operational prior to the strike and and obviously and a a number now have been destroyed as a result yeah as a result of this um they didn't get so many of the of the Blackjacks um of the of the 160s those are the that's the biggest it's a huge supersonic bomb the biggest supersonic bomber in the world and in a way the Ukrainians aren't as bothered about the 160s because they're not being used so much to launch cruise missiles against Ukraine in these nightly attacks it's the old bears and blackjacks these old second world cold war bombers that sort of lumber around with a radar signature of an elephant and they and they launch cruise missiles from a long way out um and and the Russians are keeping their uh their backfires away from the war most of the time because they figure they might need those for another war sometime later and it is interesting to me as well Michael because I think last week or the week before we talked about striking airfields and I joked that you know that you park the planes wing to wing um if they're far enough away that they feel like they're going to be safe and you never do that that's the front line and where are these planes parked when you see them yeah and you know the the the the bear and the and the the blackjack bombers the Ukrainians don't have any of them except they had one bear and one blackjack bomber in their aviation museum and they use those two to work out the um the uh the areas where they had to hit them with the drones because obviously if you if a drone hits at the tip of a wing or something it's not going to do a lot of damage they they use their their two museum pieces to work out where are the fuel tanks where are the where are the control systems centered where do you need this little drone to hit the bomber to do the maximum amount of damage and so they they they worked on their two museum pieces as as the algorithm for their bombing attack yeah an algorithm right this is all AI as well isn't it once once they were off and running it was uh controlled by the computer which is just a fantastic um step forward in warfare all right let's move on to another question here sean the Prawn great name um asks &quot;Is the Russian summer offensive underway?&quot; Uh yes um it's a it's a it looks like a rolling offensive as we thought it might be it doesn't at the moment look like some sort of big strategic thrust with lots of armor uh in the front to try to you know open up Ukrainian lines i mean that is still possible but I think we'd see that building um before it struck and we're not seeing it at the moment but we are seeing um feed the feeding in of different units all the way around the front so we're seeing something in Sumi up in the north and um uh I mean Sumi and Khakiv and Khak is being bombed again last night um that there's a lot of air activity around Khaki which is the second city and we're also seeing more more pushes down in the south where we we we spend most of our time looking at this around uh Chazar Costanti Nifka and Prosk and the big the big operation and we actually we had we had a great graphic for it last week and we never got to use it is that the big operation is that the the roads I mean there aren't that many roads in that area I mean not not not like very major motorways but the road between Pocrosk And Costantinovka is a key road because it also the other side of Costantin go to Chazivar and if the Russ and they're fighting over that road if the Russians get control that road then they can push north to Slavansk and Krammatsk and if they get particularly Krammurk but even then Slavansk after that then they've got the Donbass then the game's up for the Ukrainians in the Donbas for that part yeah and the key thing is this is this road it's like a like a Tjunction if if they get the road then they cut northwards off the road and then they they're very close then to getting Crater and Slavian have we got insight as to what the fighting is is actually like in that part are the Ukrainians dug into positions are they holding back in towns and they're sort of keeping their It's fairly dynamic the the Ukrainians are launching lots of counterattacks and they're succeeding in some of them but they're only they're grabbing back little bits of territory but otherwise back punch back exactly that's it's punch and counter punch but the Russians are moving forward but very very slowly because they're working with dismounted infantry now they've learned if they send in their armored vehicles first they lose them and if they send in troops inside armored cars they lose them so what they're doing is they're sending in small groups of troops who are you know dispensable and these are the these are the ones they don't care about and they send them in in little squads of eights and tens to grab a little bit of this and a little bit of that and when they think that there's that they've got enough of it then they send in their professional troops in their armored vehicles when these small groups what's left of them have taken most of the fight how many troops will go in they'll grab a a property somewhere they can defensible position to hold yeah and they'll take they'll take a local position they're not digging in trenches as they go they're taking you know buildings areas um very often because this is quite industrial that area of of Ukraine so there's quite a lot of of old plants you know old bits of the mines old bits of steel works and mills and things like that and they of course they can be made into fortresses i was going to say positions must be really really Exactly if you get hold of one then you make it into a fortress and move forward but equally if you're defending you can make that into a fortress and fend off lots of attacks which is why the Russians are still losing over a thousand men a day and funny enough the CSIS in Washington Center of Strategic and International uh Studies which is a very respectable organization they just produced a report which came out I think yesterday and their view is that the the whole war has now cost about 1.4 million military casualties about and they said it's just on the million now for Russia and it's 400,000 for Ukraine and that's killed and wounded right and that's the point i mean the Ukrainians look look as if they've lost about 40% of what the Russians have lost but the Russians are now have lost just on a million dead and seriously wounded and that's only going to going to go up well there's a question here from our viewers who are watching us thank you for this one B hunt um who asks &quot;At current rates of attrition is Russia likely to run out of soldiers and equipment?&quot; Um not run out no um because it's recruiting people from all over the world because it's paying them you know large amount large amounts of money so their own soldiers from the east are being paid a lot to go not many soldiers from Moscow and Petersburg or Western Russia proportionately um but lots from the east and lots from foreign countries also they've got lots of foreign workers from Africa and Asia working in their arms factories and they just they've imported them as labor and they're paying them pretty well and so literally you know Russia's arms production is being driven now by an influx of foreign workers so they can keep on going they'll keep on doing it i mean Russia is a big economy and it's a big war machine but as I keep saying it's like a sponge you know it's you can you can sort of punch into it but it keeps re you know resuming its shape but equally the sponge itself finds it difficult to create a a big offensive it just keeps sort of spreading out and spreading out and it's very hard therefore for the Ukrainians to to stop it unless they have a lot more modern more modern equipment and I have to say some different tactics all the way down through their through their whole system but the Russians can keep going um but it will strain their economy it's bent their economy out of shape already but it will strain their economy more and more from next year which is one reason why I think Putin is going for as much as he can this year now if if he is interested in doing a deal at some point a ceasefire it'll be towards the end of the year when he's got Dombas and he can say thi this is now my territory um and now I will do now I'll agree to a ceasefire and that will give him the break he needs before he comes back for another go in two three years time so Putin said on the 13th of May that Russia is recruiting 60,000 volunteers to join the armed forces every single month i mean my math is terrible i can't work out what the attrition rate is but whether or not that is enough for them no they are they they are I mean they're losing on average one the average is now 1,300 a day they're now recruiting more than that so they're recruiting,500 to 2,000 a day which is 60,000 a month um and so they are doing that i mean people are are sort of not clear about or disagree on this can the Russians keep on doing this just by recruiting foreign um individuals and individuals in the east to their army or will at some point the Russians have to go in for mobilization again i mean Putin went in for partial mobilization in late 22 300,000 it was very unpopular it wasn't called mobilization called partial mobilization very unpopular and things were pretty shaky for the Russian government as a result of that they're desperate to avoid that but if they keep bringing in you know foreign nationals to their army and their arm is getting the quality is going down and down and down until they can recruit you know Russians who want to fight for the really want to fight and are prepared to train properly and be given the time to train this army is not going to be very good it'll be big but it just won't be good and the quality is going going down all the time of of the mass of the army but they'll keep on adding to that mass as long as they keep on paying for it the other thing that we've talked about as well is that people do get paid don't they families if you die in battle get a huge payout which for That's right many people who are from the poor parts of Russia changes their family life once the person dies there's all sorts of anecdotal reports of um uh you know neighbors uh saying &quot;Oh look at look at so- and so she's riding round in the car that that her dead husband bought for her.&quot; Um because that's it you know to be able to afford a car to um you know have a you know house for the son-in-law or for the daughter and the son-in-law all those sort of things are unaffordable for a lot of of Russians you know east of Moscow mh and uh paying for I or getting paid for father going off to war is quite an attractive prospect it's 19 million rubles i've just looked on here i think it works out perhaps to 68,000 US for a decision that's right i think average average pay is about 13 $15,000 um and so you're talking they're making they're making good money if they go and do it three yeah you get a signing on bonus which is like three or four times the average pay as a straight lump sum and then you get much higher pay it varies from region to region and of course the average does as well but much higher pay and then the family gets big payments um if uh if you die and then and also you get lots of veterans benefits so if you survive then you're given all sorts of privileges as a veteran for the rest of your life and you and your family so it's it is a sort of an attractive package for people who are relatively poor and are prepared to take the risk mhm all right let's move on to this next one um is from CD or could will Ukraine attack the Kremlin it seems like they could very easily or at least put the fear that they can and of course they did it's reported attack in May 2023 that's right there was a drone attack then though Ukraine never claimed it and my sense of it was always that I don't think those uh drones came from inside Ukraine i think they were launched by somebody else closer to the Kremlin um maybe still by the Ukrainians though I mean quite possibly Ukraine or Russian opposition group or a group that Ukraine was prepared to sponsor i mean we never really got to the bottom of that but it didn't do it didn't do any good and it it it plays to um Putin's narrative that that Ukraine is involved in a war to destroy Russia that the West is trying to destroy Russia and it's using Ukraine as the sort of battering ram to do it so I don't think there's much to be gained politically from attacks on the Kremlin and and the Ukrainians have got to stick to the idea that they are attacking into Russia and they're sticking to military targets that make a difference to them you know things that will ease the pressure on them so aircraft that can launch glide bombs fuel centers that are that are you know sending fuel to the front line railway lines and logistics things that matter to the front line in Ukraine is what they need to show they're attacking well similarly the point that you made that if Russia were to use nuclear weapons they would lose support from India and China if Ukraine were to start hitting targets like the Kremlin they would lose what whatever little support they have in the unaligned nations they lose they'd lose that yeah and and the danger I said this at the time that um you know they're playing with fire if they do attack something like the center of Moscow like that because although they'd say well these were only Ukrainian weapons that distinction will be lost you know were they western supplied weapons or Ukrainian weapons nobody will care too much um so the the Ukraans have got to be careful and they do play with fire sometimes when they do these things and and one of the things they have tried to do with their attacks toward Moscow not on the Kremlin is to close the airports i think there's what four airports around Moscow and they can all be closed pretty quickly by air attack and that's again it inconveniences the Russians and it reminds the Russian people that they that you may call it terrorism but this is what Warfield just a couple of weeks back they were I think they were being closed every other day that the airports were being knocked out already the um operation was being stopped because of the risk of air attack all right let's move on to a question here from Monty and Monty's uh asking you a question I always love to talk to you about Michael and it's about drone warfare how how has drone warfare affected the other forms of conventional war and tactics that were used at the start of the war um and my favorite statistic about this is that 70% of casualties now caused by drone it's completely changed the way that we fight yeah it has i mean the thing is when we say drones we're talking about robotics as well so it's you know drones in the air but you know drones at sea drones on land the same sort of thing it's a robot system of some sort a robot vehicle which can either be a surveillance vehicle an intelligence collection or a lethal vehicle it can fire something fire a weapon or it can just be a kamicazi vehicle which which goes to a target and blows itself up and yes I mean this is all I mean drones have been around a very long time and we often say the first really effective drones were the V1 doodlebugs that the Germans fired against London in 1944 um and they were I mean they existed before that as well but they were the first really effective drones the the whole science of drones didn't move that far forward and then in 20 2020 the war between Azaban and Armenia yeah okay and the Azabanis used Turkish Bay drones that's right with with Israeli Harab drones little drones as surveillance and there was nothing clever about either the Harab drones or the Baya drones but the Azabanis used lots of them that was the point instead of using just a handful they used lots of them and found that they were extremely effective against Armenia's Russian tanks and I remember at the time talking to people in the Ministry of Defense in 2020 i mean and I mean Ben Wallace was a secretary of state for defense then saying we're taking this really seriously so we we are really looking at this because everybody was sitting up well as a result of that but the US and UK have been did use drones in Afghanistan and Iraq Predator very small numbers right i mean they were they were terrifying to the population people there because they would fly overhead you'd see the thing you'd hear this buzz the Israelis used them a lot as well in Gaza for surveillance and for mainly surveillance um and the the drones that we developed was the um uh the protector uh and the uh uh we had watchkeeper which is surveillance drone and predator and and that was a drone which which like an airplane fired missiles so it just did the same as an airplane big old things as well yeah it was almost it was the size of a small plane anyway but what the uh what the Turkish drone showed was that really cheap drones used in the hundreds rather than the handfuls could make a strategic difference and that understanding in 2020 is what went forward really into the battles of 2022 and 23 in Ukraine and what we've seen since is an astonishing development of of drone and robotic warfare mainly drones because that's the way in which robotics can be used most easily in the air once you get down to ground robotics robotics on the sea they're all more complex more complicated just to move around but drones I mean small drones able to deliver one charge one grenade but directed with AI directed you know with with a computer system to follow somebody if necessary into a bunker and drop the grenade into this poor man's you know lap in effect that is something that has developed only in the last two or three years and it's pretty fundamental and that's some of the wireless ones they're also being wired now this fiber optic drones that they're using on these huge sort of spools of cable there'll be an answer to that we don't know what it is yet but there will be an answer to these fiber optic drones some way of breaking the cables or or disabling what the cables do nobody we haven't come up and we the world hasn't yet come up with it but there will be one and just a few more numbers on the the drone production russia is producing 300 drones every 3 days aiming for 500 drones a day yeah uh it's reported most of them small yeah well they've adapted the quadcopters yeah and the um Ukrainians are going to be making 2.5 million drones a year their whole industry drone industry is is huge in 20 in 2022 realizing what drones were doing i remember Zilinsky saying we will produce a million drones next year 1 million drones he said for 2023 and that of well done but that figure is now you know treble it i mean treble it now two years later and they can churn them out in the day so it's it's completely changed everything right move on to some uh quick fire questions if we can Michael um clock is ticking um here's one from Stevie it's about Sunumi again with 50,000 troops gathered near Sunumi are they a tempting target for Ukrainian fighter jets um well they would be if they if they came together in big enough groups but I mean what the Russians have learned like the Ukrainians is that if you've got troops ready for an offensive keep them dispersed don't at some point they have to be together but you only mass them quite late on before you you know go into a maneuver but yes I mean anyone who who brings large numbers of troops together close enough is making them a target mhm just very quick one on in the old days they used to say you know for centuries and centuries of warfare you you you didn't know um was now that that's right you you you knew where the enemy was but you didn't know if you could destroy the enemy right but you knew where they were because you could see them you could hear them your scouts came back and said &quot;They're over the hill there.&quot; But you didn't know if you could destroy them now it's the other way around you know you can destroy them you just don't know where they are right they're so dispersed um here's a question here from Alan 999 and Alan you may be tempting fate here why is Trump so quiet he's going to go on true social immediately isn't he oh um because um he's on the verge of failure in this peace effort and he's not going to associate himself with failure now he may come through with some rabbit out of the hat initiative and that's not not impossible but the more time goes on uh the more likely it is that America will walk away from this that you know we all think he's in the process of walking away so it's not entirely set in stone yet but he's quiet because his instinct I think is that this is going to fail so stay away from it right sophie Louise has a question about the bridges again were the bridge instance over the weekend in Russia a sign that Ukraine has tourist missiles almost certainly not um I think they will get tourist missiles but I think we'll see them more clearly when we do the the Russians reported that both those bridges um were blown up um uh in and you know one bridge was blown as a train was going underneath it and the other was blown as a train was going over the top of it yeah um and both of them seemed to be uh charges pre-laid charges so you know classic um sabotage operation I think seven killed on it that's right yeah it wasn't without casualties no i mean and again a a terrorizing attack it was it was yeah and it was it was an an attack you know in Russia one one one bridge was in Brians and one was in Kursk and the Ukrainians have got to you know they can make a good case to say that was a legitimate target but yes civilians were killed and that is uh allowable it's you know it's tolerable in international law depending on how carefully you set up the operation but almost certainly not tourist missiles but we may see tourist missiles do exactly that sort of thing as and when the Ukrainians get them they suggest that the missiles are coming and then they show look this is what we can do without them imagine you get I think that's quite important for them smithy asks &quot;How aware are people in Moscow and St petersburg that Ukraine is now hitting Russia regularly?&quot; Well as we said before I think what they they're certainly aware of it the Russians don't don't not report these things because they know that there's enough local reporting of what goes on and the blogosphere in Russia you know circulates stuff the way it does in Western countries so they can't they can't pretend it hasn't happened but as we were saying they put it all down to terrorism and so you know what I think the Russian population are told is that you know they are fighting a war they're winning a war that they have to win and one of the consequences is that we've that we are the subject of terrorist attacks and that's that's the view that's that's the line and and most Russians seem as far as we can tell the Lvada Center is the only the only center we've got in Moscow the Lavvada um uh foundation I think it is that um uh publishes reports which are reasonably um independent and they seem to indicate that the the Russian public you know they support the war they're not they haven't turned against it and that they this is the necessary cost of it i wonder if it becomes self-fulfilling as well after all these decades of propaganda telling you that the West is your enemy and then suddenly you're in a special military operation against this Nazi regime that's been told across your border and things are happening to you in Moscow and St petersburg yeah it it it reinforces the belief that you've been led yeah i mean I think we all think that Russian public opinion is probably quite brittle on this but of course you know they want to see them they they want to see their side win but increasingly they want to see the war over um they they want to see an end to this and and quite a a reasonable number the last time I was looking well over a third of those um pled said that oh we ought to make concessions to get it finished with we ought to make concessions to see an end to this they should tell the Russian delegation in a stumble that member had no concessions or maximist demands all right uh last quick one from Stanman do you think it's a clever idea publishing for all to see especially the Russians how you got your drones into their country well that's a yeah I I understand the the argument there that's a a sort judgment which the SBU and and Zalinski the SBU the special for special intelligence service um and the uh president's office will make you know do we get more out of showing the world that we can do this or keeping the Russians in the dark the point is that you know the Russians will work out pretty quickly um exactly how it was done um they they'll want to you know they'll want to do that so they will find out anyway within a week or two and and so the Ukrainians will will want to show the world what they could do it but it does mean that they will find it hard to do it again a second time just to that as well as you told me yesterday there's some senior Ukrainians who are in the states at the moment or at least were in the states while this was happening to kind of show look this is what we can do if you uh continue exactly yeah i mean Andre Yamak is there who's the chief of staff of Zilinski and that clearly he's he's he's talking to um uh the Congers on the Hill and Congress people to say &quot;Look we're not beaten you know we're not we're not we are the victim in this but we're not you know we're not dead and buried i mean we can still we can carry on we can fight we can hurt the Russians look at what we can do.&quot; All right let's move on to the final question um we're going to wrap two into one here one that we had sent to us from Joe from before and one that's come in while we've been talking michael and it's about the UK and the strategic defense review um indicated an increased risk of future conflict including attacks on the UK potentially is it time for the public to start preparing do you think well that's a good question actually because it's the great um unanswered question of the strategic defense review i mean the defense review is all about what what British defense is going to do and the government's on board for this and and so this is now government policy and we'll take it forward to NATO what nobody knows is whether the public will buy this because what the review has said is that we've got to stop thinking of ourselves now as in a period of prolonged peace um we are already at in a certain sort of war with Russia the Russians are already making war on us up to the threshold with cyber attacks with attacks on our pipelines um attacks on our our cables and it could get a lot worse and I think it it could get a lot worse in the next two or three years um we're not at military confrontation yet but that is the that's where we're heading and we've got to be prepared for that um we hope to avoid it by deterrence but to deter it you've got to be prepared to do it and the other side's got to see you can do it that you're capable of it and that you you're prepared to what we don't know is whether the British public will be on board for that um and we'll find out I guess in the next year or two when the sacrifices that have to be made to implement this defense review in terms of either higher taxes cuts in expenditure things we're talking about today with the spending review i mean we'll get to see what the real cost of this the opportunity cost of this review is over the next few months and then we'll get a sense of whether the you know public opinion will go along with it and of course we've spent more on defense before but the economy was different before the tax burden was not quite as high before it probably didn't feel that bad you can tell me because we live through it Michael not not to say you're much older than me but you know that feeling that you know we're spending all this on defense and yet our schools don't work and our hospitals are are full up maybe wasn't so efficient it is problematic yeah i mean in terms of the tax burden we're about middle of the European scale you know we're nowhere near the highest tax population in Europe we're about middle of the scale um but undoubtedly people feel that we are taxed to the hilt because we expect much more of government now i mean compared to 50 years ago when I was a youngster we you know government just didn't do certain things which now everyone assumes it must do yeah and so the you know expectations of government are much higher and they're they're expensive and so we now have you know we're in this situation where we now have to take some pretty big decisions and will we duck the defense uh requirement maybe we will i don't know i hope we don't but maybe we will well onto our final question then from John Smith who's put this in as who's been watching along thank you for this John if Michael Clark were leading the defense review what would you prioritize in the budget well um I would if I were involved with it I would um prioritize the sort of things that are in it i mean it's it's transformational and that means that you've got to put a lot of effort into the development of of real AI digitizing the forces things that won't show up very much it's not ships tanks and planes so much although we do need new generations of those things but it's it's laying the foundations of a digital force structure and what the government is saying what the review says which I agree with is that we want to and if we can we want to increase the lethality of our forces by 10fold in a decade now that sounds a big ask it's not implausible in the modern world but and then we've got to use that that that new transformed ability to be a small but very effective military power to to contribute it to our allies our European allies particularly Northern Europe to take a not necessarily the leading role but to take a leading role which helps to solidify our defense and our sense of reassurance particularly in Northern Europe and amongst our big partners of France Germany Italy to a lesser extent because Italy is southern Europe and it's on a different track in some ways but certainly France Germany the United Kingdom and our North European partners we are the essence of I think of security for this country for the next 60 70 years but to make that to get that right we've got to look after the north North Europe the North Atlantic and we've got to transform our forces so that they can do these sorts of things with less um heavy metal i said it was the last question but I want to put you on the spot Michael sorry about this what would you cut then in public services to achieve that cuz some or if not cut in public services what would you do to raise the money how would you get there yeah I I for me it's got to be a combination of of higher tax and and um spending cuts and so you can say you know some of the some in the of the welfare area is probably going to end up being cut don't want to see it but probably would have to do that um possibly some of the environmental area would be you know possibly cut um you you don't really want to try to you know sacrifice education and you you certainly want to restrain the growth in spending on health because we're you know we're doing sort of 60 billion on defense we're doing over 300 billion on health um and by common consent although we all love our health service um some of that spending isn't as efficient as it should be so it it's a combination of of public expenditure cuts somewhere um and higher taxes elsewhere and you can do certain amount by extra borrowing um you can borrow as long as the international community or the the financial community thinks you're borrowing responsibly they won't punish you for doing it if they think you're borrowing irresponsibly then you'll get punished by you know bond rates will will suddenly go up it'll cost more to borrow and so on so you can you can add an element of extra borrowing if as the EU countries are now doing um if you can convince the international markets that this is responsible that it will have a growth impact and that you can still afford to pay the interest on the stuff you borrow so it's not impossible you can do some of it like that well there you go Chancellor Michael's answered it all for you the spending review next week and on that thing about the borrowing I think there is a school of thought that's looking at some of these investment banks aren't there as well that go specifically towards defense and rearmament absolutely i mean getting some more private capital into uh putting liquidity into the defense business and even the services are talking about that the army's talking about that um you know don't regard defense as somehow an evil necessity you know get into it because it's all part of preserving our freedoms and it will have a growth impact it will help as well that's the argument yeah Professor Clark always great to have your thoughts your brain magnificent love the conversation as always thank you very much for being with us and submitting all your questions we will do another one of these next week schedules being aligned so thank you enjoy the rest of your afternoons and we'll see you again very soon" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="so here's the thing about climate change statistics the the data can be kind of dense so here's some real information from the World Meteorological Organization uh quote &quot;There's a 70% chance that the increase in the 2025 to 2029 5-year mean near surface temperature will exceed 1.5 degrees C.&quot; If that sentence made you want to change the channel please don't one uh and two I'll make a bargain with you i'll bring in a comedian an actor a man named David Cross who you recognize from Arrested Development and many other shows to tackle this problem in a better way it's the idea behind Climate Science Translated a British video campaign that's now here in the US making its debut cross works with a renowned climate scientist named Michael Oppenheimer of Princeton and uses humor to make all the dense science stuff a little bit more accessible uh and to communicate the urgent need for action here's a little taste of the PG version a lot of fbombs in the other one hi I'm Michael Oppenheimer professor of geocciences at Princeton University hi I'm David Cross and I am not a scientist so you can trust me joking the climate crisis is no longer a matter of scientific projections or partisan politics it's well and truly here heat records are being broken all around the world in fact last year was the hottest year since the industrial era began translation: new world record yay woohoo millions of us have experienced extreme weather events ourselves from hurricanes to flooding to wildfires global warming makes many such events much more frequent as well as significantly more devastating pretty soon Netflix are going to switch all their disaster movies into their documentary section these unprecedented David Cross and Professor Oppenheimer join us now to talk about the campaign gentlemen thank you very much for being here i was telling you in the in the commercial break that I used to cover uh climate change almost exclusively over at MSNBC before I came here and I have to say I despared by the end because it felt like no one wanted to hear it it was the same story over over and over again it's really bad it's getting worse we have to change and yet we're not i'm happy there's a new approach and you have new energy david tell me about your approach and your energy well I mean you know part of it comes down to uh why not nothing else seems to have worked uh so I was approached by the folks at the BBC who had done this uh uh successful campaign in in the UK and um and yeah why not it's important it's fun i got to meet and now date Mike and um and yeah it's it's important and it's and it's a new approach that hopefully cuts through the noise you know and professor you know why did you want to be involved in this at one point in the video you say &quot;Do you think a bunch of scientists are going to convince people right because that's what you would think except it's not really happening why did you want to be part of this project that brings comedy to it?&quot; Well you need to explain something as complicated as climate change you need to present the information in a familiar context in ordinary English and most scientists can't do that when I say familiar context what's more familiar than comedy ordinary English who speaks the ordinary language who's more or better i know I'm almost a little insulted but that's okay that's all right okay average is off the chart it's you know that's what comedy does and comedy isn't the only way to do this some audiences prefer to hear it in a religious context the key thing though is stay faithful to the science don't exaggerate say things that are true but say them in a way that the average person can understand so then how do you go from someone laughing to a joke about climate change to actually doing something because people can just enjoy the content and move on well after you laugh after one laughs you tend to reflect on the thing you just laughed at it's kind of the oh yeah oh okay and then you move into the hopefully the uh being proactive part of it and doing something about it and you know there's not a lot you know you can get rid of as many plastic straws as you want but that's not going to do much you got to you got to kind I I mean I'm speaking for myself you got to vote people in who are going to uh have the courage and political will to do the bigger things that will make a difference i'm not a big believer in courage when it comes to our political leadership i think they do whatever they think will keep them in office right they are representatives in the truest sense right so it's really about political will so courage comes from knowing that the people want you to do something about something and a comedy or any sort of humorous context is a way to engage more people so then they're willing to do at least the med the minimum which is send a message to their leaders tell them &quot;We heard this we got it we want you to act one of the things that I think is uh most important and more perhaps the most effective way to do it is to tell people this is going to affect your pocketbook that's how you vote that's the preeminent reason you vote for the person you vote for always this talk to him about that that the this is going to you know really really affect your income and your uh and and will you know and we talk about that we talk about insurance rates going skyrocketing and not just your income the way the world looks in the future the way your children are going to have to live and their children i know it gets to a stretch if you go generations but if you keep it close your family that helps professor I'd be curious to know what your colleagues in political science think about it coming to this you'll have to have me come back to answer that later again I'm insulted is it is it hard to make climate change funny David you know uh it it's it's the hard part is to not get overwhelmed with the seriousness and the urgency of it if you can kind of get through that make a joke and not cry then yeah all right sometimes you got to laugh so you don't cry david Cross thank you so much" />

Okay But so are rich people the ultra rich a problem if they are using their money to invest and those investments become businesses and those those businesses employ people and juice the economy In other words a defense of rich people would include they are lifting through their large s so many other people and this being America we all have a chance to be that guy Absolutely Look that's an essential piece of the American story And I think if you actually look at American attitudes we're pretty ambivalent about big money 59% of Americans last year in a poll said they want to become a billionaire and the almost identical share of Americans 60% said billionaires are making the country less fair We're both cynical and aspirational at the same time Those numbers are getting a little more concerning over time because the fact is we do need people who prosper who innovate who take big risks This is essential to making America a stronger economy But as we've seen in our own history we also need people like the John D Rockefellers of the world who said you know I'm going to use some of my winnings to start the University of Chicago Andrew Carnegie said &quot;I'm gonna take my fortune and I'm going to start putting libraries in every small town in this country.&quot; And people are still going to libraries today with the Carnegie name on it So part of this is about saying to people there are a lot of different ways to be ultra rich And there are some great lessons and some not great lessons You talk about visiting survivalist compounds and how the ultra rich some of them are basically not necessarily doing what you're what you've just described but using their money to withdraw from society to prepare for the worst What did what did you experience yeah I remember a Silicon Valley CEO said to me &quot;I keep a helicopter gassed up all the time and I have a bunker in my house with an air filtration system I went to New Zealand to visit some of these places for this book.&quot; I think what happens is when you get so high in the social and the income scale it's like a kind of vertigo You begin to feel vulnerable You're sort of exposed And also curiously enough you're using the very platforms that you've built things like Reddit things like uh other social media platforms are giving you a sense of the social distress You hearing people complain that they can't get a mortgage to get that starter home And so you come away with a very pronounced sense of social fragility What I heard from some other CEOs in Silicon Valley was &quot;I hope that my peers begin to say let's spend less money on our own bunkers and more money on protecting the most vulnerable because that might diffuse the tension.&quot; I'm trying to imagine the gastup helicopter escape story three generations from now after some apocalyptic experience It's like so bizarre to me Uh a singular version of the and we escaped Europe by getting on the boats and then we came to America It's like the inequality is wild Just one statistic before we go 25 hedge fund managers this is from your book make more money than all kindergarten teachers in America combined Just shocking Amazing Thank you so much Evan Thank you" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="Bilawal Sidhu: Eric Schmidt, thank you for joining us. Let's go back. You said the arrival of non-human intelligence is a very big deal. And this photo, taken in 2016, feels like one of those quiet moments where the Earth shifted beneath us, but not everyone noticed. What did you see back then that the rest of us might have missed? Eric Schmidt: In 2016, we didn't understand what was now going to happen, but we understood that these algorithms were new and powerful. What happened in this particular set of games was in roughly the second game, there was a new move invented by AI in a game that had been around for 2,500 years that no one had ever seen. Technically, the way this occurred was that the system of AlphaGo was essentially organized to always maintain a greater than 50 percent chance of winning. And so it calculated correctly this move, which was this great mystery among all of the Go players who are obviously insanely brilliant, mathematical and intuitive players. The question that Henry, Craig Mundie and I started to discuss, right, is what does this mean? How is it that our computers could come up with something that humans had never thought about? I mean, this is a game played by billions of people. And that began the process that led to two books. And I think, frankly, is the point at which the revolution really started. BS: If you fast forward to today, it seems that all anyone can talk about is AI, especially here at TED. But you've taken a contrarian stance. You actually think AI is underhyped. Why is that? ES: And I'll tell you why. Most of you think of AI as, I'll just use the general term, as ChatGPT. For most of you, ChatGPT was the moment where you said, &quot;Oh my God, this thing writes, and it makes mistakes, but it's so brilliantly verbal.&quot; That was certainly my reaction. Most people that I knew did that. BS: It was visceral, yeah. ES: This was two years ago. Since then, the gains in what is called reinforcement learning, which is what AlphaGo helped invent and so forth, allow us to do planning. And a good example is look at OpenAI o3 or DeepSeek R1, and you can see how it goes forward and back, forward and back, forward and back. It's extraordinary. In my case, I bought a rocket company because it was like, interesting. BS: (Laughs) As one does. ES: As one does. And it’s an area that I’m not an expert in, and I want to be an expert. So I'm using deep research. And these systems are spending 15 minutes writing these deep papers. That's true for most of them. Do you have any idea how much computation 15 minutes of these supercomputers is? It's extraordinary. So you’re seeing the arrival, the shift from language to language. Tthen you had language to sequence, which is how biology is done. Now you're doing essentially planning and strategy. The eventual state of this is the computers running all business processes, right? So you have an agent to do this, an agent to do this, an agent to do this. And you concatenate them together, and they speak language among each other. They typically speak English language. BS: I mean, speaking of just the sheer compute requirements of these systems, let's talk about scale briefly. You know, I kind of think of these AI systems as Hungry Hungry Hippos. They seemingly soak up all the data and compute that we throw at them. They've already digested all the tokens on the public internet, and it seems we can't build data centers fast enough. What do you think the real limits are, and how do we get ahead of them before they start throttling AI progress? ES: So there's a real limit in energy. Give you an example. There's one calculation, and I testified on this this week in Congress, that we need another 90 gigawatts of power in America. My answer, by the way, is, think Canada, right? Nice people, full of hydroelectric power. But that's apparently not the political mood right now. Sorry. So 90 gigawatts is 90 nuclear power plants in America. Not happening. We're building zero, right? How are we going to get all that power? This is a major, major national issue. You can use the Arab world, which is busy building five to 10 gigawatts of data centers. India is considering a 10-gigawatt data center. To understand how big gigawatts are, is think cities per data center. That's how much power these things need. And the people look at it and they say, “Well, there’s lots of algorithmic improvements, and you will need less power.&quot; There's an old rule, I'm old enough to remember, right? Grove giveth, Gates taketh away. OK, the hardware just gets faster and faster. The physicists are amazing. Just incredible what they've been able to do. And us software people, we just use it and use it and use it. And when you look at planning, at least in today's algorithms, it's back and forth and try this and that and just watch it yourself. There are estimates, and you know this from Andreessen Horowitz reports, it's been well studied, that there's an increase in at least a factor of 100, maybe a factor of 1,000, in computation required just to do the kind of planning. The technology goes from essentially deep learning to reinforcement learning to something called test-time compute, where not only are you doing planning, but you're also learning while you're doing planning. That is the, if you will, the zenith or what have you, of computation needs. That's problem number one, electricity and hardware. Problem number two is we ran out of data so we have to start generating it. But we can easily do that because that's one of the functions. And then the third question that I don't understand is what's the limit of knowledge? I'll give you an example. Let's imagine we are collectively all of the computers in the world, and we're all thinking and we're all thinking based on knowledge that exists that was previously invented. How do we invent something completely new? So, Einstein. So when you study the way scientific discovery works, biology, math, so forth and so on, what typically happens is a truly brilliant human being looks at one area and says, &quot;I see a pattern that's in a completely different area, has nothing to do with the first one. It's the same pattern.&quot; And they take the tools from one and they apply it to another. Today, our systems cannot do that. If we can get through that, I'm working on this, a general technical term for this is non-stationarity of objectives. The rules keep changing. We will see if we can solve that problem. If we can solve that, we're going to need even more data centers. And we'll also be able to invent completely new schools of scientific and intellectual thought, which will be incredible. BS: So as we push towards a zenith, autonomy has been a big topic of discussion. Yoshua Bengio gave a compelling talk earlier this week, advocating that AI labs should halt the development of agentic AI systems that are capable of taking autonomous action. Yet that is precisely what the next frontier is for all these AI labs, and seemingly for yourself, too. What is the right decision here? ES: So Yoshua is a brilliant inventor of much of what we're talking about and a good personal friend. And we’ve talked about this, and his concerns are very legitimate. The question is not are his concerns right, but what are the solutions? So let's think about agents. So for purposes of argument, everyone in the audience is an agent. You have an input that's English or whatever language. And you have an output that’s English, and you have memory, which is true of all humans. Now we're all busy working, and all of a sudden, one of you decides it's much more efficient not to use human language, but we'll invent our own computer language. Now you and I are sitting here, watching all of this, and we're saying, like, what do we do now? The correct answer is unplug you, right? Because we're not going to know, we're just not going to know what you're up to. And you might actually be doing something really bad or really amazing. We want to be able to watch. So we need provenance, something you and I have talked about, but we also need to be able to observe it. To me, that's a core requirement. There's a set of criteria that the industry believes are points where you want to, metaphorically, unplug it. One is where you get recursive self-improvement, which you can't control. Recursive self-improvement is where the computer is off learning, and you don't know what it's learning. That can obviously lead to bad outcomes. Another one would be direct access to weapons. Another one would be that the computer systems decide to exfiltrate themselves, to reproduce themselves without our permission. So there's a set of such things. The problem with Yoshua's speech, with respect to such a brilliant person, is stopping things in a globally competitive market doesn't really work. Instead of stopping agentic work, we need to find a way to establish the guardrails, which I know you agree with because we’ve talked about it. (Applause) BS: I think that brings us nicely to the dilemmas. And let's just say there are a lot of them when it comes to this technology. The first one I'd love to start with, Eric, is the exceedingly dual-use nature of this tech, right? It's applicable to both civilian and military applications. So how do you broadly think about the dilemmas and ethical quandaries that come with this tech and how humans deploy them? ES: In many cases, we already have doctrines about personal responsibility. A simple example, I did a lot of military work and continue to do so. The US military has a rule called 3000.09, generally known as &quot;human in the loop&quot; or &quot;meaningful human control.&quot; You don't want systems that are not under our control. It's a line we can't cross. I think that's correct. I think that the competition between the West, and particularly the United States, and China, is going to be defining in this area. And I'll give you some examples. First, the current government has now put in essentially reciprocating 145-percent tariffs. That has huge implications for the supply chain. We in our industry depend on packaging and components from China that are boring, if you will, but incredibly important. The little packaging and the little glue things and so forth that are part of the computers. If China were to deny access to them, that would be a big deal. We are trying to deny them access to the most advanced chips, which they are super annoyed about. Dr. Kissinger asked Craig and I to do Track II dialogues with the Chinese, and we’re in conversations with them. What's the number one issue they raise? This issue. Indeed, if you look at DeepSeek, which is really impressive, they managed to find algorithms that got around the problems by making them more efficient. Because China is doing everything open source, open weights, we immediately got the benefit of their invention and have adopted into US things. So we're in a situation now which I think is quite tenuous, where the US is largely driving, for many, many good reasons, largely closed models, largely under very good control. China is likely to be the leader in open source unless something changes. And open source leads to very rapid proliferation around the world. This proliferation is dangerous at the cyber level and the bio level. But let me give you why it's also dangerous in a more significant way, in a nuclear-threat way. Dr. Kissinger, who we all worked with very closely, was one of the architects of mutually assured destruction, deterrence and so forth. And what's happening now is you've got a situation where -- I'll use an example. It's easier if I explain. You’re the good guy, and I’m the bad guy, OK? You're six months ahead of me, and we're both on the same path for superintelligence. And you're going to get there, right? And I'm sure you're going to get there, you're that close. And I'm six months behind. Pretty good, right? Sounds pretty good. No. These are network-effect businesses. And in network-effect businesses, it is the slope of your improvement that determines everything. So I'll use OpenAI or Gemini, they have 1,000 programmers. They're in the process of creating a million AI software programmers. What does that do? First, you don't have to feed them except electricity. So that's good. And they don't quit and things like that. Second, the slope is like this. Well, as we get closer to superintelligence, the slope goes like this. If you get there first, you dastardly person -- BS: You're never going to be able to catch me. ES: I will not be able to catch you. And I've given you the tools to reinvent the world and in particular, destroy me. That's how my brain, Mr. Evil, is going to think. So what am I going to do? The first thing I'm going to do is try to steal all your code. And you've prevented that because you're good. And you were good. So you’re still good, at Google. Second, then I'm going to infiltrate you with humans. Well, you've got good protections against that. You know, we don't have spies. So what do I do? I’m going to go in, and I’m going to change your model. I'm going to modify it. I'm going to actually screw you up to get me so I'm one day ahead of you. And you're so good, I can't do that. What's my next choice? Bomb your data center. Now do you think I’m insane? These conversations are occurring around nuclear opponents today in our world. There are legitimate people saying the only solution to this problem is preemption. Now I just told you that you, Mr. Good, are about to have the keys to control the entire world, both in terms of economic dominance, innovation, surveillance, whatever it is that you care about. I have to prevent that. We don't have any language in our society, the foreign policy people have not thought about this, and this is coming. When is it coming? Probably five years. We have time. We have time for this conversation. And this is really important. BS: Let me push on this a little bit. So if this is true and we can end up in this sort of standoff scenario and the equivalent of mutually-assured destruction, you've also said that the US should embrace open-source AI even after China's DeepSeek showed what's possible with a fraction of the compute. But doesn't open-sourcing these models, just hand capabilities to adversaries that will accelerate their own timelines? ES: This is one of the wickedest, or, we call them wicked hard problems. Our industry, our science, everything about the world that we have built is based on academic research, open source, so forth. Much of Google's technology was based on open source. Some of Google's technology is open-source, some of it is proprietary, perfectly legitimate. What happens when there's an open-source model that is really dangerous, and it gets into the hands of the Osama bin Ladens of the world, and we know there are more than one, unfortunately. We don't know. The consensus in the industry right now is the open-source models are not quite at the point of national or global danger. But you can see a pattern where they might get there. So a lot will now depend upon the key decisions made in the US and China and in the companies in both places. The reason I focus on US and China is they're the only two countries where people are crazy enough to spend the billions and billions of dollars that are required to build this new vision. Europe, which would love to do it, doesn't have the capital structure to do it. Most of the other countries, not even India, has the capital structure to do it, although they wish to. Arabs don't have the capital structure to do it, although they're working on it. So this fight, this battle, will be the defining battle. I'm worried about this fight. Dr. Kissinger talked about the likely path to war with China was by accident. And he was a student of World War I. And of course, [it] started with a small event, and it escalated over that summer in, I think, 1914. And then it was this horrific conflagration. You can imagine a series of steps along the lines of what I'm talking about that could lead us to a horrific global outcome. That's why we have to be paying attention. BS: I want to talk about one of the recurring tensions here, before we move on to the dreams, is, to sort of moderate these AI systems at scale, right, there's this weird tension in AI safety that the solution to preventing &quot;1984&quot; often sounds a lot like &quot;1984.&quot; So proof of personhood is a hot topic. Moderating these systems at scale is a hot topic. How do you view that trade-off? In trying to prevent dystopia, let's say preventing non-state actors from using these models in undesirable ways, we might accidentally end up building the ultimate surveillance state. ES: It's really important that we stick to the values that we have in our society. I am very, very committed to individual freedom. It's very easy for a well-intentioned engineer to build a system which is optimized and restricts your freedom. So it's very important that human freedom be preserved in this. A lot of these are not technical issues. They're really business decisions. It's certainly possible to build a surveillance state, but it's also possible to build one that's freeing. The conundrum that you're describing is because it's now so easy to operate based on misinformation, everyone knows what I'm talking about, that you really do need proof of identity. But proof of identity does not have to include details. So, for example, you could have a cryptographic proof that you are a human being, and it could actually be true without anything else, and also not be able to link it to others using various cryptographic techniques. BS: So zero-knowledge proofs and other techniques. ES: Zero-knowledge proofs are the most obvious one. BS: Alright, let's change gears, shall we, to dreams. In your book, &quot;Genesis,&quot; you strike a cautiously optimistic tone, which you obviously co-authored with Henry Kissinger. When you look ahead to the future, what should we all be excited about? ES: Well, I'm of the age where some of my friends are getting really dread diseases. Can we fix that now? Can we just eliminate all of those? Why can't we just uptake these and right now, eradicate all of these diseases? That's a pretty good goal. I'm aware of one nonprofit that's trying to identify, in the next two years, all human druggable targets and release it to the scientists. If you know the druggable targets, then the drug industry can begin to work on things. I have another company I'm associated with which has figured out a way, allegedly, it's a startup, to reduce the cost of stage-3 trials by an order of magnitude. As you know, those are the things that ultimately drive the cost structure of drugs. That's an example. I'd like to know where dark energy is, and I'd like to find it. I'm sure that there is an enormous amount of physics in dark energy, dark matter. Think about the revolution in material science. Infinitely more powerful transportation, infinitely more powerful science and so forth. I'll give you another example. Why do we not have every human being on the planet have their own tutor in their own language to help them learn something new? Starting with kindergarten. It's obvious. Why have we not built it? The answer, the only possible answer is there must not be a good economic argument. The technology works. Teach them in their language, gamify the learning, bring people to their best natural lengths. Another example. The vast majority of health care in the world is either absent or delivered by the equivalent of nurse practitioners and very, very sort of stressed local village doctors. Why do they not have the doctor assistant that helps them in their language, treat whatever with, again, perfect healthcare? I can just go on. There are lots and lots of issues with the digital world. It feels like that we're all in our own ships in the ocean, and we're not talking to each other. In our hunger for connectivity and connection, these tools make us lonelier. We've got to fix that, right? But these are fixable problems. They don't require new physics. They don't require new discoveries, we just have to decide. So when I look at this future, I want to be clear that the arrival of this intelligence, both at the AI level, the AGI, which is general intelligence, and then superintelligence, is the most important thing that's going to happen in about 500 years, maybe 1,000 years in human society. And it's happening in our lifetime. So don't screw it up. BS: Let's say we don't. (Applause) Let's say we don't screw it up. Let's say we get into this world of radical abundance. Let's say we end up in this place, and we hit that point of recursive self-improvement. AI systems take on a vast majority of economically productive tasks. In your mind, what are humans going to do in this future? Are we all sipping piña coladas on the beach, engaging in hobbies? ES: You tech liberal, you. You must be in favor of UBI. BS: No, no, no. ES: Look, humans are unchanged in the midst of this incredible discovery. Do you really think that we're going to get rid of lawyers? No, they're just going to have more sophisticated lawsuits. Do you really think we're going to get rid of politicians? No, they'll just have more platforms to mislead you. Sorry. I mean, I can just go on and on and on. The key thing to understand about this new economics is that we collectively, as a society, are not having enough humans. Look at the reproduction rate in Asia, is essentially 1.0 for two parents. This is not good, right? So for the rest of our lives, the key problem is going to get the people who are productive. That is, in their productive period of lives, more productive to support old people like me, right, who will be bitching that we want more stuff from the younger people. That's how it's going to work. These tools will radically increase that productivity. There's a study that says that we will, under this set of assumptions around agentic AI and discovery and the scale that I'm describing, there's a lot of assumptions that you'll end up with something like 30-percent increase in productivity per year. Having now talked to a bunch of economists, they have no models for what that kind of increase in productivity looks like. We just have never seen it. It didn't occur in any rise of a democracy or a kingdom in our history. It's unbelievable what's going to happen. Hopefully we will get it in the right direction. BS: It is truly unbelievable. Let's bring this home, Eric. You've navigated decades of technological change. For everyone that's navigating this AI transition, technologists, leaders, citizens that are feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety, what is that single piece of wisdom or advice you'd like to offer for navigating this insane moment that we're living through today? ES: So one thing to remember is that this is a marathon, not a sprint. One year I decided to do a 100-mile bike race, which was a mistake. And the idea was, I learned about spin rate. Every day, you get up, and you just keep going. You know, from our work together at Google, that when you’re growing at the rate that we’re growing, you get so much done in a year, you forget how far you went. Humans can't understand that. And we're in this situation where the exponential is moving like this. As this stuff happens quicker, you will forget what was true two years ago or three years ago. That's the key thing. So my advice to you all is ride the wave, but ride it every day. Don't view it as episodic and something you can end, but understand it and build on it. Each and every one of you has a reason to use this technology. If you're an artist, a teacher, a physician, a business person, a technical person. If you're not using this technology, you're not going to be relevant compared to your peer groups and your competitors and the people who want to be successful. Adopt it, and adopt it fast. I have been shocked at how fast these systems -- as an aside, my background is enterprise software, and nowadays there's a model Protocol from Anthropic. You can actually connect the model directly into the databases without any of the connectors. I know this sounds nerdy. There's a whole industry there that goes away because you have all this flexibility now. You can just say what you want, and it just produces it. That's an example of a real change in business. There are so many of these things coming every day. BS: Ladies and gentlemen, Eric Schmidt. ES: Thank you very much. (Applause)" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="i'm Jimmy I'm the host Very kind Thank you for watching Thank you for joining us I'm glad you're here We have a um we have a special theme for the show tonight or at least for the monologue tonight It's a through line that seems to be running through everything lately And that through line is stupid This is going to be a stupid show And why not look around you We're living in the golden age of stupid right now We are unable to distinguish between fiction and fact We seem to have learned nothing from the past Science is now a matter of opinion According to researchers at John's Hopkins University since the pandemic vaccination rates for measles mumps and reubella are waning Fewer people are getting them for themselves and for their kids Turns out the only thing we learned from co co is how to make sourdough bread But in Hawaii vaccination rates have dropped 15% which it dangerously threatens what they call herd immunity Have you ever noticed that people who do their own research always do it wrong They're never like I did a deep dive and uh turns out every credible scientist in the world says we should get the measles vaccine So I did I Trump is actively waging war against Harvard University which seems to be one of the very few institutions with integrity right now They are fighting back Although according to CNN a lot of other colleges have begun quietly negotiating to avoid the president's wrath I hear Brown University just changed their name to Orange to appease him Trump right now is pushing back against a story from the best-selling author of multiple Trump tell alls Michael Wolf who says the real reason he's going after Harvard is because they didn't accept him when he was a student Trump responded &quot;Michael Wolf a third rate reporter who was laughed at even by the scoundrels of the fake news recently stated that the only reason I'm beating up on Harvard is because I applied there and didn't get in.&quot; The story is totally false I never applied to Harvard In other words he applied to Harvard Harvard is really in a terrible spot The White House trying to cut their funding They're threatening to revoke visas for foreign students This woman was one of the commencement speakers at Harvard She graduated from the school And pay attention to what's happening in the background while she talks because somehow it weirdly sums everything up The message itself is if I have to put it into one sentence it will be humanity rises and falls as one I think we are living in a very difficult time There's a lot of divisions in terms of know ideas um ethnicities identities and I think this is a time where we can use a little bit more moral imagination and imagine ourselves being connected with Yeah Or we could just keep beating each other's ass until we get hit by a truck You know Harvard may be the most elite university in the world but it is still in Boston Don't ever forget that Trump claims the reason for his battle with Harvard is he wants them to crack down on anti-semitism which is definitely why his people voted for him especially this guy who Trump pardoned on his first day He hates anti-semitism so much he wore a Camp Awitz hoodie to demonstrate But despite the overall feeling of gloom at our nation's universities our students are still graduating still having fun This is the scene at CalPoly Pomona where one new graduate started his postacademic career with a flip Scotty Nin The Nin is short for ninoop And then we have the high school version of that from South Plantation High School in Broward County Florida Ailio Rodriguez See this is what happens when you make the owner of the WWE Secretary of Education But the biggest flip of the day belongs to Elon Musk On Friday Trump gave Elon Musk the key to the White House And I guess he better change the locks because today Musk had something very nasty to say about Trump's big beautiful bill He wrote &quot;I'm sorry but I just can't stand it anymore This massive outrageous pork filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination Shame on those who voted for it You know you did wrong You know it.&quot; Boy when he's off the ketamine he is a lot less fun I mean he's right but shame on those who voted for it Who bankrolled these people that voted for it I want the name of whoever bankroll Oh wait It's his name For Elon Musk to call this a disgusting abomination is really saying something because this is the man who created this disgusting abomination Musk also tweeted that Congress is bankrupting America Yo Elon bro were you not paying attention when Trump said he was going to run the country like one of his businesses Trump versus Elon What an unexpected I'm not sure who to root for It's like Diddy versus R Kelly Obviously this was a um a big deal at the White House So uh they asked press secretary Karen Levit about it and she dodged that question like her boss did the draft How mad do you think President Trump is going to be when he finds out that Elon Musk said &quot;I'm sorry but I just can't stand it anymore This massive outrageous pork- fililled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination Shame on those who voted for it You know you did wrong You know it Look the president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill It doesn't change the president's opinion This is one big beautiful bill and he's sticking to it I love that the question is how angry is the president going to be Is it going to be Chernobyl or Vuvius Just going to be regular Mad or extra crispy either way She's very good at pretending grandpa is a sane individual Somehow Trump has managed to restrain himself and not lash out at Elon Musk probably for about 288 million reasons but it's only a matter of time Trump spent the day doing productive work He signed more in a series of important executive orders Sir the purpose of this executive order is for the beautifification of our national monuments specifically to augment the breasts on the Statue of Liberty You said that right now Lady Liberty is quote A5 and you felt that other countries are laughing at the size of the statue's bosom So this order allocates money meant for veteran housing to provide the Statue of Liberty with a 13 ton boob job He did a very good job didn't he How many people here could have done that I don't know I think a lot Now say I did a good job again Thanks Good job Guys I still have to give the president his bath So when he's done scribbling like a baby everybody applaud so that I can get home Is that it Yep Let's get you in the tub All right Okay Well that's a step in the right direction I'm for that The White House also unveiled Trump's new presidential portrait You know he wasn't happy with the one they shot for him when he took office in January so they he had them do it again And this is the new portrait It's called Sneering in the Dark Isn't that fun This is the last thing a McNugget sees before it dies They actually cropped the original photo was much wider They um they shot it on the Death Star Emperor Palpatini hand seated It's interesting because this was Trump's first presidential portrait in 2017 He's brightly lit He's smiling in front of American flag How did we get to this Could it be a robot clone of Donald Trump I mentioned last night Trump reposted an absolutely wacko conspiracy theory that says President Biden was really a robotic clone which was a topic of light-hearted conversation on Fox News That brings us right back to our theme tonight Apparently Donald Trump reposted somebody's post on Truth Social claiming that Biden had been executed in 2020 and was replaced by a robotic clone Clearly President Trump did not believe that I mean I know Trump's sense of humor I'm sure he was just trolling him What do you think Well I would hope so but I think also it gets to the real heart of this scandal which is who in the world was president for the past four years if it wasn't Joe Biden Was it a clone Was it a cable of White House officials Yes Was it a cable of White House officials Or even scarier a cabal of them That reminds me I need to cancel my subscription to Cabal Uh but don't let her misprononunciation distract you from the point she was making which was every bit as dumb as the word she got wrong Then we have our Secretary of Education Miss Linda McMahon who appeared before the Senate Appropriations Committee where Mark Wayne Mullen made a strong case for improving education in his home state of Oklahoma And what was we ranked in reading and math in 1979 I'm sorry what What was we ranked nationally in math and and and reading in 1979 You hearded me What was we ranked Was we reading good or reading bad That's what happens when you get homeschooled by your dog Luckily for Mark Wayne he wasn't the only dummy at the hearing He had some serious competition from Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana We spend $1.858 858 billion dollar a year on TRIO Yes More than 10 years Yes So that's over a trillion dollars we've spent on this program Madam Secretary and I'm not a great mathematician but I think you were talking about a trillion dollars Uh I believe 1.5 billion times 10 is $15 billion That's a little bit off from a trillion dollars I think the the budget cuts 1.2 billion for Well 1.2 that would be 12 billion not three Okay Okay All right Now we finally found a dumber Kennedy than RFK These are the people These are the people responsible for passing our budget They can't do simple math And to top it off we have a new character throwing his stunts cabinet in the ring the acting head of FEMA the guy in charge of the department supposed to help us after a natural disaster told his staff yesterday he wasn't aware the United States had a hurricane season which obviously had some of his staff concerned Then a spokesperson tried to spin it by telling the press he was joking This is the guy His name is David Richardson You tell me does this look like a guy who was joking This is There's not a funny bone in this body He looks like Vgo the Carpathian's mean older brother silently watching you drown It's Is there anyone in this administration who knows how to do their job You know there used to be a political party in the United States called the Nothings They didn't call themselves that They called themselves the American Party which they wanted to make America great again by kicking out the immigrants who back then were the Germans and the Irish like these two uh seen here stealing an election Does this sound familiar to anybody The Nothings argued that Germany and Ireland weren't sending their best people They were sending unskilled wretched refues like this guy Frederick Trump and this kid Patrick Kennedy And they had to go but they didn't go And now their ancestors are the new no nothings Including our head of homeland security Christy I don't know what habius corpus means Gnome And our secretary of education doesn't know the difference between AI and A1 And Pete I don't know who's on my signal thread or that I shouldn't be using Signal Hegth And now David I didn't know there was a hurricane season Richardson I hope we don't have a situation We have to put this new guy to the test But hurricane season is here And those individuals who still do work for FEMA Trump has already cut 2,000 of them want us to be ready when disaster does strike The following is a message from the Federal Emergency Management Agency Hurricane season is upon us and quite frankly it caught us off guard Uh with all the layoffs and budget cuts we just don't have the headsp space to deal with disasters this year So let's get you ready to be on your own Step one get a whistle That way if there's a flood and you get stuck in a raft or something you can blow it and maybe someone will help Step two sandbags Get some bags put sand in them That'll be good for something Step three get a membership to Mara Lago God sends hurricanes to punish drag queens and destroy woke libraries but God loves and protects President Trump and all his many properties And finally step four learn to like cat food Not just eat it like it Cat food is cheap and it's not as bad as you think Cat food has all the vitamins you need and it's a great way to bond with your pets So good luck I guess from those of us who were left here at FEMA Remember God helps those who help themselves This was a message from FEMA Paid for by your friends at Meow Mix Meow Mix not just for cats anymore I'm more of a fancy fish guy but that's GMO Do you know how many subscribers we have on YouTube now Uh 20 million That's right Yeah that's why we're wearing these glasses Thanks for being a subscriber If you're not help us get to 20 million and one" />

Amy Goodman with Narin Sheh we turn now to Gaza where more evidence is coming to light about how Israel has systematically used Palestinians as human shields in violation of both international and Israeli law that's the conclusion of a new investigation by the Associated Press based on interviews with Israeli soldiers and with Palestinians who said they were used as human shields to inspect buildings tunnels and other sites in Gaza and the occupied West Bank the AP reports the Israeli soldiers said the practice was used in part to spare combat dogs from injury or death one Israeli sergeant admitted to using Palestinians as young as 16 years old as human shields in February the news outlet 972 revealed how Israel used an 80-year-old man as a human shield troops tied an explosive cord around his neck then forced him to search abandoned buildings after he finished the mission he was ordered to flee but then another Israeli unit fatally shot him and his wife haratz and the Red Cross have also documented Israel's use of human shields the AP report is based in part on testimonies collected by Breaking the Silence a group made up of former Israeli soldiers opposed to the Israeli occupation the group's also released photos of Palestinians being used as human shields in Gaza we're joined now by the group's executive director Nadav Vimman he's a former Israeli soldier joining us from Tel Aviv thanks so much for being with us tell us what information you collected the Israeli soldiers you talked to and how exactly they are using Palestinians as human shields so Amy I've got to say that from the beginning of this war we got testimonies from soldiers that told us they they were ordered by senior officers to grab Palestinians next to them and to use them as human shields meaning that they were they were ordered to send Palestinians some of them were dressed up with IDF uniform cameras on their uh head or on their chest and then they were sent into tunnels and houses to check that there isn't any IEDs or explosive over there so the soldier could enter safely or clear the area and um we got testimonies from different units different times and different places in the Gaza Strip which shows as you said that it's widely spread this protocol and Nadav as far as you know how long has this practice been in place now um the first testimony that we have is from December 2023 meaning immediately after the ground invasion started and the last testimony that we had is from the beginning of this year beginning of 2025 just before the ceasefire and and it's something that the IDF is using more and more and more more units and more areas throughout the war and to what extent are you aware of soldiers resisting uh these orders to use Palestinians as human shields yeah so so it's interesting now every almost every soldier in the IDF learned about the fact that we used Palestinians as human shield during the second back then we called it the neighbor procedure when you come to arrest a high-ranking Palestinian or you know that he's armed so you grab the next door neighbor and you told the neighbor you knock on the door not me and maybe he will get shot and if nobody shot him then we told them get inside the house open all of the doors and open all of the lights so we will be more safe and that was banned by the Supreme Court in Israel in the end of the second father so the reserveist in the Israeli army grew up on that history that we did something it was bad but it was banned and that's it and now they got a command that is exactly that but I can say even worse actually right because he's dressing them up in IDF uniform some of the soldiers told us that it's maybe that they will be the target so they will get shot now the the thing is is that our testifier told us there was a debate inside their unit but it's our testifiers right i just read an oped in of an officer that served in Gaza and he said that almost every platoon is using human shields right so our testifiers told us there was a debate they came to their senior officers and told them hey you know that's we were trying to fight not to use human beings as human shields or that dea dehumanization of Palestinians or that's immoral or illegal or I don't know what but I cannot tell you what's going on in the greater IDF at the moment so explain the Dav why this is called the mosquito procedure and also talk about what these Israeli soldiers told you about what happens to the Palestinians many forced into houses buildings tunnels um that are suspected being booby trapped allegedly made to perform tasks like um looking for explosives uh in tunnels yeah so first of all a lot of things that uh the IDF has names for I don't know the reason but I can say that mosquito it's it's like it's a bug that flies in the air and like you can kill it who cares about it and that and that was the relationship a lot of times between the soldiers and those individual that were used and that's the word they were used right we have a testifier that called them a sub army of slaves now the the protocol is quite simple you need that individual with you for a period of time two days three days a week three weeks so it means that only when he's scanning a tunnel or an or a house or an alley so he doesn't have handcuffs or a blindfold the rest of the time when you're he's with you inside the house you need to feed him you need to take him to the bathroom uh but he's also handcuffed and blindfold so you need to help him in some unit there were um the mosquitoes inside the house were used to clean the house where the the soldier um stayed so it's not only you know don't only think about that time in the tunnel when they need to endanger their life think about the rest of the time the majority of the day that they they were living with the soldiers inside the house but again eventually they were supposed to be um released so it's um again I'm quoting that soldier a sub army of slaves and Nadav could you talk about the context in which this news has been coming out where there's mounting uh anger against Netanyahu protests all across the country yesterday uh for refusing to agree to a deal that would uh guarantee the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza if you could explain what the mood is uh in Israel uh the repeated calls for Netanyahu to step down you've said that he's acting like a dictator yeah so from the very beginning of this war we and other human rights organization we called for a deal to release our hostages ceasefire and enter humanitarian aid into Gaza now at the beginning we are we were a minority at the protest but as as this war it's hard for me to call it a war because as a soldier they told me that the war it's two armies fighting one another so is this intensive operation in Gaza went so long and we killed so many civilians and we lost so many of our soldiers and also we also some of our hostages more and more Israelis are resisting this war and if you look at polls in Israel at the moment you can see that the majority of Israelis meaning even BB's voters I believe are against the continuence of this war and pro- hostage deal and pro- ending this war and and you can see the atmosphere on the streets um what happened yesterday it was the 600 day uh of this uh operation or since October 7th and and we saw a lot of anger you know protesters in Tel Aviv took over the headquarters of the Liut party in Tel Aviv for a couple of hours right and they and they put signs they said it's the embassy of Qatar because of the allegation that Qatar paid for the close advisers of BB to support them more than anything else but but but I can say that what changed is in the mid mid-March when we returned fighting in Gaza when we continue bombing in Gaza and we broke the ceasefire and we stopped releasing our hostages the majority of of the audience in Israel understood that this is a war to protect BB's seat and BB's government not to release our hostages not to fight Kamas and not to defend our borders because if that was the case we will go to a hostage deal like um uh like Witkov help us achieve uh the minute Trump step into office now what we saw yesterday is more and more Israelis understanding that we are being lied to that our soldiers are sent to die and to be killed for themselves without any good reason without without releasing our hostages or ending this war i wanted to turn uh for a last example to the occupied West Bank israel admitting to strapping a wounded Palestinian man to the hood of an Israeli military vehicle during a raid on Janine relatives and neighbors of the man Mujahed Azmi said Israeli soldiers used him as a human shield instead of allowing him to get medical care after he'd been shot this is 13-year-old Alme speaking last year we told them we want an ambulance for the wounded person in the room so the army told us to bring him to them we got him outside and for about an hour or half an hour we kept asking for an ambulance then we called one 15 minutes later two jeeps came and they got in here the troops told us to turn around and not to look and they put mujah on the jeep's hood and took him after video of the incident went viral the Israeli military released a statement claiming the action was quote in violation of orders and standard operating procedures um Nadav if you can talk about how Israel is responding now to this latest news of this much more widespread use of exactly this kind of example now first of all I've got to say that IDF spokesperson a lot of times when they are confronted with something bad that soldier did that are against regulation they said it's against regulation we will educate the soldiers a mistake and that's it no investigation no nothing now I've got to say that that now the IDF announced that uh six investigation were opened after the IDF soldiers used Palestinian human shield in Gaza and it's a joke right because we have so many more incidents and even Yaniv Kubovich from Harit's newspapers published a couple of months ago that Helsi then commander-in-chief of the IDF was sitting in the meeting room while the mosquito protocol was discussed meaning that everybody knew now I've got to say that connects to something a lot bigger in the Israeli society and that's demonization of Palestinians right since October 7th it's even on steroids right we have government members that openly talking about genocide right when the head of the Labor Party Golan last week said that the right-wing politician likes to kill Palestinian kids and babies he was called as a traitor by our government you know we have ministers saying there isn't any innocent in Gaza that all of the Palestinians are assisting terror or terrorists by themselves and that sips down into the IDF into command that soldier are getting and if you connect that with the fact that we have more and more soldier officers and commanders in the IDF that comes from the religious rightwing or for the settler movement and believe that maybe it's a holy war uh not a war of defending ourselves you can understand why you have such a huge amount of those kind of incident dehumanization of Palestinians in in Israel uh became something so common that it also leads to this kind of practices inside the IDF nav want to thank you for being with us executive director of breaking the silence a whistleblower group of former Israeli soldiers democracy Now is funded by viewers like you please give today at

          <attvalue for="6" value="if you go back to the World War World War II the admiral who had been tasked with planning Pearl Harbor thought it was a really bad idea he went through and obviously followed orders but he thought it was a very bad idea because he had spent a substantial amount of time studying in the United States when he was younger and his conclusion was that attacking the United States was a bad idea because even though at the time militarily we were behind the Japanese certainly technologically and otherwise we had factories and we had access to raw material and resources and he knew that over time once those factories and those raw materials were put to the war machine the Japanese would not be able to keep up and you could very well argue that the end of World War II that the victory in World War II both in Europe and especially in Asia was the result of America's industrial capacity when the Japanese lost the plane they lost the plane when we lost the plane and their planes were better than ours for a long time when we lost the plane we were able to produce hundreds to replace it industrial capacity mattered in terms of national security and that's never changed that's always been true and so today what you find is because of all of those years of neglect because of the loss of industrial capacity we didn't just undermine our society we didn't just undermine our domestic economy we've undermined our position in the world and what you will find and what we find even now is that increasingly on geopolitical issue after geopolitical issue it is access to raw material and industrial capacity that is at the core both of the decisions that we're making and the areas that we're prioritizing it's be now the the technologies are different but nonetheless that is what we're increasingly prioritizing and that that's become really apparent to me i think it was even going into this job but in the months that I've been there um place after every country in the world is now pitching themselves as a source of rare earth minerals every country in the world by the way they're not that rare so every country has access to it but it's become a big Oh but but but it's that alone is not enough because you have to have access to rare earth minerals but then you have to have the ability to process them and you have to have to make them into usable material and frankly what the Chinese have done over the last 25 or 30 years is they've cornered the market and this is one of the true challenges to sort of pure free enterprise view of these things you cannot compete with a nation state who has decided they're not interested in making money they they don't they're not interested in making money in this field they are interested in in the short term in dominating the market being the sole source provider for the world of a certain product because once you establish industry dominance in any one of these fields you can charge the world whatever you want now one thing is if we said &quot;Well this happened because they're just better than us.&quot; But that's not why it happened it happened because we literally gave it away because we made the decision we made the policy decision that it was okay we were okay with 80s something% of the active ingredients and most of our generic pharmaceuticals coming from another country we were okay with giving that away we were okay with giving away all kinds of things like that and now now we are in a crunch and I say we I mean the rest of the world is in a crunch because we have realized that our industrial capability is deeply dependent on a number of potential adversary nation states including China who can hold it over our head and so in many ways the the nature of geopolitics has now adjusted to that and is adjusting to that and it'll be one of the great challenges of the new century and one of the priorities of this administration under President Trump is to reorient our domestic and and the way we pursue geopolitics to take into account for the fact that you can never be secure as a nation unless you're able to feed your people and unless you're able to make the things that your economy needs in order to function and ultimately to defend yourself [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="want to start this morning with some breaking news that we are following out of the Middle East. take a look. This is some of the video out of Iran. as we cover this developing story. Iran supreme leader Ayatollah, Ali ham has now criticized and appears to have flat out rejected. a proposal by the US amid negotiations over to Ron's rapidly advancing nuclear program. his remarks a short refuses to give up enriching uranium in any possible deal. which is essentially the purpose of any kind of deal with the US. The demand has been made repeatedly by President Trump and his administration Ation though, because of the meetings have happened behind closed doors. It's not quite clear yet. Exactly how much. us Middle East Envoy, Steve, witkoff discussed in his initial proposal. Homine did not reject. future talks between the US and Iran on the issue. But again, reiterated that Iran will continue to enrich uranium which is a major step forward in its nuclear program and building nuclear weapons. Homine also did not insist on any specific, level of nuclear enrichment. Iran now does enrich uranium up to 60%? a short technical step from weapons grade levels? Iran's foreign minister, who has led the talks with witcoff said to Ron soon will offer its response officially to the US. Comm during his speech saying quote, if we had 100 nuclear power plants, while not having enrichment, they are not usable for us. If we do not have enrichment, then we should EX send our hand. begging to the US. the 86 year old who does have the final say on all matters of State in Iran often matters his remarks over the demands of reformists within the country who want the talks against Hardline elements within Iran's theocracy including the paramilitary Revolutionary guard. Late in August How many in a speech opened the door to possible talks with the US? saying there is quote, no, harm in engaging with the quote unquote enemy the supreme leader later Tempered that saying that negoti. with the America quote are not wise or honorable after president Trump did float nuclear talks with Tron. Do want to pop this up on your screen because we are getting reaction and that includes from the Israel war room saying that Iran's Chief terrorist alihan publicly rejected president Trump's nuclear deal offered today. Vowing the regime will keep enriching uranium The US has reiterated its zero Tolerance stance on enrichment. Warning, It would enable Iran's Regime to build nuclear weapons Now at this point, we have not heard a response from president Trump but I imagine once he does hear about this, he will be posting on his truth. social page. So we will bring you that information. right here. on live. Now from Fox as we do get it. in the meantime, I do want to head out to the Middle East as we do have the latest happening between the US and Hamas over in Gaza. Trey enst reporting from the scene. family members of Palestinians killed by By Israeli bullets. weep over the bodies of their loved ones. Israeli soldiers, fired on dozens of people who were just over a quarter mile from an Aid distribution. site. asked about the shooting the Israeli military said quote, the IDF is aware of reports regarding casualties. and the details of the incident are being looked into the military confirmed firing on these Palestinians and says that they had deviated from a designated route. A spokesman for Israel's prime minister confirmed the incident took place before claiming without evidence that the IDF did not fire at civilians near the Aid distribution zones. Israel is not preventing gazans from accessing humanitarian Aid and the IDF did not fire at civilians. in. or near a distribution Zone. All of the injured were of different ages the majority were young men in civilian clothing and included children and women the latest incident comes as Israeli Soldiers are expanding ground operations against Hamas. over the weekend 3. Israeli soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb that Hamas planted in Northern Gaza. The Trump Administration is calling for a diplomatic solution. to end the ongoing War. stop the suffering of Palestinian civilians and bring the remaining hostages held by Hamas home. These are imperfect. situations for catastrophic areas. where the rest of the world is wanted this to be done. We have to try Um and that's what that's what they're doing. so far diplomatic. IC efforts to reach a ceasefire have failed Both Israel and Hamas have agreed to a deal. but they're looking at different agreements. in Tel. Aviv Trey in Fox News. Trey, thank you so much And as I mentioned, once we do get additional information, on that rejection. from Iran, we will make sure to bring that to you here. on live now from Fox.

          <attvalue for="6" value="been quite a few incidents uh not least the um drone attacks on those Russian bomber fleets so let's start with uh with some of that and the potential Russian response so Sean asks &quot;Will Russia go nuclear in response to these recent attacks um and if that were to happen how would the West respond?&quot; Yeah two questions what one's got a very standard answer and one's got a very different answer the second part the the standard answer and this question comes up again and again people always ask about you know would Russia use nuclear weapons and the answer doesn't change but people keep asking it so it deserves to be answered because it obviously is on people's minds fair enough and so I mean so the standard answer and this answer hasn't changed since from the beginning of the war is no very very unlikely firstly the Russians have shown no indication any physical indication of bringing their tactical nuclear weapons forward or bringing any of the preparations together which we would see because it would take some time um they talk about nuclear issues all the time because they use the sort of nuclear rhetoric to frighten everybody and that is you know has had some effect but in practical terms no there's there's no preparation that we can detect for any sort of nuclear use not only that there's there's no real advantage on the battlefield that the Russians could really get because Ukraine is a very big country and uh you know if they were to try to use a tactical nuclear weapon against Ukrainian forces they'd have to use several of And again I can go into the technicalities of this if people want to but you but effectively they'd have to use something like five or six Hashima sized bombs right to get rid of to actually destroy one Ukrainian brigade dispersed as they normally are one brigade of 5,000 troops and its equipment so they would have to go in for a nuclear war in a big way um and even then that would not you know it would destroy one Ukrainian brigade or maybe a little bit more or they'd have to launch two or three nuclear weapons at a at a city or a town as a retaliatory measure and that brings in the other issue that the the the taboo against nuclear use is very very strong since the Second World War sometime somebody's going to break it i mean that you know at some point in human history that will be broken i mean Putin wants to wants to go down in history as a great Russian leader i'm pretty sure he doesn't want to go down in history as the man who broke the taboo the first man to use nuclear weapons in an aggressive mode not even to defend his own country against the final some sort of final attack i mean that's what nuclear weapons do they provide a final guarantee that if all else fails and your country is under a threat of complete destruction you might then go nuclear that's what that's and Russia's nuclear doctrine is actually all about that so I think that the chances are very very very low now the second part of the question what would the west do if a nuclear weapon were used the the answer used to be under the Biden administration and this answer was never explicitly said by Biden but you know David Petraeus General David Petraeus independent he works for KKR now but he was director of CIA he was Britain's most America's most I say Britain because he's in Britain a lot he's he was America's most famous general during Afghanistan and Iraq well and he often would speak with the sort of private authority of the White House he didn't say things that were antithetical to White House thinking and he said a couple of times when this issue came up in 2023 he said &quot;If the Russians ever used a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine I'd be fairly confident,&quot; he said that the United States would would reply with conventional weapons we would destroy the Black Sea fleet we would attack every base from which tactical nuclear weapons had been used would take out the strategic air force of Russia that had done it with with conventional weapons the the response would be massive and conventional and would really hurt now that's what he said apparently independently but obviously consistent with American thinking so that was then this is now would the Trump administration do that no no you don't think so do you think they would if it I think they would well it'd be in a terrible mess if a nuclear weapon would you was used but I don't believe that Trump would initiate that sort of response because um as everyone who knows him and knows his relationship with Russia people like Fiona Hill the British academic you know associate with our defense who used to work for him she worked for three presidents including Trump she's written books about it and she says look he's frightened of Putin you know he admires Putin but he's frightened of him and he is Trump is very frightened or very res very very resistant to using um American firepower in a strategic way he might use American firepower against the Houthies and he might use it against uh you know against terrorist groups or small groups um where it's a very one-way process but the idea of using American firepower in a you know another uh Iraq operation say or something like that or I mean against Iran which is is you know on the table at the moment is quite is hard to imagine and the idea of using American firepower explicitly against Russia is almost completely off the table with that's so That's interesting and Putin would of course know that because Putin the expy would have calculated worked it out and perhaps knows that there is a threshold but it's interesting isn't it Michael because that threshold from what Petraeus was saying even in the event that nuclear weapons are used the response from the from the most powerful country on on earth under Petraeus or under under Biden would not be to go nuclear either because they know that is a threshold that you just can't you couldn't cross but if a nuclear weapon were used you you couldn't ignore it you couldn't say &quot;Well that's unfortunate and where do we go from here?&quot; There would have to be a response and then the other thing I didn't mention about that is that it's very unlikely that China would stick with Putin if he used a nuclear weapon because that would go down so badly in the rest of the global south and India would not stick with Putin i mean Putin would lose his most important supporters and backers if he broke this taboo so it's it's very very unlikely that that would happen it's certainly I mean I I could say with you know 99.99% certainty that in response to let's say an attack on the Kersh bridge his pride and joy he would not use nuclear weapons in response he would want to respond but not with a nuclear weapon we'll probably we'll come back to the coach bridge of course later on but it occurred to me as you were answering your question Mike because it's something that I've asked you since the very beginning of the invasion and we've talked about it a lot and you've been very clear in your in your thinking and reassuring to me in in your responses but you know nuclear weapons aren't the only weapon of mass destruction you know that the Russians have been using gas on the front lines to try and flush out Ukrainian um trench positions is there any suggestion that the Russians could use another kind of of weapon that doesn't reach the threshold of nuclear but more than conventional chemical or biological yes there is i mean I mean you know the Russians always believe in retaliating against these sorts of big Ukrainian attacks and their retaliation has generally speaking been um more bombing you know fairly conventional bombing with drones and and ballistic missiles so I'm one would expect them to try to really step that up and have say you know four or five days of very intensive air attacks and make it very clear that that is their response so the Ukrainians know and the Ukrainians will have decided that that was likely they'll have already priced that in to their to their response but you can't rule out the idea that the Russians might begin to step over other thresholds say in biological warfare and chemical warfare i mean they've used um CS gas which is illegal interestingly to use on the battlefield in riots that's right you can use it in riots because it can disperse but used on the battlefield it can be used in lethal con or is used in lethal concentrations and has the effect of driving people into the open where they can be shot very easily so it is actually a banned weapon on the battlefield but the Russians there's lots and lots of reports of them using it using a lot of nerve agents um there were uh uh accusations they've been using sarin which I thought were credible before Christmas but then I I tried to track some of them down and they they sounded credible but then I couldn't find any really strong information well sarin will be in people's minds from Syria of course that's right yeah lots of sarin was used in Syria um but there's but there's a lot of um chlorine elements used CS gas um but I can't pin down other than accusations that sarin's been used i can't pin down any specific instances which proved but yes um and biological weapons no of the sort of things we've seen the Russians used in Britain is not impossible that they might go for their own sort of spectacular with a biological attack on a civilian population somewhere and that's that's plausible and it would be extremely unpleasant and it would be another threshold cross wouldn't it um next question here from a a poster called never the question thank you for this um and another one that I've asked you many many times Michael what psychological effect do these attacks have on Putin put yourself in Vladimir's mind oh these attacks um are believed to annoy him i was talking to somebody who keeps track on these things and he said that Putin's disappeared in the last 48 hours he's he's he's just not made any appearances which is unlike him um I because last week he was out quite a lot it was marked how how often you saw him popping up doing things i was talking to somebody last night who tracks these things and he said &quot;We haven't seen him for 48 hours.&quot; Um that could be a coincidence i don't know maybe he's got a cold who knows um but um he does these do affect him they really do because the the more um audacious they are the more humiliating it is for Russian defense forces I mean Russian air defenses and of course he always makes sure one of the reasons he doesn't come onto TV immediately is because it would look as if the blame was his and so he always makes sure that the blame is laid on the regional governor or somebody lower down in the air defense control or whatever it might be and always you go back to you know the puzzin um attempted coup which was very serious i mean he was very shaken by that when Pgozinian and the Vagna group began to advance from Rosstov on Moscow and were shooting incredible Saturday afternoon that was astonishing yeah were you on then i I well I was I was on it and then I went home and I was watching it watching it go along because you you didn't know where it was going to end no I was on for part of it and then missed the rest of it on air anyway but um yeah but I mean you know they were shooting down their own Russian aircraft it was astonishing and he went missing he went missing for days um and you know when he came back he looked shaken and so on but he makes sure to deflect attention from these things and they're always put down as as terrorist acts you know extensive terrorist acts and we're dealing with it and interestingly after the um the the airfield bombs at the weekend on Sunday they arrested lots of people they always do that they always arrest somebody within 24 hours oh we've got the perpetrators they always say that strung them up some Yes somebody gets arrested every time within hours what is the narrative as to as to what went so badly wrong for the Russian security services that allowed this to happen well only that was some ingenious terrorist attacks and I haven't heard I may be wrong about this but so far I haven't heard a a really strong uh account from Russia as to how it happened the Russian bloggers are are circulating what's circulating in the west these these um uh uh containers where the roof kind of peels back and reveals all these first person drones i mean that's astonishingly clever and that's going around on the blogersphere in Russia but I don't think Russian main channels have have used that material so far they've just talked about um attacks terrorist attacks on their airfields as if it's been groups of terrorists as far away as uh um beluga ble ink yeah i mean they went all the way across Russia just incredible the fact that they're in Mansk in the north yeah to get there um because this this Sorry I said Ba the air base is is Ble in Kusk because of course it's a special military operations it's not it's not a war it's not a war so these can't be acts of war can't be happening like and so they can't blame the SBU they can't blame the Ukrainian security services or or can well they can know that what they say is that the SBU are setting off terrorist groups they're sending Ukrainian terrorists or Russian terrorists working for Ukraine to commit these acts so everything is everything that happens in Russia is a terrorist act even though you we can argue about it but these are are by most standards legitimate acts of war against military targets in a state that has invaded its neighbor just on that because that's interesting these are legitimate there's nothing that you could in terms of international law whether or not you can strike that deep into Well no you can certainly strike deep into an an opposing country if you're at war with it um the the marginal line is assassinations of individuals and so if uh and again assassination of a military officer which has happened um is a bit more questionable you could argue that that's a terrorist act but there is a legal precedent for saying well there's no other way of getting at that officer and that officer is intrinsic to the war that they're waging against you so you have a right if you take reasonable precautions only to kill that officer or to affect that officer then that's arguable but it does get close to the borderline with terrorism but attack so individual attacks on individuals are difficult to justify more difficult but attacks on bases and facilities are straightforward in in legal terms get on with that okay next question here from HJ um could Ukraine destroy the Kirch Bridge outright or is it enough to keep targeting it and causing inconvenience after inconvenience for Russia so I think this is the third time they've targeted the Kirch Bridge um we saw that truck bomb or explosion very early October 22 and then July 23 was a sort of baby drone attack which sea drones sea drones which got underneath and damaged fair and so this is the third one yeah um yes very hard to destroy the bridge in total it's 12 mi long so it's the longest bridge in Europe um it's I'm pretty sure it's the biggest bridge the Russians have ever built or the longest bridge they've ever built i think I'm going to check the the figure 12 mi long is I think is fairly secure and I know it's it's Europe's longest bridge i'm trying to work out exactly when they when it came into sort of use cuz uh 2018 I think okay so 2018 so I'm right it was post them annexing Crimea oh yeah that was the idea they annexed Crimea in 2014 or or or conquered Crimea in 2014 which is illegal and then built a bridge to Crimea which is which is also illegal because it's a a bridge that the Ukrainians certainly didn't agree to there used to be a ferry the Kurdish ferry when the when the 2014 um uh seizure of Crimea took place and I was at Russi then and we were looking very carefully at the Kurdish ferry we had a really good Russian specialist with us who said you look at this ferry said it can only take about six vehicles you know three times a day completely inadequate for there's no way they can supply you know Crimea as it as it then stood with the Kurdish ferry and he said they'll have to build a bridge and we said you know really Eagle are you sure he said &quot;Yeah yeah they'll build a bridge they will.&quot; He was absolutely right yeah and you were right 2018 it came in 2018 yeah so it took him four years to build it but it's it's Putin's pride and joy um all bridges can be repaired which is why the when the Ukraans have tried to attack it they tried to attack the vulnerable part which is the part with the arches on it which is that is where the bridge can let shipping through underneath the rest of it is quite low on the water so you can't get ships underneath because it's easier to build a bridge which is only you know 20 feet above the water as opposed to 200 feet above so the the vulnerable part is where you see the big arches and that's each time it's been attacked that's where it's been attacked could could you destroy the bridge completely no not really but you could keep on damaging it so that it becomes unviable for the use of military supplies and this attack um less spectacular than the others because it's against the the support is to try to make the bridge unsafe to to to make it vulnerable structurally vulnerable yeah mainly so that the Russians can't send heavy um train loads of supplies over it it's not so much I mean the traffic is one thing and they they like the symbolism of be of having to have the bridge closed but it's actually the train line that they're really after because that's what a lot of stuff goes the train line is next to the to the roads like two bridges in effect and what they want to do is to is to stop the Russians or make it unsafe for the Russians to send ammunition and supplies on this train line into Crimea which is a major supply hub or was for all of their forces in Zaparisia i suppose the engineering of that is that if you knock out parts of the track that can be easily replaced by by engineers oh you can go back to bomber command in the second world war and ask them how difficult is it to bomb very very okay first of all it's difficult to hit them and secondly it's difficult to hit them well enough um to stop them being repaired so I think implicit in the question here from HJ probably thinking about those tourist missiles that we've been talking about for the last few weeks is if they can knock it out they have lots of missile defense around the bridge don't probably to stop from aerial attacks is that why that they're going for sort of explosives on the structures because you could if you can get to it by sea it's it's an easier way of Yeah exactly i mean every time there is an attack the Russians close that loophole and so the Ukrainians have to be more careful so the first attack looked like a truck bomb i'm still not entirely convinced about that but it seemed to be based on a truck bomb the second attack was with you know sea drones getting just sailing up to it basically under the water and so the Russians have put a stop to any any repetition that the this third one somehow they've got charges placed i don't know how they did it and we you know perhaps we'll find out in the next few months but they managed to get some charges placed that obviously went off quite remotely and about a ton of explosives i don't know how they did that but we'll see the Russians will definitely find out how they did it and they'll block that off as well so the Ukrainians will have to keep on being inventive but they could try as and when they get Taurus missiles they could try just putting holes in the bridge further along not at the most vulnerable part yeah just to make it difficult for everybody but even then five holes in the thing is gonna be repaired but they could they could keep the they could make the bridge a real nuisance for the Russians to keep open that's what they could do and that's part of the tactic isn't it of these kind of sabotage attacks to make it really difficult i mean just on the the drone attacks and the fact that those drones are brought in by truck uh an individual on a podcast I listen to regularly said that now the Russians are going to have to be checking every single truck that comes in the logistical nightmare that has been caused by the fact you can't trust any vehicle that's passing over your borders that's right because there were apparently Russian drivers driving trucks they didn't know what was in them they were just told to take this container to some area and there were wonderful reports or interesting reports of one driver who said I was just told to go to a layby and stop there and somebody will come and meet me and of course that that tells you this is all part of the black economy you know he wasn't told to take it to a depot where the where the load was properly recorded and scanned and everything no no he was taking it to a layby where a gentleman will come and meet him so he presumably didn't care what was in the truck and he was getting paid for what he was doing and there's enough of that of course there's so much of that going on in Russia and in Ukraine as well that what the SBU the Ukrainian intelligence service obviously did is that they got enough people into Russia not difficult you know Ukrainian you know Russian speaking Russians who are working for Ukraine into Russia doing deals with drivers or making arrangements with false companies to send this fleet of lries off with all these first person drones in them and two of the lries we we are told were self-destructed because something went wrong and the Ukrainians again had thought of this they didn't want the lries captured as they were so two lries self-destructed before they got to the point where they would have opened their roofs and released all these attack drones which again was a remotes operation it folded back and the drones came out now when I saw you it must have been Monday after the after the attacks you said that this is the most extraordinary bit of sort of espionage sabotage since the pager attack on by the Israelis on Hezbollah that's right i mean last September last year wasn't it um around the third week of September I think it was was the the um Israeli the Mossad attacks on Hezbollah I mean giving them a series of p all I mean setting up companies that supplied them with pages which must have been over years ago oh yeah several years in the making and they they'd been supplying them with perfectly good pages until they started supplying them with ones that blew up in their hand and then they sent the message and those pages were specially designed because they got out of production from the Taiwanese company that produced them they they were specially designed that you needed both hands to actually answer so you couldn't just pick it up and answer you had to use both hands you know because two buttons on it so that you were holding it in both hands to pick it up in front of your face to your ear and then it exploded and blew people's hands off or killed them whatever and it was and the idea was that only Hezbollah people would have these pages because it was what Hezbollah was using it was what Hezbollah had given people so the Israelis in a sense could say this is absolutely legitimate although there were some other casualties some children well because people Yeah exactly and other people were involved but they had a reasonable case for saying we created a system whereby only our enemies our our expressed enemies would be affected by these pages because they were for them only and they would blow up only in their hands and with one or two exceptions that was true it's the ingenuity of it as well sheer and I mean yeah in the in the writings on intelligence successes in years to come um the Hezbollah pages and Ukraine's um drone lorries whatever they get called will go down as two of the big coup intelligence coups of modern times does make me think of of the other ones and prior to that there was uh an assassination on a Iranian nuclear scientist and I think the Israelis used a sentry gun a remote controlled machine gun or that was certainly the reporting that's right yeah and I can't I can't remember his name now um but that was going back to the 1990s I think it was quite a while ago quite a while check him out yeah quite a while ago but it was again this sort of ingenuity of of the um security forces to be able to do this sort of stuff now Rick White has got a question here on these drones the Ukrainians declared about 40 aircraft were destroyed by drone but the footage showed only a handful of aircraft hit uh Rick asks &quot;How accurate is the Ukrainian number?&quot; Well um in so far as we it can be verified bits of it are accurate we don't know about the rest so the Blea airfield in Kusk which is a Siberia one that's been overflown now by a couple of companies maxar Technologies have overflown it with one of their satellites and taken photographs and this Capella space have overflown it with synthetic aperture radars which also can see through cloud and so on because it's a basically it's a radar beam that bounces off the ground and shows you shapes in great detail and what that bo both those companies separately independent companies have shown that at least eight aircraft are destroyed at that air base which is what the Ukrainians said mhm so it looks as if um some of their uh their TU22s and their TU95s that's the uh the bear and the blackjack bombers which are the ones the Ukrainians were really after um they seem to have got a group of those bombers they also um confirmed at a different base I think at a different base that they got one of the A50s which is the um Awax aircraft the airborne air control aircraft exactly now and they've got they've had one of those before they might even have got two of them and the Ukrainians have caught one of them before last year uh actually shot it down or arranged for it to be shot down even by Russian systems and the the Russians have only got about seven or eight of those operational so it looks as if they've lost about half of their Awax force yeah and they're very very valuable because that's the sort of control center it's an aircraft that flies you know near to the battlefield and controls everything going on they're very very expensive we run them as well and you know you don't have 20 or 30 of them you have a dozen or so or in our case you have two or three um and you you know you you look after them so impacts on their ability to be able to control it will do the battlefield so what what the Ukraans are saying is we have destroyed they said 34% of Russia's strategic bomber force now that is not verified but but what we've seen so far links into what they have claimed at the the BA base so the Ukrainians say 41 um have done 34% so the Institute for War studies who I know of course we we listen to who've got excellent detail on all of this they have they're quoting Colonel Yur uh Colonel Yuri Inhut uh who said that 10 out of 12 of Russia's 19 TU160 bombers and 36 of the uh 57 TU95 bombers were operational prior to the strike and and obviously a a number now have been destroyed as a result yeah as a result of this um they didn't get so many of the of the Blackjacks um of the of the 160s those that's the biggest it's a huge supersonic bomb the biggest supersonic bomber in the And in a way the Ukrainians aren't as bothered about the 160s because they're not being used so much to launch cruise missiles against Ukraine in these nightly attacks it's the old bears and blackjacks these old second world cold war bombers that sort of lumber around with a radar signature of an elephant and they and they launch cruise missiles from a long way out um and and the Russians are keeping their uh their backfires away from the war most of the time because they figure they might need those for another war sometime later and it is interesting to me as well Michael because I think last week or the week before we talked about striking airfields and I joked that you know that you park the planes wing to wing um if they're far enough away that they feel like they're going to be safe and you'd never do that the front line and where are these planes parked when you see yeah and you know the the the the bear and the and the the blackjack bombers the Ukrainians don't have any of them except they had one bear and one blackjack bomber in their aviation museum and they use those two to work out the um the uh the areas where they had to hit them with the drones because obviously if you if a drone hits at the tip of a wing or something it's not going to do a lot of damage but they they use their their two museum pieces to work out where are the fuel tanks where are the where are the control systems centered where do you need this little drone to hit the bomber to do the maximum amount of damage and so they they they worked on their two museum pieces as as the algorithm for their bombing attack yeah an algorithm right this is all AI as well isn't it once once they were off and running it was uh controlled by the computer which is just a fantastic um step forward in warfare all right let's move on to another question here sean the Prawn great name um asks &quot;Is the Russian summer offensive underway?&quot; Uh yes um it's a it's a it looks like a rolling offensive as we thought it might be it doesn't at the moment look like some sort of big strategic thrust with lots of armor uh in the front to try to you know open up Ukrainian lines i mean that is still possible but I think we'd see that building um before it struck and we're not seeing it at the moment but we are seeing um feed the feeding in of different units all the way around the front so we're seeing something in Sunumi up in the north and um uh I mean Sumi and Khakiv and Khakiv is being bombed again last night um that there's a lot of air activity around Khakiv which is the second city and we're also seeing more more pushes down in the south where we we we spend most of our time looking at this around uh Chazar Costanti Nfka and Prosk and the big the big operation and we actually we had we had a great graphic for it last week and we never got to use it is that the big oper operation is that the the roads I mean there aren't that many roads in that area not not not like very major motorways but the road between Prosk and Costiant is a key road because it also the other side of Costant goes to Chazar and if the Russ and they're fighting over that road if the Russians get control of that road then they can push north to Slavansk and Krammatsk and if they get particularly critsk but even then Slavansk after that then they've got the donbas then the game's up for the Ukrainians in the donut for that part yeah and the key thing is this is this road it's like a like a T junction if if they get the road then they cut northwards off the road and then they they're very close then to getting Cratsk and Slavian have we got insight as to what the fighting is is actually like in that part are the Ukrainians dug into positions are they holding back in towns and they're sort of keeping their It's fairly dynamic the the Ukrainians are launching lots of counterattacks and they're succeeding in some of them but they're only they're grabbing back little bits of territory but otherwise back punch back exactly that's it it's punch and counter punch but the Russians are moving forward but very very slowly because they're working on with dismounted infantry now they've learned if they send in their armored vehicles first they lose them and if they send in troops inside armored cars they lose them so what they're doing is they're sending in small groups of troops who are you know dispensable and these are the these are the ones they don't care about and they send them in in little squads of eights and tens to grab a little bit of this and a little bit of that and when they think that there's that they've got enough of it then they send in their professional troops in their armored vehicles when these small groups what's left of them have taken most of the fire and these troops will go in or they'll grab a a property at somewhere they can defensible position to try and hold yeah and they'll take they'll take a local position they're not digging in trenches as they go they're taking you know buildings areas um very often because this is quite industrial that area of Ukraine so there's quite a lot of of old plants you know old bits of the mines old bits of steel works and mills and things like that and they of course they can be made into fortresses i was going to say fighting positions must be really Exactly if you get hold of one then you make it into a fortress and move forward but equally if you're defending you can make that into a fortress and fend off lots of attack which is why the Russians are still losing over a thousand men a day and funny enough the CSIS in Washington Center of Strategic and International Studies which is a very respectable organization they just produced a report which came out I think yesterday and their view is that the the whole war has now cost about 1.4 million military casualties about and they said it's just on the million now for Russia and it's 400,000 for Ukraine and that's killed and wounded right and that's the point i mean Ukrainians look look as if they've lost about 40% of what the Russians have lost but the Russians are now have lost just on a million dead and seriously wounded and that's only going to going to go up well there's a question here from our viewers who are watching us thank you for this one B hunt um who asks &quot;At current rates of attrition is Russia likely to run out of soldiers and equipment?&quot; Um not run out no um because it's recruiting people from all over the world because it's paying them you know large amount large amounts of money so their own soldiers from the east are being paid a lot to go that not many soldiers from Moscow and Petersburg or western Russia you proportionately um but lots from the east and lots from foreign countries also they've got lots of foreign workers from Africa and Asia working in their arms factories and they just they've imported them as labor and they're paying them pretty well and so literally you Russia's arms production is being driven now by an influx of foreign workers so they can keep on going they'll keep on doing it i mean Russia is a big economy and it's a big war machine but as I keep saying it's like a sponge you know it's you can you can sort of punch into it but it keeps re you know resuming its shape but equally the sponge itself finds it difficult to create a a big offensive it just keeps sort of spreading out and spreading out and it's very hard therefore for the Ukrainians to to stop it unless they have a lot more modern more modern equipment and I have to say some different tactics all the way down through their through their whole system but the Russians can keep going um but it will strain their economy it's bent their economy out of shape already but it will strain their economy more and more from next year which is one reason why I think Putin is going for as much as he can this year if if he is interested in doing a deal at some point a ceasefire it'll be towards the end of the year when he's got Dombas and he can say thi this is now my territory um and now I will do now I'll agree to a ceasefire and that will give him the break he needs before he comes back for another go in two three years time so Putin said on the 13th of May that Russia is recruiting 60,000 volunteers to join the armed forces every single month i mean my math is terrible i can't work out what the attrition rate is but whether or not that is enough for them no they are they they are I mean they're losing on average one the average is now 1,300 a day they're now recruiting more than that so they're recruiting,500 to 2,000 a day which is 60,000 a month um and so they are doing that the I mean people are are sort of not clear about or disagree on this can the Russians keep on doing this just by recruiting foreign um individuals and individuals in the east to their army or will at some point the Russians have to go in for mobilization again i mean Putin went in for partial mobilization in late 22 300,000 it was very unpopular it wasn't called mobilization called partial mobilization very unpopular and things were pretty shaky for the Russian government as a result of that they're desperate to avoid that but if they keep bringing in you know foreign nationals to their army and their arm is getting the quality is going down and down and down until they can recruit you know Russians who want to fight for the AR really want to fight and not prepared to train properly and be given the time to train this army is not going to be very good it'll be big but it just won't be good and the quality is going going down all the time of of the mass of the army but they'll keep on adding to that mass as long as they keep on paying for it the other thing that we've talked about as well is that people do get paid don't they families if you die in battle get a huge payout which for many people who were from the poor parts of Russia changes their family life once the person dies marketkedly there's all sorts of anecdotal reports of um uh you know neighbors uh saying &quot;Oh look at look at so and so she's riding around in the car that that her dead husband bought for her.&quot; Um because that's it you know to be able to afford a car to um you know have a you know house for the son-in-law or for the daughter and the son-in-law all those sort of things are unaffordable for a lot of of Russians you know east of Moscow mhm and uh paying for I or getting paid for father going off to war is quite an attractive prospect 19 million rubles I've just looked on here i think it works out perhaps to 68,000 US for a decision that's right and I think average average pay is about 13 $15,000 um and so you're talking they're making they're making good money if they go and do it three yeah you get a signing on bonus which is like three or four times the average pay as a straight lump sum and then you get much higher pay it varies from region to region and of course the average does as well but much higher pay and then the family gets big payments um if uh if you die and then and also you get lots of veterans benefits so if you survive then you're given all sorts of privileges as a veteran for the rest of your life and you and your family so it's it is a sort of an attractive package for people who are relatively poor and are prepared to take the risk mhm all right let's move on to this next one um it's from CD or could will Ukraine attack the Kremlin it seems like they could very easily or at least put the fear that they can and of course they did it's reported attack back in May 2023 that's right there was a drone attack then though Ukraine never claimed it and my sense of it was always that I don't think those uh drones came from inside Ukraine i think they were launched by somebody else closer to the Kremlin um maybe still by the Ukrainians though wasn't it i mean quite possibly Ukraine or Russian opposition group or a group that Ukraine was prepared to sponsor i mean we never really got to the bottom of that but it didn't do it didn't do any good and it it it plays to um Putin's narrative that that Ukraine is involved in a war to destroy Russia that the West is trying to destroy Russia and it's using Ukraine as the sort of battering ram to do it so I don't think there's much to be gained politically from attacks on the Kremlin and and the Ukrainians have got to stick to the idea that they are attacking into Russia and they're sticking to military targets that make a difference to them you know things that will ease the pressure on them so aircraft that can launch glide bombs fuel centers that are that are you know sending fuel to the front line railway lines and logistics things that matter to the front line in Ukraine is what they need to show they're attacking well similarly the point that you made that if Russia were to use nuclear weapons they would lose support from India and China if Ukraine were to start hitting targets like the Kremlin they would lose what whatever little support they have in the unaligned nations they lose they'd lose that yeah and and the danger I said this at the time that um you know they're playing with fire if they do attack something like the center of Moscow like that because although they'd say well these were only Ukrainian weapons that distinction will be lost you know were they western supplied weapons or Ukrainian weapons nobody will care too much um so the the Ukrainians have got to be careful and they do play with fire sometimes when they do these things and and one of the things they have tried to do with their attacks toward Moscow not on the Kremlin is to close the airports i think there's what four airports around Moscow and they can all be closed pretty quickly by air attack and that's again it inconveniences the Russians and it reminds the Russian people that they that you may call it terrorism but this is what war feels like just a couple of weeks back they were I think they were being closed every other day that the airports were being knocked out really the um operation was being stopped because of the risk of air attack all right let's move on to a question here from Monty and Monty's uh asking you a question I always love to talk to you about Michael it's about drone warfare how how has drone warfare affected the other forms of conventional war and tactics that were used at the start of the war um and my favorite statistic about this is that 70% of casualties are now caused by drones it's completely changed the way that we fight yeah it has i mean the thing is when we say drones we're talking about robotics as well so it's you know drones in the air but you know drones at sea drones on land it's the same sort of thing it's a robot system of some sort a robot vehicle which can either be a surveillance vehicle an intelligence collection or a lethal vehicle i can fire something fire a weapon or it can just be a kamicazi vehicle which which goes to a target and blows itself up and yes I mean this is all I mean drones have been around a very long time and we often say the first really effective drones were the V1 doodlebugs that the Germans fired against London in 1944 um and they were I mean they existed before that as well but they were the first really effective drones the the whole science of drones didn't move that far forward and then in 20 2020 the war between Aabjan and Armenia yeah okay and the Azabjanis used Turkish Bay drones that's right with with Israeli Harab drones little drones as surveillance and there was nothing clever about either the Harab drones or the Baya drones but the Aabjanis used lots of them that was the point instead of using just a handful they used lots of them and found that they were extremely effective against Armenia's Russian tanks and I remember at the time talking to people in the Ministry of Defense in 2020 i mean and I mean Ben Wallace was a secretary of state for defense then saying &quot;We're taking this really seriously.&quot; So we we are really looking at this because everybody was sitting up as a result of that but the US and UK have been did use drones in Afghanistan and Iraq predator very small numbers right i mean they were they were terrifying to the population people there because they would fly overhead you'd see the thing you'd hear this buzz the Israelis used them a lot as well in Gaza for surveillance and for mainly surveillance um and the drones that we developed was the um uh the protector uh and the uh uh we had watchkeeper which is surveillance drone and predator and and that was a drone which which like an airplane fired missiles so it just did the same as airplanes bigger things as well yeah it was almost it was the size of a small plane anyway but what the uh what the Turkish drone showed was that really cheap drones used in the hundreds rather than the handfuls could make a strategic difference and that understanding in 2020 is what went forward really into the battles of 2022 and 23 in Ukraine and what we've seen since is an astonishing development of of drone and robotic warfare mainly drones because that's the way in which robotics can be used most easily in the air once you get down to ground robotic robotics on the sea they're all more complex more complicated just to move around but drones I mean small drones able to deliver one charge one grenade but directed with AI directed you know with with a computer system to follow somebody if necessary into a bunker and drop the grenade into this poor man's you know lap in effect that is something that has developed only in the last two or three years and it's pretty fundamental and that's some of the wireless ones they're also being wired now this fiber optic drones they're using on these huge sort of spools of cable there'll be an answer to that we don't know what it is yet but there will be an answer to these fiber optic drones some way of breaking the cables or or disabling what the cables do nobody we haven't come up and we the world hasn't yet come up with it but there will be one and just a few more numbers on the the drone production russia is producing 300 drones every 3 days aiming for 500 drones a day yeah uh it's reported most of them small yeah well they've adapted the quadcopters yeah and the um Ukrainians are going to be making 2.5 million drones a year their whole industry drone industry is huge right in 20 in 2022 realizing what drones are doing i remember Zilinsky saying we will produce a million drones next year 1 million drones he said for 2023 and that of well done but that figure is now you know treble it i mean treble it now two years later and they can churn them out in the day so it's it's completely changed everything right move on to some uh quickfire questions if we can michael um clock is ticking um here's one from Stevie is about Sunumi again with 50,000 troops gathered near Sunumi are they a tempting target for Ukrainian fighter jets um well they would be if they if they came together in big enough groups but I mean what the Russians have learned like the Ukrainians is that if you've got troops ready for an offensive keep them dispersed don't at some point they have to come together but you only mass them quite late on before you you know go into a maneuver but yes I mean anyone who who brings large numbers of troops together close enough is making them a target mu just very quick one on in the old days they used to say you know for centuries and centuries with warfare you you you didn't know um was it now that that's right you you you knew where the enemy was but you didn't know if you could destroy the enemy right but you knew where they were because you could see them you could hear them your scouts came back and said they're over the hill there but you didn't know if you could destroy them now it's the other way around you know you can destroy them you just don't know where they are right they're so dispersed um here's a question here from Alan 999 and Alan you may be tempting fate here why is Trump's so quiet he's going to go on true social media isn't he oh um because um he's on the verge of failure in this peace effort and he's not going to associate himself with failure now he may come through with some rabbit out of the hat initiative and that's not not impossible but the more time goes on uh the more likely it is that America will walk away from this that you know we all think he's in the process of walking away so it's not entirely set in stone yet but he's quiet because his instinct I think is that this is going to fail so stay away from it right sophie Louise has a question about the bridges again were the bridge instance over the weekend in Russia a sign that Ukraine has tourist missiles almost certainly not um I think they will get tourist missiles but I think we'll see them more clearly when we do the the Russians reported that both those bridges um were blown up um uh in and you know one bridge was blown as a train was going underneath it and the other was blown as a train was going over the top of it yeah um and both of them seemed to be uh charges pre-laid charges so you know classic um sabotage operation I think seven killed on it that's right yeah it wasn't without casualties no i mean and again a a terrorizing attack it was it was yeah and it was it was an an attack you know in Russia one one bridge was in Briansk and one was in Kursk and the Ukrainians have got a you know they can make a good case to say that was a legitimate target but yes civilians were killed and that is uh allowable it's you know it's tolerable in international law depending on how carefully you set up the operation but almost certainly not tourist missiles but we may see tourist missiles do exactly that sort of thing as and when the Ukrainians get them they suggest that the missiles are coming and then they show look this is what we can do without them imagine what you get i think that's quite important for them smithy asks &quot;How aware are people in Moscow and St petersburg that Ukraine is now hitting Russia regularly?&quot; Well as we said before I think what they they're certainly aware of it the Russians don't don't not report these things because they know that there's enough local reporting of what goes on and the blogosphere in Russia you know circulates stuff the way it does in Western countries so they can't they can't pretend it hasn't happened but as we were saying they put it all down to terrorism and so you know what I think the Russian population are told is that you know they are fighting a war they're winning a war that they have to win and one of the consequences is that we've that we are the subject of terrorist attacks and that's that's the view that's that's the line and and most Russians seem as far as we can tell the Lavvada Center is the only the only center we've got in Moscow the Lvada um uh foundation I think it is that um uh publishes reports which are reasonably um independent and they seem to indicate that the the Russian public you know they support the war they're they haven't turned against it and that they this is the necessary cost of it i wonder if it becomes self-fulfilling as well after all these decades of propaganda telling you that the West is your enemy and then suddenly you're in a special military operation against this Nazi regime that's been told it's across your border and things are happening to you in Moscow and St petersburg yeah it it it reinforces the belief that you've been fed yeah i mean I think we all think that Russian public opinion is probably quite brittle on this but of course you know they want to see them they they want to see their side win but increasingly they want to see the war over um they they want to see an end to this and and quite a reasonable number last time I was looking well over a third of those um pled said that oh we ought to make concessions to get it finished with we ought to make concessions to see an end to this they should tell the Russian delegation in stumble that member had no concessions or maximalist demands right all right uh last quick one from Stanman do you think it's a clever idea publishing for all to see especially the Russians how you got your drones into their country well that's a yeah I I understand the the argument there that's a sort of judgment which the SBU and and Zalinski the SBU the special for special intelligence service um and the uh president's office will make you know do we get more out of showing the world that we can do this or keeping the Russians in the dark the point is that you know the Russians will work out pretty quickly um exactly how it was done um they they'll want to you know they'll want to do that so they will find out anyway within a week or two and and so the Ukrainians will will want to show the world what they could do it but it does mean that they will find it hard to do it again a second time just add them to that as well as you told me yesterday there's some senior Ukrainians who are in the states at the moment or at least were in the states while this was happening to kind of show look this is what we can do if you uh continue exactly yeah i mean Andre Yamak is there who's the chief of staff of Zilinski and that clearly he's he's he's talking to um uh the Congers on the hill and Congress people to say &quot;Look we're not beaten you know we're not we're not we are the victim in this but we're not you know we're not dead and buried i mean we can still we can carry on we can fight we can hurt the Russians look at what we can do.&quot; All right let's move on to the final question um we're going to wrap two into one here one that we had sent to us from Joe from before and one that's come in while we've been talking Michael and it's about the UK and the strategic defense review um indicated an increased risk of future conflict including attacks on the UK potentially is it time for the public to start preparing do you think well that's a good question actually because it's the great um unanswered question of the strategic defense review i mean the defense review is all about what what British defense is going to do and the government's on board for this and and so this is now government policy and we'll take it forward to NATO what nobody knows is whether the public will buy this because what the review has said is that we've got to stop thinking of ourselves now as in a period of prolonged peace um we are already at in a certain sort of war with Russia the Russians are already making war on us up to the threshold with cyber attacks with attacks on our pipelines um attacks on our our cables and it could get a lot worse and I think it it could get a lot worse in the next two or three years um we're not at military confrontation yet but that is the that's where we're heading and we've got to be prepared for that um we hope to avoid it by deterrence but to deter it you've got to be prepared to do it and the other side's got to see you can do it that you're capable of it and that you you're prepared to what we don't know is whether the British public will be on board for that um and we'll find out I guess in the next year or two when the sacrifices that have to be made to implement this defense review in terms of either higher taxes cuts in expenditure things we're talking about today with the spending review i mean we'll get to see what the real cost of this the opportunity cost of this review is over the next few months and then we'll get a sense of whether the you know public opinion will go along with it and of course we spent more on defense before but the economy was different before the tax burden was not quite as high before it probably didn't feel that bad you can tell me because you live through it Michael not to not to say you're much older than me but you know that feeling that you know we're spending all this on defense and yet our schools don't work and our hospitals are full up maybe wasn't so It is problematical yeah i mean in terms of the tax burden we're about middle of the European scale you know we're nowhere near the highest tax population in Europe we're about middle of the scale um but undoubtedly people feel that we are taxed to the hilt because we expect much more of government now i mean compared to 50 years ago when I was a youngster we you know government just didn't do certain things which now everyone assumes it must do and so the you know expectations of government are much higher and they're they're expensive and so we now have you know we're in this situation where we now have to take some pretty big decisions and will we duck the defense uh requirement maybe we will i don't know i hope we don't but maybe we will well onto our final question then from John Smith who's put this in uh as who's been watching along thank you for this John if Michael Clark were leading the defense review what would you prioritize in the budget well um I would if I were involved with it I would um prioritize the sort of things that are in it i mean it's it's transformational and that means that you've got to put a lot of effort into the development of of real AI digitizing the forces things that won't show up very much it's not ships tanks and planes so much although we do need new generations of those things but it's it's laying the foundations of a digital force structure and what the government is saying what the review says which I agree with is that we want to and if we can we want to increase the lethality of our forces by 10fold in a decade now that sounds a big ask it's not implausible in the modern world but and then we've got to use that that that new transformed ability to be a small but very effective military power to to contribute it to our allies our European allies particularly northern Europe to take a not necessarily the leading role but to take a leading role which helps to solidify our defense and our sense of reassurance particularly in Northern Europe and amongst our big partners france Germany Italy to a lesser extent because Italy is southern Europe and it's on a different track in some ways but certainly France Germany the United Kingdom and our North European partners we are the essence of I think of security for this country for the next 60 70 years but to make that to get that right we've got to look after the north North Europe the North Atlantic and we've got to transform our forces so that they can do these sorts of things with less um heavy metal i said it was the last question but I want to put you on the spot Michael sorry about this what would you cut then in public services to achieve that because some or if not public services what would you do to raise the money how would you get there yeah I I for me it's got to be a combination of of higher tax and and um spending cuts and so you can say you know some of the some in the of the welfare area is probably going to end up being cut don't want to see it but probably would have to do that um possibly some of the environmental area would be you know possibly cut um you you don't really want to try to you know sacrifice education and you you certainly want to restrain the growth in spending on health because we're you know we're doing sort of 60 billion on defense we're doing over 300 billion on health um and by common consent although we all love our health service um some of that spending isn't as efficient as it should be so it's a combination of of public expenditure cuts somewhere um and higher taxes elsewhere and you can do certain amount by extra borrowing um you can borrow as long as the international community or the the financial community thinks you're borrowing responsibly they won't punish you for doing it if they think you're borrowing irresponsibly then you'll get punished by you know bond rates will will suddenly go up it'll cost more to borrow and so on so you could you can add an element of extra borrowing if as the EU countries are now doing um if you can convince the international markets that this is responsible that it will have a growth impact and that you can still afford to pay the interest on the stuff you borrow so it's not impossible you can do some of it like that well there you go Chancellor Michael's answered it all for you the spending review next week and on that thing about the borrowing I think there is a school of thought that's looking at some of these investment banks aren't there as well that go specifically towards defense and rearmment absolutely i mean getting some more private capital into putting liquidity into the defense business and even the services are talking about that the army's talking about that yeah um you know don't regard defense as somehow an evil necessity you know get into it because it's all part of preserving our freedoms and it will have a growth impact it will help as well that's the argument yeah professor Clark always great to have your thoughts your brain magnificent love the conversation as always thank you very much for being with us and submitting all your questions we will do another one of these next week schedules being aligned so thank you" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="kenya's president on a 5-day state visit to China its largest lender while Beijing's trade war with Washington intensifies how is it worsening and what's the impact on countries like Kenya which do business with both economic superpowers this is Inside Story [Music] hello and welcome to the program i'm Fib Batibbo kenya's President William RTO is in Beijing on a state visit his third trip in three years underlying the importance of China to his country china is Kenya's biggest lender funding major development projects including road and rail infrastructure but the trip comes as the trade war between China and the US worsens kenya and other developing countries find themselves in the middle after imposing tariffs on most countries US President Donald Trump is now seeking deals beijing is warning it will take action against any nation that makes agreements with the US that damage Chinese interests media reports also suggest Beijing is opening up another front reducing investment in private US funds so how is the trade war affecting countries like Kenya which do business with both sides will they have to pick a side and with China holding around threequarters of a trillion dollars in US debt what risks does that pose to both sides we'll talk to our guests shortly but first this report from Laura Khan the economy trade and development are on the agenda for Kenyan President William R's 5-day visit to China as is a significant debt his country owes to its biggest lender billions of dollars it's struggling to pay off but now it seems Kenya may be entangled in a trade war between Beijing and Washington president R was originally seen to be western leaning to suddenly start leaning to the east uh for to seek assistance but I think in terms of how Kenya is attempting to navigate its debt issues we've seen it trying to widen its scope of partnerships almost a year ago then President Joe Biden named Kenya a special US ally during President R's visit to the White House but this year the Trump administration has cut more than $200 million in aid and added a 10% tariff on Kenyan goods entering the US the East African nation is just one of many caught up in a tit fortat trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies china increased duties on American goods to 125% after President Donald Trump raised levies on Chinese goods to 145% we advocate for inclusive and beneficial economic globalization including a multilateral trading system with a world trade organization at its core we must consistently uphold the principles of openness inclusiveness and mutual benefit oppose all forms of unilateralism and protectionism last week President Xi Jinping visited Malaysia Vietnam and Cambodia to strengthen regional ties signing dozens of cooperation agreements and sending a message that Beijing is a reliable trading partner in the US stock markets are volatile with investors fearing the knock-on effects a trade war will have on the global economy and on the streets many are concerned that President Trump's trade policies mean familiar liquor and food from abroad will be served up with a higher price tag i mean it's so soul crushing and deeply saddening uh coming from the largest Chinatown in the United States which is the Chinatown in San Francisco uh to see what could possibly erase some people's ability to obtain things they grew up with ingredients that they know and love china's GDP grew in the first quarter beating expectations but economists have warned of a sharp downturn in the coming months as the US tariffs come into effect laura Khan inside story alazer let's now bring in our guests joining us from Beijing is Aar Tangen a senior fellow at the Teahi Institute robert Scott is an independent international economist he joins us from Rockville Maryland in the United States and in London David Omo an emerging market economist at Capital Economics he specializes in African countries a warm welcome to each one of you thank you so much for your time today um Robert uh let me start with you if I can and these latest developments Chinese investors reportedly changing their approach to US private equity just how serious is this for uh the US financial sector especially private equity well I I think private equity is is feeling uh pressured not only by threats from Chinese investors but by the tumult in markets caused by President Trump his his massive tariff increases that were imposed already uh especially the the 145% tariff on imports from China have have uh threatened to disrupt global trade and stimulate more inflation in the United States and the stock market is down uh more than 20% since the first of the year and uh so I think the the bigger problems here are based in domestic investors at the moment uh you the markets are in freef fall because of President Trump's actions also his threats yesterday to the independence of the Federal Reserve saying he wished to replace Chairman Powell indeed do you think Robert Do you think Robert that this additional pressure on private equity will pressure the Trump administration to rethink its stance towards this trade uh war frankly I doubt that the the the biggest uh component of China's investment in the US United States is public uh China has over $3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves in the that are held by the central bank in addition the the uh sovereign wealth funds hold nearly$2.5 trillion dollars as well so China is by far America's biggest lender and most of that is public funds all right Anarr Tangen from the Chinese perspective what strategic purpose does cutting off private equity investment in the US serve is it more about economic leverage or or diplomatic uh signaling here well I think it's diplomatic signaling remember uh if you start looking at this you know at arms length Donald Trump's problem isn't China it isn't the rest of the world it's what he's doing to the American public it's purely a bluff uh within two months people will be calling for his his head um he was elected uh by people who perhaps didn't care for his personality but thought that he was the best uh candidate to control prices and instead of doing that he's raised them so I used to run political um elections in the US and I can tell you for certainty that people vote with their pocketbook and they are not happy and they're going to get less and less happy as these tariffs wind in uh David let me come to you i I will of course ask you about uh President R's visit to to Beijing and the significance of that at this time but I wanted to get your thoughts first about what uh Robert alluded to earlier and the growing concern that China might escalate the trade war even further by dumping US debt um h how realistic is that scenario in your view and what would be the ripple effects of that not just within the US but for the rest of the world and the African continent uh especially yeah um to to to talk about the realism of um how how likely it is I think maybe a bit outside my expertise but in terms of its potential implications for kind of African economies um in terms of the market dislocation it would cause um there was a worrying rise in say um the interest rates that many African countries have to borrow on on international capital markets in relation to the um the kind of trade turmoil that's happened if we got an escalation we'd worry that that would kind of happen again and that would leave many countries who need um this kind of money from international markets to finance their kind of budgets in a really worrying place i think that's the biggest worry um not the kind direct trade implications of say um US trade with Africa but more this how global trade turmoil kind of impacts all of Africa's kind of trade partners and the global economy kind of in total okay uh so David now let me ask you about President R's visit uh to to Beijing uh which comes at a tense time as we've seen in in the US China trade war what opportunities uh whether economic or diplomatic do you see for African countries like Kenya what can they extract from from this deepening divide between uh these two economic superpowers um it's it's a tricky one on on the US side i think we've been making the point that the transactional style of politics that President Trump has kind of proceeded with it's probably the buzz word we constantly hear transactional means that countries with leverage of sorts whether it's mineral wealth or in Kenya's case kind of strategic um kind of importance from a security perspective um have the most to gain I guess or can really play off with the US what they can offer in that regard to perhaps get better kind of economic terms whether it's on the trade perspective whether it's FDI investment that type of thing on the kind of China perspective we think the relations with China already quite deep anyway in terms of the amount um China is a much bigger trading partner for many kind of African countries than the US is and you've seen over the last kind of few decades the importance of the loans that China has given to many kind of kind of African countries and that financing there's a question as to whether this pushes kind of countries to decide that China is a bit more of a reliable partner um they're less likely to kind of engage in the stick approach that we're seeing but that's really dependent on what state China is in to carry on um with kind of economic engagement they're going to kind of suffer from this trade war does that have any implications for what they lend to Africa the kind of investment they put in different countries let's ask aar about the China perspective ana why is it beneficial to China to make investments in a country like Kenya for example well quite frankly I mean the way that China sees the world is quite different they're not out to conquer it they're not taking over other lands they haven't suggested that they should own Canada uh what they do is they have these principles that uh countries should be secure that there should be a path to prosperity and that they have to be respected and along that line they for the last 10 years they put a trillion dollars into the belt and road initiative it has not always been smooth and there have been problems with loans especially when they were uh government to government because the only thing you know for certain is the next government that comes in is not going to be happy about what the last government did but overall Kenya has the last 10 years been exceeding over 5% uh growth it's actually outperformed uh the developed countries uh well still having uh major issues uh with wealth disparity but it's in the right direction so China is not going to destabilize the world it has no interest in selling off all of its bond bonds uh that would create a global cataclysm and that's exactly the opposite of what China has been trying to do he saw this very clearly when the Xi Jinping was first in Vietnam then um in Malaysia and then finally in Cambodia he was assuring people that China will be a reliable partner that they'll continue to open up so this is China's story very different from Donald Trump's as has been put out by my colleagues uh your thoughts about this Robert do you see this moment as a a moment for Africa to pivot towards China uh uh towards deeper integration with China or is there a risk here on becoming too reliant which some have said you know African countries like Kenya uh like uh uh the DRC are already too reliant on on China the African countries are at risk for becoming too dependent on China because China is uh investing so much in their development infrastructure roads as as the general China has has mentioned the the the huge belt and and road initiative has made these countries dependent on loans and those loans at some point are going to have to be repaid and that's going to uh sort drag on the countries of of of Africa so there's no free lunch here there's nothing that you get for for for free and there are costs involved what are your thoughts aa I saw you shaking your heads there uh Robert says African countries are already too reliant on on China on loans and that there's no free lunch what do you say to that yeah I mean this is the debt trap diplomacy uh call saying oh China is somehow taking over these countries you know where is the United States where is the rest of the world uh in terms of helping these countries develop i mean the track record is clear the last 10 years Kenya's been growing why because it has had these loans it's been able to use these loans to develop its infrastructure if you didn't do that Kenya would just be a subservient country at the mercy of the colonial interests that originally abused it i I I find it odd that there is always this oh well China's lending money that's that's bad right why Why would that be bad these countries need to develop and I I I I would love to hear from my colleague about what what it is that the US or Europe has done to help African countries get out of it and we'll ask we'll ask Robert about that in just a moment but But let's hear from David on this david what do you make of what we just heard there from both Robert and uh Inar i I don't want to be the middle ground and stand on the fence between um kind of Robert and I know um I I I think it's it's quite interesting i take that point of what's the alternative i I think we I talked about earlier the kind of worrying rise in kind of yields um that many of these kind of African countries are wanting to borrow at so they're quite boxed in in terms of financing kind of budget deficits that many of them are running so where do they turn to and you're seeing the US in a way retreat um from the kind of pivot we that the kind of former administration was talking about in terms of relationship with Africa to a lot more transactional so it leads them to okay you can't borrow international capital markets and um kind of issue euro bonds you the concessionary kind of lending from say the IMF and kind of other kind of organizations might be a bit more tricky too so you've got to increasingly look to other players and that's where China does kind of step in i would say in terms of that debt trap diplomacy point um I think it is a lot more nuance as kind of Robert mentioned but there is this sense of debt restructuring talks when countries do kind of go over the precipice and default have become more difficult because of not just China but it's simply because there are just so many um kind of different organiz stakeholders that African countries are owing debts to your private bond holders the IMF and kind of other organizations are getting involved bilateral lenders are getting involved so that needs some kind of resolution and I think from a China perspective in terms of transparency around the debt terms that needs to be addressed um other stakeholders need to address the issues that they're kind of introducing into debt debt negotiations too so it's it's it's a bit more nuanced I think is the final point I'd make all right Robert your thoughts and and as Anar mentioned Robert I mean we've seen China engage African countries with high stakes infrastructure deals like in Kenya for example in Ethiopia as well in Zambia the Loito corridor with the DRC and so on if the US administration is right now signaling to some of these countries that they should not engage too closely uh to China we've heard some of the threats from the Trump administration what exactly is it offering in return are we seeing any comparable uh US-backed initiatives that can match the scale at which China is engaging with the African continent right now no I'm afraid it's just the opposite president Trump shut down the US aid which provided aid to to African countries it was not on the scale as offered by ch by China uh but it was still significant especially for countries suffering from uh famines and other kinds of acute acute uh food shortages so uh Trump has moved in the wrong direction in terms of its relationship with Africa and the developing countries and this is not helping so uh in a sense we're pushing these countries into the arm arms of China and uh this is not good for either the US or Africa right so Anar where does China stand right now we've seen it warn countries not to engage in deals that damage its interests at the behest of the US we have right now as we've seen uh African countries like Kenya deepening ties with Beijing while other countries like Ghana and Zambia for example are negotiating debt restructuring um is China drawing a red line here and how far is it willing to go uh if countries pursue USbacked uh alternatives i mean whether it's in you know digital infrastructure or transportation energy or military corporation as as is the case for Kenya for example well it's it's a very different perspective I mean uh China has never said to anybody up to this point you can't deal with the US and they're not saying that they don't care about anyone's cooperation I mean they deal with the Middle East states they have very good relations in most part with the United States they have military cooperation it isn't an issue it's about trade but Donald Trump is saying to these countries that if you want uh I'm going to slap you with tariffs now if you don't want the tariffs you have to do as I tell you and what I tell you to do is stop trading with China and China's saying &quot;Look we're we're not going to countenance that.&quot; I mean this this is really troubling that you have this bully wandering around slapping people around taking their lunch money and then saying &quot;You should thank me for it.&quot; As pointed out Donald Trump isn't interested in the rest of the world he's interested in only one thing and that is quote what can those countries give America i mean this this is the definition of you know hijgemy I mean he's just he doesn't care right David what can African countries give America today they're they're working they're walking a really tight rope here do you do you think they can realistically afford to alienate uh either China or the United States um on the United States point I mean like currently we've got 10% kind of universal tariff a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs um I think our kind of expectation is that the pause may be extended so African countries aren't going to be hit yet or it doesn't look like they're going to be hit by those kind of doomsday style tariffs that we're expecting but I think we were making that point in that the direct implications of the trade hit from the US isn't as kind of doomsday as many would think certain countries yes but on the whole the African countries are doing much more trade with China it's a bigger trading partner that's probably where the bigger concern should be not saying that they won't want to negotiate with the US but this transactional style of politics as I said if you're not a mineral producer or you haven't got strategic security kind of importance it's hard to see what the US are going to or what President Trump is going to say can get out of um kind of these talks with the African countries on the on the China perspective I I'm not sure that China has to do much more to um kind of convince African countries to align with it um we've got a global fracturing um kind of proprietary measure and a lot of African countries align with China um based on that measure and we kind of expect that to continue as well so um I I don't I don't think it's necessary China going to have to do much when America's already probably alienating kind of countries that haven't got loads to offer in terms of leverage all right Robert before I come to Anar for his thoughts what are your thoughts about where this is headed i mean are we seeing the beginning of a financial decoupling between the US and China and is this a great time then for the global south for African countries to to move even closer to China i am concerned that that's the case uh what and what if we look at what China did during the first Trump term uh between 2016 and 2020 uh Trump raised tariffs initially on China to substantial levels well below the current uh 100% plus tariffs but in the range of 25 to 30% uh China responded by uh shipping mass quantities of exports uh diverting them from the US to countries like Vietnam and Cambodia and Malaysia exactly where President Xi is today and uh in turn those countries rerouted the exports from China to the United States so although US exports from China to the sorry Chinese exports directly to the United States fell dramatically after Trump imposed tariffs China's exports to the world increased overall so China was not hurt particularly by the tariffs they simply diverted trade to these other countries and I expect them to do that again and perhaps to expand that diversion through Africa as well all right uh your your thoughts in about where this is headed is it again the beginning of of a financial decoupling between the US and China not just in trade but in capital flows and investment philosophies okay well you know this story stop me before I spend again american consumers spend one out of every four dollars on imported goods whether they come from China Vietnam or wherever it is still is not coming from the United States so and they're not going to it cannot they cannot be produced at uh the kind of prices in the United States so let's put that aside let's talk about this 10% since it's going against everybody all right it doesn't make any difference basically American consumers are going to foot the bill or at least the majority of it so you know this idea that this is going to sink the world no it will depress demand on the American side and that has an effect that ripples onto the world stage because US although it's only 4 and a.5% of the world's population manages to consume about 18 19% of the world's GDP on a on a yearly basis so at this point you know we're talking about a bluff by Donald Trump he cannot decouple is the long-term looking like there's going to be less cooperation between these twos i would say yes the book ends have been reset and they're a lot more conservative uh America is justifiably concerned about its economic uh condition but the way to do that is to out compete nations not try to bludgeon them to death with tariffs all right uh David I'll give you the final word where do you think this is headed and also David are there lessons that African countries can can take from this geopolitical tension in shaping their own uh sovereign wealth fund strategies um on on the first point I think the the the worry I have is if you do get this kind of pivoting by China in terms of they've got huge manufacturing capacity and they decide to instead of exporting to the US even if rerouting does work if it doesn't work you may see there's been worries about potential dumping and kind of manufacturing manufactured goods going to kind of other countries increase if that happens on the kind of African kind of side um you've already seen trade deficits in Africa between Africa and China kind of increasing i think the worry is what happens if that kind of stops the kind of fledgling kind of manufacturing kind of growth models that perhaps we we kind of hope for in terms of Africa moving up the value chain um so that that that's kind of one worry I have on just how Africa decides to engage geopolitically i think it's going to continue to try to position itself in it in the most optimal way kind of ensuring that it's able to get what it can from the US and what it can from kind of China so not necessarily it there may be it may be more aligned towards China but not necessarily at the expense of completely kind of severing kind of ties with the kind of US as I think one of the guests mentioned in terms of say um kind of Middle Eastern countries having strong relations with the US despite um also doing having deep kind of economic relationships with China all right thank you gentlemen to all three of you for a great

          <attvalue for="6" value="the plan as we've heard it now was simple smuggle 100 or so Ukrainian drones behind enemy lines along with specially modified containers built to deploy those drones load those containers onto the backs of trucks drive them right up to Russian air bases then open the retractable roofs outfly the drones packed with explosives and the rest is now history ukraine says it carried out largecale drone attacks on multiple air bases truly something out of a spy movie a reminder despite Russia's overwhelming strength in numbers that Ukraine is a resourceful determined enemy ukrainian and Russian social media are now filled with video like this circulating widely claiming to show the attacks and the damage from them according to Ukraine's domestic intelligence agency the attack caused 7 billion worth of damage badly compromised Russia's strategic cruise missile capability and according to Ukraine's president involved a level of covert infiltration of Russian territory that if true might even be more daring than the attack itself i'll explain dubbed Operation Pavutina or spiderweb Ukraine's goal was to do maximum damage to a part of Russia's war machine that has been in a very real way almost untouchable until now more than 40 aircraft are known to have been hit including strategic bombers and one of Russia's very few remaining surveillance planes the target Russian warplanes capable of hitting Ukraine from very long range so able to fight without ever actually entering Ukrainian airspace and staying therefore well out of range of anti-aircraft fire this required more than a year and a half of planning and organization according to Ukraine's president and once put in motion the suggestion seemed to be the whole thing could have unraveled at any moment the FSB that's Russian intelligence specifically counter intelligence and surveillance by Ukraine's account the operation took root right under Russia's nose you're hiding right under the nose of the giant the last place the FSB is likely to look is the apartment building across the street now at this stage I should warn you we are getting into the realm of details the ultra clandestine stuff that's just impossible for us to independently verify where possible I'll make clear where we're getting our information from just so you can judge for yourself but just remember these are two countries at war and in every attack there's not just strategic value but also propaganda value so let's keep that in mind okay so Ukraine's president says 117 drones were used in the attack at least some or potentially all of which would have been smuggled in from Ukraine according to the Associated Press but we should bear in mind that these are relatively smalls size flying bombs in effect so putting them together in a container or distributing them among different loads would not be such a huge task but then actually making sure that they were ready to fly and preparing for the attack completely undetected by Russia's own security and intelligence services would have been a more complex task we can see from these unverified photos that those drones were eventually hidden in the roofs of these large wooden containers some media have described them as sheds except the roofs are retractable by remote control which would allow those drones to fly straight up and out and towards their targets so in theory once these containers were fully loaded with explosive carrying drones they could be loaded onto the backs of trucks driven to the outer perimeters of Russian air bases far far away from the Ukrainian front line the roofs pulled back and out come the drones flying straight to their targets russian intelligence apparently none the wiser all of that is a very complex operation which could have gone wrong at any number of stages we've heard different reports of how these drones have been being controlled there's been a lot of talk of ill use of AI for managing and for targeting and locating the targets but we've also heard that they were individually controlled by people actually sitting in Ukraine this photo posted by Ukrainian intelligence shows one facet of this plan a layout of the airfield to be attacked and overhead imagery of the specific targets these red X's possibly marking weak points fuel tanks most often in the wings sometimes in the fuselage that if hit could make the plane a complete loss and several videos show in real time what these attacks might have looked like how much damage they might have caused and what vulnerabilities they might have uncovered electronic warfare systems air defense systems those are quite expensive and the Russians don't have the capacity to be able to defend the entirety of the depth of Russia with those systems russia will have been prepared for nighttime missile and drone attacks against their aircraft in a specific range from Ukraine what they won't have been prepared for is an open daylight attack using these short range drones that had to get very close to the target and also of course at ranges that were immensely greater let me show this to you on a map because Russia's Ministry of Defense has confirmed the attack identifying five regions that were targeted all within a very short span of time now two things worth pointing out here first that Russia says it repelled attacks at these locations this contradicts the Ukrainian account which is that four bases were successfully hit but the other thing worth pointing out here and what makes this attack so incredible is along the lines of what you just heard how far from the war some of these bases are thousands and thousands of kilometers away from the front line deep within Russian territory the range of this attack is so important because it shows that there's no place you can park these strategic bombers that Ukraine can't theoretically reach so what that means is it's it's changed the chessboard and Russia has to decide where do we move these planes now in order to keep them safe but now let's talk about what Russia has reportedly lost [Music] the number widely cited now by Ukrainian defense analysts and security sources but which we can't independently confirm is that more than 40 Russian warplanes with long range strike capability were hit among them the Russian TU95 originally designed to carry nuclear weapons but since reconfigured to fire cruise missiles from very far away they take off they reach a certain altitude they open their Bombay doors and then Russian missiles come out of them and have long glide paths to be able to get into Ukraine and also at higher altitudes altitudes that make it difficult for anti-air to hit them it's long been recognized that the best Ukrainian approach would be to actually eliminate these flights in the first place and that is what Ukraine has done in spectacular fashion take a major chunk out of the fleet of aircraft that Russia has been using to pummel its cities according to Ukraine security service the attack hit 34% of strategic cruise missile carriers parked at Russia's various air bases and experts say these will be difficult to replace maybe even difficult to repair they no longer produce these bombers uh and they have a limited amount of uh parts in order to repair them so a large chunk of whatever was hit this weekend is going to stay inoperable there's just no way around it now what we will only come to understand with time is just how big of a setback for Russia's war effort this really is ukraine has had other similar surprise successes the sinking of the Mosva the flagship of the Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet was one the invasion of Russia's Kursk territory was another but Ukraine remains at least militarily very vulnerable what this is however is a major propaganda coup one of the biggest problems Ukraine faces is a widesread assumption outside the country that it is on the ropes that Russia is winning that Ukraine only has a certain amount of time before it will have to surrender this will be a major breakthrough in terms of showing that Ukraine is very much still in the fight and is able to carry that fight to Russia and let me point out one more thing about the timing this attack came just hours before Ukrainian and Russian negotiators were set to meet in Istanbul to discuss among many things how to make a ceasefire real experts say hopes were never high for these talks to begin with but if Russia has been hesitant to make serious concessions up until this point it's hard to know how its stance may change or perhaps harden after what Ukraine has just done to it [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="welcome everyone welcome back to another show it's your host Danny Hiong and we have a great one for you as the world holds its breath regarding the latest escalations in and around the Ukraine conflict before I introduce our special guests just a quick word russia right now is investigating Ukraine's drone attack which destroyed at least four strategic Russian nuclear bombers according to western reports uh that number could be as high as 40 but Russia rejects this now uh Putin and Russia there they are right now preparing their response but the retaliation may be imminent or it could already be happening russia has struck Sunumi very hard as it pushes to create a buffer zone between itself and Ukraine and Moscow just laid out its terms for ending the war that signal nothing short of a demand for Ukraine's unconditional surrender the truth is that Russia's punishing moves are ongoing and it could get worse as the call to release the archnik grow louder and reach a breaking point as just as we began streaming the reports have come out that the curse bridge in Crimea has also been targeted so to break down what is going to happen next I have an incredible panel with me today uh we have Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson former US Army Colonel and Chief of Staff for Coen Powell uh Colonel Wilkerson great to have you back on the show good to be with you Danny we also have first time guest on this show i've been following his work for a while on 21st Century Wire he's the co-founder of that publication it is Patrick Henningson patrick thanks so much for joining me today great to be with you Danny and we have the co-founder of Veterans for Intelligence Professionals for Sanity and former CIA analyst Ray McGovern ray it's good to have you back here hi Danny hey Larry hi Patrick hi Ray right great well let us get started everybody hit that like button as you come on that helps boost his stream and YouTube's algorithm now I wanted to ask maybe I can begin with you Colonel Wilkerson about this attack that Ukraine uh conducted against Russia uh Dimmitri Medvev uh Putin's number two uh said that quote to all who are waiting for retribution you need not worry this is a normal person's quality retribution is inevitable now that we've had several attacks now uh on Russia on Russian territory the latest being Crimea the airfields has been the most dramatic and the most controversial and of course there were two attacks on other bridges in Russian territory Barans uh region talk about what the response could be and what uh do you find is the significance of all of this as we move into possibly a dangerous phase of this conflict well Danny of course I don't know what the ultimate significance is going to be but I can speculate and I can speculate fairly powerfully I think um first I'd like to back up and say um if it's true the public reports that this planning has been going on for 18 months then there is absolutely no doubt there was no doubt in my mind in the first place that NATO read Washington Britain France Germany the whole complex was involved with this but principally the United States because it's got the assets to do the kinds of things that were done basically intelligence and satellites But the second thing I wanted to say about it and I said yesterday on another podcast is that just imagine for a moment that someone proximate to the United States or maybe in a submarine or something like that proximate to the United States launched an attack that struck Barstow in Louisiana or May not and blew up B-52s or hit Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri and blew up B2s imagine what we would do if that occurred because at least some of us are still steeped in the what I call the doctrine of the Cold War where we never never did these sorts of things but hitting someone's nuclear strike power and I think if I remember right about the START treaty which is still active until February of 26 however more abundant it might be one of the requirements was to keep your bombers like that B-52s B2s and Russian equivalents in the open so that was something that was known and it was that way for a purpose not so someone could attack them quite the opposite and yet we did and we were planning this for 18 months if the public information is correct uh this is a staggering strategic error in my view and Putin would be absolutely justified i hope he doesn't i hope he's more prudent than that in coming back with an absolutely resounding attack which actually could include a nuclear weapon don't think it will i hope and pray that it won't that's how stupid this was and I'm gonna watch this unfold with some trepidation no question about it yeah Patrick I want to get you in here the reports are from CNN that Pete Hegth was getting live as it was happening intelligence on this and so your response to how Russia is reacting to this as well as uh the US's role and and what this reflects about this conflict well thanks Danny i mean f for starters uh you know I expect Russia's uh response to be uh very measured um and um reciprocal in a certain way in terms of the damage that it incurred what it's uh going to inflict on Ukraine um Russia's well aware that the West's uh strategy is basically u predicated on a you know NATO article 5 trip wire and so they're obviously going to be very careful about overreacting because they know this is part of the uh the west strategy and uh but at some point um Russia could reserve not now but down the road to call this bluff basically um because now you're getting into very dicey territory and if you remember just 12 months months ago around the same time as this week 12 last May in 2024 Ukraine uh launched attacks on Russia's long range uh nuclear uh early warning radar system in Orsk just uh on the uh I think the western border of Kazakhstan that area about 1,500 uh kilometers I believe from uh Ukraine so that was deep into Russian territory and that was kind of a an interesting kind of attack because it's right before this Switzerland peace summit that Zilinski had staged obviously there's there's going to be nothing happening there uh when something like that precedes the scheduled negotiations same exact situation here uh this basically kills any chance of goodwill at the Istanbul summit so but yet Russia proceeds by the book as you'd expect uh and they've laid out their uh demands obviously political first then talks of technical talks of ceasefire and things like that and that's the way it should be and that's what's missing I think from the US dialogue is there's no willingness by the United States to address the overarching political concerns and then that's also part of the national security uh concerns of of Russia and until that's done everything else is secondary and it's not it's not going to you're not even going to make it to second base until you deal with those things which are pretty very similar to what the United States presented the uh last administration uh and the last secretary of state Tony Blinken and the State Department uh during December of I believe 2021 uh and then after that subsequently more or less the same by Russia so it's not as if there's any surprises here from that side what we do have though is lots of surprises from the United States side from the Ukrainian side uh and also from the NATO side a lot of moving of the goalpost a lot of flip-flopping and then a continuation of these provocations which are hugely uh counterproductive and and I think they're designed to be counterproductive because my personal opinion is and the if the US backs off and we can talk more about the political dimension of this the US can't just say &quot;Oh we're going to back off and wipe our hands of this if uh you know the Europeans or the Ukrainians or the Russians and Ukrainians don't get along or whatever we're just going to as JD Vance says we're going to pull away from it i think that's a massive mistake i think it's a copout um I think it's it shows that the United States is weak uh and is no longer considered to be a responsible world power they have to be involved they need to they need to broker a deal with Russia first and then uh those demands need to be impressed upon Ukraine this is the only way that we're going to get that we're going to avoid potential World War II here ray I want to bring you in your take oh you're muted about the Whoops no continue you're You're fine i'm okay now Patrick said that the first deal has to be between the United States and Russia there is a deal there is an understanding they both see merit in tamping down this thing and finally ending it that's the big backdrop here of all this discussion now the analogy between what would happen if they did it to us uh that's it's valid but it only goes so far because we have our leader as a kind of overcharged emotionally unpredictable leader who probably would lash out it's not the same on the other side putin is cool hand Luke i mean hello uh this is all to provoke him into what the British say is a wrong foot wrong footing poutine in other words they do this they the timing I mean now they do this right before the negotiations the second round are begin in in Istanbul and I dare say they were hoping that Putin would be overly charged emotionally like people on in the West and say &quot;Well I don't want more negotiations that's it we're going to send a risk and then and that way the US would be kind of blackmailed into well caving in or supporting these idiot Europeans that think they can win against a much stronger Russia.&quot; Uh one of the saving graces I saw here was that uh there is there there are the negotiations that's a biggie and there are high level contacts between American and Russian officials now what happened well I saw in the New York Times that it was at the Russian initiative that Lavough and uh Rubio talked about this okay and lav in other words caused the telephone call uh that's new now what we know about that readout so far as I could see is that Rubio already knew about the sabotage of those two bridges and he said you know my condolences so to speak i don't think that's right earlier expressed my sympathy on that whether I haven't looked at the timing yet whether Rubio already knew about these deep penetration strikes by drones into Russia or maybe he did but I don't think he was ready to respond to that the the readout such as we have doesn't indicate he said anything about that so I'm sure Lavough braced braced him on that but the idea is that Rubio and Lavough were talking whether as I suggested in the tweet that actually Trump and Puchin needed to talk before Puchin started to become emotionally overcharged okay uh anyhow what happened at the foreign minister level did happen and I think that the negotiations actually have been successful to the point where they've started out with little baby steps well 6,000 frozen frozen Ukrainian corpses taken out of deep freeze and given back to Ukraine for decent burial uh these things may not seem much to us but I think they mean a lot to the Ukrainians they are goodwill gestures and you know these are minor compared with the major concessions that will be necessary given that the Russians are winning and not going to settle for much less uh given given the negotiations going on given the high level of contacts I take some solace in the notion that although there are hottheads that want this thing to go out of out of control coolhead Luke in Moscow is going to prevent that by not being provoked colonel Wilkerson I want to I want to bring you back in here and um you know ask you about how this might uh backfire on Ukraine uh when it's all said and done because all of the Western mainstream media reports are saying that this was about leverage on Russia we've heard this over and over and over again that these terror attacks uh whether it's Crimea whether it's these drone attacks the significant most significant one now being this airfield strike uh that it's all about getting Russia to the table and essentially capitulating but how might how might this actually backfire on Ukraine as this conflict reaches uh a new stage um or or maybe a different stage moving forward let me say I don't share Ray's sanguing opinion about this at all uh let me say that uh I suspect this is going to go on and on and on and on and what I'm hearing from Istanbul is that that is a prospect of it going on and on and on because they're not even close and Ukraine is not going to come around to the adamant position that the Russians have and saying that the United States in its current state of disarray and I do mean that disarray is going to be a mediator of consequence in this even though the situation might demand that and I think that's true it does is nonsense there's no way this president vacasillating from one poll to the other with a cabinet that clearly doesn't know where he's going from one day to the next with an intelligence community that apparently doesn't even respond to his wishes and an intelligence community that apparently doesn't speak to anyone but JD Vance and one has to wonder if JD Vance is the right conduit for giving Trump or even if Trump allows him to give him a recent decent picture of what's happening in various places including Kaza and the Middle East in general and including Russia and Ukraine so I'm not at all happy or or hopeful about this situation i could see this going on and and Russia tolerating it's going on because it can't do anything else but let it go on and continue to win for months and the disarray of the empire as were continuing as it is now and maybe even deepening deepening and becoming more profound and let me add the disarray of the EU and the disarray of NATO too we have so many leaders in NATO now uh even in crucial countries like Germany and France and I would say England too that aren't supported by their people they do not have a majority of their people who are in their coalition as it were or supporting them so they're shorttermers in many respects and figuring out where the EU is going and where NATO is going is not very difficult down the tubes and if I were to say as a military professional what Putin's real objectives were say 15 years ago 12 years ago 10 years ago I'd place them in three categories one to destroy the transatlantic link two to get rid of NATO and three to keep his reasonably sound energy hegemony over Western Europe maybe the third one being unaccomplishable but nonetheless maybe a product of the first two he's going right down that list and he's being successful but he's not being successful because of his strategic skills so much as because our lack thereof and because our mistakes that's why he's winning and that's the thing that bothers me the bigger picture that occurring right now yeah patrick how about how about you weigh in here uh because you know uh I think the reaction to this um you know is on one on one hand speculative but on the other there are many who have been clamoring that Putin do more that he's not doing enough uh in response to all of this i'm I'm guessing what's your take given what you've heard uh both Ray and Colonel Wilkerson uh outline here um I'm I'm hopeful i'm cautiously optimistic always optimistic you can't be engaged in any diplomacy unless you're optimistic you have to be an optimist at heart so on that side I'm uh you know I I share Ray's sentiments that regardless of how bad this looks like in terms of a you know geopolitical diplomatic trade foreign policy train wreck they're talking to each other and and we have to hope that that's over overall a positive thing and they're talking to each other the Americans and the Russians have a line of communication uh the Washington and the Iranians Washington and Hamas but specifically on the Russia uh Ukraine situation this is uh perhaps the most volatile now this week so um by by that token I I share Larry Wilkinson's concern just about the overarching what I think is a huge mistake that's being made um by the Trump administration and I think part of it incompetence and and but a lot of it is just a lack of understanding um and a lack of appreciation because like he he okay I'll I'll be generous that Donald Trump has the right ideas he has the right intentions he wants peace but I don't believe that he has the personnel to pull off the type of highwire act multiple plates spinning three different major uh geopolitical flash points i don't think he has the people who have the skill set uh nor do they have the uh subject area experts to pull off any of these negotiations hence they're they're all fumbling if you look at Russia Ukraine it's materially worse right now uh diplomatically potential for they just hit you know the Russia's nuclear uh long-range deterrent i mean this is bad you know we're at Defcon you know we're going up the scale towards Defcon 1 and in in Gaza it's materially worse since Trump came into office and then Iran we have threats of attacking Iran preemptively that are still getting purchase on in Israel and in Washington so this isn't good so they they're potentially fumbling all three major negotiations i can't think of a bigger disaster and it's it's not as if there aren't competent skilled people available in the beltway that can help to advise including uh our our present company on this panel um uh Colonel Wilkinson and Ray McGovern who are subject area experts and they're one two of a few of many who could fill that role and they're not doing it instead he's paired down his team he doesn't have the type of compliment he's sending a private envoy which I think is completely uh unprofessional and unrealistic that Steve Wickoff himself is going to uh garner any results marco Rubio is not really involved in the way that previous Secretary of States are involved so this hierarchal system that Trump has uh constructed I think is a disaster not only that I think this the the rhetoric that this is not my war this is Biden's war that works politically for a while but you know you c you can't just pretend to be aloof and say and at the same say this would never have happened if I was president and then this week saying I did I I wasn't in the loop i didn't know about the assassination attempt on Vladimir Putin and I didn't know about this drone strike you can't it did happen under your watch Donald Trump you are president and the war is happening so that old stick is just completely getting old and then this backing off uh if they can't make up make a deal we're just going to wash our hands of this this the US is sherking its duty as a nuclear power as a UN Security Council member they they have a they're duty bound they have an obligation to the international community to play that role responsible role to tamp down tensions that's been traditionally the role of previous administrations instead they're doing really careening in the opposite direction and this is a problem is it because this administration doesn't appreciate what's at stake do they not appreciate previous administrations and the types of people who played those roles before and what could be learned from them you have to remember even Ronald Reagan could call Richard Nixon for counsel if he needed and I'm sure Rey has plenty of uh stories uh from his career where previous administrations were called in to give opinions and direction and counsel and help i don't see them drawing from that type of intelligence pool in this administration and I that frightens me um I I see the opposite happening i see them basically burying their head closing ranks and taking this kind of tortoise position half the time with the media and it it doesn't inspire a lot of confidence quite quite frankly yeah right anything you want to respond to both Colonel Wilkerson and Patrick here so we have two uh area subject experts and slash diplomats right on this program with you and me danny these are the kinds of people that should be available for counsel and advice now we're doing our best uh by talking to folks like you Danny but we're not getting much headway at least not yet now there's no denying the fact that there's chaos and that uh Trump is is unpredictable and that he's bitten off a lot more than he could chew he's Dr jackekal and Mr hyde for God's sake on Gaza it is unconscionable that we would continue to support to enable genocide so let's let's let's at least intellectually put Gaza and China and the rest of the Middle East actually at one side and say okay what about Ukraine on Ukraine for whatever reason he his instincts are good as Patrick suggested and so are Putin's Putin's instincts are whoa wow this is a window of opportunity this fellow Trump really seems to want to do some sort of deal of explained to him how hard it's going to be and he wants to do it anyway okay WhitF in that respect has played a useful role so there's chaos there's I've never seen the government in such disarray but to the degree that Trump is in control and that's an essential question he and Woodoff can bring this off now with resp one thing that Larry suggested about if we the United States tried to be a uh uh a negoti a mediator of consequence i don't see that as our role and more important of course I don't think that uh that Trump sees that as our role his role was to get the Russians and the Ukrainians together and he and Putin worked out just three weeks ago very clever ways to doing precisely that and now the Russians and the Ukrainians have talked twice now will this go on and on and on yeah but that's a good thing it's better to jaw jaw than war war as Winston Churchill says now that's an imperfect analogy because there is war war while jaw jaw is going on but what's the war about the worries about Russia how much it's going to win and how much it might be prepared for some kind of comp compromises to get its core interests as it says honored and agreed to so this is going to take a long time and it may never come to fruition these negotiations but meanwhile Russia is taking over as much of Ukraine as it thinks it needs to have this buffer zone so-called by Putin so that in the final analysis the Ukrainians what's left of Ukraine can't do damage to Russia now but these drones and stuff like that's going to be a very artful uh inspection regime or treaty or whatever it is but you know we used to just to finish up we used to use this word They're not able to make an agreement that was what the Russians were calling the US or that's what the US was calling the Russians okay but now wow they're getting together uh that is the Ukrainians and the Russians getting together and the Ukrainians seem to be the all of a sudden and the Russians are willing to make concessions i'm pretty sure they are they don't want to be burdened with the whole Ukraine under their toutelage they don't want another Vietnam for themselves so there's room there it's just that what was the word on and on and on and on well I see that as a good thing because I see it as a safety valve to to have some prospect that there could be progress at a more peaceful way rather than slugging it out with arnik and other things in Ukraine yeah uh Colonel Wilkerson I wanted to definitely uh you can feel free to respond to this but I wanted to ask you um about your reaction to uh you know Vladimir Putin and Russia came out with their terms for ending the conflict a lot of this drone attack this bridge attacks all of this comes in the context of the Istanbul talks and I just want to show you how the Western mainstream media has been framing it this was from NBC News putin demands to Putin's demands to Ukraine underscore a position the West always suspected no compromise the memorandum was less of a peace plan and more of a demand for Ukraine to surrender defanging its military and become a vassel of Moscow now I also want to play you uh Lindsey Graham because as much as I don't agree of this narrative that Trump is not in the no that Trump uh is somehow not a party and everyone else is kind of doing this Ukraine policy for him at the same time you have people like Lindsey Graham who very explicitly uh comment on uh uh this matter here is what he had to say when during his surprise visit to Kiev just days before the Istanbul talks and all of these attacks president Trump said that Ukraine doesn't have good cards well Russia's much bigger and has a lot more people i get that but the world has a lot of cards against Russia and one of those cards that we have is about to be played in the United States Senate in America you have more than one person at the guard table we have three branches of government and the House and the Senate are poised to act what would change our mind if Russia came to the table agreed to a ceasefire so Colonel Wilkerson uh your thoughts and reaction to uh to all of this well when I see Lindsey Graham I want to throw up generally speaking and he's from my home state i'm going to back uh every penny I have left in my bank account behind the woman who's running against him because she is really something uh as my father said Lindsey Graham is a jerk and I'm not giving him another penny he's a lying sack of all right before he died that was on his deathbed he really fell out with Lindsay and he lived right down the street from him in Cross Creek Plantation at least one of Lindsay's house houses at that time but he's a jerk and I don't take anything he says for gospel except I take it for his pronouncements on the empire an empire by the way Lindsay probably hadn't looked at the bond market lately but an empire that is rapidly going down the tubes if you look at the bond the Japanese just said &quot;Sorry don't want anymore certainly don't want any more 30 years and probably don't want any more two-year bonds.&quot; And American citizens are saying that now too so we're headed for a tremendous fall and Lindsay's expostation there as it was conceived in his mind that we are so big and so powerful and that we have lots of levers we can pull and just bring Moscow to its knees is absolutely ludicrous and Lindsay is going to find that out over the next 18 to 24 months i feel sorry and I didn't say I think I'd ever say that for the Senate of the United States when they have to deal with what's coming that said I don't think Russia is falling off of a single parameter that we've known for some time now and I don't think they're about to fall off a single parameter because they have through blood and treasure won that's the way wars work you know check your clouds wits that's the way they work one side wins and another side loses or you have a draw and a bigger power comes in you know there all kinds of permutations but in this case one side has won and the other side has lost now because this isn't really a war between Ukraine and Moscow and it's really a war between the United States of America and its vassal states in Europe who are rapidly becoming nonvassal and Russia it's a different dimension so the fact that Donald Trump has to participate in this is a prime requisite because the war is really between him despite his denials thereof and Putin or Russia and the United States with NATO as an appendage and Ukraine as the bloodied really bloodied proxy this will go on forever because we want it to and Russia isn't going to give up i don't care how how long we talk or how many cities we talk in that's the reality of this situation and it's going to be very difficult to change that reality unless someone says uncle and I don't see Donald Trump saying uncle he's the art of the deal man and he's got to come out of anything that happens that he participates in even if it's mainly at the top if you will geostrategic geopolitical top US Russia and better relations those are soured so badly now that I'm not even sure they can be achieved but even if they were achievable and that were what he concentrated on the bottom's going to eat his lunch so I'm not saying about this at all yeah Patrick uh definitely uh come come in here any reactions well there there's there one of the big problems with this administration is fundamental problem it's not just with this administration it's I would say for the previous administration as well i I almost appreciate the Obama administration on as big of a critic as I was about so many of the new wars that were started and so forth there was at least some logical you know you could follow some line of thought but you can't hear the problem is is is you see because if all of your uh ideas and your beliefs and assumptions about the parties that you're dealing with in the international system like Russia for instance okay if if they're all based on erroneous erroneous talking points that are on heavy rotation on Fox News like Putin uh wants to conquer the whole of Europe and Zalinsky repeats it in his speeches he said that we're holding the line here at Ukraine but we're also holding it for the whole of Europe and and we're going to force Russia to the negotiation table and I just hear the exact same talking points on CNN and I hear the same talking points in the Trump administration ultimately when they're having the conversations there through their various actors and cabinet members and so forth and surrogates if that's the case there's no way that you can have any kind of coherent policy that it's it's doomed to fail every single policy direction that you take will not succeed if your idea about what's going on and who you're dealing with is completely false and and sort of based on circular reasoning and propaganda and that's kind of where the United States is right now this is where Washington is right now it was bad under the Biden administration it's potentially worse under the Trump administration and and if we talk about the Middle East it gets even more erroneous the assumptions and the ideas and things like that so there there's that problem that's a fundamental problem but the other thing is and I don't mean to sound like overly dramatic with history but the for the US not to take a central role obviously have to be responsible wellinformed and able to uh be competent in negotiations and diplomacy but but there's a big danger by the US receding because other things can fill the vacuum okay there are other European actors that have actually been playing the role of chief whip in NATO i'm talking about Britain as as an example okay the the rhetoric is much more striden it has been for the whole conflict coming out of London with from Boris Johnson right now till to to to Kirst and so Britain has a very different agenda you could say probably even than the United States i know they've worked together like a hand and glove for a long time but they're giving uh Britain and maybe some other maybe uh dangerous actors in maybe slightly more ideologically driven like Poland in terms of their historical relationship with Russia and these are the things that you want to avoid because if the US pulls back then they will eventually be pulled back in and history has shown the United States being pulled into two major wars in the last uh century twice and to and then to you know marshall the uh rebuilding of of of the disaster uh and do we want a a repeat of that or or can we do things to prevent that from happening and I don't believe in coincidences and the start uh I think uh Colonel Wilkinson or or Rey mentioned the START treaty th this attack this week is very significant because more than anything it's a war that was declared on the START treaty okay all of these agreements are lapsed the ABM the INF treaty the Open Skies Treaty and now the START treaty so th this was I think a very calculated provocation and I don't think it came from Kiev i think this came from a NATO country possibly Britain possibly uh the US elements within the US intelligence were well aware provided the ISR for these attacks I'm sure but some plausible deniability because the United States may have been you know hands off on the actual operation but think about that no coincidence there that starts up for review very soon and they want to have this bundled agreement like they like with Iran they want to bundle in this giant all-encompassing agreement that's not going to happen so but we still get these provocations and you know what last week Britain uh uh launched their strategic defense review and the centerpiece of that this is no coincidence was called the kill web it was about drone swarms and thi this operation that the Ukrainians mounted with the help of NATO actors was called this operation spid web i don't believe in coincidences i think this was deliberate this is the future of asymmetric warfare and as our other panelists said this can just go on and on and on and it's hugely dangerous because you have the ability here to threaten governments to to to paralyze through constant swarms of these types of attacks to paralyze governments and when you're dealing with nuclear powers at some point uh a nuclear power could opt to launch a preemptive strike if they think there's an existential threat in terms of their nuclear deterrence dealing with nuclear powers it's a very dangerous area we we cannot proceed down this road if I don't think it's a sane path to to gamble and the talk in London from from the the MOD and everybody else is yeah we need to give Russia a bloody nose we need to teach them a lesson ukraine's going to you know get the upper hand now that's the belief now for the last 3 years so I don't the US should be moving in to say this is we're not doing this but that's not happening with the Trump administration that is hugely concerning plus the rest of Europe but somebody needs some world leader some government needs to step forward and take a leader because the I the Trump administration is Donald Trump himself being uninformed about a lot of the nuances of these things and and not delegating to I think competent subject area experts i think he's very weak he's showing himself as being being a very weak leader and is as as aloof in many ways as Joe Biden to take the rhetoric away and I I am hoping for the best but I'm also being realistic because I'm looking at how this is progressing and I see it going on a bad arc on all three major flash points at the moment and this needs to be dealt with now or things could spiral out of control down the road yeah Rey um I mean when it when we're talking about uh being thankful for Obama I mean we're we're in really bad uh territory now i mean it's just uh given every all the wararmongering that happened there if we're if we're looking at a better train of thought uh we have certainly declined uh quite a bit but Rey what does it also say any you react to anything that Patrick just said but it also say get you know Vladimir Putin and Russia had been very firm this is all about pressuring Russia to capitulate and give up on uh essentially what it's been demanding for uh several years plus now since the very beginning of this thing and Russia just won't Putin will not uh relent does not capitulate uh so what does this all say to you uh against the background of the wish by both Puchin and Trump to have a more decent relationship between the US and Russia that's the pervasive reality here they're together on that they give priority to that everything else in my view is secondary and if you buy into my theory you can understand a lot of the punishment that uh that Putin will not be provoked to react to and the way Trump keeps supporting Putin for example on encouraging the talks in Ukraine now they both have a mutual interest in that but they also have a mutual interest in allowing each other uh to back away from Ukraine putin has won as Larry said yeah he's won but Trump needs some lipstick on the pig of defeat and Putin in my view is flexible enough to give him that why because he's a nice guy no because he doesn't want to take over all of Ukraine okay so uh what about Adessa what about Khov you know the notion of Russian forces fighting fighting Ukrainians in Adessa's beautiful city is crazy uh uh Putin doesn't want to do that uh so there's room for negotiation bin said two and a half years ago at the end of one of these long Q&amp;As's that I think only I read the text of okay he said you know aessa could be a a yabla razor it could be an apple of discord think about your mythology okay or it could be a way of getting ir irreconcilable differences together so that so we can work so work really difficult things out that's what suggest it could be i think that there's still a prospect does Putin want to destroy Ukraine i don't think so i think that he'd prefer to have a Ukraine that was viable enough and it can't be viable enough on its own without access to the sea and that being a Jessa so there's things to work with here now let's respect to the propaganda to the public uh thing here the rhetoric uh you know it's interesting biden said several times &quot;Do you think do you think that Putin's going to stop Ukraine Poland Baltics?&quot; Well you know it's going to be really easy for Putin to say &quot;Look Donald this is what we do i will promise you that I will not and that I will not try to take over Ukraine i'll write it down nor Poland nor the Baltic Sea i'll promise that and you can advertise that to the American brainwash public as you got me to agree to that now what the American public doesn't know and this is key right the Russians stopped they stopped in March six weeks after the invasion of Ukraine because they scared the pants off Zinski and he picked his best friend to negotiate with them and they were just they had initial negotiation now it's going to be much tougher but I don't think the Russians want more than what they already have they have the power to insist on it it's on the fringes here and again the background of this overwinning desire which I can't really explain very well but I know it's there of both sides to create a more decent relationship one with the other Russia ruther US Dayton or even Rafal I think that can be explained to the American people in a in a gradual way and that's why as these talks go on and on and on and on that's a good thing we can have them go on the Russians will continue to progress and their hands will get stronger and finally Trump will realize well what will Putin give me in terms of this lipstick I need to put on this proverbial pig colonel Wilkerson though uh one one thing I wanted to ask you given what uh Rey just put out there is we know that the CIA we know that US intelligence UK intelligence we know that they're actively involved in helping Ukraine with these kind of operations like what we saw with so-called operation spider web and all these attacks on Russian territory won't eventually if this goes on and on and on and on um won'tually this lead to a kind of attack or could lead to a kind of attack that uh Russia cannot uh hold back on that that it will be compelled to respond in a massive way and I think that's one of the dangers I see of this going on and on and on your uh your take well as Clausitz points out very clearly particularly in book eight um you never know when that moment is going to arrive once you've let slip the dogs of war you never know and the deeper you get into it the greater your ignorance grows um and let me let me say a point about Odessa um if you've read any Allen first a better historian than most historians you know that Odessa is a criminal city basically um beautiful people yeah but mafiaike existence and I don't think as Ry said Putin would want it i know his naval commanders probably salivate over it because if they had it they then would have three major ports on the northern rim of the Black Sea and they would make our venturing into that sea very dicey so in terms of strategic interest if I were a sailor I definitely would want to complete my uh coup d'eta if you will with regard to the Black Sea with Odessa but I wouldn't want the problems that Odessa would bring for the very reasons that Alan Furs points out vividly in almost every one of his books in one way or another um so I I do I I agree with Rey that I don't think Putin wants the problem of partisans who for World War II alone if not earlier are some of the worst in the world in terms of killing everything men women children taking your gold teeth and so forth that's what he would get if he tried to invest all of Ukraine not to mention others that might participate from across the border as it were so I agree that he doesn't want the whole thing but he may be compelled to take more than even he wants because he can't just I don't think stop and let himself be peacemeal to death with things like just happened and other things that might happen right near the front that is thus created so he's got a problem there the inexraable movement of his forces um is something that generals would tell him we don't want to stop and just defend we don't want to stop and just vegetate so this this has it this conflict has its own dynamics on the ground that play into the strategic aspects of it and that's one of the things we're trying to exploit we're trying to use that very pressure that Putin's under to to either do something stop defend whatever we're trying to use that to further harass him and to further denigrate his forces um that's not a good good recipe for the future of that region and as I pointed out in other venues if I were the polls not the current government but if I were the polls some of whom I know quite well I would be uh wondering whether or not I might be able down the road here and we're still doing this work out a deal maybe with Moscow where I would get some of the territory that I coveret and and some polls do intensely still coveted and maybe give a backdrop to the problem that Putin is now confronted with and give a a sort of a margin of safety for him between real NATO if it even is still in existence and I don't think it will be um and his own forces so there are all kinds of dynamics to this conflict that could play themselves out militarily and otherwise but I do think the problem we've got right now is as Patrick said we don't have any competent people in the United States of America to deal with this problem and I think it's essential essential that we do deal with it it's just the nature of the beast if you will that we have to deal with it and we are not going to do it very confidently and that could deepen the problems yeah patrick and then Rey uh I definitely want your final thoughts before we pivot to um a different part of the world oh sorry Patrick yeah just to to to round off my uh thoughts on this particular situation um Danny you know it's uh the those in Washington whether that's JD Vance or uh Marco Rubio or whoever is you know pulling together foreign policy they they absolutely have to include Russia in the you know some kind of a coherent binding uh European security framework it it has to include Russia the the Europeans and the the UK are basically saying Russia's persona nangrada for all things Europe nato will decide and so forth and so the US is in a position to make sure that that goes in the right direction but they need to also understand how this this mechanism works and you know for for the longest time NATO has been the uh the glove in which the US could insert its hand to steer military political and economic affairs in Europe and now we're seeing with the rise of different types of politics coming including in the US um and different types of thinking in terms of foreign policy management of postworld war II zones like Europe and Japan for instance the Pacific a different type of thinking but this is also a very dangerous interregnum um historically and the at the same time and if you noticed those who are paying attention European collective defense was taking shape before the Ukrainian conflict kind of broke out in a big way in February of 2022 and they had just signed the PESCO agreement so what why why was that important it's not it's not exactly problem free with Europe because the one the problem with Europe is they can never get on the same page foreign policy wise because you have a collection of all these different countries nato provided this continuity led by the United States with Britain as number two to decide what foreign policy was going to be for Europe but those you can see it eroding now and I don't think they could get on the same page easily without NATO so a lot of people in Europe still clinging to NATO they they need the clout of NATO they need the gravitas of NATO they need to have this uh this track outside of their own democratic systems to exert power or to do whatever this new power configuration is going to look like um because if it's done through Europe it's going to be completely impossible and they might just end up subjugating to uh Asian economic uh growth and interests and the fact that the money is in Asia right now so they're they're fighting the inevitable in Europe the United States has to either decide what role they're going to play in this transition um this into a you could call it a multipolar world or a bricks centric uh political economy globally and I don't see that kind of clarity I don't really see any vision or strategy coming out of the US other than you know rentse seeeking opportunities for the Trump and transactional rentse seeeking uh power plays like oh what are you going to give us um what what are what are you going to provide us and and and these trade wars that Trump has uh declared against the world it's completely uh directionless i I don't see any clear policy uh in in anywhere anywhere in any of this as well as US foreign policy other than like Ry said Trump's instincts wanting to do the right thing and you know stop the wars okay that's a good starting point but there's a whole lot of other essential things that need to happen to get to that point and this this is the real problem so I really think there's a lack of imagination in Washington of where America's place in the world is in this transition and still calling China our enemy what has China ever done to the United States potentially they're our enemy they're going to thwart us from our you know catbird seat in the global hegemonic position ridiculous thinking but Marco Rubio himself has been paring this type of rhetoric for years so is is this what these people really think because this I don't think this is going to work going forward for the United States yeah Ray jump right in patrick they're ad hocing it as we used to say you ad hoc things you ad hoc them you don't have any real vision or policy however on Ukraine there is this back prop that I've described two times now and the fly in the ointment is the media it's the military industrial intelligence media complex okay what about the media they're controlled by the rest of the med rest of the military-industrial complex for God's sake look at the multinationals that control the media are we chipping away on it yes we are i think there have been some salutary developments of actual actually actually sensible reporting even in the Financial Times if you look over the last month maybe that's a harbinger of things to come the real problem is in Germany where the media is even worse than it is in the United States if you can believe it not quite as bad as Britain maybe but German people have been deprived of of of information that is valid there's one um member of Sara Vagen Connect's party her name is Okay so it's our first duty uh by this by this kingdom of of lies okay okay don't let ourselves be made dumb now there are a lot of Germans that realize they've been made dumb okay and I see that merits is is probably uh ironically a good catalyst for making them wake up and say &quot;My god our grandfathers told us about what happened in the 30s is this the 30s again and are we ready to deal with the Russians my god.&quot; So what I see here is a gradual chipping away at things where the media might be formed by more reality i see Danny your show and others as making a huge contribution to this and Americans being able to be informed but that seems to be the fly in the ointment that I see that's preventing sensible things from happening it's not only disarray and incompetence and stupid stupidity in in Washington it's the media which actually has control of a lot of what Washington polit policies are lastly there's no one that knows this better than Vladimir Putuchi who said expressly this is a virtual quote three years ago i realize that American foreign policy is made primarily on domestic political considerations that's how it's formed so if the media is telling uh Americans that poutine has two horns and he's worse than Hitler and that has to stop I see little chips in that and I applaud you Danny and others who are trying to make it possible for Americans to be educated and nish i appreciate that uh very much Rey now uh let's move if we can to uh West Asia because uh there it is just absolutely out of control uh and we have to just center here Israel which has been opening fire on these sham aid uh venues that have been set up which the gray zone has revealed through just simply scouring Twitter that Israeli officials have admitted that the Mossad has funded these sham aid centers and essentially have been drawing Palestinians in walking miles and miles and miles and then opening fire and killing now the reports say 20 but we 20 plus but we know it's a lot more but the situation maybe we can start with you Patrick the situation of course is very dire uh not only for the people of Palestine but we know that Israel right now appears to be digging itself into a huge protracted quagmire where it is demanding that it be able to strike Iran it is in a protracted conflict with Yemen and even just as we speak here we know that the Palestinian resistance has inflicted blows again that they are fighting very hard to u defend themselves from this genocidal onslaught so Patrick how about you give us the lay of the land of this situation i know that you cover it deeply first before we move to the others sure yeah first thing I'll I'll say is the where this situation is right now in Gaza is terminal right now it's really uh it's worse than anything I you could even possibly have imagined uh a year ago it's really really uh horrible what's happening and you have to you have to get past the rhetoric and this is where I've been a huge critic of uh the Trump administration especially Steve Wickoff um himself because again I'm I'm looking at I I'm not interested in the rhetoric and talk is cheap especially in uh foreign policy discussions and the the the material reality on the ground in Gaza is fundamentally much worse than it was when Trump took office okay and this is a president that has considerable uh you could say ties with Israel and hopefully some positive influence and uh somehow t uh t tampering down the Netanyahu's you know genocidal proclivities uh on this but what we've seen is a lot of uh I think pseudo negotiations uh the ceasefire looked amazing when Trump came in and it was a huge breath uh it g it gave restbite to the people that were being besieged in Gaza and and it was a great it was a great thing but it in hindsight it looks like it was merely a pause to give Israel time to rearm by the United States and its allies and then also to restaff uh its ranks of the IDF that were uh quite clearly demoralized uh after the you know the previous 12 months so if that's all it was was a strategic pause and it wouldn't be the first time the United States would be involved in such such a deception okay so if that's all it was then that's all for not and that was a show so what what has Israel always done in negotiations let's be realistic it's they're they're good at buying time they're good at buying time to change the facts on the ground and that's exactly what's going on now now you have the worst possible the worst possible situation um is that they they're a they by by demonizing UNRA the United Nations uh work and relief agency by by equating them with being a terrorist organization and the UN pretty much took that sitting down by the way except for their special raptor uh for uh human rights and Palestine franchesca Albanese is the only high-profile person I I that really to me pushed back publicly uh the secretary general did almost nothing in in in in hindsight so what they've done is is o tried to override tried to demonize neutralize ultimately shut down and destroy UNRA that's been providing aid since the mid1 1950s to Palestinian they don't just provide aid they do education they do counseling they do all all sorts of essential services and they're the conduit with three or 400 small kitchens around the Gaza Strip to effectively and efficiently uh feed the population okay so by cutting off aid and and imposing a blockade with the US and Israel have done that jointly okay you can't just put all this on Israel uh the United States has done this jointly with the Israelis okay by doing this the the floating pier stunt and now the worst the Gaza humanitarian foundation so-called and what they've done is by by neutralizing the supply of food from UNRA and then creating their own bottlenecks they're doing these what what what can only be described as feeding points okay four or five feeding points that are clearly quite clearly designed to push people to the south okay ultimately push them to into either kill zones or concentration camps and ultimately push them out uh through Rafa into the Sinai desert or kill them on the spot i mean that's kind of what it looks like on paper and and and the the United States is kind of shephering this pro uh process pretending it's not happening but that's exactly what's happening they've made Gaza unlivable and they've created a situation where people have to make m hundreds of thousands if not a million people might at some point if whoever survives is going to have to make the choice do I make a run for it and save my life and my family's life or whoever's left or do I stand my ground and die here because that's like that's that's what the Israelis have been pushing for they believe in Israel based on the political rhetoric across more or less most of the spectrum that they've almost finished the job with Gaza and let's be realistic about it and and I I don't I don't think there's any nice way to put we are looking at the worst possible uh humanitarian holocaust of our time okay it where and it's it's happening now and now you're starting to see some European leaders and some people in the media finally doing the responsible thing and and describing what is actually happening rather than covering it up but it it's almost like uh c can Israel be stopped pushing that final domino down with uh the Palestinians being crushed underneath it is is is that possible now i I I'm not sure and I'm not very encouraged by what I'm seeing from the Gulf either although it's been good that Saudi Arabia has put conditions on normalization with Israel so much as you know Israel must make some substantial moves towards the formation of a Palestinian state at least there's that but I don't see anyone intervening to save lives in Gaza from the Middle East or Egypt or or the Gulf um and I don't see the US doing it and I don't see Europe doing it so who's going to do it uh Colonel Wilus I want to get you in here uh you uh very frankly talk about uh uh the the atrocities and and what Israel is doing uh what do you make of this situation and uh can can this go on in perpetuity because that is essentially what it seems like Netanyahu and the Israeli government and of course the United States which has done very little uh to put an end to this but if it does I mean what are the consequences here both for the people of the region and and maybe Israel itself first let me say I associate myself positively with every word semicolon colon and period that Patrick just uttered this is a deplorable situation in my 80 years plus on this earth 50 of them in government service I have to say I've never seen anything like it nor did I think as a citizen of this country I would that said I think we've taken the wraps off one thing to a certain extent Mir Shamir Malt with their Israel lobby did a disservice they're right in terms of buying Congress in terms of Netanyahu in particular's control over the Congress we've seen vivid examples of that he actually called me and other military veterans who were on the congressional lawn as it were he actually called us doomcoughs for Iran um I'd like to have walked into the well of the joint session there and you know put a smack on his head but that's how bad the situation is and in that sense Walton Mir Shammer were right but they're deadly wrong about the ultimate situation israel is our pit pull in the Levant we as Lindsey Graham said clearly on the Senate floor more than once but one time I remember vividly I can quote him verbatim if they weren't doing it we'd have to be there doing it he believes that tom Cotton and Josh Holly and Ted Cruz and a host of other of my political party's members and lots of Democrats too believe that also that if Israel were not doing what it's doing in Gaza we would have to somehow do it and so it's really okay that they're doing it for us and would you please hurry up and finish the job what we didn't count on because we thought the IDF was as indestructible as the IDF itself thought it was was that these fighters who are clearly within their rights to attack an occupier who is not living up to his responsibilities under international law nobody ever talks about that or to attack an occupier who's kept them in an open air concentration camp for a decade or two and really intensified that atmosphere once Chiron pulled the idea out and turned everything over to Netanyahu and once my President George W bush in the Oval Office in 2004 looked at Chiron and said &quot;Over to you buddy over to you.&quot; Chiron was like a deer caught in the headlights what do you mean Mr president well nothing's worked the peace process the MEP the road map all the things Colon talks about all the time they haven't worked so over to you it's yours and it's been theirs ever since and they've been prosecuting it on a slow burner on the West Bank in the Golan in East Jerusalem and in Gaza and this attack on October the 7th gave them like 9/11 did us Kart Blanc and they've been doing it ever since but they didn't count on being beaten and right now they are on the cusp of losing and Hamas is on the cusp of winning but the people paying the price for this periodic victory are all around dying just as Patrick said miserably so absurdly so it's like a It's like a theater of the absurd to watch this happening and with the United States standing right by because we are letting them do what we want them to do i can't say that too many times this is our policy and they're executing it for us they're our attack dog in the Levant they're they're not acting because Trump was paid all this money by Miriam Adlesen that may be a transactional positive for Trump but they're acting because we let them do it we pay them we arm them we give them every capability that they have and we let them do it because we want them to do it and don't ask me why we feel that way i have my own suspicions about it has everything to do with race it has everything to do with Islam it has everything to do with we really hate all those Arabs and Persians but we just can't come out and say it and we'd like them all to destroy themselves but we just can't come out and say it and Trump has bought into that i don't know if he knows he has but he's bought into it i thought he might change things a bit and we might have a different situation but we don't but as I said we're looking at a situation where the IDF could collapse at almost any moment and if it does then this man who's in charge will open a new front with Iran and we're in for everything we'll have a new war and I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to be a regional conflict that turned out to marry itself up somehow with the conflict in Ukraine and wound up being a global conflict that's the prospects that both of these theaters actually have and you pull a Ronin into it create a third theater and you have the prospects much larger for a regional conflation and I just don't think that's going to be positive for anyone and we have nuclear powers in there we have a very instable nuclear power in Israel not an MPT member not an additional protocol signatory not a safeguards agreement signator a bastard case really and I fear far more the nuclear capabilities with regard to Jerusalem and Israel than I do with regard to Iran in every respect so it's a dicey situation in my mind it might be an even more serious situation than Ukraine ray come right in well let me say that I subscribe to every comma semicolon that uh both my colleagues have said except for two words in perpetuity i think Larry used that in another connection i mean I may be closer to perpetuity than the others of you because you're younger uh I was born before World War II so I was aware as I grew older of the first genocide i knew about it as a teen uh I couldn't do anything because it was sort of over but I said to myself when I get big and something like this happens I got to do something about it and now I'm big and I'm trying to do something about it it's unconscionable that people elected by our democracy would be enabling genocide now let me just uh say that uh the reason I have this kafia on is because I feel rather strongly about this uh according to the following following dictum from Bishop Desmond Tutu from South Africa now decades ago he visited Palestine and he said apartheid there was far worse than what he had experienced in South Africa far worse now that was before genocide what he said was this in such situations it is not a moral choice to be neutral to be neutral is to be on the side of the oppressor i refuse to be on the side of the oppressor and I think this is something one can can be very angry and emotional about i don't want my country doing this anymore now what can we do well people always ask what we can do you can do something aaron Bushnell who we awarded the Sam Adams award to last year uh before he self emulated uh he said &quot;Look um I would I used to ask myself what would I do if I was alive during slavery or or during Jim Crow or what would I do if people were being genocided?&quot; And I said to myself well and I say to you now you're doing it now you're doing it or you're not doing it okay that's a challenge now each of us has some ways to react here get off our rear ends and do something uh some of several hundreds of my colleagues in Veterans for Peace are fasting on 250 calories a day which is what the Gazins were subject to before the latest disruptions of aid supplies into Gaza before okay 250 i tried that one day my son went my son the doctor said &quot;No Dad you get I tried it one day and I was good for nothing by 4:00 in the afternoon.&quot; So that's going on they're demonstrating in this hunger strike before the UN mission to the UN and in many other cities okay the other thing well there's a flotilla boat going to Gaza it's about five days out good friend of mine good friend of ours Ann Wright is on it it's a multinational flotilla it's a sailboat great big sailboat uh they're about to arrive uh off the Sinai or off Gaza uh on the 8th of June as I reconstruct their path and I don't know if this was deliberate but Larry and Patrick perhaps will remember what happened on the 8th of June 1967 when the Israelis shot up the USS Liberty killing 74 sailors and wounding 147 others okay that's a strange coincidence what will the Israelis do uh to that flotilla boat filled to the degree it can be filled it's a small boat uh with provisions it's a a token uh access for aid to Gaza i don't know i know what happened when I did this in 2011 and that was that we were warned by the National Security Council and by the State Department that President Obama for his election prospects would just as soon want to have cold corpses come down off our boat which was titled the US boat to Gaza the audacity of hope okay and which we charted under US law and everything we were ready to go we we did go out into the nine miles in out of the harbor in Pereas and then uh we found out that the Obama had prevailed on the Greeks and their coast guard to turn us back why well he said &quot;Look you guys need an IMF loan right forget about the loan unless you disallow that boat.&quot; We had lots of people on that boat good people return back so at least we were spared being being attacked as the Marvi Moa was the year before with 10 people killed including a US citizen so what's going to happen to this Gaza flatillaa and if it happens will it get any will it get any publicity and you know what the Israelis have to decide whether they're going to let these guys in or not they probably won't but these people are doing it doing this act because it's good the last thing I'll say is you know people worry about results uh Americans particular I'm not going to get involved in anything unless well unless there's a reasonable prospect of success right well my friend Dan Buran and my tutor used to always say look uh the good is worth doing because it's good uh results are not unimportant but they're secondary to the goodness of the act so let's figure out some good nonviolent act that each and every one of us can do to make sure our government knows that we're not about as American citizens to tolerate genocide mass starvation extermination of a whole people i'm big now i'm not going to sit still for it yeah Patrick jump right in you know there's this situation as both Larry and Rey outlined is is not only dire but it has it does have this regional uh character to it and I'm I'm curious about your evaluation of uh Trump's and the Trump administration's approach uh you you've outlined its approach to Gaza but then there's this larger picture too that of course extends right to Gaza uh you have these talks with Iran for example that have just been head spinning in a lot of ways because on the one hand you have talks about oh we're almost close to a deal together and then you have on the other uh just these maximalist demands that come out uh it seems like every other day which seems to suggest that uh there is no movement there and then it comes to question well what exactly is the movement around all of this really all about anyway way so uh Patrick uh your thoughts yeah good uh point to jump on to Danny because the the Iran nuclear talks as they're called okay uh they're they're they're set up to fail for a very similar reason that the Ukraine talks are dysfunctional and set up to fail i'm talking from the US um position is that the you know Donald Trump wants to re do basically a carbon copy of the JCPOA or maybe something a little extreme in terms of you know what enrichment levels are allowed with Iran but he he and his you know previous regime led by monk Pompeo who was being prodded by Netanyahu to tear up the JCPOA and they certainly did it a year into the uh first Trump term the what what made that stick that agreement was the fact that it wasn't just the United States that negotiated it it was the fact that this was the P5+1 you had all of these major stakeholders Europe Russia all these people together can glue an agreement like that okay and and almost make it so it's difficult because of a change in administration or government in any particular country that that's not that's going to deep six the agreement that's how it was designed that's why it took two years to to put together so think of all the capital the US political capital poured in there all the time the sweat the effort Europe uh the the the European Commission different other parties that were involved in that and Donald Trump tore it up unilaterally at at the express uh request of Israel okay he himself probably didn't know why he just said at the time he's Donald Trump's analysis was it's a terrible deal it's a terrible deal what a terrible deal it wasn't a terrible deal because he's trying to get the exact he'd be lucky to get the exact same deal now but it's going to fail uh because of that reason you can't do this unilaterally and the United States has proven to the Iranians to the Russians and to uh the to people in Gaza the Palestinians and Hamas and whoever that they're not agreement capable that they're not they're not they don't have either another administration comes in that could actually be more hawkish than believe it or not than the Trump administration a neocon administration if they followed this this Trump administration then you all this this deal if Trump even signs or agrees on it it's going to be in disarray so where does that leave the the the Middle East security architecture um it's it it leaves it in a in a place where there's there's no there's there's a lot of potential there's some good things that are happening in the Middle East um I think but there the the good things that are happening are a result of bad things that have happened and I'm talking about the way the region views Israel the way the world views Israel that you cannot kid yourself there is no future for the state of Israel in its current form to to that that they can just waltz into the future having done what they have just done in the last two years there's there is no future they can't just pretend it didn't happen and wish it wish it away israel is stuck in a terminal death spiral they have to go for more war they have to escalate more aggression with various insundry neighbors anybody that seems to oppose them or stand up for the human rights of the Palestinians or they're going to collapse and fold uh the regime will fold and collapse from within under the weight of its own uh moral hypocrisy and just outright criminal crimes against humanity there's an ethical and a a moral collapse in the state of Israel and the United States is kind of not far behind it as their main backer and so the US legitimacy is being caught in the undertoe globally of Israel you see so at some point the uh the those who the powers that be international finance capital the money in the Gulf the Israel is now becoming uh more of a liability for the region than they are an asset for Western Empire okay which arguably that's what they they were the beach head for Anglo-American and Western transnational financial interest for the longest time but now that's changed now you can see pivot and finance and capital you know moving towards the Middle East and the future doesn't have Israel in it um in its current form as as a war making uh genocidal uh eth extreme ethnationalist regime uh it there's no future for it it's already it's played out its its hand historically now so the question is what what's going to happen in in the near term is this is it going to drag with the United States Iran into a conflict i see I see a potential for great potential for a security architecture in the Middle East between Iran the Gulf Turkey possibly Egypt you know to somehow hem in Israel somehow but what what's going to happen and this goes back to what Rey said was what can we do well what what we can do uh in the US internationally is have first amendment freedom of speech and assembly and the uh right to boycott and to divest and to lobby for sanctions against this bad international actor but the problem in America is the the current administration the Trump administration is basically declared war on the first amendment it's declared war on freedom of assembly it's chas Marco Rubio is spending more time chasing students in and around and out of the country than he is doing his job as secretary of state it's the most crazy secretary of state I've ever seen in my life okay so that if those are the priorities those that's what Americans can do that's what people internationally can boycott it south Africa the the apartheid regime in South Africa didn't fold voluntarily they they folded because of sanctions because of international pressure and the US public can lead that and they did uh do a huge amount in to bring down the apartheid regime in South Africa the US population did and as well as the European population but there's this goes back to what Larry said about the lobby just qu thing I'll say is just to expand on that that one thing Mir Shimemer and Waltz left out of their analysis is the fact that what that money buys isn't necessarily the president but it's almost in this case of Trump it bought the approval the short list of all his cabinet members that had anything to do with foreign policy or national security were okayed by Israel and it wouldn't be the first time this happened for a US cabinet it Obama Wall Street provided their short list of cabinet appointees in 2008 and if you think about what happened immediately after in 2008 and the financial crash the tarp the bailout that was hugely consequential same thing you could say with this Trump term and and this is a huge problem for the US because while they might be good for Israel all these people Mike Waltz Marco Rubio and whoever else they're not necessarily good for the rest of the world they'll do right for Israel but they're they're going to fumble the ball on every other uh uh situation so and this is where the lobby becomes dangerous more than just the perceived influence over the president but handpicking all the members of his cabinet who formulate policy and who go and attack students and uh and and a lot of those cases are going to win out in the in the Supreme Court because they're unconstitutional or federal courts but it it's created a chilling effect in America and this is costing lives in Gaza quite frankly yeah uh let's get final words from Colonel Wilkerson and then Ry colonel I want to go back to what Ry said about the boats um Conscience was attacked by a drone and we were pretty sure that was Israel and I'm really worried about this one because there's a sub in the Eastern Med right now very quiet sub a diesel sub one that Netanyahu took bribes from the Germans over I'm told that's part of his case in the court if we ever get him there but uh you know a torpedo would be horrible or worse divers coming out and putting Olympic mine or something like that on it uh but I don't for a moment put it beyond Israel to bring this boat down um if it does get within range so to speak of delivering its aid and I think Gre Greta Thunberg is on there too along with Ann and others brave souls all um I agree with what Patrick was saying um but I think we're at a point uh if you've seen Joseph Ozavar a Avazar Joseph Azavar Avazar Ave who is a uh Israeli citizen a Jewish Israeli citizen and who runs for a group of us every other Sunday a simulation uh simulating a government over the two governments over now the Palestinian Authority and Israel and more or less a federal government that would have a constit institution would have elections and so forth and I thought it was a real farce in the beginning and I didn't you know didn't really feel like I would participate in it but I've been participating in it now almost two years and Joseph uh was recently in Jaffa did a lot of videos from Jaffa and on the beach uh in Kaza and Joseph says things like uh Jewish state is not good for Jews which is a powerfully true statement and Joseph is all over YouTube right now just click through it and look at all the things he's doing many of the videos he made were in Israel he went to Ben Gorian's house stood stood in front of his house and said &quot;This is the first terrorist this is the first terrorist.&quot; And then went through the history and did that through out Jaffa went into Joffa on the Sabbath and said &quot;Look look look the train's not running.&quot; You know why the train's not running because they have this law that says on the Sabbath you can't work and so the trains can't work but you know how they get around that and then he described all the workarounds and he said &quot;Look at the shops and everything.&quot; This is not a religious state it's only a religious state for those ultraorththodox people and that's part of the problem too what do you think it's like out of the 100,000 that were drafted under the new law of the ultra orthodox I redeem only 10,000 reported for duty but what do you think it's like incorporating those 10,000 into the ranks of the IDF now bloodied in Kaiser uh is that helping morale i'll bet it isn't um back to my point that the IDF is falling apart and Israel is falling apart economically financially culturally conscience-wise psychologically whatever term you want to use it's falling apart now there's no doubt in my mind that we will probably try to buttress it and hold it up because it is our attack dog in the Levant and we're not about to turn to Saudi Arabia to do it or any other country in there the GCC or whatever we want Israel to do it i think Israel is as Patrick just implied strongly done toast put a fork in it um that's going to be traumatic for us this administration possibly is going to be traumatic for but then we've got the other issue and the other issue is that when BB Netanyahu and he is very good at smelling the winds senses this existentially he will go to war with Iran and every expectation is that when he expands the conflict that way we will be with him now I know Donald Trump has publicly said if he starts the war he's not going to be with him but I dare say I don't believe him we're going to be with him and then I think all bets are off uh for that region of the world we're going to have a real real war um all to say that as I said before I think we're in a very dicey time here in a stretch of contingencies um I the latest thing I heard about the negotiations which was preposterous in my mind was that Woodco had said that we were going to get an agreement out of Rach and others who were involved in the negotiations we were going to get an agre agreement that they would not enrich for three years and we were going to cover over that with the you know announcement that their enrichment was zero there's there's no enrichment at all and the details were going to be that they had agreed that they wouldn't do it for three years but we wouldn't make that very public and then they'd go back to do into 3.67 or 3.7 or whatever and get their other uranium that was a little more highly relish enriched from other countries as they did under the JCPOA i don't think that's I don't think that's right i don't think the Iranians are going to accept that at all i think they've put too much blood and too much treasure into this program and they're not going to surrendered even for three years of lying and cheating and stealing um so we're headed for another one there I think uh another one that will be accompanied by the state of Israel being kaput i'm not sanguin about that place either hate to be such a pessimist but Ray well I'd like to quote Rabbi Abraham Hesshel who is a real justice person especially during Vietnam and even later uh what he said was this um when people do evil uh there are lots that are involved if we're not doing the evil can't blame us we're not accountable so to speak well that's wrong we are we're accountable and we're responsible for stopping it because doing nothing in the face of evil is worse than doing the evil itself so are we sitting around condoning or not not holding our our own people accountable for this uh I dare say many of us are we have to stop that we have to respond to this this dictim that says &quot;Look you can't be neutral you can't be just a bystander.&quot; In other words when this kind of evil is going on because that's worse than doing the evil yourself says Hesshel i have one little question I want to ask Larry it's about Martin Luther King and a host of other people too yep yep that's right thanks for adding that uh Larry and and and Patrick have been following this very closely uh again I may be too relaxed about Iran and Netanyahu uh but it would be such a cataclysm if Netanyahu did in the last analysis what Larry just suggested and expected us to join him and my question is this are there enough compass admirals and generals in our armed forces to go to go to Trump now and say look uh we think at least Larry Wilkerson thinks and others of high repute think that if Netanyahu starts a war with Iran you will have no choice other than to join in uh just let us let us explain to you what's going to happen then okay israel's going to be destroyed and we're going to lose all those bases around the periphery okay so So you really want that okay my question is this aren't our military telling Trump that and isn't that one reason why I can be more relaxed than many others and thinking well that's why Trump has publicly warmed Netanyahu and in the final analysis maybe Netanyahu won't go that far i don't know you guys probably know more than I do my answer to that question Ray was the they were but I'm not sure anymore because a lot of those they are gone you mean the general officers not just the generals more importantly the colonels telling the generals uh ouch uh Patrick any uh I'm sorry if there was a question too but um we also can just close here yeah the um some of the people the talking heads uh you know Admiral James uh Stavartis and others uh they they all seem to be very pro-war just pretty much across the board um so yeah I don't see that um high high ranking former you know advisers and heads of NATO and so forth um stepping forward unfortunately but we do see a lot of other people especially in our media space uh like uh Colonel Danny Davis and of course present company as well um that seem to be giving sober advice and analysis on this so uh and and and certain people in the administration are listening and do watch these podcasts which is good um and some of these ideas filter up the question is do they stick and how well um are they getting through so like permanently changing thinking and so forth so I hope so so like what Rey said is something to be hoped for is is that um the the sea change in the media uh that some of the foreign policy discussions and things like on these big issues on on the independent media space and Judge Npalitano and people like this making a massive impact in changing public opinion especially within academia and within you know think tank world for it's creating a consensus and that consensus moves like an elephant it's very slow but it does move and not fast enough of course uh for the people who are uh you know uh under threat but it it is happening and and that's hopefully we're in a little bit of a race of time there well gentlemen it was uh great to have all three of you on stream today we can uh close here uh everyone as you leave be sure to hit the like button that helps continue uh this stream on into YouTube's algorithm you can go to the video description to find uh 21st Century Wire you can find that website below i don't know um if there's anything else anyone wanted to uh put out there uh Rey or Colonel Wilkerson you wanted to share um but if not we can head out well let me let me just uh say that my web web mister is my son and he criticizes me very strongly if I don't mention that he puts things up on my website which is called raycover.com not hard to remember all one word and I also do a lot of tweeting on X and that's raymc all right well I'm getting that in the video description Now without further ado everyone you can go to the video description too to find all the places to support this channel uh uh Patreon Substack and so many other options i want to apologize if anyone asked a question in the super chats we just don't have time today to get to them i think there was just one um but I want to uh really say thank you to everyone who gave a super chat as well without further ado everybody uh have a good rest of your day evening wherever you are and we'll be back again soon mhm" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="well we might have to bring you back out of uh retirement what you're currently doing and help have you help go through with that um I'd like to now recognize Mr horn for an opening statement chairwoman Luna Ranking Member Garcia and members of the committee thank you for the invitation to appear and testify today i served on the staff of the President John F kennedy Assassination Records Review Board for the final three years of its four-year lifespan from August of 1995 through September of 1998 i was hired as a senior analyst on the military records team and was promoted early in 1997 to head the military records team serving as chief analyst for military records until the ARRB shutdown on September 30th 1998 during my time on the staff in addition to securing the declassification and public release of military records related to Cuba and Vietnam policy I was privileged to work extensively in the medical evidence arena and to serve as the review board's pointman on issues related to the zaprruder film of President Kennedy's assassination although the review board was not empowered to reinvestigate the assassination or generate conclusions or findings of fact the board did choose to attempt to clarify the record of certain aspects of the assassination by taking the depositions of 10 persons who participated in or who were present at the autopsy on President John F kennedy and by later taking one additional joint deposition of five of the Dallas treating physicians i served as the principal research assistant to the review board's general counsel Jeremy Gun in preparing for and conducting our 10 depositions of the participants and witnesses to JFK's autopsy and was present at all 10 of those depositions the sworn testimony of our 10 opponents as well as numerous written interview reports of additional unsworn medical witnesses were all deposited in the National Archives in the JFK records collection without comment or endorsement in subsequent years I wrote a five- volume memoir about my own personal conclusions regarding the medical evidence and explained the substantial ways in which the work of the ARRB staff significantly enhanced the totality of the medical evidence and our understanding of how President Kennedy was killed some outstanding questions were resolved but many other questions were raised by the information we gathered questions that remain unresolved today and this is the heart of my oral testimony here many Americans remain troubled today by the many conflicts within the JFK medical evidence and what they might mean and they remain unsatisfied with the official conclusions offered up by both the Warren Commission in 1964 and the HSCA Forensic Pathology Panel in 1979 based on my work as an analyst at the ARRB and as an independent researcher I have concluded that there are ample reasons for the disqu of so many of the American people to wit first eight different sets of photographs known with confidence to have been taken during the autopsy on JFK are not in the official collection today and never have been some autopsy photos in the official collection at the National Archives are in gross disagreement with the head and neck wounds universally observed on November 22nd 1963 by the treating physicians at Parkland Hospital which they recorded in precise detail in their treatment notes that day and in their subsequent 1964 testimony at least two and possibly three JFK skull X-rays exposed at Bethesda Naval Hospital are missing today and have never been in the official collection the science of optical densitometry reveals that all three surviving skull X-rays are not originals but rather are altered copy films two highly qualified and respected MDs who were granted repeated access by the Kennedy family to the autopsy photographs and X-rays in the deed of gift collection at the archives both agree that the extent JFK skull X-rays reveal unambiguous and clear evidence of two head shot fired from in front of the president contrary to the findings of the Warren Commission and the HSCA the JFK skull X-rays actually reveal a total of three head shot one from behind and two from the front the so-called Harper fragment of skull bone a crucial item of evidence signed for by the president's military physician and photographed and X-rayed by the FBI has been missing since late in 1963 many bullet fragments known to have been removed from President Kennedy's body at Bethesda Naval Hospital were never placed into the official record and are missing today the remains of President Kennedy's brain following its examination were placed in a stainless steel container in 1963 but the brain is missing today as many people know already that stainless steel container and an original signed autopsy report were among materials transferred from the Secret Service to Senator Robert F kennedy in April of 1965 those materials and others were not among the materials returned to the US government by RFK on October 31st 1966 via a deed of gift to the National Archives the Kennedy family attorney Burke Marshall told the HSCA that Robert F kennedy had made those materials permanently inaccessible without providing details the 14 brain photographs in the National Archives today cannot be and are not photographs of John F kennedy's brain they have been impuged by the official photographer at the brain examination and by one of the FBI agents present at JFK's autopsy the chain of custody of President Kennedy's body prior to the start of the autopsy shortly after 800 PM on November 22nd 1963 clearly appears to have been broken casting even more doubt upon the reliability of the official autopsy report and finally Navy pathologists arrived at four sets of differing conclusions about President Kennedy's wounds and how he died within the two weeks after his death the official autopsy report that is now in the National Archives represents only the fourth and final set of conclusions this fact perhaps more than any of the others above is patently unacceptable in the nation that prides itself as the world's greatest democracy moving on to a new subject the existing deed of gift dated October 29th 1966 that sets severe restrictions upon who can view the JFK autopsy materials and how they can be used needs to be re-examined and lifted it has resulted in de facto suppression of these materials only by having free and unlimited access to the autopsy photographs and skull x-rays can troubling and persistent questions about their authenticity be definitively and finally resolved by qualified experts in my concluding paragraph I wish to make a short statement about the Zaprruder film of the assassination studies in Hollywood of the individual film frames that is state-of-the-art digital scans of extremely high resolution appear to show the use of visual effects that is animation or artwork to crudely and blatantly alter the image content in some key frames to state the problem simply the digitized Zaprruder film studied by professionals in Hollywood does not show the massive exit wound in the rear of the head seen at Parkland Hospital and by many witnesses at Bethesda during the autopsy because it has been blacked out and yet the film does appear to show head wounds not seen at Parkland Hospital we now know that rather than spending the entire weekend following the assassination in Chicago at the life printing plant as was originally claimed the Zapruder film actually spent most of the weekend in the custody of the CIA in Washington DC and at Kodak's main research and development laboratory in Rochester New York the attitude of one National Archives official expressed in writing circa 2009 was that they quote do not ever intend to take the film out of the freezer again end quote this decision excuse me this decision should be overturned and the so-called purported original film should be made available for appropriate inspection by qualified film professionals from the motion picture industry and academia and by that I mean film schools so that questions of authenticity can be definitively resolved i've provided many additional details in my written testimony and I request that they be included in the congressional record thank you very much thank you Mr horn and they will uh Miss Co if you can please provide opening statement thank you thank you Madam Chair thank you Ranking Member Garcia it's an honor to address the committee" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="hey all Peter Zion here coming to you from Zion National Park we're launching off a week in the Middle East today and uh as seems appropriate when you're in Zion we'll start by talking about what some people call the Zionist state israel Israel is a multi-party democracy uh that hasn't had a majority government in years this is not an electoral system like the United States where if you get one more vote than the other guy you get the seat no no no knew if you get a certain percentage of the votes you get a certain percentage of the seats so we've got like 11 parties in the Israeli uh parliament right now uh and as a result um for the last 30 years their governments have been um very weak because they have to uh make all of their coalition partners happy because if a coalition partner leaves odds are you're going to have a fresh election and you get to start it all over again so uh it's a lot like how Italy used to be in the ' 60s '7s and ' 80s and '90s and '90s um now uh in Israel where governments very very rarely last out their whole term the guy in charge is Benjamin Netanyahu who has been near or at the top of the Israeli political heap now for pushing gez almost 30 years almost 40 been a long time anyway he is a populist conservative who has no problem throwing other people under the bus or sacrificing some of his um political preferences in order to maintain power and I don't necessarily mean that in a condescending or condemning way when you've got multiple parties in parliament and multiple parties in your government you have to make a lot of horse trades on a tactical basis daybyday and that means that a lot of the things you do care about get pushed to the side and that's part of his problem right now uh Donald Trump uh entertained Netanyahu at the White House a few weeks ago and it went horrible really uh the only world leader who's been to the White House since Trump has been in that had a worse time was Zillinsky of Ukraine uh if you remember that ambush anyway Netanyahu came asking for three things number one he wanted a completely a free hand in Gaza to do whatever he wanted uh reminder that Gaza is that little strip of territory uh that until recently was ruled by a militant political group called Hamas uh kidnapped hundreds of Israelis still are holding a couple hundred of them and the Israelis have now been spending about a year and a half trying to beef it into some sort of shape that they actually think they can deal with in the long run the second thing that Israel wanted was an end to tariffs uh Trump put tariffs on pretty much everybody who wasn't Russia and the Israeli project in many ways has been American subsidized since the beginning back in 1948 and so the idea that the United States is now going to charge a pretty hefty uh tariff fee against the Israelis really caught everyone of all political stripes in Israel offguard because they thought that Trump being a populist conservative was one of theirs uh apparently not to the degree that they thought and then third Netanyahu really wanted to get uh Trump to bomb Iran into the Stone Age and do Israel's work for it um it didn't go well he basically got a firm loud Trumpian no on all three and you know there's a lot of speculation on a lot of sides as to how this is going to shake out but what it feels like to me is that uh Trump is just done with the entire alliance structure it's not just the Germans or the Brits or the Australians uh it's everybody and that includes Israel and so the Israelis are learning that even when they have their most populous conservative government in decades and the Americans have their most populous conservative government in literally centuries uh they do not see eye to eye and from Trump's point of view the problem appears to be Netanyahu the way Trump sees the world which is through a very specific lens that I would argue needs to be replaced uh Netanyahu represents everything that Trump looks down on came to the White House and he asked for things that's not what winners do that's what losers do uh he hasn't been able to clean up Gaza and it's been a year and a half why is this still going on it's entirely unfair you've got over 2 million people basically living on a postage stamp the idea that's going to be anything other than a breeding ground for insurgency is silly and there is no good solution for Gaza you want to ship the Gazins somewhere else where apparently people are starting to talk about sending them into the middle of the desert in Libya now whatever uh there's no infrastructure to move them there's no place that can take 2 million people in the Middle East anywhere even include including in the rich places but Israel wants them gone and Trump wonders why this hasn't been settled on the tariff situation you know the Trump view that the world has been ripping off the United States economically I have no respect for that that's just flatout wrong we basically paid people to be on our sides for the Cold War so we got something in return we got security control israel is different uh Israel has basically occupied a soft spot in the American strategic formula uh since foundation and when they say come after RIP like the Chinese or the French do we really don't do a lot about it because we're trying to make sure that Israel can exist as an island of democracy in a sea of problems anyway so there was no change on the tariff situation third up is Iran and while the Trump administration and Trump personally talks a big talk on Iran uh Trump has made it very clear over and over and over again in both this administration and his first one that he has no intention of getting involved in a meaningful war i mean he picked a fight with the Yemeni recently and then stopped after 30 days uh and now the idea that the United States is going to get involved in a knock them out fight with a country that can influence militants across the entire region seems a bit of a stretch to me uh also the Israelis very clearly have been pushing for the United States to do this long before Trump going back five presidents uh and it hasn't really gone the way that the Israelis would like and so when Netanyahu made his direct almost arrogant plea to Trump he was turned down flat that doesn't mean that the Americans and the Iranians are about to like kiss and make up uh but Trump really does want a nominal deal that would allow him to say that he made a deal and so those talks are continuing to grind forward uh the bottom line is that Netanyahu can't give Trump anything that he wants uh number one there's not a lot in the Middle East that the United States does want uh especially now that the withdrawal after Iraq has been completed and then second anything that might produce movement of for example peace in Gaza which is one of the things that Trump campaigned on can only happen by rupturing Netanyahu's domestic political coalition because by the tenor of the right-wing in Israel Donald Trump is a hippie uh and there's just no version of any deal uh in Gaza that would work for Oo this is nice take a look at that uh that would work for all of the factions in fact there are some members of Netanyahu's coalition who are wondering why they haven't kicked up the crematory and just gotten rid of the Gazins directly uh anyway so that's where Israel is that's where Netanyahu is um he's kind of stuck in a lurch there's no real good move for him and Trump is tuning out uh and that means the Israelis are going to have to figure out how to function in a world where the United States just really doesn't care about the Middle East now uh obviously this is happening under team Trump but I would have argued that we've been edging this direction for a good 15 years already and we're always going to get to some version of this where the Israelis have to figure out that they can't look after their security themselves they're too small they're too dependent on energy imports they're too independent on food imports they're too dependent on technology imports but there are partners out there that might work they just have to figure out which one they can stomach and the one that is most obvious the one that is closest the one that could be a threat if it wasn't a partner would be Turkey and we'll talk about them tomorrow" />

Great If it means that I have continued to try and be in the theater all these years because it's what I love and it's what fills me then great But I can't really comprehend what that means to me cuz I can't you know as I see how dirty my closet is and the fact that I have not done laundry in four weeks I can't go I am legendary Audra and McDonald I can't you know it's like and McDonald Yeah She's just like us So who who's a legend to you there are many One or two names Yeah in the theater Okay I don't know I just started to get so emotional I don't know why First person who's coming to mind is Why am I crying i don't know Diane Carol Ruby D Lena Horn Cuz they're not here They're not here O And they meant a lot to me I could see them They were doing it They look like me So imagine the message it sends to some little girl black or white who's looking at you going &quot;She can do it I can do it too.&quot; Yeah That means everything That really does A goosebump moment every night You can watch the 78th annual Tony Awards this Sunday 8:00 Eastern right here on CBS and streaming on Paramount Plus I mean people walk out of the theater One person said &quot;I was so moved when I walked out I didn't know whether to go right or left because she just floored me.&quot; Wow You know Time magazine has described Audrey as an emotional athlete I like Christine Baransky Like what you said Christine called her a naval seal to do what she does night after night The emotion that she has to conjure up And when I asked her how you're able to pull that off she says &quot;Sometimes I don't know I don't even know myself where it comes from but every night she does.&quot; She is an emotional athlete You can see it in the interview right i like that description When a feeling rises in her she's able to just be with it It takes such courage and poise to do that And that's why she can get emotional just thinking about the past And the talent is off the charts Yes Yes Yes Powerful Sunday This Sunday the Tony's I can't wait They made us read the the uh the Tony announcement first because they knew we were going to get involved and talk about Audra" />

          <attvalue for="5" value="Sky News Australia" />
          <attvalue for="6" value="joining me now is one of the finest thinkers of his generation best-selling author Douglas Murray douglas we've got plenty to discuss today let's start with Bono the uh preachy YouTube frontman with a history of questionable tax arrangements he's had um some thoughts about US aid it's not proven but the surveillance enough suggests 300,000 people have already died from just this cut off this hard cut of USD douglas we've got Bill Gates also making all sorts of bold claims um he's saying millions of deaths will this sort of advocacy for USAID have any effect uh no it won't i think as far as we know the judgment of Elon Musk the Doge team and indeed President Trump was that they looked under the bonnet of what was there at USAD looked to see if there was anything worth salvageable and decided that the whole thing was so rotten and there was so much unaccountability that it just wasn't worth saving it was worth scrapping uh I I I'm always loathed to hear uh from Bono pretty much about any subject other than singing with you too which he's great at um but whenever somebody like him talks like this they always seem to forget this this isn't their money to give away to his credit Bill Gates says that he's going to give away his money and give it away to Africa and we'll see if he does that but when Bono speaks like this he seems to forget this isn't just the sort of free money from something this is money that American taxpayers work for and hand over to the federal government to be wellused and uh the fact is is that USAD's money was not well used it was an incredibly political entity with as I say very little accountability it just um it just hosed money out particularly toward the end of Biden's time in office if you can say he was actually in office it just hosed money out because they want to be able to demonstrate that they're giving out money well I'd rather see that they're actually doing some good with that money but yes it's very easy for people like Boner to be very generous with other people's money yes I think uh people's eyes have been open to the sort of activism USAID was funding around the world as so many of these movements were wondering where are they getting the money from where's this organic sort of grassroots movement it never was that it was uh taxpayers unwittingly funding this madness now Douglas it's happened again karma is again tweeting like he's Donald Trump an angry Donald Trump who posted &quot;You have every right to be angry about small boat crossings i'm angry too.&quot; And he's promised all sorts of action there but Douglas the number of people claiming asylum in the UK in the past year in 2024 was the highest since records began they're not really doing much to solve this issue no I mean uh K Star Dmer says you know in a tweet &quot;I'm angry.&quot; in order to try to plate the actual real anger of the British public uh who just whether it's conservative or labor uh the migration just keeps going up up and up endlessly so that just illegal boat crossings across the channel in a single day again the other day were about 1100 people more than a thousand people arriving illegally in a day I what's the point of having laws what's the point of even pretending you have borders let alone pretending that you're angry when they they're being infringed when they're being infringed every single day when the law is being made to look like an ass every single day and if Starmmer actually wants to demonstrate that he feels angry about this he shouldn't just send out a tweet he should start the forced deportation of the hundreds of thousands if not millions of people who have broken into the UK illegally is he going to do that mhm we'll see probably unlikely uh staying in the UK u one has to ask does the country now have quasi blasphemy laws or perhaps I should just call them blasphemy laws uh we have a man who burnt a a copy of the Quran his own copy and shouted in Turkish that Islam is religion of terrorism well Douglas he's been convicted of a religiously aggravated public order offense and fined you're completely right Rita this is simply a blasphemy law you know um if if somebody were to set light to a Bible uh um everybody would be running out saying uh this man has an absolute right to do so the churches would be falling over themselves to demonstrate it it would probably win uh uh the Turner Prize or some other art prize for being so daring um but no the holy book of modern Britain as so many other western democracies now is the Quran it's the holy book in that even the people who've never opened it and don't know what's in it know that that is the thing that has to be protected so whether you're an autistic uh school child in the north of England who accidentally drops the Quran on the floor that child's mother will have to sit in front of effectively a Sharia council and beg for the life of her child in Britain in the 21st century if you're a school teacher in Batley and some deranged semi-educated parent alleges that a teacher has said something blasphemous about Islam then that teacher goes into hiding and is still in hiding to this day and if you burn a Quran it turns out that's the holy book that's the thing you mustn't touch it's not just a blasphemy law it's a blasphemy law that the state is allowing to be pushed through by threat of force because nobody is doing an argument here you know there's no good argument for why the Quran has to be treated as the holiest of holy books no it's only that intimidation violence and thuggery seems to work and I thought that was the sort of thing that the law was there to protect us against absolutely now let's go to the US and you've written in the spectator about the derangement of Harvard the Ivy League college is currently at war with the Trump administration uh we had those 30 more than 30 Harvard University student organization signing a letter Douglas literally uh whilst October 7 victims were still being uncovered blaming the Israeli regime entirely for for the un unfolding violence uh tell me what's happening at Harvard how did this prestigious Ivy League college become such a hot bed of hatred and hostility uh well you know it's well documented as you said Rita uh the students at places like Harvard from the 7th of October 2023 onwards uh were making it clear which side they were on they were saying in a joint letter on written on the 7th of October that the Israeli government not Hamas the Israeli government was responsible for all violence and since then students at Harvard and other elite universities have been allowed to rampage across university shut down uh um student accommodations and and places of study intimidate and uh uh beat up employees and basically act as low-level copycats of the of the thugs of Hamz they seem to admire so much but but the real thing is Rita we should all congratulate these students at Harvard and Princeton and Colombia and elsewhere congratulations to them they've spent the last uh 18 or so months calling for the Interard the uprising uh violent terrorist uprising to be globalized and well done guys you've got your way because not only do you have two people shot in the streets of Washington DC on suspicion of being Jewish you now have in Colorado uh um uh Islamist supporters of Hamas trying to burn to death Jewish people who are trying to call for the peaceful release of the hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza so well done students at Harvard well done all the students at Princeton and Yale and the rest of them you're getting your globalized inifard i hope you love it well we have that seen that shocking rise in anti-semitic violence in the US the two incidents you mentioned and just a short time before that a matter of weeks we had the uh a governor's house burned down uh it's just such an escalation and yet Douglas if if if it was a right-wing movement behind these acts uh one after another I would imagine the reaction would be a little bit more serious than what we're getting here because these are targeted attacks they are an acts of domestic terrorism and I wonder whether the authorities are looking at them as seriously as they should well we we've got uh um uh equivalents we can pull out i mean uh how many years was it now six years ago or so since Jesse Smlet uh remember him um a a low-grade actor in America uh claimed that in the middle of the night in Chicago he had uh been assaulted by two MAGA Trump supporters uh uh and racially abused and had a a noose put around his neck and and poison thrown at him and uh all sorts of other things and uh he just made allegations which of course turned out to be a total croc he'd hired two uh big black Nigerian guys to be the local white supremacist MAGA people but anyway remember when Jesse Smlette pulled that fake hoax uh hate crime uh within hours every leading Democrat Camela Harris every all these all these Hollywood people all the talk show hosts all said &quot;We have to have a reckoning as a country that this could happen here.&quot; that uh low-grade actors could be assaulted by people they've hired from Nigeria to fake hate crime oh we've got to have a a national rethink of everything guys but when real things are happening in real time and the object of the hate is Jews no because Jews aren't one of the cool minorities in the left-wing intersectional world and you know what's not cool with them either is reality they're fine fine talking up the fakes and the hoaxes and the ghouls and the the the the banshees that they imagine are lingering everywhere but when reality is right in front of them they'll continue to do everything they can to avoid it and we've seen the media some use some very imaginative words instead of saying Jews or pro-Israel i think one of them was uh uh pro Gaza hostage release uh activist there was some bizarre wording that NBC used before you go just on Harvard uh the university's tolerance for anti-semitism and anti-Israeli sentiment seems boundless in recent days we heard another speech at a Harvard graduation ceremony this time by Zerah Imam again all about Palestine there are no safe zones left in Gaza after 600 days and 77 years of genocide i center Palestine today not just because of its scale of atrocity but because of our complicity in it together we must refuse to be ruled by the tyrants of our time because our liberations are intertwined there you go Douglas 77 years of genocide the these are the best and brightest these are Harvard graduates yeah she she obviously doesn't have a dog in that fight does she uh she's covered in her kafir and so on uh you know as I mentioned in the in the uh spectator last week one of the many interesting things is the the toxic mix we see here of uh real bigotry and real hatred uh real sectarianism as displayed by that uh young woman there and uh and all the time with the fatal additional mixtures to the cocktail of fanatical ignorance and narcissism and the narcissism is who do you think you are you're a student at Harvard you're one of the luckiest kids in the one of the luckiest generations of all time and uh you seem to be under the impression that the war in the Middle East that Hamas started is somehow being directed from Harvard University and I've got news for those students neither Hamz nor the Israeli government take any direction from Harvard University or any other privileged Ivy League campus there's a world beyond the end of your own nose and these students haven't been taught that they haven't been taught anything they certainly haven't been taught any humility uh and so no they think that the world is going to be run on their terms well the sooner they grow up and learn otherwise the better but in the meantime yes they'll just continue this toxic cocktail of advocacy uh um endless prejudice against people they feel able to be prejudiced against and wild wild narcissism douglas Murray beautifully said thank you so much for your time tonight" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="These actually have billions and many billions of memory bits. Bits that store information in ones and zeros in them. Data is at the center of all our devices and generative AI, and accessing and storing that data requires these. Memory chips. And there's only one major memory maker based in the U.S. Micron. Micron. Micron. The maker of basic DRAM chips, the building blocks of all memory. Micron stock is up more than 30% since the start of the year, largely thanks to generative AI hype. And while memory is a simpler, cheaper type of semiconductor than the high powered central processing units and graphics processing units sending other chip stocks through the roof, multiple memory chips are needed to support each GPU or CPU, and that means making memory takes more space than other kinds of chips. The new fab that we're building in Boise, Idaho, right now that we just poured concrete on in October will be over 600,000ft². So over 12 times of the size that you see behind me. In addition to that, in New York, we're going to build four of those 600,000 square-foot fabs for a total of 2.4 million square feet. At $100 billion, over 20 years, Micron's investment in four chip fabrication plants, or fabs, in upstate New York, is slated to be the biggest U.S. chip project in history. It's a commitment Micron made with some big help from New York and a bid for National Chips Act funding. We have to make it worth their while. It's still a competitive environment, we're competing with the rest of the globe. But being the only U.S. memory maker also comes with risk. Micron is the latest target of China's bans on U.S. chips as the two countries vie for technological dominance. Micron has absolutely become a pawn in what I consider this 15 year war between China and the U.S. CNBC went to Micron's giant fab in Boise, Idaho, to see the start of its major expansion into advanced memory manufacturing on U.S. soil and ask how it will pull off massive growth amid a market oversupply and geopolitical turmoil that's casting doubt on the quarter of its revenue that comes from China. Micron was founded in 1978 by three chip engineers and one of their twin brothers in the basement of a dental office in Boise, Idaho. By 1980, it was building its first fab and pumping out a revolutionary small 64k DRAM chip by 1981. These chips, used for storing bits of data that can be quickly accessed by a CPU, ended up in many of the early personal computers. So there are two main types of memory DRAM and NAND. DRAM stands for Dynamic Random Access Memory, and it is a volatile memory, which means that when the power is removed, it loses all of its information. It's very fast, and it sits near the CPU and it's used for real time processing. NAND flash memory is what's in your SSDs or your storage cards, and NAND flash is nonvolatile, meaning it'll still store your memory even when power is removed. Micron went public in 1984. Remember our name when choosing your career. Scott Gatzemeier joined as an intern in 1997. And at the time, DRAM was worth its weight in gold. This was kind of as the dot com era was starting to take off, and it was incredibly exciting and something that I wanted to be a part of. Now he heads up Micron's expansion projects in both New York and Boise, where he gave us a tour. The features that we build on our NAND and DRAM devices are some 15 nanometers. Well, a human hair is 3000 times the size of those devices. So any, you know, hair follicle or dead skin could cause contaminations to our equipment, our wafers, causing our yield to lower. So this is why we wear the bunny suits and the gowns inside of the fab. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra says the $15 billion Boise expansion and the four fabs in Syracuse, New York are necessary because of how fast the entire memory industry has grown alongside compute and AI. At the turn of the century, memory used to be about 10% of semiconductors. Today, you know, it varies from 25% to 30% of the total global semiconductor industry revenue. Anything that has compute requires some amount of memory. This trend of AI, memory enables deeper insights, and that makes AI smarter. So as AI gets bigger, memory gets bigger. Memory used to be a crowded field, but over the years it's whittled down to just three top players. But the name of the game is high performance and low cost at the same time. Otherwise, you're going to be blasted out of the market. And there used to be 20 memory makers that were out there that were relevant, and really, there's only three at this point. When it comes to the biggest type of memory DRAM, South Korean giant Samsung is by far the leader in revenue, followed by SK Hynix, also out of Korea, and then Micron in the U.S. Micron has made 11 acquisitions since 1998. Numonyx, Elpida, Inotera, TI's memory business. For a very long period, they had not invested in a new fab, but they were still able to retain their market share by acquiring other smaller memory firms which were either going out of business, bankrupt. Unlike most kinds of chips, memory wasn't in short supply during the chip shortage, but Micron and its competitors did see a major upswing during the pandemic fueled boom in consumer electronics sales. Then, Micron's profits fell significantly in 2022 due to weakened demand for PCs and smartphones, a downturn that's affected much of the chip industry. Micron reduced its output to limit oversupply and laid off 10% of its workforce in the beginning of 2023. It now employs some 43,000 people globally. When I look at this market over the past 30 years, it's always feast or famine. And we have an oversupply now, but guess what? Give it a couple of months and we will be in an undersupply. Micron supplies memory in phones from Apple, Motorola, Asus and more and its optimistic about growth. The mix of smartphones is going more and more toward higher-end smartphones, toward the flagship smartphones, which require more memory as well. So when we look ahead at 2024, we actually expect that year over year, total worldwide smartphone unit sales will increase. But Micron is also focused on rapid growth markets like automotive and generative AI. Its most advanced product, High Bandwidth Memory, is set for volume production next year. HBM helps AI models like ChatGPT remember past conversations and user preferences to generate more human-like responses. It is able to pack 50% more memory capacity in a memory cube. It is able to give you 50% faster performance, and is able to give you about two and a half times better power and performance efficiency. And these are all the elements that are critically important in AI applications. Unlike the market wide headwinds of oversupply and slow device sales, Micron is facing one major challenge that the Korean memory giants have not. China banned some of Micron sales in May, citing cybersecurity risks. About 25% of Micron's business revenue comes from China markets, and about half of that revenue is at risk given the CAC decision. Last year, the US barred chip companies from supplying China with certain key technologies. Micron is absolutely just a pawn in this game right now. They weren't the first and they were not the last. Have you become a pawn in this in this geopolitical chip war between the two countries? What I can tell you is that it's very important for U.S. and China to provide an environment to the businesses so that they can invest in a predictable manner. Micron, of course, is totally committed to our customers across various end markets in China. Meanwhile, Micron has started construction on a $2.75 billion assembly and test facility in India. So Micron is obviously trying to diversify its base. It has testing and packaging facilities in China, and obviously they are trying to move, diversify out of China. India has been trying to lure and attract multinational chipmakers to set up projects in the country through multiple schemes and projects, and this is the first major one. For now, Micron is still in China, but China is turning to memory from Samsung, SK Hynix and smaller Chinese memory makers instead. That's possible because memory is considered a commodity, meaning it's relatively easy to switch between products from different companies, although that's not guaranteed to last. What I'm going to find really interesting is when we get back to the boom days, and Hynix and Samsung can't fulfill all the volumes, you might see China diving back into Micron and suddenly lifting any restrictions. As for whether Micron's tech does indeed pose a national security risk for China. I believe it's a front compared to a CPU or a GPU or a system. It's pretty hard to embed something nefarious into something like storage or memory. That would be technology that I have never heard of. We think China was being very nasty about this to Micron. In October, Schumer led a delegation of senators to visit China for a rare meeting with President Xi, in part to discuss the ban on Micron. China's upset with the Biden administration's very smart prohibition of selling certain types of chip manufacturing equipment to China, but we're going to stick up for Micron. This also isn't the first time Micron has been at the center of U.S.-China tensions. In 2018, the U.S. cut ties with Chinese chip company Fujian Jinhua after accusing it of stealing IP from Micron, a claim the Chinese company denied. Micron told CNBC its IP is critical for revenue in the commodity business of memory. So behind me you see Micron's patent wall and we have over 54,000 patents. Our primary revenue source is we want to use our IP to manufacture our chips better than others. The week before Schumer's China visit, Micron marked its 45th anniversary by pouring the first cement for its new Boise fab. Both Boise and New York will be producing these advanced 300 millimeter wafers with memory technology on them. The most advanced size wafer in the industry, correct? In volume production, yes. Micron's U.S. footprint today includes its headquarters and R&amp;D facility in Boise, a lagging edge memory fab in Manassas, Virginia, and offices in five other states. Its leading nodes are made at fabs in Japan and Taiwan. By 2026, Micron plans to start leading edge production at the new Boise Fab. And then in our state of the art facility in New York, when it's fully built out, we'll produce over 100,000 wafers per month. Each of these silicon wafers goes through more than 1000 steps over 90 days, traveling via automated overhead robotics. The vehicles that deliver these wafers travel over 23,000 miles annually in our fab. Memory isn't a high cost product like logic chips, computing powerhouses like CPUs and GPUs, but that's actually one reason Micron's fabs are even bigger than those needed to make logic. So memory is very cost sensitive, and we have to get economies of scale to mass produce our chips on a level that meets the market demands. Another reason the fab is so large is to accommodate huge, expensive machinery like this $250 million extreme ultraviolet photolithography machine for printing the chips tiniest features. So the sheer size of this tool is absolutely massive. There's over 100,000 parts. The tool weighs 20 tons. It has to be delivered on three 747s, then shipped to us in 40 shipping containers on the back of 20 semis. EUV machines are only made by one company, ASML, in the Netherlands, and they're infamous for taking incredible amounts of power. Micron says each of its new fabs will use the equivalent of 25,000 homes worth of energy. Renewable, reliable energy is absolutely critical for our fabs. In the U.S., we have access to that renewable, reliable energy, and the cost of that energy is about 25% of the cost of equivalent energy in Asia. Many of those 1,000 steps also require a lot of water. So in New York, we're building for 600,000 square foot fabs. Each one of those fabs will use 25 Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of water a day. 75% of that water will be reused and recycled right on site. Water and power were both big reasons why Micron settled on U.S. expansion. We have an area of plentiful fresh water, not just the Finger Lakes, but two Great Lakes, Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, and low-cost power generated primarily by hydroelectric and wind and solar. So we're ready for it. We know it's going to be a transition. The energy costs are, interestingly enough, lower in the United States than most parts of the world. People are more expensive in the United States, and so is the materials and the cost to build that factory. But that gap is narrowing over time. Still, in Arizona, the world's advanced chip leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, recently blamed a shortage of skilled labor for delays to its massive $40 billion fab under construction there. That won't happen in New York because we already have a legacy, we have Wolfspeed, we have GlobalFoundries, so this is not a new industry to us. We're attacking this from K through 12 all the way through post graduate studies. We are big donators to the STEAM School in Syracuse, New York. We also run chip camp. In fact, my daughter, she's 13 and she went to the chip camp in Boise, Idaho this summer. Still, the U.S. share of chip manufacturing has plummeted in recent decades. It costs at least 20% more to build and operate a new fab in the U.S. than in Asia. Labor is cheaper there, the supply chain is more accessible and government incentives are far greater. That's why the Chips and Science Act sets aside $52.7 billion for companies to manufacture in the U.S., and it's no surprise that Micron and more than 460 other companies have applied for those funds. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer thought up the idea for the Chips and Science Act at the gym in 2019 while talking with Republican Senator Todd Young. And all of a sudden, when it came to chips so essential to everything we do, we had lost that edge. And if we didn't get back that edge, and not just on chips, but on science broadly, we would no longer be the number one economic power in the world. The prosperity in America would decrease. The number of jobs would go down. So I felt a passion about this. The U.S. has especially lost that edge on the memory side of chips. Now, Micron is making big promises about changing that. Today, only 2% of the world's total memory production DRAM production is coming from the U.S., and all of that comes from Micron's fab in Manassas, Virginia. With Micron's investments through chips support in Boise, Idaho, as well as in Syracuse, New York, that 2%, over the course of nearly 20 years, will be changing to about 15% of the worldwide production coming from the U.S. In New York, Governor Kathy Hochul signed the $10 billion Green Chips Act last summer to entice companies like Micron, which says it's eligible for up to $5.5 billion from the bill. If they hadn't passed the Chips and Science Act first, I don't think it would have been as many as incentives as necessary to bring them home or to encourage existing U.S. manufacturers to continue to expand, so I knew I had to woo them, talk about our incentives, but also we get out of it 50,000 jobs. To make good on its promises in New York and Idaho, Micron is betting big that as the world relies more and more on technologies with vast data needs, they'll also need more and more memory. The large language learning models and other things like that that continue to increase large demand. We're now moving into things like FaceTime, higher resolution images, movies on demand. All of that requires more and more memory to be made available. Micron says construction in New York will begin at the end of 2024, and chip production will start in 2027, with some major promises about what that means for the country's share of memory manufacturing. 10% of Micron production today is produced here in the U.S., as these projects advance and complete, nearly 60% of Micron's production will be coming over the course of next couple of decades from here in the U.S." />

          <attvalue for="6" value="Chris Anderson: Demis, so good to have you here. Demis Hassabis: It's fantastic to be here, thanks, Chris. Now, you told Time Magazine, &quot;I want to understand the big questions, the really big ones that you normally go into philosophy or physics if you're interested in them. I thought building AI would be the fastest route to answer some of those questions.&quot; Why did you think that? DH: (Laughs) Well, I guess when I was a kid, my favorite subject was physics, and I was interested in all the big questions, fundamental nature of reality, what is consciousness, you know, all the big ones. And usually you go into physics, if you're interested in that. But I read a lot of the great physicists, some of my all-time scientific heroes like Feynman and so on. And I realized, in the last, sort of 20, 30 years, we haven't made much progress in understanding some of these fundamental laws. So I thought, why not build the ultimate tool to help us, which is artificial intelligence. And at the same time, we could also maybe better understand ourselves and the brain better, by doing that too. So not only was it incredible tool, it was also useful for some of the big questions itself. CA: Super interesting. So obviously AI can do so many things, but I think for this conversation, I'd love to focus in on this theme of what it might do to unlock the really big questions, the giant scientific breakthroughs, because it's been such a theme driving you and your company. DH: So I mean, one of the big things AI can do, and I've always thought about, is we're getting, you know, even back 20, 30 years ago, the beginning of the internet era and computer era, the amount of data that was being produced and also scientific data, just too much for the human mind to comprehend in many cases. And I think one of the uses of AI is to find patterns and insights in huge amounts of data and then surface that to the human scientists to make sense of and make new hypotheses and conjectures. So it seems to me very compatible with the scientific method. CA: Right. But game play has played a huge role in your own journey in figuring this thing out. Who is this young lad on the left there? Who is that? DH: So that was me, I think I must have been about around nine years old. I'm captaining the England Under 11 team, and we're playing in a Four Nations tournament, that's why we're all in red. I think we're playing France, Scotland and Wales, I think it was. CA: That is so weird, because that happened to me too. In my dreams. (Laughter) And it wasn't just chess, you loved all kinds of games. DH: I loved all kinds of games, yeah. CA: And when you launched DeepMind, pretty quickly, you started having it tackle game play. Why? DH: Well, look, I mean, games actually got me into AI in the first place because while we were doing things like, we used to go on training camps with the England team and so on. And actually back then, I guess it was in the mid '80s, we would use the very early chess computers, if you remember them, to train against, as well as playing against each other. And they were big lumps of plastic, you know, physical boards that you used to, some of you remember, used to actually press the squares down and there were LED lights, came on. And I remember actually, not just thinking about the chess, I was actually just fascinated by the fact that this lump of plastic, someone had programmed it to be smart and actually play chess to a really high standard. And I was just amazed by that. And that got me thinking about thinking. And how does the brain come up with these thought processes, these ideas, and then maybe how we could mimic that with computers. So yeah, it's been a whole theme for my whole life, really. CA: But you raised all this money to launch DeepMind, and pretty soon you were using it to do, for example, this. I mean, this is an odd use of it. What was going on here? DH: Well, we started off with games at the beginning of DeepMind. This was back in 2010, so this is from about 10 years ago, it was our first big breakthrough. Because we started off with classic Atari games from the 1970s, the simplest kind of computer games there are out there. And one of the reasons we used games is they're very convenient to test out your ideas and your algorithms. They're really fast to test. And also, as your systems get more powerful, you can choose harder and harder games. And this was actually the first time ever that our machine surprised us, the first of many times, which, it figured out in this game called Breakout, that you could send the ball round the back of the wall, and actually, it would be much safer way to knock out all the tiles of the wall. It's a classic Atari game there. And that was our first real aha moment. CA: So this thing was not programmed to have any strategy. It was just told, try and figure out a way of winning. You just move the bat at the bottom and see if you can find a way of winning. DH: It was a real revolution at the time. So this was in 2012, 2013 where we coined these terms &quot;deep reinforcement learning.&quot; And the key thing about them is that those systems were learning directly from the pixels, the raw pixels on the screen, but they weren't being told anything else. So they were being told, maximize the score, here are the pixels on the screen, 30,000 pixels. The system has to make sense on its own from first principles what’s going on, what it’s controlling, how to get points. And that's the other nice thing about using games to begin with. They have clear objectives, to win, to get scores. So you can kind of measure very easily that your systems are improving. CA: But there was a direct line from that to this moment a few years later, where country of South Korea and many other parts of Asia and in fact the world went crazy over -- over what? DH: Yeah, so this was the pinnacle of -- this is in 2016 -- the pinnacle of our games-playing work, where, so we'd done Atari, we'd done some more complicated games. And then we reached the pinnacle, which was the game of Go, which is what they play in Asia instead of chess, but it's actually more complex than chess. And the actual brute force algorithms that were used to kind of crack chess were not possible with Go because it's a much more pattern-based game, much more intuitive game. So even though Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov in the '90s, it took another 20 years for our program, AlphaGo, to beat the world champion at Go. And we always thought, myself and the people working on this project for many years, if you could build a system that could beat the world champion at Go, it would have had to have done something very interesting. And in this case, what we did with AlphaGo, is it basically learned for itself, by playing millions and millions of games against itself, ideas about Go, the right strategies. And in fact invented its own new strategies that the Go world had never seen before, even though we've played Go for more than, you know, 2,000 years, it's the oldest board game in existence. So, you know, it was pretty astounding. Not only did it win the match, it also came up with brand new strategies. CA: And you continued this with a new strategy of not even really teaching it anything about Go, but just setting up systems that just from first principles would play so that they could teach themselves from scratch, Go or chess. Talk about AlphaZero and the amazing thing that happened in chess then. DH: So following this, we started with AlphaGo by giving it all of the human games that are being played on the internet. So it started that as a basic starting point for its knowledge. And then we wanted to see what would happen if we started from scratch, from literally random play. So this is what AlphaZero was. That's why it's the zero in the name, because it started with zero prior knowledge And the reason we did that is because then we would build a system that was more general. So AlphaGo could only play Go, but AlphaZero could play any two-player game, and it did it by playing initially randomly and then slowly, incrementally improving. Well, not very slowly, actually, within the course of 24 hours, going from random to better than world-champion level. CA: And so this is so amazing to me. So I'm more familiar with chess than with Go. And for decades, thousands and thousands of AI experts worked on building incredible chess computers. Eventually, they got better than humans. You had a moment a few years ago, where in nine hours, AlphaZero taught itself to play chess better than any of those systems ever did. Talk about that. DH: It was a pretty incredible moment, actually. So we set it going on chess. And as you said, there's this rich history of chess and AI where there are these expert systems that have been programmed with these chess ideas, chess algorithms. And you have this amazing, you know, I remember this day very clearly, where you sort of sit down with the system starting off random, you know, in the morning, you go for a cup of coffee, you come back. I can still just about beat it by lunchtime, maybe just about. And then you let it go for another four hours. And by dinner, it's the greatest chess-playing entity that's ever existed. And, you know, it's quite amazing, like, looking at that live on something that you know well, you know, like chess, and you're expert in and actually just seeing that in front of your eyes. And then you extrapolate to what it could then do in science or something else, which of course, games were only a means to an end. They were never the end in themselves. They were just the training ground for our ideas and to make quick progress in a matter of, you know, less than five years actually went from Atari to Go. CA: I mean, this is why people are in awe of AI and also kind of terrified by it. I mean, it's not just incremental improvement. The fact that in a few hours you can achieve what millions of humans over centuries have not been able to achieve. That gives you pause for thought. DH: It does, I mean, it's a hugely powerful technology. It's going to be incredibly transformative. And we have to be very thoughtful about how we use that capability. CA: So talk about this use of it because this is again, this is another extension of the work you've done, where now you're turning it to something incredibly useful for the world. What are all the letters on the left, and what’s on the right? DH: This was always my aim with AI from a kid, which is to use it to accelerate scientific discovery. And actually, ever since doing my undergrad at Cambridge, I had this problem in mind one day for AI, it's called the protein-folding problem. And it's kind of like a 50-year grand challenge in biology. And it's very simple to explain. Proteins are essential to life. They're the building blocks of life. Everything in your body depends on proteins. A protein is sort of described by its amino acid sequence, which you can think of as roughly the genetic sequence describing the protein, so that are the letters. CA: And each of those letters represents in itself a complex molecule? DH: That's right, each of those letters is an amino acid. And you can think of them as a kind of string of beads there at the bottom, left, right? But in nature, in your body or in an animal, this string, a sequence, turns into this beautiful shape on the right. That's the protein. Those letters describe that shape. And that's what it looks like in nature. And the important thing about that 3D structure is the 3D structure of the protein goes a long way to telling you what its function is in the body, what it does. And so the protein-folding problem is: Can you directly predict the 3D structure just from the amino acid sequence? So literally if you give the machine, the AI system, the letters on the left, can it produce the 3D structure on the right? And that's what AlphaFold does, our program does. CA: It's not calculating it from the letters, it's looking at patterns of other folded proteins that are known about and somehow learning from those patterns that this may be the way to do this? DH: So when we started this project, actually straight after AlphaGo, I thought we were ready. Once we'd cracked Go, I felt we were finally ready after, you know, almost 20 years of working on this stuff to actually tackle some scientific problems, including protein folding. And what we start with is painstakingly, over the last 40-plus years, experimental biologists have pieced together around 150,000 protein structures using very complicated, you know, X-ray crystallography techniques and other complicated experimental techniques. And the rule of thumb is that it takes one PhD student their whole PhD, so four or five years, to uncover one structure. But there are 200 million proteins known to nature. So you could just, you know, take forever to do that. And so we managed to actually fold, using AlphaFold, in one year, all those 200 million proteins known to science. So that's a billion years of PhD time saved. (Applause) CA: So it's amazing to me just how reliably it works. I mean, this shows, you know, here's the model and you do the experiment. And sure enough, the protein turns out the same way. Times 200 million. DH: And the more deeply you go into proteins, you just start appreciating how exquisite they are. I mean, look at how beautiful these proteins are. And each of these things do a special function in nature. And they're almost like works of art. And it's still astounds me today that AlphaFold can predict, the green is the ground truth, and the blue is the prediction, how well it can predict, is to within the width of an atom on average, is how accurate the prediction is, which is what is needed for biologists to use it, and for drug design and for disease understanding, which is what AlphaFold unlocks. CA: You made a surprising decision, which was to give away the actual results of your 200 million proteins. DH: We open-sourced AlphaFold and gave everything away on a huge database with our wonderful colleagues, the European Bioinformatics Institute. (Applause) CA: I mean, you're part of Google. Was there a phone call saying, &quot;Uh, Demis, what did you just do?&quot; DH: You know, I'm lucky we have very supportive, Google's really supportive of science and understand the benefits this can bring to the world. And, you know, the argument here was that we could only ever have even scratched the surface of the potential of what we could do with this. This, you know, maybe like a millionth of what the scientific community is doing with it. There's over a million and a half biologists around the world have used AlphaFold and its predictions. We think that's almost every biologist in the world is making use of this now, every pharma company. So we'll never know probably what the full impact of it all is. CA: But you're continuing this work in a new company that's spinning out of Google called Isomorph. DH: Isomorphic. CA: Isomorphic. Give us just a sense of the vision there. What's the vision? DH: AlphaFold is a sort of fundamental biology tool. Like, what are these 3D structures, and then what might they do in nature? And then if you, you know, the reason I thought about this and was so excited about this, is that this is the beginnings of understanding disease and also maybe helpful for designing drugs. So if you know the shape of the protein, and then you can kind of figure out which part of the surface of the protein you're going to target with your drug compound. And Isomorphic is extending this work we did in AlphaFold into the chemistry space, where we can design chemical compounds that will bind exactly to the right spot on the protein and also, importantly, to nothing else in the body. So it doesn't have any side effects and it's not toxic and so on. And we're building many other AI models, sort of sister models to AlphaFold to help predict, make predictions in chemistry space. CA: So we can expect to see some pretty dramatic health medicine breakthroughs in the coming few years. DH: I think we'll be able to get down drug discovery from years to maybe months. CA: OK. Demis, I'd like to change direction a bit. Our mutual friend, Liv Boeree, gave a talk last year at TEDAI that she called the “Moloch Trap.” The Moloch Trap is a situation where organizations, companies in a competitive situation can be driven to do things that no individual running those companies would by themselves do. I was really struck by this talk, and it's felt, as a sort of layperson observer, that the Moloch Trap has been shockingly in effect in the last couple of years. So here you are with DeepMind, sort of pursuing these amazing medical breakthroughs and scientific breakthroughs, and then suddenly, kind of out of left field, OpenAI with Microsoft releases ChatGPT. And the world goes crazy and suddenly goes, “Holy crap, AI is ...” you know, everyone can use it. And there’s a sort of, it felt like the Moloch Trap in action. I think Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella actually said, &quot;Google is the 800-pound gorilla in the search space. We wanted to make Google dance.&quot; How ...? And it did, Google did dance. There was a dramatic response. Your role was changed, you took over the whole Google AI effort. Products were rushed out. You know, Gemini, some part amazing, part embarrassing. I’m not going to ask you about Gemini because you’ve addressed it elsewhere. But it feels like this was the Moloch Trap happening, that you and others were pushed to do stuff that you wouldn't have done without this sort of catalyzing competitive thing. Meta did something similar as well. They rushed out an open-source version of AI, which is arguably a reckless act in itself. This seems terrifying to me. Is it terrifying? DH: Look, it's a complicated topic, of course. And, first of all, I mean, there are many things to say about it. First of all, we were working on many large language models. And in fact, obviously, Google research actually invented Transformers, as you know, which was the architecture that allowed all this to be possible, five, six years ago. And so we had many large models internally. The thing was, I think what the ChatGPT moment did that changed was, and fair play to them to do that, was they demonstrated, I think somewhat surprisingly to themselves as well, that the public were ready to, you know, the general public were ready to embrace these systems and actually find value in these systems. Impressive though they are, I guess, when we're working on these systems, mostly you're focusing on the flaws and the things they don't do and hallucinations and things you're all familiar with now. We're thinking, you know, would anyone really find that useful given that it does this and that? And we would want them to improve those things first, before putting them out. But interestingly, it turned out that even with those flaws, many tens of millions of people still find them very useful. And so that was an interesting update on maybe the convergence of products and the science that actually, all of these amazing things we've been doing in the lab, so to speak, are actually ready for prime time for general use, beyond the rarefied world of science. And I think that's pretty exciting in many ways. CA: So at the moment, we've got this exciting array of products which we're all enjoying. And, you know, all this generative AI stuff is amazing. But let's roll the clock forward a bit. Microsoft and OpenAI are reported to be building or investing like 100 billion dollars into an absolute monster database supercomputer that can offer compute at orders of magnitude more than anything we have today. It takes like five gigawatts of energy to drive this, it's estimated. That's the energy of New York City to drive a data center. So we're pumping all this energy into this giant, vast brain. Google, I presume is going to match this type of investment, right? DH: Well, I mean, we don't talk about our specific numbers, but you know, I think we're investing more than that over time. So, and that's one of the reasons we teamed up with Google back in 2014, is kind of we knew that in order to get to AGI, we would need a lot of compute. And that's what's transpired. And Google, you know, had and still has the most computers. CA: So Earth is building these giant computers that are going to basically, these giant brains, that are going to power so much of the future economy. And it's all by companies that are in competition with each other. How will we avoid the situation where someone is getting a lead, someone else has got 100 billion dollars invested in their thing. Isn't someone going to go, &quot;Wait a sec. If we used reinforcement learning here to maybe have the AI tweak its own code and rewrite itself and make it so [powerful], we might be able to catch up in nine hours over the weekend with what they're doing. Roll the dice, dammit, we have no choice. Otherwise we're going to lose a fortune for our shareholders.&quot; How are we going to avoid that? DH: Yeah, well, we must avoid that, of course, clearly. And my view is that as we get closer to AGI, we need to collaborate more. And the good news is that most of the scientists involved in these labs know each other very well. And we talk to each other a lot at conferences and other things. And this technology is still relatively nascent. So probably it's OK what's happening at the moment. But as we get closer to AGI, I think as a society, we need to start thinking about the types of architectures that get built. So I'm very optimistic, of course, that's why I spent my whole life working on AI and working towards AGI. But I suspect there are many ways to build the architecture safely, robustly, reliably and in an understandable way. And I think there are almost certainly going to be ways of building architectures that are unsafe or risky in some form. So I see a sort of, a kind of bottleneck that we have to get humanity through, which is building safe architectures as the first types of AGI systems. And then after that, we can have a sort of, a flourishing of many different types of systems that are perhaps sharded off those safe architectures that ideally have some mathematical guarantees or at least some practical guarantees around what they do. CA: Do governments have an essential role here to define what a level playing field looks like and what is absolutely taboo? DH: Yeah, I think it's not just about -- actually I think government and civil society and academia and all parts of society have a critical role to play here to shape, along with industry labs, what that should look like as we get closer to AGI and the cooperation needed and the collaboration needed, to prevent that kind of runaway race dynamic happening. CA: OK, well, it sounds like you remain optimistic. What's this image here? DH: That's one of my favorite images, actually. I call it, like, the tree of all knowledge. So, you know, we've been talking a lot about science, and a lot of science can be boiled down to if you imagine all the knowledge that exists in the world as a tree of knowledge, and then maybe what we know today as a civilization is some, you know, small subset of that. And I see AI as this tool that allows us, as scientists, to explore, potentially, the entire tree one day. And we have this idea of root node problems that, like AlphaFold, the protein-folding problem, where if you could crack them, it unlocks an entire new branch of discovery or new research. And that's what we try and focus on at DeepMind and Google DeepMind to crack those. And if we get this right, then I think we could be, you know, in this incredible new era of radical abundance, curing all diseases, spreading consciousness to the stars. You know, maximum human flourishing. CA: We're out of time, but what's the last example of like, in your dreams, this dream question that you think there is a shot that in your lifetime AI might take us to? DH: I mean, once AGI is built, what I'd like to use it for is to try and use it to understand the fundamental nature of reality. So do experiments at the Planck scale. You know, the smallest possible scale, theoretical scale, which is almost like the resolution of reality. CA: You know, I was brought up religious. And in the Bible, there’s a story about the tree of knowledge that doesn't work out very well. (Laughter) Is there any scenario where we discover knowledge that the universe says, &quot;Humans, you may not know that.&quot; DH: Potentially. I mean, there might be some unknowable things. But I think scientific method is the greatest sort of invention humans have ever come up with. You know, the enlightenment and scientific discovery. That's what's built this incredible modern civilization around us and all the tools that we use. So I think it's the best technique we have for understanding the enormity of the universe around us. CA: Well, Demis, you've already changed the world. I think probably everyone here will be cheering you on in your efforts to ensure that we continue to accelerate in the right direction. DH: Thank you. CA: Demis Hassabis. (Applause)" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="I want to tell you what I see coming. I've been lucky enough to be working on AI for almost 15 years now. Back when I started, to describe it as fringe would be an understatement. Researchers would say, “No, no, we’re only working on machine learning.” Because working on AI was seen as way too out there. In 2010, just the very mention of the phrase “AGI,” artificial general intelligence, would get you some seriously strange looks and even a cold shoulder. &quot;You're actually building AGI?&quot; people would say. &quot;Isn't that something out of science fiction?&quot; People thought it was 50 years away or 100 years away, if it was even possible at all. Talk of AI was, I guess, kind of embarrassing. People generally thought we were weird. And I guess in some ways we kind of were. It wasn't long, though, before AI started beating humans at a whole range of tasks that people previously thought were way out of reach. Understanding images, translating languages, transcribing speech, playing Go and chess and even diagnosing diseases. People started waking up to the fact that AI was going to have an enormous impact, and they were rightly asking technologists like me some pretty tough questions. Is it true that AI is going to solve the climate crisis? Will it make personalized education available to everyone? Does it mean we'll all get universal basic income and we won't have to work anymore? Should I be afraid? What does it mean for weapons and war? And of course, will China win? Are we in a race? Are we headed for a mass misinformation apocalypse? All good questions. But it was actually a simpler and much more kind of fundamental question that left me puzzled. One that actually gets to the very heart of my work every day. One morning over breakfast, my six-year-old nephew Caspian was playing with Pi, the AI I created at my last company, Inflection. With a mouthful of scrambled eggs, he looked at me plain in the face and said, &quot;But Mustafa, what is an AI anyway?&quot; He's such a sincere and curious and optimistic little guy. He'd been talking to Pi about how cool it would be if one day in the future, he could visit dinosaurs at the zoo. And how he could make infinite amounts of chocolate at home. And why Pi couldn’t yet play I Spy. &quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;it's a clever piece of software that's read most of the text on the open internet, and it can talk to you about anything you want.&quot; &quot;Right. So like a person then?&quot; I was stumped. Genuinely left scratching my head. All my boring stock answers came rushing through my mind. &quot;No, but AI is just another general-purpose technology, like printing or steam.&quot; It will be a tool that will augment us and make us smarter and more productive. And when it gets better over time, it'll be like an all-knowing oracle that will help us solve grand scientific challenges.&quot; You know, all of these responses started to feel, I guess, a little bit defensive. And actually better suited to a policy seminar than breakfast with a no-nonsense six-year-old. &quot;Why am I hesitating?&quot; I thought to myself. You know, let's be honest. My nephew was asking me a simple question that those of us in AI just don't confront often enough. What is it that we are actually creating? What does it mean to make something totally new, fundamentally different to any invention that we have known before? It is clear that we are at an inflection point in the history of humanity. On our current trajectory, we're headed towards the emergence of something that we are all struggling to describe, and yet we cannot control what we don't understand. And so the metaphors, the mental models, the names, these all matter if we’re to get the most out of AI whilst limiting its potential downsides. As someone who embraces the possibilities of this technology, but who's also always cared deeply about its ethics, we should, I think, be able to easily describe what it is we are building. And that includes the six-year-olds. So it's in that spirit that I offer up today the following metaphor for helping us to try to grapple with what this moment really is. I think AI should best be understood as something like a new digital species. Now, don't take this too literally, but I predict that we'll come to see them as digital companions, new partners in the journeys of all our lives. Whether you think we’re on a 10-, 20- or 30-year path here, this is, in my view, the most accurate and most fundamentally honest way of describing what's actually coming. And above all, it enables everybody to prepare for and shape what comes next. Now I totally get, this is a strong claim, and I'm going to explain to everyone as best I can why I'm making it. But first, let me just try to set the context. From the very first microscopic organisms, life on Earth stretches back billions of years. Over that time, life evolved and diversified. Then a few million years ago, something began to shift. After countless cycles of growth and adaptation, one of life’s branches began using tools, and that branch grew into us. We went on to produce a mesmerizing variety of tools, at first slowly and then with astonishing speed, we went from stone axes and fire to language, writing and eventually industrial technologies. One invention unleashed a thousand more. And in time, we became homo technologicus. Around 80 years ago, another new branch of technology began. With the invention of computers, we quickly jumped from the first mainframes and transistors to today's smartphones and virtual-reality headsets. Information, knowledge, communication, computation. In this revolution, creation has exploded like never before. And now a new wave is upon us. Artificial intelligence. These waves of history are clearly speeding up, as each one is amplified and accelerated by the last. And if you look back, it's clear that we are in the fastest and most consequential wave ever. The journeys of humanity and technology are now deeply intertwined. In just 18 months, over a billion people have used large language models. We've witnessed one landmark event after another. Just a few years ago, people said that AI would never be creative. And yet AI now feels like an endless river of creativity, making poetry and images and music and video that stretch the imagination. People said it would never be empathetic. And yet today, millions of people enjoy meaningful conversations with AIs, talking about their hopes and dreams and helping them work through difficult emotional challenges. AIs can now drive cars, manage energy grids and even invent new molecules. Just a few years ago, each of these was impossible. And all of this is turbocharged by spiraling exponentials of data and computation. Last year, Inflection 2.5, our last model, used five billion times more computation than the DeepMind AI that beat the old-school Atari games just over 10 years ago. That's nine orders of magnitude more computation. 10x per year, every year for almost a decade. Over the same time, the size of these models has grown from first tens of millions of parameters to then billions of parameters, and very soon, tens of trillions of parameters. If someone did nothing but read 24 hours a day for their entire life, they'd consume eight billion words. And of course, that's a lot of words. But today, the most advanced AIs consume more than eight trillion words in a single month of training. And all of this is set to continue. The long arc of technological history is now in an extraordinary new phase. So what does this mean in practice? Well, just as the internet gave us the browser and the smartphone gave us apps, the cloud-based supercomputer is ushering in a new era of ubiquitous AIs. Everything will soon be represented by a conversational interface. Or, to put it another way, a personal AI. And these AIs will be infinitely knowledgeable, and soon they'll be factually accurate and reliable. They'll have near-perfect IQ. They’ll also have exceptional EQ. They’ll be kind, supportive, empathetic. These elements on their own would be transformational. Just imagine if everybody had a personalized tutor in their pocket and access to low-cost medical advice. A lawyer and a doctor, a business strategist and coach -- all in your pocket 24 hours a day. But things really start to change when they develop what I call AQ, their “actions quotient.” This is their ability to actually get stuff done in the digital and physical world. And before long, it won't just be people that have AIs. Strange as it may sound, every organization, from small business to nonprofit to national government, each will have their own. Every town, building and object will be represented by a unique interactive persona. And these won't just be mechanistic assistants. They'll be companions, confidants, colleagues, friends and partners, as varied and unique as we all are. At this point, AIs will convincingly imitate humans at most tasks. And we'll feel this at the most intimate of scales. An AI organizing a community get-together for an elderly neighbor. A sympathetic expert helping you make sense of a difficult diagnosis. But we'll also feel it at the largest scales. Accelerating scientific discovery, autonomous cars on the roads, drones in the skies. They'll both order the takeout and run the power station. They’ll interact with us and, of course, with each other. They'll speak every language, take in every pattern of sensor data, sights, sounds, streams and streams of information, far surpassing what any one of us could consume in a thousand lifetimes. So what is this? What are these AIs? If we are to prioritize safety above all else, to ensure that this new wave always serves and amplifies humanity, then we need to find the right metaphors for what this might become. For years, we in the AI community, and I specifically, have had a tendency to refer to this as just tools. But that doesn't really capture what's actually happening here. AIs are clearly more dynamic, more ambiguous, more integrated and more emergent than mere tools, which are entirely subject to human control. So to contain this wave, to put human agency at its center and to mitigate the inevitable unintended consequences that are likely to arise, we should start to think about them as we might a new kind of digital species. Now it's just an analogy, it's not a literal description, and it's not perfect. For a start, they clearly aren't biological in any traditional sense, but just pause for a moment and really think about what they already do. They communicate in our languages. They see what we see. They consume unimaginably large amounts of information. They have memory. They have personality. They have creativity. They can even reason to some extent and formulate rudimentary plans. They can act autonomously if we allow them. And they do all this at levels of sophistication that is far beyond anything that we've ever known from a mere tool. And so saying AI is mainly about the math or the code is like saying we humans are mainly about carbon and water. It's true, but it completely misses the point. And yes, I get it, this is a super arresting thought but I honestly think this frame helps sharpen our focus on the critical issues. What are the risks? What are the boundaries that we need to impose? What kind of AI do we want to build or allow to be built? This is a story that's still unfolding. Nothing should be accepted as a given. We all must choose what we create. What AIs we bring into the world, or not. These are the questions for all of us here today, and all of us alive at this moment. For me, the benefits of this technology are stunningly obvious, and they inspire my life's work every single day. But quite frankly, they'll speak for themselves. Over the years, I've never shied away from highlighting risks and talking about downsides. Thinking in this way helps us focus on the huge challenges that lie ahead for all of us. But let's be clear. There is no path to progress where we leave technology behind. The prize for all of civilization is immense. We need solutions in health care and education, to our climate crisis. And if AI delivers just a fraction of its potential, the next decade is going to be the most productive in human history. Here's another way to think about it. In the past, unlocking economic growth often came with huge downsides. The economy expanded as people discovered new continents and opened up new frontiers. But they colonized populations at the same time. We built factories, but they were grim and dangerous places to work. We struck oil, but we polluted the planet. Now because we are still designing and building AI, we have the potential and opportunity to do it better, radically better. And today, we're not discovering a new continent and plundering its resources. We're building one from scratch. Sometimes people say that data or chips are the 21st century’s new oil, but that's totally the wrong image. AI is to the mind what nuclear fusion is to energy. Limitless, abundant, world-changing. And AI really is different, and that means we have to think about it creatively and honestly. We have to push our analogies and our metaphors to the very limits to be able to grapple with what's coming. Because this is not just another invention. AI is itself an infinite inventor. And yes, this is exciting and promising and concerning and intriguing all at once. To be quite honest, it's pretty surreal. But step back, see it on the long view of glacial time, and these really are the very most appropriate metaphors that we have today. Since the beginning of life on Earth, we've been evolving, changing and then creating everything around us in our human world today. And AI isn't something outside of this story. In fact, it's the very opposite. It's the whole of everything that we have created, distilled down into something that we can all interact with and benefit from. It's a reflection of humanity across time, and in this sense, it isn't a new species at all. This is where the metaphors end. Here's what I'll tell Caspian next time he asks. AI isn't separate. AI isn't even in some senses, new. AI is us. It's all of us. And this is perhaps the most promising and vital thing of all that even a six-year-old can get a sense for. As we build out AI, we can and must reflect all that is good, all that we love, all that is special about humanity: our empathy, our kindness, our curiosity and our creativity. This, I would argue, is the greatest challenge of the 21st century, but also the most wonderful, inspiring and hopeful opportunity for all of us. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you Mustafa. It's an amazing vision and a super powerful metaphor. You're in an amazing position right now. I mean, you were connected at the hip to the amazing work happening at OpenAI. You’re going to have resources made available, there are reports of these giant new data centers, 100 billion dollars invested and so forth. And a new species can emerge from it. I mean, in your book, you did, as well as painting an incredible optimistic vision, you were super eloquent on the dangers of AI. And I'm just curious, from the view that you have now, what is it that most keeps you up at night? Mustafa Suleyman: I think the great risk is that we get stuck in what I call the pessimism aversion trap. You know, we have to have the courage to confront the potential of dark scenarios in order to get the most out of all the benefits that we see. So the good news is that if you look at the last two or three years, there have been very, very few downsides, right? It’s very hard to say explicitly what harm an LLM has caused. But that doesn’t mean that that’s what the trajectory is going to be over the next 10 years. So I think if you pay attention to a few specific capabilities, take for example, autonomy. Autonomy is very obviously a threshold over which we increase risk in our society. And it's something that we should step towards very, very closely. The other would be something like recursive self-improvement. If you allow the model to independently self-improve, update its own code, explore an environment without oversight, and, you know, without a human in control to change how it operates, that would obviously be more dangerous. But I think that we're still some way away from that. I think it's still a good five to 10 years before we have to really confront that. But it's time to start talking about it now. CA: A digital species, unlike any biological species, can replicate not in nine months, but in nine nanoseconds, and produce an indefinite number of copies of itself, all of which have more power than we have in many ways. I mean, the possibility for unintended consequences seems pretty immense. And isn't it true that if a problem happens, it could happen in an hour? MS: No. That is really not true. I think there's no evidence to suggest that. And I think that, you know, that’s often referred to as the “intelligence explosion.” And I think it is a theoretical, hypothetical maybe that we're all kind of curious to explore, but there's no evidence that we're anywhere near anything like that. And I think it's very important that we choose our words super carefully. Because you're right, that's one of the weaknesses of the species framing, that we will design the capability for self-replication into it if people choose to do that. And I would actually argue that we should not, that would be one of the dangerous capabilities that we should step back from, right? So there's no chance that this will &quot;emerge&quot; accidentally. I really think that's a very low probability. It will happen if engineers deliberately design those capabilities in. And if they don't take enough efforts to deliberately design them out. And so this is the point of being explicit and transparent about trying to introduce safety by design very early on. CA: Thank you, your vision of humanity injecting into this new thing the best parts of ourselves, avoiding all those weird, biological, freaky, horrible tendencies that we can have in certain circumstances, I mean, that is a very inspiring vision. And thank you so much for coming here and sharing it at TED. Thank you, good luck. (Applause)" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="hi everyone I'm Jimmy I'm the host of the show Thank you for watching Thank you for joining us on a um now it's starting to feel fake It uh I have to tell you something Uh Mondays with all the terrible stuff that happens over the weekend nowadays Mondays for me are like how I would imagine Monday feels for the janitors who have to clean up the men's room at the Port Authority bus station in New York all the horrors accumulate and we have to come in with a power washer and flush them all out I mentioned last week we finally got some good news out of the White House and the good news out of the White House is that Elon Musk is out of the White House We don't know for sure because they're doing their best to spin it to make it seem like his work is done But the more likely scenario is he didn't deliver any what he promised and they've had enough of them But it can't look like Trump made a mistake bringing him in even though he obviously did So they had a ceremony a farewell press conference to send the skittish South African off on his way and to catalog some of the many imaginary contributions Doge has made Doge canled $101 million for DEI $20 million for Arab Sesame Street in the Middle East Nobody knows what that's all about Nobody's been able to find it $8 million for making mice transgender So they spent $8 million on making mice transgender And he's reading it out of a three- ring binder So you know for sure it's true You think he believes that that I don't I mean there I'm not sure which is scarier that he does or that he doesn't because it has been repeatedly established that what Trump is referring to are transgenic mice not transgender mice which are mice used for gene research and have nothing to do with sex changes There is no such thing as transgender mice There's not even a Chuck-e-Cheese in West Hollywood But to Trump they Trump and Musk claimed Doge cut $160 billion from the federal budget Their initial promise was to cut $2 trillion from the budget but that didn't happen because Elon fired everybody who knew how to do math The most notable part of the press conference was the shiner on Elon Musk's eye I don't if you noticed him Reporters asked him what happened and he claimed he got punched by his 5-year-old son X and wound up with a black eye Steven Miller freaked out when he heard uh Elon was in the Oval Office with a black eye He uh he thought they said black eye and it was quite a relief But Trump was effusive in his praise for Musk He thanked him for working tirelessly Well yeah of course he was working tirelessly They say he's gobbling down 20 different kinds of uppers every day when he was there And and he Trump even gave Elana a get out of here gift I gave a little special something We have here Thank you A very special that I give to very special people I have given it to some but it goes to very special people and I thought I'd I'd give it to Elon as a presentation from our country Thank you Thank you Elon Thank you Take care Thank you I think what I'm going to miss most is their chemistry You know it's I feel like I feel like all it would take would be one trip to the driving range together to convince Trump never to speak to Elon again And who knew there was a key to the White House apparently in his book the first son-in-law Jared Kushner said Trump personally designed these keys which explains why they say key to the White House on them Master of subtle elegance Over the weekend the New York Times published a crazy story about Elon Musk claiming among other things he was taking ecstasy psychedelic mushrooms pills believed to be aderall and so much ketamine it was affecting his bladder control which is a delightful detail Between him and Trump that Oval Office is going to smell like an abandoned nursing home Elon of course denied these claims strongly Shortly after the report came out he wrote &quot;To be clear I am not taking drugs.&quot; That's a good start The New York Times was lying their ass off I tried prescription ketamine a few years ago and said so on X So this not even news It helps for getting out of dark mental holes but haven't taken it since then And I do have to say I believe him I mean does this look like a person who's on drugs thank you very much for being here He's done a fantastic job Our country has given $5 billion dollar plus I don't think Harvard's been acting very nicely I think Colombia wants to get to the bottom of the problem They've acted very well and they capture Ask your doctor about ecstasy You can't dance to bad music on ecstasy And mushrooms Go to space without a ship on mushrooms And ketamine A whole garbage bag full of ketamine And bladderall Blow up your bladder with bladderall I don't see any evidence of any unusual anything there at all I mean these are the moments of a perfectly normal well-balanced human being So Elon is leaving the cutthroat world of DC politics and headed back to work at SpaceX where he is beloved by all He offered us an interview at SpaceX's enormous headquarters We knew we were in the right neighborhood when we saw this huge bust of Musk installed by his admirers and vandalized by his critics Probably another one of his 13 kids Never mind the bandit who added Superman's chin to his face But all that fraud and abuse Elon and his musketeers found through Doge is nothing compared to what our conspiracy theorist and chief uncovered over the weekend Our current president blew the lid off a bombshell coverup involving our previous president that goes beyond anything we've ever heard before This is perhaps the most shocking political scandal in the history of this planet On Saturday Trump reposted this There is no Joe Biden executed in 2020 Biden clones doubles and robotic engineered soulless mindless entities are what you see This is a theory that claims President Biden was cloned and replaced by a robot which first of all aren't robots and clones two entirely different things Not in Trump's head they aren't And secondly I know Trump puts out this stuff like as a smokeokc screen to hide the fact that he's about to cut $600 billion from Medicaid but this is so deeply nuts How is this not on the front page of everything the president of the United States is spreading deranged stories about his predecessor being a robot Hey Republicans remember when you were very concerned Joe might not have the mental acuity to be president come get your guy because he thinks Biden was executed and replaced by a a clone a robotic clone I mean if your dad was saying stuff like this you'd start looking for an assisted living facility And by the way whoever built that Joe Biden robot is very bad at building robots I mean if anyone was replaced by a robotic clone it's Melania right and then he uses the words fake news with a straight face It's worth noting that the individual who originally posted this Biden gobbledygook that Trump reposted claimed today since he's on a roll that Michelle Obama is actually a transgendered man who played college football at Oregon State His name is Michael Robinson which makes even less sense when you go through the roster and learn that no one named Michael Robinson ever played football at Oregon State which means Michelle Obama is a ghost too Look I know I understand that Trump blasts us with a a fire hose of crap every day but the media needs to stop being polite when they report this stuff This is the headline from NBC Trump shares unfounded conspiracy theory claiming Biden was executed in 2020 Never mind unfounded This is not even a theory That headline should be convicted felon posts insane fairy tale about cancer patients while constipated on toilet Though I will admit a robot Joe Biden would make a pretty solid movie You get the best of both worlds Fastest reflexes modern technology has to offer onboard computer assisted memory and a lifetime of on the street elderly presidential programming It is my great pleasure to present to you Joe I'm staying in a race This idea is a bunch of malarkey the scripted cyborg It's just the beginning Trump has a lot of other great ideas including a possible pardon for Diddy Trump took a break during his goodbye party for Elon to weigh in on whether or not he would consider a pardon for his old pal Diddy First of all I' I'd look at what's happening and I haven't been watching it too closely although it's certainly getting a lot of coverage I don't know I would certainly look at the facts If I think somebody was mistreated uh whether they like me or don't like me it wouldn't have any impact on me Right Right I mean this is a man who's famously immune to flattery It makes no difference to him at all He loves the idea that he can let anyone out of prison at any time He loves it He's handing out pardons like they're podcast promo codes right now But he won't be giving one to Diddy if 50 Cent has anything to do with it Nobody's having more fun with this Diddy trial than 50 Cent right now and 50 Cent He claims he's going to call President Trump to share all the insulting things Diddy said about him just in case he thinking about giving him a pardon This is how far hip hop has come Rappers are now personally reaching out to the president to put their rivals in jail What happened to snitches get stitches is that And also can you imagine the list of calls Trump fields in the day is bananas All right Zilinsky I got to hop off I got Fiddy calling about Diddy And you know last week Trump freed a couple of reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrysley who were convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud They were already back They're shooting a new season of their show And according to Todd getting locked up wasn't all bad So you know we're grateful for everything that has happened thus far And as bad as this experience has been there's also been a lot of blessings to come from it I have met some wonderful men Well say no more As Trump's big beautiful bill works its way through the Senate Republican lawmakers are in the tough spot now of having to defend some truly indefensible ideas like throwing more than 8 million Americans off health insurance Iowa Senator Joanie Ernst had a town hall in Butler over the weekend with constituents who were very upset At one point during the discussion on cuts to Medicaid somebody shouted &quot;People are going to die.&quot; And before I share what Senator Ern said in reply I want you to think about the worst thing you could say to respond to that statement Do you have it okay I don't know what's in your head but I'm pretty sure this is it They are not eligible So they will be coming off So we people are not Well we all are going to die Oh for heaven's sakes There's a difference between we're all going to die and we're all going to die because of what you are doing This woman is a senator a United States senator telling her constituents &quot;We're all going to die.&quot; I mean imagine how terrified you would be if your Uber driver said that But to her credit Joanie slept on it and then took to Instagram to issue an apology Hello everyone I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize for a statement that I made yesterday at my town hall I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that yes we are all going to perish from this earth So I apologize and I'm really really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the tooth fairy as well Cruel and condescending That's a nice combination of qualities And all we need now is a dash of pseudo-Christian hypocrisy For those that would like to see eternal and everlasting life I encourage you to embrace my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Yes Yes The hardright conservative Jesus Christ who famously said &quot;Blessed are the poor bastards who suck so hard they can't afford healthcare.&quot; I hope the actual Christians of Iowa remember that in November of next year Speaking of cruel bastards Steven Miller was on Laura Trump's show over the weekend where he took a rare break from deporting children to talk about his own And have your kids met President Trump yes What do they think what's I actually I have a um I I'm very lucky because um I have a I have a uh a photo of my daughter when she was a newborn meeting President Trump Look at how he's holding that baby It's like like it fell from the ceiling and he caught it by the head But go on And what people don't know about President Trump you can speak to this He's actually great with kids He's like a kid magnet When kids are around they want to be around President Trump He's a child whisperer The uh kids love President Trump President Trump loves children Cuz he is a children He knows how they think Remember how Trump said he would lower grocery prices on day one well he didn't Groceries are still very expensive and these tariffs he keeps throwing around aren't going to help The price of all the basics especially clothes are expected to go way up by the end of the summer The price of eggs still 78% higher than they were under Biden's robot clone at this time last year Many Americans are now buying food on credit which is a bad sign And some companies are trying to capitalize on this now I just got an envelope from eggs forgold.com and all I had to do was look through my old jewelry that I never wear Eggs for gold Turn your unwanted watches bracelets and necklaces into cold hard eggs I

          <attvalue for="6" value="welcome to the Late Show I'm your host Steven Colbear Before we begin ladies and gentlemen I uh before we begin I want to warn any of our more sensitive viewers children pregnant or breastfeeding mothers that I am about to show you a picture of Donald Trump's face Uh here's the deal cuz uh yesterday the White House dropped the president's new official portrait Now you might remember uh he already had an official portrait which I believe was released on his inauguration and uh that photo can only be described as body in the morg that just stood up So to compare to compare to compare this was the old one and here's the new one Oh my god it's it's getting closer The new portrait is notable because it doesn't feature the American flag which has appeared in every official presidential photograph since Gerald Fords in 1974 They they had to remove it uh from the new portrait ever since the flag filed that restraining order Yeah Yeah Yeah Flagworth The new picture will replace the official photographs of Trump that have already been hung in federal buildings and offices The old pictures will not be thrown away They will be used from now on to scare horses I don't know why they want to do that but that's what they're going to terrify horses with it It's possible that the portraits of himself are the only things Trump really wants to be looking at these days because reportedly director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is having a lot of trouble uh briefing Trump on world events According to intelligence experts who have tried to brief him the problem with Trump is that he doesn't read which is appalling Although he's not the first president to struggle with literacy I mean who can forget the sign on Harry Truman's desk dur one analysis one Harry Truman fans There you go One CIA analyst said that when he tried to give the president his daily intelligence briefing Trump did not read it but he touched it Touching it doesn't count I don't think He's not your aunt Sarah who's only at the book club to drink wine I like the way the letters on the cover bumped out a little bit That was nice Let's crack open that next Chardonnay I'm not getting any less divorced It's so bad It's so bad that one retired officer said briefing Trump presented the intelligence community with the most difficult challenges it had ever faced Yes the most difficult challenges that the entire intelligence community of the United States has ever faced Getting Trump to learn I believe is the plot of the next mission impossible Do we Jim do we do we have a clip your mission should you choose to accept it is to get Donald Trump to read anything No No The intelligence community he looks fantastic Tom Cruz has still got it He's still got it The intelligence community has some ideas for how to better capture the president's attention One is to turn the briefings into videos styled after Fox News It makes sense because he's all he's always watching No I think it actually makes sense because he is always like looking at Fox News and the best way to get information into his brain is just to put the information someplace he's already looking all the time So either they have to put the top secret information on Fox News or at the bottom of a chicken bucket Here's the troubling news here There there's some troubling news uh from FEMA the Federal Emergency Management Agency Yesterday in a private staff briefing about the start of hurricane season acting chief David Richardson said he was unaware the United States had a hurricane season Okay Not not great Hurricane season is is big for FEMA That would be like the head of Hallmark Channel saying they were unaware that we had Christmas or small town bakery owners who have given up on love named Brenda Jingle falls in love with a owner of a candy cane farm This is a bad look for Trump's FEMA So the agency quickly tried to clean things up by claiming Richardson was joking Of course it was a joke That makes sense Just look at this laugh machine [Applause] Knock knock [Applause] David David Richardson acting FEMA chief Let me in There's a hurricane and I don't know why Okay Thank you Thank you Primarily I'm a hoofer You could forgive female employees for not always knowing when Richardson is joshing him because on his first full day as acting administrator he told the AY's employees that if any of them tried to obstruct his agenda quote &quot;I will run right over you.&quot; I'm kidding Of course I wouldn't want to hurt my car with your body I would poison you The Department of Homeland Security uh which oversees FEMA has defended Richardson saying &quot;Despite mean-spirited attempts to falsely frame a joke as policy there is no uncertainty about what FEMA will be doing this hurricane season,&quot; adding &quot;Which we all know starts in Martober the second week of Toyota thought Another another Trump appointee making headlines is FBI director and toddler who just walked into mommy and daddy's bedroom without knocking Cash Patel Recently Patel gave an interview to Fox News's Brett Bearer about I don't know who cares Check out how small Patel looks in his giant chair His little tootsies can barely reach the little footresty thingy Is he sitting for an interview or is he ready for his num noms it's Also I'd like to point out I'd like to point out at the exact same time in the exact same type of chair as Patel Brett Bearer appears totally normal It looks like a ventriloquist got an exclusive interview with his dummy Yet another one of Trump's cluster of weirdos is Health and Human Services Secretary and Vienna Sausage having a stroke RFK Jr Since since becoming since becoming the head of HHS Bobby Jr has introduced some radical changes to things like fluoride in the water and vaccination schedules to justify uh these changes Last week HHS released a report laying out their scientific vision to make America healthy which they called the MAHA report which claimed to be a quote clear evidence-based foundation for action on a range of children's health issues Just one problem The report is rife with errors including at least seven fake sources I mean the speculation the speculation is they just used AI to make up their science Any teacher would fail this paper immediately I mean how the heck did this guy even get through school i was at the bottom of my class I started doing heroin I went to the top of my class Wow RFK Jr is also riding the white horse down to Texas where a new bill that he's backing may soon force products like Doritos and M&amp;M's to include warning labels about ingredients not recommended for human consumption No no worries there By the time I finish a bag of Doritos I am no longer human More specifically thank you More specifically this is such generous people Specifically the bill warns about ingredients not recommended by other countries Well who cares about other countries Bobby we are Americans We are pioneers We We put a man on the moon We We put a shack on Aroni Finally finally I've got I've got a little uh bad news to everybody who likes to taste the rainbow because Texas also wants to slap warnings on Skittles and M&amp;M's Fruit Loops and Mountain Dew which use synthetic dyes Okay I mean I mean that's not great But was there anyone who did not already know those colors were synthetic the two O's in the word fruit weren't a context clue I mean there's not one ingredient of Mountain Dew that wasn't created at Los Alamos As Oppenheimer famously said &quot;I am become death blaster of Bajas.&quot; Things are pretty bad Right Right Bloody hell Right Things are uh things are pretty bad out there right now which is why it's important to focus on the little things For instance Tinder is rolling out a new feature that allows users to screen potential matches based on height O tough week to be Cash Patel Is he single is he sing do we know is he single seems like a catch Specifically Tinder is adding a filter that lets users specify the minimum and maximum heights of their matches Yes ladies you have to be careful with the maximum height You go too tall get stuck with a guy with a beantock who only wants to Fifi fool around I don't understand why people are so picky about dimensions Are they looking for a date or a dining room table on Craigslist my dream match Oh someone modern with long legs and an expandable leaf that can accommodate six to eight diners No surprise there's a little bit of blowback on the new feature with many accusing the app of superficiality Yes Yes Tinder matches should be based on nonsupficial reasons like a half-second glimpse at someone's face That tooth looks weird Nope We got a great show for you tonight My guest is former New Zealand Prime Minister Send Arthur when we come back Meanwhile join us once [Music] [Applause]" />

know we say a lot about the president Some of it isn't flattering Some of it is critical I'll admit that But it isn't fair to focus only on the negative We should focus on the positives too And today President Trump showed that he isn't just a dishonest divisive money grubbing golf ballpounding narcissist who cares only about himself He is also capable of showing compassion and he did that today This afternoon Donald Trump granted a full and unconditional pardon to Todd and Julie Chrysley These are the Chrisley's They are reality TV stars just like him He doesn't forget his roots The first time I saw a promo for their show I think I was watching Mr Robot I think that's the last time I watched the USA Network I thought it was a joke I thought there were actors in a parody of a reality show Put that picture up again about a woman who um married her own ventriloquist dummy or something It's not This is a real couple It's not a mom and her gay real estate broker son This is a real married couple who had a show called Chrysley Knows Best until a jury in Georgia found them guilty of conspiring to defraud community banks out of more than $30 million in fraudulent loans That happens to be an issue that is very dear to President Trump He has a soft spot in his heart for fraud And so he summoned the cameras to capture him calling the Chrisley's kids who are also reality stars to share the good news about the pardon Your parents are going to be free and clean and I hope we can do it by tomorrow Is that okay we'll try getting it done tomorrow So wonderful Give them I don't know them but give them my regards and wish them wish them a good life Mr President yes How are you i just want to say thanks Thank you for bringing my parents back Yeah You know isn't that beautiful that's That's how generous Donald Trump is He doesn't know those people He just saw some fellow criminals in need And you know the J in Donald J stands for Jesus Now thanks to his loving even Christlike generosity the Grizzlies can get back to the important work they were doing which was this Todd is very controlling And you have to let him think he's the boss And that's okay Okay So what do you think it's just me and you that supposed to be walking through the door Not me you and your camel toe Ty for real it's the whole hoof Are we sure that guy wants to leave [Applause] prison give me two more weeks to say goodbye to the fellas They said the uh Chryslies could be released as soon as tonight which was especially exciting for their daughter Savannah You know the real reason Trump released the Chryslies because a their daughter's good-looking and b she spoke in support of him last year at the RNC Turns out that was a savvy move President Trump didn't just commute their sentences he gave them a full unconditional pardon So for that I am forever grateful Um thank you President Trump and I vow to stop to stand next to you and your administration and exposing the corruption and continue fighting for the men and women that are in prison Cool We'll get you a ticket on the next flight to El Salvador a lot of people you can fight for down there Maybe after that she could help the Tiger King You know Joe Exotic is livid today He has been begging Trump for a pardon for quite some time And now they got it Instead he's so desperate He is now begging Khloe Kardashian to ask Kim Kardashian to ask Donald Trump to help him get out of jail being alive in 2025 It's like always being on mushrooms and and not a micro dose By the way Trump today floated the idea of pardoning the men who plotted to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer He said they got railroaded and he also granted clemency to a man convicted of tax evasion a month after his mom dropped a million bucks at a fundraiser at Mara Lago Paul Waltzac was an executive at a nursing home withheld more than $10 million from the paychecks of the nurses doctors and others who worked at his facilities and used that money to buy a $2 million yacht and a bunch of stuff at Burgdorfs and Cardier So he's good He's a good guy And when he was sentenced the judge told him there's no get out of jail free card for the rich And he was right The card costs a million dollars and is to be delivered in person by his mommy So wait a minute Let's do some math here because I want to figure this out So Paul Walshack he was um convicted of hiding $7.5 million from the IRS and then he after he was convicted he was ordered to pay a $4 million fine But then when he got pardoned that wipes out the $4 million So I will add the $4 million back And now assuming he pays his mom back the million dollars she gave Trump he comes out hold on ahead $6.5 million Not bad at all That's pretty good Finally someone associated with Trump made some money on something And I don't want to go down the if Biden did this road but the man stole from nursing home employees to buy a yacht What more do you And do we hear anything from Congress no That sound you hear coming from the Republican side of the aisle is crickets Specifically the ones they feed Ted Cruz at night And then and then we have JD Vance raking in the dollars I guess nobody told these guys that once you win the election you stop asking for money for a while JD Vance headlined a fundraiser in Vegas last night Tickets were a million dollars a pop Imagine you have one night out in Vegas That's what you go see Tom paying a million dollars to see JD Vance in Vegas He better be on that stage pants down humping a sofa while Selene Deion sings the Titanic song to cheer him off JD Chris Angel pulls an ottoman out of his ass That was last night Today JD was at the big Vegas Bitcoin conference Speakers included JD Vivic Ramaswami the Winklvoss twins Eric Trump and Don Jr basically the guys you'd expect to be lined up to greet you when you got to hell Trump's media company announced they're planning to raise $2.5 billion to invest in Bitcoin $2.5 billion This is that is a lot of bit or maybe it isn't a lot of bit Nobody has any idea how much Bitcoin that is Trump has been known to drop a lot of money on things he doesn't

          <attvalue for="3" value="Support our work: https://democracynow.org/donate/sm-de...&#10;&#10;We're joined by Israeli journalist Gideon Levy as we continue our conversation on the Israeli-Lebanon ceasefire. We take a look at the mood within Israel, where Levy characterizes the Israeli public as &quot;sour&quot; about what is seen as a premature deal. &quot;They would like to see more blood, more destruction in Lebanon,&quot; says Levy. &quot;Israel wants wars.&quot; This retributive stance is still being felt in Lebanon, adds writer Lina Mounzer, who says Lebanese people are &quot;very terrified of the day after&quot; and do not feel that they have been awarded peace, despite the terms of the ceasefire. Meanwhile, the Israeli government has unanimously voted to sanction the Israeli newspaper Haaretz_, claiming that its editorials &quot;have hurt the legitimacy of the state of Israel and its right to self defense.&quot; _Haaretz has criticized the move, which comes just months after Israel banned the international media outlet Al Jazeera, as anti-democratic. Levy, a columnist for _Haaretz_, says the sanction makes it clear that Israelis cannot take the freedom of speech &quot;for granted anymore.&quot;&#10;&#10;Democracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on over 1,500 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

          <attvalue for="6" value="I want to bring giddon Levy into this conversation in Tel Aviv um giddon if you could start off by responding to there was a um latest text from the Israeli negotiator Gan Basin um who wrote the ceasefire agreement which went into effect today is good news the agreement is between Israel and the government of Lebanon not between Israel and Hezbollah it seems that Hezbollah has been weakened enough um it says uh it seems that it's been weakened enough um that let's see if I can find this that it's been weakened enough to end the war in Lebanon before the war in Gaza has ended your response to this and also the response in Israel right now to I think it was about 4 a.m. that the ceasefire or this cessation in hostilities went into effect yes I wish I could tell you that Israel is happy about the ceasefire I wish I could tell you that there is even a relief in Israel but unfortunately in Israel everyone almost everyone is critical about this agreement I guess many Israelis did not have enough for sure the right Wingers for sure the most of the inhabitants of the north they would like to see more blood and more destruction Lebanon and therefore they are so sour today and the other Camp as usual is saying nothing and even one of the opposition leaders Benny gun even criticized the ceas he saw the war should go on in other words Israel wants Wars that's the inevitable conclusion when you see reactions to a ceas fire which puts an end at least partial end to suffer in both sides suffer which didn't lead to anywhere Israel didn't achieve anything in this war it will not achieve anything in the war in Gaza 10 times or 1,000 times worse and here I must emphasize that nobody should have any Illusions has no intention to put an end to the war in Gaza what happened in Lebanon will not happen soon in Gaza because if he goes for an agreement in Gaza he loses his government and that's his top priority and Israel at least part of Israel has very serious intentions to resettle Gaza don't underestimate those settlers the sky the limit for them they just wait for Donald Trump to get into the office and I will not be surprised if we very soon later see settlements in Gaza in other words nothing was solved yesterday accept of the the the punishment of of Lebanon which came to its end but also this is for a very limited time I mean when the prime minister speaks about the agreement and all he has to say are threats about Lebanon and kbal that if any violation will take place immediately Israel will attack again so we are going from one war to the other and from one viol confrontation to the other without even suggesting any other alternative nothing nobody speaks about diplomacy nobody speaks about touching the core issues both in the north and in the South our friend from from Lebanon our Lebanese friend just mentioned violations of the of the sovereignity of Lebanon anyone speaks about the fact that Israel I'm sure will continue to fly over Lebanon known for intelligence this will be kosher this will be legitimate and only the violation of of of Israeli sovereignity is never forgiven and get Lev I wanted to ask you in terms of the the the toll on the the IDF now over 800 soldiers have been killed in Gaza about the estimates are about 70 73 or 74 uh in in Lebanon on and those are the only ones the ones publicly acknowledged uh the what is the impact on Israel of continuing this war on the economy of Israel on migration on tourism and the other aspects of economic life in Israel the price is enormous but somehow Israeli accepted this is this unbelievable phenomena in which people are ready to sacrifice the dearest ones I mean who is more than your son without seeing a real purpose I mean they all tell themselves that they were killed sacrificed for the for the defense of Israel what what kind of defense is it if you bomb camp in Gaza what what does Israel benefit out of it the economical price is one thing I mean you mentioned tourism there's no tourism whatsoever there are hardly any International Airlines to fly in here but there is a much heavier price namely turning Israel into a par State you know it very well from the United States but everywhere else it's not only that netan and and the Gallant are now wanted all over the world every Israeli will feel it when he will go abroad now every Israelis everywhere will feel at least discomfort in presenting himself identifying himself as an Israeli and still Israelis are ready to take this only because they were told that we have to live from war to war to live on our sword and there is no other option which is a total lie because Israel never tried an alternative but brainwash like brainwash gon and I don't know if you can respond to this but the Israeli cabinet has unanimously voted to sanction your paper harat saying its editorials quote have hurt the legitimacy of the state of Israel and its right to self-defense unquote under the move the Israeli government will stop advertising in the paper cut off all Communications with haret haret has slammed the decision saying it quote is another step in netanyahu's Journey to dismantle Israeli democracy like his friends Putin eruan Orban Netanyahu is trying to silence a critical Independent Newspaper haratz will not bulk and will not morph into a government pamphlet that publishes messages approved by the government and its leader unquote this all comes 6 months after Israel banned Al jazer from operating in Israel and as the president-elect here in the United States uh Donald Trump threatens to go after major US broadcasters and Publications calling the media the enemy of the people get on you serve on the editorial board of harats I know you can't speak specifically about the sanctions against your paper but can you talk broader about these threats to the Press sure it's not that I can't but we decided that this this message that you just read now is is our reaction as a newspaper but I think that those sanctions tell much more about Israel and Israel's government than about the arids and here I think especially in the United States who always speaks about the shared vales about the only democracy in the Middle East so first of all it's questionable if if a state which rules in such a brutal way in five million people can it all be defined as a democracy but let's put the occupation the part they side even for us Jews in Israel who used to live in a quite liberal democracy things are changing right now from day to day from week to week legislations against freedom of speech against the legal system against any kind of Human Rights against any minority are being ruled and and nobody says a word I mean nobody can stop it at least as long as this government is there so what I would like to stress here Amy is that you have to also look at what's going on within the Jewish Israel it is Chang changing while we are speaking and the war in Gaza and Lebanon has a lot to do with it because the those two Wars with all their lack of legitimacy and brutality also influence the domestic structure and the domestic system of Israel and you see the outcome I don't take my freedom of speech and I have of speech total freedom of speech but I can't take for granted anymore well I want to thank you both for being with us and I want to give Lena munza just we have 30 seconds but the last word on what you expect to happen from here as you watch what has happened to your country uh at least for this moment from afar uh look we're very terrified of the day after Mr Levy talked about the effect on internal Israeli politics we're also very afraid uh Lebanon is a very fragile you know pluralist state but at the same time the Israelis also have known very much how to uh work on that so they've been specifically bombing where the refugees have gathered we've seen over the last few months that people have been Turning Away refugees these refugees are largely Shia from South Lebanon uh and from uh the southern suburbs of of Beirut so there's been a lot of hostility that has incurred uh so we're really really afraid of the day after in terms of you know the internal stability of the country and what's going to happen to it and I just want to say you know to go back to this idea of collateral damage this is something that the United States normalized you know in our region in Iraq the way to punish an entire country in order to change some sort of internal mechanism which then devastates the country because of course they have no idea what they're doing and this is not you bring about change so we're all also very afraid of now what's going to happen to Lebanon internally as we go on and as the pieces are picked up and a lot of anger and recrimination is going to start coming to the surface among the population so you know as we say in Arabic Al like we have no idea what's going to happen Lena muner we want to thank you for being with us lean's writer and Senior editor of the Arts and literature magazine the maraz and gon Levy award-winning Israeli journalist at harat's author of the new book The Killing of Gaza reports on a catastrophe we thank you so much both for joining us from Montreal and from Tel Aviv" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. LAWRENCE. HAVE A GOOD SHOW. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. AND ONCE AGAIN, DONALD TRUMP BACKED DOWN. IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE TO FAITHFUL. VIEWERS OF. &gt;&gt; THIS PROGRAM. &gt;&gt; THAT THE MOST COWARDLY PRESIDENT IN. &gt;&gt; AMERICAN HISTORY BACKED DOWN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; THE STUPIDEST. &gt;&gt; PRESIDENT IN. &gt;&gt; AMERICAN HISTORY. &gt;&gt; BACKED DOWN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; THE ONLY CONVICTED. FELON TO. SERVE AS PRESIDENT OF. &gt;&gt; THE UNITED. &gt;&gt; STATES BACKED. &gt;&gt; DOWN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT WHO GOT CAUGHT. &gt;&gt; PUBLICLY LYING. &gt;&gt; OVER 35,000. TIMES IN. &gt;&gt; HIS FIRST TERM. BACKED DOWN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; AND IN BACKING DOWN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; ONCE AGAIN BECAME A LOSER, IN THIS CASE A LOSER IN A. CONTEST THAT HE STARTED A CONTEST THAT DIDN'T. &gt;&gt; HAVE TO HAPPEN WERE IT. &gt;&gt; NOT FOR THE RANK. &gt;&gt; IGNORANCE OF DONALD TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP. HAS ALREADY LOST HIS TRADE WAR. &gt;&gt; AND HE IS RELENTLESSLY STUPID ENOUGH TO CONTINUE. &gt;&gt; TO DRAW LINES. &gt;&gt; IN THE SAND OF HIS TRADE WAR. &gt;&gt; THAT GET. &gt;&gt; BLOWN AWAY BY HIS OWN FOUL. &gt;&gt; INTEMPERATE BREATH. &gt;&gt; AND IN DONALD. &gt;&gt; TRUMP'S WAR. &gt;&gt; AGAINST THE GREATEST UNIVERSITY IN THE. &gt;&gt; WORLD, DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO LOSE. &gt;&gt; THE HISTORY. &gt;&gt; OF DONALD TRUMP'S WAR. &gt;&gt; AGAINST HARVARD WILL NOT. &gt;&gt; BE WRITTEN DURING DONALD TRUMP'S. &gt;&gt; PRESIDENCY. AND IN HARVARD'S HISTORY, DONALD TRUMP'S WAR IS A SPECK. &gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP'S. &gt;&gt; LAST YEAR IN. THE PRESIDENCY WILL BE HARVARD'S. &gt;&gt; 393RD YEAR. &gt;&gt; DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENCY. &gt;&gt; WILL BE THE. &gt;&gt; EQUIVALENT OF ROUGHLY 1% OF THE YEARS. &gt;&gt; HARVARD UNIVERSITY. &gt;&gt; HAS ALREADY. BEEN WITH US AS AMERICA'S OLDEST UNIVERSITY. &gt;&gt; FOUNDED IN. &gt;&gt; 1636, LONG BEFORE ANYONE EVER. &gt;&gt; DREAMED OF A. &gt;&gt; COUNTRY CALLED. &gt;&gt; THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. LONG AFTER. DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; IS GONE. &gt;&gt; THE WORLD CLASS HISTORIANS AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY AND ELSEWHERE. WILL BE DEFINING. DONALD TRUMP'S. PRESIDENCY AS THE MOST CORRUPT AMERICAN PRESIDENCY. &gt;&gt; IN HISTORY. &gt;&gt; THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY WILL BE RECORDED IN HISTORY AS A FAILURE, BECAUSE NOTHING DONALD TRUMP DOES IN THE PRESIDENCY WILL LIVE AFTER HIM. THE POLICIES ARE ALL REVERSIBLE. &gt;&gt; AND WILL BE. &gt;&gt; REVERSED. &gt;&gt; AND MANY OF. &gt;&gt; THEM WILL BE REVERSED IN THE COURTS DURING. THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. AND THEN THERE. &gt;&gt; ARE THE TRUMP POLICIES. &gt;&gt; THAT ARE REVERSED. &gt;&gt; BY DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; FLIP FLOP USED TO BE THE WORST THING A POLITICIAN COULD. BE ASSOCIATED WITH IN. &gt;&gt; A HEADLINE. &gt;&gt; OTHER THAN A SEX. &gt;&gt; SCANDAL OR BRIBERY. &gt;&gt; THEN CAME. DONALD TRUMP, WHO FLIP FLOPS. MORE THAN ANY. &gt;&gt; POLITICIAN IN AMERICAN. &gt;&gt; HISTORY. NO AMERICAN POLITICIAN HAS EVER REVERSED HIMSELF MORE FREQUENTLY THAN. DONALD TRUMP. OR MORE QUICKLY THAN DONALD TRUMP, OR MORE FULLY PREDICTABLY, THAN DONALD TRUMP. THE WEAK WILLED. DONALD TRUMP, THE FOOLISH. DONALD TRUMP AND DONALD TRUMP'S. &gt;&gt; PREDICTABLE REVERSING. &gt;&gt; OF HIMSELF HAS NOW CREATED A NEW PHRASE WITH. &gt;&gt; THE. &gt;&gt; ACRONYM TACO, AS IN, TRUMP ALWAYS CHICKENS OUT. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT THE. &gt;&gt; USUALLY CONSERVATIVE BRITISH NEWSPAPER THE FINANCIAL TIMES NOW SAYS. &gt;&gt; ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; TRUMP ALWAYS CHICKENS OUT. THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTS THAT THE PHRASE IS NOW SWEEPING THROUGH WALL STREET. TRUMP ALWAYS CHICKENS OUT, QUOTE, HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY SOME TO DESCRIBE THE PATTERN IN WHICH MARKETS TUMBLE AFTER MR. TRUMP MAKES TARIFF THREATS, ONLY TO REBOUND JUST AS SHARPLY. &gt;&gt; WHEN HE. &gt;&gt; RELENTS AND GIVES COUNTRIES MORE TIME. &gt;&gt; TO NEGOTIATE DEALS. THE MARKET DROPPED ON FRIDAY WHEN MR. TRUMP THREATENED TO RATCHET UP TARIFFS TO 50% ON GOODS FROM THE. &gt;&gt; EUROPEAN UNION. &gt;&gt; A MOVE THAT COULD HAVE DONE SEVERE ECONOMIC DAMAGE. &gt;&gt; TO. &gt;&gt; EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES. BUT AT THE TIME, SOME ANALYSTS LIKE SALOMON FIEDLER OF BERENBERG, A GERMAN BANK, SAID IT WOULDN'T LAST. WHILE THREATS BY TRUMP ARE NOT UNUSUAL, HE WROTE IN A NOTE. THAT DAY. GIVEN THE DAMAGE THE US WOULD DO TO ITSELF WITH THIS TARIFF, HE WILL PROBABLY NOT FOLLOW THROUGH. THESE RETREATS ARE SO FREQUENT THAT INVESTORS SHOULD RATIONALLY EXPECT THEM. PAUL DONOVAN OF UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT WROTE, ECHOING ME, BY THE WAY, AS STOCKS IN EUROPE JUMPED MONDAY MORNING, AND AS US MARKETS, WHICH WERE CLOSED ON MONDAY FOR MEMORIAL DAY, JOINED THE RALLY ON TUESDAY. CHRIS BEAUCHAMP OF IG GROUP SUMMED IT UP WITH TACO TRADE TRIUMPHS ONCE AGAIN. SO I GUESS ONE PLACE I COULD BE MAKING MORE MONEY IS AS A UBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT ANALYST, BECAUSE LONG BEFORE. &gt;&gt; PAUL DONOVAN. &gt;&gt; OF UBS WROTE, THESE RETREATS ARE SO FREQUENT, INVESTORS SHOULD RATIONALLY EXPECT THEM. I SAID EXACTLY THAT, ESSENTIALLY THAT ON THIS PROGRAM WEEKS AGO, I TOLD WALL STREET, WE'RE OBVIOUSLY NO ONE WAS LISTENING. &gt;&gt; THAT DONALD. &gt;&gt; TRUMP WILL NOT CARRY OUT ANY OF HIS TARIFF THREATS FROM THAT POINT FORWARD. AND THERE IS NO REASON TO SELL ANY STOCK WHEN DONALD TRUMP THREATENS A TARIFF, AS HE DID LAST WEEK, THREATENING A NEW 50% TARIFF ON EVERYTHING FROM EUROPE, A TARIFF THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY ILLEGAL AND RULED ILLEGAL IN FEDERAL COURTS. BUT THE STOCK MARKET PANICKED AGAIN ABOUT THAT 50% TARIFF ON YOUR ON EUROPEAN GOODS. AND THEN DONALD TRUMP COMPLETELY FLIP FLOPPED OVER THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND WEEKEND, SEEING WHERE THE. &gt;&gt; WORLD. &gt;&gt; MARKETS WERE GOING OVER THIS, HE REVERSED HIMSELF SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE ANOTHER STOCK MARKET CRASH ON HIS HANDS THAT HE WOULD BE BLAMED FOR. AND OF COURSE, THE STOCK MARKET CAME BACK UP. DONALD TRUMP IS TOO STUPID TO STOP THREATENING NEW TARIFFS, AND HE IS TOO COWARDLY TO ACTUALLY CARRY OUT THOSE THREATENED TARIFFS AGAINST A WALL STREET REACTION THAT WOULD INVOLVE A CRASHING STOCK MARKET. AND SO THE AMERICAN STOCK MARKET SHOULD NOW BUILD ALL OF THAT INTO ITS REACTION TO TRUMP TARIFF THREATS. THE EUROPEAN UNION KNOWS THAT TARIFF THREATS ARE NONSENSICAL, AND THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE GIVEN DONALD TRUMP EXACTLY NOTHING IN NEGOTIATIONS. AND AFTER GIVING DONALD TRUMP EXACTLY NOTHING IN NEGOTIATIONS, DONALD TRUMP IMMEDIATELY ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS DELAYING HIS 50% TARIFFS ON ALL GOODS COMING FROM EUROPE UNTIL JULY 9TH. THAT'S THE NEW LIE, JULY 9TH. AND I CAN PROMISE THE STOCK MARKET RIGHT NOW THAT ON JULY 9TH NOTHING WILL HAPPEN. DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT IMPOSE A 50% TARIFF ON ALL GOODS COMING FROM EUROPE ON JULY 9TH OR EVER. AND INSTEAD OF LETTING THE ISSUE FADE AWAY AND PRETENDING THAT HE'S ACTUALLY ACHIEVED SOMETHING WITH HIS TRADE WAR, DONALD TRUMP WILL FOOLISHLY REMAIN. IN THE THREAT AND RETREAT CYCLE FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG. JULY 9TH IS 482 DAYS BEFORE THE NEXT CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION. HOUSE REPUBLICANS AND SENATE REPUBLICANS WILL CONTINUE TO BE SICKENED EVERY TIME DONALD TRUMP THREATENS A NEW TARIFF. AS THE ELECTION APPROACHES AND THE STOCK MARKET CRASHES ONCE AGAIN. AND YOU SHOULD EXPECT THAT EVEN DONALD TRUMP WILL UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAS TO SHUT UP ABOUT CRAZY TARIFFS A YEAR FROM NOW, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER BEFORE THE NEXT CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION. AND SO EVENTUALLY, DONALD TRUMP WILL SHUT UP ABOUT HIS CRAZY AND ILLEGAL TARIFFS AND JUST PRETEND THAT HE'S ACHIEVED SOMETHING WITH HIS FAILED TRADE WAR. AND EVERY ONE OF DONALD TRUMP'S FAKE TARIFF THREATS FROM NOW THROUGH JULY 9TH AND BEYOND SHOULD BE TAKEN FOR WHAT IT IS POLITICALLY A GIFT TO THE DEMOCRATS RUNNING AGAINST THE TARIFF, SUPPORTING HOUSE AND SENATE REPUBLICANS AND THE TRUMP TARIFF CLOWNS WHO WORK FOR DONALD TRUMP WILL CONTINUE TO GIVE THE DEMOCRATS THE GIFT OF TALKING ABOUT SKYROCKETING PRICES. THAT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY INTOLERABLE. AS IF THEY'RE A JOKE TODAY, THE MOST PUBLICLY IDIOTIC ECONOMIC ADVISOR TO A PRESIDENT IN HISTORY WENT ON CNBC, WHERE HE ADMITTED THAT DONALD TRUMP COULD PUSH THE PRICE OF AN IPHONE UP TO $3,500. AND NO ONE SHOULD DARE COMPLAIN ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY IS. &gt;&gt; TRYING TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE IT'S A CATASTROPHE IF THERE'S A TINY LITTLE TARIFF ON THEM RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; A TINY LITTLE TARIFF, THAT DISGRACED BUFFOON WHO HAS NEVER MADE IT ABOVE THE RANK OF ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS AND HAS NEVER HAD TENURE IN AN ECONOMICS FACULTY, THINKS THAT TRIPLE THE COST OF AN IPHONE THAT IS JUST A TINY LITTLE TARIFF. OF COURSE, HE DOESN'T ACTUALLY THINK THAT, BUT HE'S WILLING TO SMILE HIS WAY THROUGH ANY LIE THAT HE NEEDS TO TELL ON ANY DAY ON TV ABOUT THE TRUMP ILLEGAL AND CRAZY TARIFFS. AND WHILE HE'S TELLING THOSE LIES AND SMILING ABOUT THEM, HE EVEN AS AN ECONOMIC ADVISER TO DONALD TRUMP, DOESN'T HAVE THE SLIGHTEST IDEA WHEN DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO FLIP FLOP NEXT ON HIS OWN TARIFFS. HE COULD BE ON TV DEFENDING A TARIFF THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS REVOKED WHILE HE'S SPEAKING, AND HE'LL KEEP SMILING BECAUSE THAT'S HIS JOB. THE CLOWNISH SMILE ON TV LYING ABOUT THE TRUMP TARIFFS ON FRIDAY. JUST FOR THE HECK OF IT. DONALD TRUMP, IN A CHILDISH TWEET, THREATENED TO RAISE THE PRICE OF $1,000 IPHONE BY $250, SAYING WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST GRIP ON REALITY, I EXPECT THEIR IPHONES THAT WILL BE SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL BE MANUFACTURED AND BUILT IN THE UNITED STATES, NOT INDIA OR ANY PLACE ELSE. IF THAT IS NOT THE CASE, A TARIFF OF AT LEAST 25% MUST BE PAID BY APPLE TO THE UNITED STATES. OKAY, THAT IS NOT THE CASE. NONE OF THE IPHONES ARE MADE IN THE UNITED STATES NOW, SO THAT TARIFF SHOULD BE APPLIED RIGHT NOW. AND OF COURSE, NONE OF THEM HAVE A 25% TARIFF. NO IPHONE HAS A 25% TARIFF ON IT NOW, AND NONE OF THEM ARE SCHEDULED TO BE MADE IN THE UNITED STATES. AND SO THAT IS A FAKE THREAT. AND SOME IN THE STOCK MARKET ACTUALLY FELL FOR IT. APPLE STOCK DROPPED 3% THAT DAY, BUT ONLY 3%. SO THAT TELLS YOU THAT ALMOST EVERYONE ON WALL STREET KNEW THAT THAT IS A CHILDISH, LYING THREAT BY DONALD TRUMP. WE'RE NOW THREE MONTHS AWAY FROM THE TRADITIONAL SEPTEMBER INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW IPHONES, WHICH IS ALSO THE TRADITIONAL BEGINNING OF THE CHRISTMAS SHOPPING SEASON IN AMERICA, AND EVEN A POLITICIAN AS STUPID AS DONALD TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO RAISE THE PRICE OF IPHONES 25% GOING INTO THE CHRISTMAS SHOPPING SEASON. $250 PRICE INCREASE ON IPHONES BY DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO CONTINUE ISSUING THOSE KINDS OF THREATS BECAUSE HE'S TRYING TO PRETEND THAT HE HASN'T ALREADY LOST HIS TRADE WAR. THE CASUALTIES IN DONALD TRUMP'S TRADE WAR SO FAR ARE ALL IN THE UNITED STATES. DONALD TRUMP'S FOOLISHLY HIGH ILLEGAL 30% TARIFF THAT IS BEING STILL BEING IMPOSED ON ALL GOODS FROM CHINA. AFTER DONALD TRUMP REDUCED THAT TARIFF FROM THE UTTERLY INSANE AND OBVIOUSLY INSANE LEVEL OF 145%, THOSE TARIFFS ARE STILL AT 30%, DOING DAMAGE TO AMERICAN BUSINESSES AND COULD KILL SOME BUSINESSES AND WILL DEFINITELY KILL AMERICAN JOBS. AND AFTER AMERICANS LOSE THOSE JOBS, DONALD TRUMP AND REPUBLICANS ARE MAKING SURE THAT AFTER THEY'VE BEEN FORCED INTO UNEMPLOYMENT BY DONALD TRUMP'S TARIFFS, THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET HEALTH CARE IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ENROLL IN MEDICAID AND RECEIVE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. THAT IS THE TWO PRONGED ATTACK ON AMERICAN WORKERS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY IN THIS COUNTRY. THE ALREADY JOB KILLING TRUMP TARIFFS AND THE HEALTH CARE STEALING TRUMP REPUBLICAN BUDGET BILL THAT PASSED THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT PASS THE REPUBLICAN SENATE. THE NEW YORK TIMES IS REPORTING ON A VERMONT SMALL BUSINESS CALLED BV0, OWNED BY KARINA HAMEL AND ROBBY RINGER THAT SELLS PERSONAL WATER CONTAINERS PEOPLE USE FOR DRINKING CONTAINERS. THE TIMES REPORTS THE DUTIES, WHICH IS TO SAY TARIFFS ON BOTH BOTTLES ARE HIGHER THAN 30% BECAUSE OF THE MATERIAL THEY'RE MADE FROM AND HOW THEY ARE CLASSIFIED BY TRADE OFFICIALS. VIVO BOTTLES THAT ARE NOT INSULATED ARE SUBJECT TO TARIFFS THAT ADD UP TO 47%, AND THE RATE FOR INSULATED BOTTLES IS 37%. MR. TRUMP HAS FREQUENTLY SAID FOREIGN BUSINESSES THAT SHIP PRODUCTS TO THE UNITED STATES PAY THE TARIFFS, BUT IN REALITY, IMPORTERS LIKE VIVO PAY THE DUTIES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WHEN THE GOODS ARRIVE AT A US PORT. IT'S STILL A MASSIVE IMPACT TO THE CASH, AND IT'S STILL REQUIRES REWORKING A WHOLE NEW STRATEGY, MR. RINGER SAID. WHEN HE WAS IN CHINA, MR. RINGER ASKED TO SEE BOSE PRODUCTS IN THE WAREHOUSE, WHICH IS SOMETHING HE HAS DONE BEFORE TO CHECK MANUFACTURING QUALITY. BUT THIS TIME HE HAD TO CLAMBER OVER PALLETS IN THE AISLES TO SEE THE BOTTLES. THE WAREHOUSE WAS CRAMMED FULL OF GOODS THAT CUSTOMERS HAD DELAYED SHIPPING TO AVOID PAYING. THE 145% TARIFFS ON MAY 12TH, WHEN MR. TRUMP REDUCED TARIFFS ON CHINA FOR 90 DAYS, AND SAMUEL AND MR. RINGER CONCLUDED THEY COULD NOW AFFORD TO PAY THE TARIFFS ON A SMALL SHIPMENT. 7624 OF THE 30,000 BOTTLES THEY HAD PROMISED TO BUY. THEY WILL PAY $24,436 IN DUTIES ON THE SHIPMENT, COMPARED WITH AN ESTIMATED 3645 AT THE RATES THAT EXISTED BEFORE MR. TRUMP TOOK OFFICE. SO THAT'S WHO PAYS THE TARIFFS. KARINA HAMEL AND ROBBY RINGER IN VERMONT, PAYING $24,436 IN TRUMP TARIFFS TO THE TREASURY OF THE UNITED STATES. JUST LIKE TAXES, JUST LIKE A SALES TAX. THAT IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP'S SMILING ECONOMIST CALLS A TINY LITTLE TARIFF. THAT'S A TINY, LITTLE TARIFF THAT COULD KILL BUSINESSES, SMALL AND LARGE ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES. DONALD TRUMP IS A LOSER WHO IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO LOSE, AND HE IS" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="let's fast forward back into well not the present where Sykes and Pico are are drawing with their crayon on a handkerchief so tell us tell us more specifics about about the the borders they decided to to create and why they why they did it in that way okay so there there's a couple of things going on one of them is oil they know there's oil there you got to remember that the British Empire is a naval imp everything is based on ships so if you're going to have oil powerered ships and you don't have access to oil your Empire is finished so they're freaking out when Royal Dutch buys shell there was really only one other major oil corporation on the planet at the time and it was Standard Oil and that was that of course belonged to the United States and so there basically there were these two big oil companies and the British didn't own either one of them now having said that the British had a great relationship with the Netherlands and and the British had a great relationship with the United States so it wasn't like they were owned by two rival States it wasn't like it was France and Germany that owned the oil companies it just that the British were concerned what if something down the road changes or shifts you know there's a bad election in United States or the Dutch decide they're more German and they want to go that direction and so the British decide they have to have their own oil resource so the way they the you know the way you look for oil back then was you walked staring at the ground and you were hoping to find like black Shale or black sandstone a porous rock that that you know like a sponge because if it's sitting on top of an oil field it'll literally suck the oil into it and turn black or because there was so much oil on the planet at time you could literally step in a puddle of oil and then that would be a big indication that there was oil um when the United States found oil in in Pennsylvania they found it at a place called oil Creek in other words there was a really big hint there was probably oil there and the reason the creek got named oil is the creek was cutting through the oil field and then oil floats so there was this Sheen oil on top of the creek and they like ah I bet there's oil here let's dig so you right that was how you found oil you just mostly you kept your eyes open but the problem is the planet is huge and so even though the British Empire own a giant chunk of the planet the idea of sending out armies of people to look at their feet and comb the whole planet to look for oil seemed daunting so the British decided to do something really extraordinary read history books and look for conversations about oil in the history books and they they found those conversations about oil in the Middle East um a thousand years ago the cities in the Middle East lit up their streets at night using oil using petroleum um the the the Roman Empire had in the seventh century and then again in the eth century were using flamethrowers using petroleum to fight the Arabs um at one point Arab armies carried around glass balls with a wick in it and inside it was oil and they would light them and throw them like little naal hang grenades uh Na that was the the name of the soldiers so uh the British knew there was oil they just didn't know where and so they moved in grabbed Kuwait by this point the British already had a presence in the Persian Gulf the Arabian Gulf um and that was in the United Arab Emirates they created the tral coast um they had already established a relationship with Oman so grabbing was just taking a chunk of land away from the the Ottoman Empire and and and basically creating a base with the idea of looking for oil in southern Iraq or in Iran they made a deal with the Persian government and the deal was amazing they got 86% concession so normally when you make a deal like that you get a 50/50 right you're the British company you're doing the work but it's you know it's the Iranian oil so they should get their share 5050 is pretty normal but the G the rulers of Iran were really how should we say into opium eager to get that British opium more than they were eager to advance their country and so the British got this really amazing concession from them and uh that began to shape the way they thought about oil I'm sorry thought about the Middle East having said that they found oil I'm pretty sure the Anglo Persian oil company found oil in like 1908 we should double check my date um so the short after they get the concession they find it shortly after they find it in Iran the Ottoman Empire finds it in what is today Northern Iraq and the British are eager to get a deal with the Ottoman Empire for that oil but the Ottomans decide that Germany is their future and so the the Turks make a deal with the Germans and of course in that moment the British are thinking okay the Ottoman Empire is you know we have to destroy it Germany can't have this oil Germany can't uh have this kind of access to oil and the reason is quite simply that they were worried that the German Navy was going to eventually eclipse the British Navy and the British and the Germans were in a an arms race every time the Germans built a ship the British would build two ships and that would force the Germans to build another ship to try to cancel the two ships the British just built which would then force the British to build two new ships and they were bankrupting each other at the at the rate that they were building ships it was inevitable that both economies were going to collapse and that's one of the reasons why World War I had to happen the they had to they had to just resolve the arms race one way or another somebody just simply had to to come out on top and of course the British come out on top the there is nothing wrong or evil about what the Germans did any more than what the British or the French did in World War I they're not the bad guys they were all bad right it was just a bunch of evil States attacking each other it's not like World War II where it's easy to sort of lay blame on the Germans in any case Sykes and Pico get together because they want to talk about what the future is and that future will not include an Automan Empire the British and the French had decided that they were simply going to take out the Ottoman Empire it didn't hurt any that uh there's an Arab Uprising and the Arabs are actually in the act of defeating the Ottomans because they're trying to break away and create their own independent state um and so the British and the French well the British really not the French assist the Arab uprising but not because they cared about Arab aspirations but because an enemy of an enemy is a friend um and then their their first goal of course was to undermine that Arab State and they did they successfully undermined it that Arab state did exist briefly its capital was Damascus um it had a flag shockingly similar to the Jordanian and Palestinian flag uh the stripes were weren't the exact order right it wasn't uh black white uh green it was if I remember green black green white but almost the exact same flag um and there that's where the jordanians and the Palestinians got their flag it was inspired by that Arab that first attempt at creating an United Arab state from from Syria in any case Sy and Pico before that Arab State existed before World War I is resolved are sitting down and talking about how they're going to carve up the Middle East when they made the plan there was still a Russian Empire so GRE the Italian Empire the Russian Empire the British Empire and the French Empire were going to be the participants in this giant carve up event so one one piece that needed to be carved up was the Ottoman Empire they were going to leave a piece behind that was going to become turkey but they were going to give a big piece to Italy in the South so antalia area that was going to go to Italy in the West ismir Was going to go to Greece so the Greeks were going to have the western shore of what is today turkey um and then the French were going to end up with Syria Lebanon and what is today Iraq the English were only going to take what is today Palestine Israel and Jordan um and the reason why the British were okay with that is then the French would get the oil that was in Iraq because the British were planning to get the oil that was in Iran the Russian Empire was going to invade Iran take the northern half of Iran and the British Empire was going to invade and take the southern half and that would get them access to oil that they could feel secure with the Russians though during World War I decide they're going to go communist have the Bolshevik Revolution and declare that they're no longer they no longer have imperialist aspirations and that they won't work with capitalists anymore and the British Empire realizes if there's no Russia to invade Iran from the north there's no way the British can manage Iran by themselves they need to divide and conquer they can't do it just conquering so the British ta have the French and take Iraq and they they're like you know we're sorry but we need to secure our oil fields you guys just have to figure it out on your own why do the French just agree to that the the French were in such awful shape at the end of World War I um the British Empire was the hegemonic superpower France was in Number the number two slot I think that at that point the French were just grateful that the British were willing to even cut them in because the French had nothing to do with the destruction of the Ottoman Empire it was the uh the the Arab uprising the British did do the invasion at galipoli but that also didn't right the the Turks won at galipoli it's okay though because the British were using Australians and nobody loves Australians so you know they're they're it's amazing that the British I like that but they are it's it's really amazing in any case uh the I think the French were just happy to have anything at that point they were grateful also they they will figure out eventually it's too late for them but but there is oil in Northern Syria it was nothing like what was in Iraq so they were probably hoping that they'd find something okay and what happens with Egypt and and Saudi Arabia okay so um Egypt had a different trajectory in 1798 Napoleon bonapart invades Egypt and after securing Egypt he actually invaded Palestine and his goal was to uh move the Jewish population out of France to Palestine he wanted to to uh ethnically cleanse the Jewish population from Europe and you know people see it as oh he loved the Jewish people well if you Lov them so much why didn't he want them to stay in France he clearly didn't love them as much as I think some people think um and any case Napoleon is defeated the British sink his Navy uh they catch his Navy in a in a bay and sink it and it's a disaster and the French have to escape Egypt and you know Napoleon was thinking he was going to basically to China he was going to he was going to start this new massive Empire with Egypt as his base of operations and the British ruin it for him so he decides you know okay I'll just conquer Europe so he Retreats back to France what what that did though was it inspired somebody so there was an Albanian General who was part of the Ottoman Army his name was mhmed Ali or Muhammad Ali depending on whether you're an Arab or a Turk he was an Albanian so I I guess we should ask the Albanian is what they say um he goes wow what Napoleon did was actually really cool I bet I could do something like that myself he takes his ottoman Army that he's in command of that he invades creit takes it over and then waits for the ottoman arire to respond it doesn't and then he's like well let's go and he invades Egypt conquers Egypt and then he takes his army into Palestine goes up through Syria and he actually invades what is today turkey before the the Ottoman Empire goes whoa what are you doing please stop right he's just an ottoman General who goes Rogue he didn't speak any Arabic um he knew Turkish and Albanian his soldiers mostly speak Turkish and Albanian you know like this is this is such an odd thing to be doing but this is what he does he's he's a Visionary and he thinks in Grand terms he negotiates out a deal with the Ottoman Empire where he'll give back a bunch of Syria and turkey in exchange he'll become basically the governor of an autonomous Egypt and he starts a whole dynasty of kings of Egypt that are they didn't take the title initially but you know it's effectively what they became um who are going to be the governors of a semi-autonomous Egypt and to to mix the two histories the SS the Saud the Saudi family had actually created a state so if you look it up it's the first Saudi state in the 1700s that Saudi State lasted something like 80 years years what happened was their Capital was DEA which is right next to Riad um in 1818 the Ottoman Empire was really upset with this first Saudi State because it it had become quite large it conquered what is today the UAE it had Bahrain uh it had essentially all of what is today Saudi Arabia and that was at the expense to some degree of the Ottoman Empire not all of that land was Ottoman territory but a bunch of it was and so the Ottoman Empire asked mhmed Ali basically for uh a favor and they said you know uh technically you're part of the Empire can you go put down this the Saudi State and he does he takes an army into Saudi this the first Saudi State he goes to daa he destroys Dura and the first Saudi state is is terminated it doesn't stick I I think it was six years later 1824 that's the year in my head um a Saudi state is formed that second Saudi state will eventually also fail and then a third Saudi state is formed out of nudged its idea is it wants to recreate the first Saudi State this big almost the entire Arabian Peninsula size State um but when we were talking earlier I was telling you about the fact that uh there was this attempt to create this Arab state in Syria when that Arab state was being created it was created by hais so West people who were living in Western Saudi Arabia it was a hashimite kingdom um the British go to the souths and they say we're going to undermine and destroy this hashimite state but it would be helpful if you did as well now they the SS don't react to that they're they're not directly uh responsive to the British but eventually they do and they'll go and they'll conquer hez they'll put it together and they create the third Saudi State as a result the British and the Saudi royal family had a cordial relationship they the British saw the SS as somebody they could work with somebody that maybe that they had enough in common with that they didn't feel like they were a threat in the case of Egypt the British did something really strange so the French built the Suez Canal but when the French built the sus Canal they charged Egypt for it now you go okay well they built it well let me rephrase a French company went to Egypt and then hired Egyptian laborers at way under labor value prices and then had them almost as slaves dig the sus canal with high mortality rates and then charge the Egyptian government for them and you know at some level you go really this is just another little imperialist scheme well the to do this the Egyptian state had to borrow money from Banks so that's what they did well in 1882 the British government decided that they were going to use the the debt Egypt owed it as an excuse to invade they invaded and conquered Egypt um there was actually a whole Defense Force set up in Alexandria to try and stop what you a possible European Invasion the Defense Force fails and the British take over Egypt and they make it a protectorate inside the Empire and they eventually Force thewi out of power but then they replace him with a king and so Egypt becomes an in independent Kingdom from the Ottoman Empire at that point" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="[Music] thank you thank you very much thank you um I didn't know I was speaking i you know I'm shy in front of audiences so I apologize i don't like to speak that much but uh first of all thank you for those kind of words i'll have more to say about that in a moment i'm of course also happy that my wife Janette is here this lifetime achievement award or lifetime leadership award is a little scary because it's like that's it you're over it's done usually they give it to you at the end not um but uh because you don't know what I'm going to do the next three years you probably maybe you want the award back in a couple years if things don't work out i hope not i hope not but thank you uh it's an honor to be with you it's also an honor to be And but I'm more importantly I'm glad that the president of the Dominican Republic is here so he can go back and say &quot;Wow they really like Marco Rubio back in the United States.&quot; So at least in this room for for this time but thank you it's an honor to be with you again and um you know I was reflecting just for a moment as before I came here today and this whole uh a couple points it's a tremendous honor to serve as a Secretary of State and when I um when I joined the administration early on they said you know one of the initiatives that we're pursuing is to increase efficiency in government in essence they want to be able to do more while you know spending less or or putting less and for example they said &quot;One of the things we want you to look at is consolidation can you take for example what today are four jobs and just give them all to one person?&quot; And uh and I said &quot;That sounds like a great idea let's we just do that all across the government.&quot; Little did I know they just met me me but uh but it is an honor to be here tonight on behalf of the National Archives uh to speak to all of you and uh and uh it is uh it's actually a really cool job um uh so anyways um I think back uh and though there's still more work to do uh sort of the road that brings me to this point and and even watching that short brief video a moment ago about Lincoln reminded me of things so I maybe I'll just it'll make sense to you at the end i want to share the story with you i always had an interest in politics and global affairs and people say um what is this interest you've always had in foreign policy and in international relations and I'm like uh you've obviously never been to Miami and uh where you know foreign policy is domestic policy on a daily basis but I always had an interest in public so listen I'm not going to lie to you and tell you I had some master plan where I was going to start at the city commission in West Miami and 20 or 30 years later wind up as secretary of state but I always had an interest in it so when I was a a college student as Congresswoman Ross Lane and Zilliano just pointed out a moment ago one of the things I wanted to do is say &quot;Let me get involved in the political process.&quot; So I literally at that time we had these things called hardline telephones that you would pick up and call it wasn't an email system and I called my congresswoman from in fact she had just been elected in a special election the first vote I ever cast was for Ross Leighton it was an election in 1989 so in 1991 I called her office and I said I inquired about there was an internship program and uh and they said well you know come in talk to us i ended up finding out I was it was the be I may have been either your first or your second intern but it was a nent internship program and it was in the local office it was in Blue Lagoon remember your Blue Lagoon office and it was in Blue Lagoon that they burned down apparently didn't it burn because somebody left the coffee maker on well well after I was gone and it had nothing to do with me but uh and uh and I started working there as an intern and it was only for a few months and it was very impactful um the first thing I learned just being there because it's interesting I I guarantee you many of you have done internships or been involved there's like the TV version of public service right and the glamour and then there's the actual nuts and bolts of it and literally the nuts and bolts of the office was people would write letters constituent letters and back then it wasn't like some form letter they they would respond to each one of them individually so part of The intern's job was to go through all these emails and Congresswoman Ross Leightton would read all these letters she would read them all unbel It's a really unbelievable thing to watch i will confess now I never read all the letters i mean I couldn't you know now it's too easy to email so you got a thousand emails to save a bald eagle or 50,000 emails from somebody with a campaign to save a bear or something but back in that time people had to put a stamp and send it to you but nonetheless it was a lot of mail and how what I do recall is that she would come by the office usually on Fridays because of the vote schedules or maybe Mondays and she'd pick up the stack of letters and with notes on them respond this say that and leave behind and then you know leave behind the stack of letters and take new ones and and and let me tell you a couple things that I learned from my time there that really were impactful years later it in many ways is how I modeled or thought about constituent service in my Senate office and uh now again we didn't read 50,000 emails a day or things of that nature but she had such a commitment to constituent service that and I don't say this like in a derogatory way i say this in a very positive way she could have literally voted any way she wanted in Congress because by the time her career in public service was just halfway through in the Congress there was no one she hadn't helped at some point and I'm talking about the things people call about like I have a cruise on Saturday and I forgot to renew my passport sounds like a simple thing unless your cruise is on Saturday and you don't have a passport a lot of immigration things I remember they had they were helping people find employment again this was and I was only there a few months and I learned so much from that experience and it really impacted me when I came back home in the summer of 1990 by the way this is an interesting story my wife at that time was my girlfriend i had just met her so I must June July that year you don't even know this story one of the first you remember this the first one of the first time I asked her she went with me as a volunteer i was a volunteer on a Saturday at a fundraiser i'm just saying that I'm sure the statute of limitations run out and whatever but I wasn't a paid staffer and uh as a volunteer at one of her at one of her um I actually even remember the fundraiser i think it was the second anniversary of your 39th birthday that's what they called it the second anniversary of her 39th birthday or maybe the first anniversary of her 39th birthday and uh and my wife my girlfriend at the time sat in one remember this you had to do the name tags in fact I even remember I think the guest was Oagioo do you remember that fundraiser it was incredible M this was back in 1991 okay so I go back to college i come back in the summer of 1992 and I said you know what would be really cool is to work on a campaign and so I drove to Hyia to this strip mall there's Halia people everywhere they're everywhere huh even in Even at the Waldorf Histori there are people from Hyalia it's unbelievable there was this uh storefront in Hyia and uh I remember the thing I remember about it it was in the It was in the uh shopping area where there was a place called Chos remember Chico and on the other side of Don't tell me there's nobody here that remember that went to Chico right there was All right they're making it up they didn't have the Chico the And on the other side of that on the in the top floor was a campaign for a state senator named Lincoln Diaz Bolard he was running for Congress and I volunteered i walked in i met this young lady Anna Carbonel and I volunteered on that campaign which he ultimately won it was an incredible it was an interesting campaign i remember he had a debate against Javier Sto great man remember this debate and um so this was a great campaign and we got hit by a hurricane that year right or shortly thereafter and it impacted the elections and what have you but nonetheless so I worked this campaign he gets elected to Congress i go back to school i graduate in 1993 and I decide I want to go to law school i'm about to tell you a story which is true this is not I'm not making this up but I mean it sounds like it's fake but it's not fake and if it is you can't prove it's fake anyway but I'm going to tell you because it's true i go to drop off my my admissions like my application personally to the University of Miami and my two letters of recommendation to the law school were Congresswoman Iliano Ross Leighton and now Congressman Lincoln Diaz Ballard so now you're thinking you did have a master plan that's why you went to two places but it really wasn't it was two people I knew i dropped it off and when I get home I get a phone call and I had been admitted to the University of Miami Law School now uh maybe the letters had something to do with it m I hope they did in any event I go to law school and this begins in 1993 and um and and time moves on we interacted many times over those years in different capacities i was just a law student i got elected to the West Miami City Commission and then I get elected to the Florida Legislature where I'm serving for a number of years um two years before I became speaker in 2004 to 2006 um I I got to serve in the Florida legislature and there was a state senator who was serving in the state senate i think it was one of the first people to do this but he decided now that term limits had removed him from the state senate he was going to run for the state house and I thought that's very peculiar like you're a state senator and now you're going to go back over to the state house as it turns out um he was appointed the chairman of the redistricting committee to draw congressional districts and then I figured it out because that's why Mario Dalart came back to the state house uh to to to draw districts and uh but I had a chance we sat next to each other on the floor and and he was a huge influence on me people say what is the most important thing you learned from Mario Diaz Bolard and uh you know the story I'm about to scared so here's the story uh the speaker they always relied on him to carry some of the big bills in addition to his work gerrymandering his district and uh I'm kidding is there media here it was the old district it's not the one now i'm just saying all right and uh and so in in in 200 so they would come with him with all these bills and they you know you carry you remember you carried a bunch of bills civil service reform now I'm and I don't mean this as an insult this is going to be a compliment you have to let me finish the story okay okay you have to let me finish the story but Mario knew nothing about these bills he knew nothing about the details of the actual legislation what he knew remember you and but here's now here's where the compliment is they would uh they would they would you know you stand up on the floor of the legislature they would say representative Diaz you're recognized to present your bill and he would stand up and say this bill is about civil service reform everybody knows what this is it's time to vote and so you know some poor Democrat usually you know opposition party would stand up and say you know the time for questions questions of the sponsor and somebody would stand up and say &quot;I have a question of the sponsor.&quot; And they would ask a question and Mario would say &quot;This bill has been public for weeks this bill has been known to this whole body for weeks i It is an insult that I would be asked questions about this bill [Applause] we need to vote and move on and stop you know standing in the way of the people's business i said &quot;That is a talented guy.&quot; Um and so I've used that ever since and it's worked really well in my career how dare you ask about this treaty it's none of your business vote on the treaty and let's move on so um in any event um but Mario was also a great friend and I I would I would actually say that my chances of running for speaker would have been gravely diminished had it not been for his advice and his counsel and uh and and obviously moving on from there to the time here we we um I never got to serve with Lincoln while he was in the House and I was in the Senate obviously Mario's still here and now we work very closely together because he happens to be the guy who does the appropriations for the foreign relations um and so uh but but we've worked very closely for many years in fact we've worked very closely in the first Trump administration in what ultimately was known as the president's executive order on Cuba which is a pretty dramatic reset uh that uh that I think will be looked back at and uh Ilana was here for some period of time while we were overlapped a little bit but I will say this now I don't have to do these flights anymore but I will say this um she seems to fly here as often now as she did when you were in the in the Congress so uh my only guess is that uh this probably just pays a lot better whichever you're doing now it just just much more uh but she's here all the time but she's an incredible she's a force of nature and the work she does and and and then uh and obviously you know with Lincoln's passing earlier this year it was a beautiful funeral and and you learn things about him that I didn't even know is Daniel here daniel Diaz Balard that told me about You did a great job you really did a great job speaking and talk there were a lot of things about him that I didn't even really know was I knew but I didn't know some of the depths of some of it an incredible statesman and someone we really all kind of looked up to as someone who made a real difference in some of the bills that he passed that we look back at now and not not fully you know it's interesting um again this I don't mean this as an insult to anyone who's involved in politics today i almost wonder if you could achieve today what he achieved during his time in Congress and I'm gonna explain to you why because he was a guy of action i mean he was here because he wanted to make policy and I think today we've entered a political culture where sometimes what's rewarded is the celebrity can you post some provocative thing online can you get a five minute a 5-second clip that gets replayed on social media of you screaming at a witness and he did some of that especially if the but he just worked and passed legislation I mean meaningful legislation so did I these are important things that changed the lives of thousands of people and um you know that's just not rewarded today in politics the way it once was and um and so I I I hope we don't lose that but it's hard to emulate the career he had but here's the point I tried to make in all of this an organization like this that that's interested in in in leadership there is someone probably interning now or camp or volunteering on a campaign now or sitting next to you now or perhaps working alongside you now in some capacity who through your opportunities that you've given them you're opening doors for them that will lead to something in the future maybe in business and maybe in politics I can tell you with certainty that I don't believe that I could have had not just the success but the opportunities I have had it not been for the fact that I had an opportunity to intern or an opportunity to volunteer here on a campaign and by the way the people you meet do you know how many of the people I met working in those offices or working on that campaign or even working in the Florida legislature that to this day I interact with some are still in government or some are not and I do think as much as anything else when you talk about Chile what you're talking about is the empowerment of young people who have a desire to in some way contribute to public service and certainly when you expose people to these things when you expose them to the network of other people that they meet because relationships are everything in life and most certainly in politics when you allow them to expand their horizons so they can see what the opportunities are and maybe even discover new areas of passion or interest that they never knew about these are truly seeds that over time bear fruit and so it's great to stand here as I said it's always flattering to receive an award and be recognized you were speaker you were uh member of the Senate you were the chairman of this you're now secretary of state and the national security adviser and the acting archavist and the AR acting USA ID director so it's always great to uh and the surgeon general no I'm kidding i'm not that nah i wanted it i wanted it you get a uniform do you know you get a uniform if you're a surgeon general i wanted it but uh they had given it away um you know what would be good is Library of Congress that would be a good job acting librarian Mario Diaz Bolard do you want it but uh all kidding aside the um it's you can talk about this path someone took there but I can just tell you these things were all made possible because I Ross Leightton and Lincoln Diaz Bollard and Mario Diaz Bolard indirectly or directly whether they realized at the time or not contributed to it invested created opportunities and allowed someone to explore uh more opportunities down the road and that doesn't escape me and I take great pride even now when I run into someone who interned for me when I started in the Senate or who now is doing great things or someone who was a staff member of mine uh who's now doing great things and usually you know staff members that work for you and they go do better things one of two things you can tell right away their clothes is a lot better because they're no longer work for you and they're making just like five times as much money or they're in charge of something some even maybe got elected to things or what have you i actually take pride in that and I think that's an incredible thing but I I don't think that's the part I don't know if people fully appreciate the doors that were opened for people like me and so many others not because of those that I don't want to say those that came before us but who were in those positions before us and I also want you to understand this about it because I think this is very powerful and true one of the things that allowed me as a young person to believe that it was possible for me to have these aspirations was because there were people sort of kind of came from the same background I did who were already in those positions because that was you know 20 years before that 15 years before that wasn't the case but when you're a 23 24 year old young person growing up in Miami who aspires to one day serve in higher office and you see someone who comes from your community and the same background that you came from who now is in those positions you know what it what it triggers in your brain that that could I could do it too if someone like me could be doing it now I can do that in the future and I think that's a very powerful thing that all of us have an obligation to continue to pass on so I appreciate this award i'm honored by it but I would say the opportunities I've had in leadership as much as anything else have been the result of what others empowered me to do gave me the opportunity to do whether they knew they were doing it at the time or not and one of them was Lincoln Diaz Balard and two of them were Ilana Ross Leightton and Mario Diaz Bolard and I thank you for what you do every single year through this organization to empower more young people so that the next archavist of the United States of America may be sitting in this audience right now thank you and God bless thank [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you we forgot to give him the award [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="2" value="3" />
          <attvalue for="3" value="President Trump contradicted his special envoy's offer to Iran by demanding a complete halt to the country's nuclear enrichment activities as a condition for relaxing severe sanctions. This stance appears to undermine the previously proposed deal concerning Iran's uranium enrichment program. LiveNOW’s Andy Mac is speaking with Jonathan Ruhe, the Director of Foreign Policy at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America. &#10;&#10;Trump's message, which surfaced on multiple social media platforms, appeared to be a direct response to a report by Axios which cited two sources with &quot;direct knowledge&quot; of a secret proposal that Washington provided to Tehran, allegedly said the U.S. would agree to permit &quot;limited low-level uranium enrichment on Iranian soil for a to-be-determined period of time.&quot; &#10;&#10;Iran has repeatedly said it will not agree to a uranium enrichment ban, arguing it has the right to the process, which is also vital for nuclear energy. Although Iran insists its nuclear program is for exclusively peaceful purposes, Iranian officials have more frequently hinted at the possibility of developing a nuclear weapon. &#10;&#10;Subscribe to LiveNOW from FOX! https://www.youtube.com/livenowfox?su...&#10;Where to watch LiveNOW from FOX: https://www.livenowfox.com/&#10;Follow us @LiveNOWFOX on Twitter:   / livenowfox  &#10;&#10;Raw and unfiltered.

          <attvalue for="6" value="All right, Welcome back in here to live now, from Fox. I'm Eddie m a live look there in Washington DC at the White House. Thank you to my colleagues. Stephanie couldn't you for guiding you? The last December last hour? I mean, 80 Mack now. K in the anchor chair. Let's get more in. To what we heard from the White House earlier on today at the Press briefing, as secretary karoline Leavitt talking about the administration president, Donald Trump. reaffirming that the administration's position when it comes to nuclear, negotiations with Iran. saying Turan will not be allowed any enrichment of uranium. let's take you out to this report here on live. Now from Fox from Rebecca caster. Thank you. That's been the position of the Trump Administration on Iran but according to the un's nuclear watchdog, Iran is close to having enough enriched uranium for a enough weapon. increasing its stockpile by 50% over the last 3 months. the way you enrich uranium is called a centrifuge I think of a salad spinner. You spend the salad spinner, a little ways and you get low enriched uranium, that's what you use for civilian reactors. You keep spinning that salad spinner, and you got highly enriched, uranium. And that's what's used in a bomb, the development. adds new pressure to us, negotiators trying to reach a nuclear deal with Iran. publicly us officials and president Trump say any deal would require Iran to stop enriching uranium entirely. this is a country that has orchestrated attempts on President Trump's life. Uh, they cannot have a nuclear weapon and we should we should treat any agreement with Iran. with a great deal of skepticism But according to a report from axios, a new US proposal would allow Toran to continue in. Riching uranium at low levels the administration must clarify. what they might be hiding from the American people. in this Secret. side deal. Iran. Has said it won't sign any deal that does not allow them to continue. uranium enrichment, which they insist make a counter Fox News. All right, thank you so much. and White House, Press Secretary. said, president, Donald Trump was very clear in his message on social media talking about Iran. not allowing them to have any. enrichment. of uranium and if they don't, they will face grave consequences that from 11:00. You can see. This was the post saying, under, our potential agreement, we will Will not allow any enrichment of uranium, Of course, this comes as you heard there from this. scoop by axios cooperated by other outlets, of course. saying that the proposal provided to Durant alleged. The US would agree to permit a limited low-level of uranium enrichment on your Iranian soil to be determined period of time. Let's bring into the conversation right now for more on this. director of foreign policy for Jenza. Jonathan rui. Jonathan thanks so much for joining us here on live. now from Fox Leavitt said, they should agree to this. know uranium or face grave consequences. What could those grave consequences be I think that's a a very good question. given that we are at a watershed moment now where a deal has literally been put on the table. if I'm the Iranians right now. I don't worry particularly about what those grave consequences. may be if I'm the Iranians I think I've got the United States, right where I want them. which is the United States openly negotiating with itself. and with its Israeli partner over. What a deal is going to look like, and right now that's very open-ended Iran would like nothing more than to drag out these talks not be forced to say yes or no to anything. and just see what else it can get by playing for time. Yeah. and of course they said during that press briefing that they didn't want to talk about these negotiations. in public, but all of this reporting coming out from axios and others about this. saying they would potentially allow a low-level. limit on your uranium enrichment. Take me back though because we had a deal in place back in 2015. It was no negotiated by then president Braun. Obama Trump pulled out of that packed. Is this potential deal that others are reporting? Similar to the 1 in 2015, To the extent, we know what might be in it. I worry that the answer is indeed. Yes, Given that the argument right now is over. What? Level of enrichment where under what circumstances? uh, rather than an unequivocal, no enrichment from the United States. If you look back uh, in the years right up to the jcpoa, the deal you mentioned that Obama negotiated. his original red lines, his demands for a deal were very strong. no enrichment. Iran has to come clean on a weaponization No nuclear capable missiles. No underground. facilities Things like that. And we ended up with what is what was fundamentally an unacceptable untenable deal that President Trump. then left? Currently I would caution people against assuming it's a 1 to 1 or Apples to Apples comparison. because through no real fault of President Trump. right now. If Iran would like nothing more than to agree to something like the strafer of the jcpoa at least in the interim because right now its nuclear program is Is far more advanced than the 1 present Obama had to deal with a decade ago. all right? That is a good point. I just wanted to put some historical context to that and of course this is all happening the United States. and Iran, but Israel is also. there waiting potentially to strike some of these nuclear. facilities. Some sites there as well. They're waiting on a determination. and this when Israel, when Netanyahu hears some of these reports coming out about them, allowing some enrichment. although there is a now reaffirmed from president Trump, that they won't allow any enrichment. What is Israel thinking? Right now? so I think right now, they're thinking that the clock is, is taking louder with every passing second. Um, you know, I think these is less, over the specifics of what's being negotiated Right now, although they have made clear that that zero enrichment and zero capacity to resume enrichment. is, is what their red line is. but more importantly, I think for Israel is the, the Prospect and from their perspective, a very discouraging 1 is that Iran will indeed ensh the United States. in long drawn out negotiations, Neither giving a yes, or a no, to any specific proposal. because Iran has learned under both Obama and Biden that as long as the US is at the negotiating table, there is no military option. B. It us or Israeli. So if I'm the Israelis my main concern is not the specific proposals. We've seen traded back and forth As you mentioned, the axios article, but rather the fact that these very likely appear to be open-ended negotiations, Yeah, this is a good point, of course. Yes. or no would go a long way in terms. Of certainty. And I do want to ask you because it feels like we are an absolute stalemate and we heard about those grave consequences but what would it take to get past this stalemate? so, I think to get past this stalemate in a positive sense from American perspective, is to make it run really fear the consequences of doing what it's been doing successfully so far dragging out talks neither saying yes or no. The Iranian regime actually does. respond. very positively from America's perspective. to the threat of military force, when it's faced with it, Unfortunately, that almost never happens. Especially at the negotiating table. So, right now, what you need is the opposite of what we've been seeing which is the United States and Israel. publicly picking fights with 1 another Trump openly telling the Israelis there's no military option for you as long as we're in talks, let me try to get a deal first. so I think right now, you know, it's going to take, you know, in the very little time we have left. It's going to take um, much more clear us-israeli alignment. that there is a clock Trump gave an official 60-day deadline to the supreme Leader. the most charitable interpretation of that deadline is it comes up next week. Iran would like nothing more than to skate past that deadline and keeps talk. Keep talks going. So right now it would take, you know, borderline Herculean efforts the United States of Israel will be clearly on the same page that Iran can either agree to an acceptable deal. Post haste or face consequences where it loses that program through other means, All right. And of course, we continue to wait to continue to be pushed off a little bit and I do want to ask you because it's so very interesting that the report from axio comes out that they potentially would have a low limit of uranium enrichment president Trump responds on social media Saying, we will not allow any enrichment of uranium and we talk about the negotiation back in 2015. We talked about Obama with uh with Biden with Trump now in these negotiations, we've all heard about Iran and their uranium enrichment program and its progress. most recently I want to ask you how is No Deal better than some deal even though it might not be be uh politically uh appealing to Donald Trump. How is No Deal better than some deal? It's a great question, and it's 1. That's always put uh proponents of a strong acceptable deal on the back foot against proponents of a weak deal, like the jcpoa Because as we saw President Obama and his administration say in 2015, when the jcpoa was agreed, it's under this deal or War. We've seen a similar thing uh, from within the Trump Administration as these talks have developed or trained that that any failure of talks, any failure to get a deal. becomes World War III in the Middle East Iran loves that We frame it that way because it helps ensure that we stay at the state of the table. and force, where all military options. So, I think it's the question is, is more accurately framed? not a deal versus no deal? But no deal versus a bad deal because with the jcpoa, the 1 thing, it did was buy, you time to actually figure out how to prevent a nuclear Iran. uh, at the cost of, you know, Iran eventually. got a legitimate and nuclear program they want that again, they want recognition of their right to enrich so that zero enrichment is never a consideration. Ever again, And that they essentially have a latent nuclear weapon. capability. So the question is now is an ounce of prevention worth a pound of cure. Uh and so, you know, the 1 thing that has not been tried is to actually Force the Iranians to say. Here's the cost of of No Deal which is you lose the program. through other means So until you test that proposition I think it's in in some ways. Um a false, you know, false dichotomy the No Deal versus uh any deal at this point because any deal would have eventually be worse in the long run. Yeah, that is a good point. I just wanted to ask that So very interesting, Jonathan Ruby, anything else that you're monitoring in terms of this. What comes next? What we're looking forward to. anything else that you can provide Insight on the 1 thing, I would add is in parallel to everything we've discussed the iaea, the international inspectors tasked, with verifying, that Iran has a peaceful nuclear weapons program or nuclear program as the Iranians claimed. They are set to issue what they call a comprehensive report. that details how Iran has failed. in its obligations as a signatory of the non-proliferation treaty by building a secret secret nuclear weapons program. Advancing that to a point where they could have a bomb in short order and lying about it the entire time. that's coming to a head as well right now. Iran. like they do in the, in the talks with the United States, those talks with the iaea Iran feels like it has the upper hand now because they're threatening our European partners. The ones who can censor Iran for that Iran is threatening we'll leave the npt if you. advance any penalties the Snapback that it's called, Uh, for our frankly blatant violations of our treaty obligations. So I would note that people should keep an eye on that and I would also critique the US position by saying those need to be aligned with our own negotiations of the Iranians right now. Iran is playing the United States and Europe. separately. There's a lot of daylight there just like there is between the United States and Israel. And that right there is the equation, uh, for a bad deal. All right, very good, Jonathan ruy, it feels like we're in Groundhog's Day almost seeing this conversation happen. time and time. Again, of course, karoline Leavitt saying, they need to agree to this deal or potentially face grave consequences. Thank you so much for your time your Insight here on live now. Thank you." />

          <attvalue for="6" value="&gt;&gt; OKAY. RIGHT. WE WILL SEE. THANKS, JEN. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; THANKS, LAWRENCE. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, WELL, DONALD TRUMP SAID TODAY THAT HE WILL ISSUE REFUNDS OF HIS ILLEGAL TARIFFS TO EVERY AMERICAN BUSINESS THAT HAS BEEN FORCED TO PAY THOSE TARIFFS. DONALD TRUMP BEING THE MOST INCOMPETENT PRESIDENT IN HISTORY, AND THE PRESIDENT, WHO KNOWS THE LEAST ABOUT WHAT HIS OWN GOVERNMENT IS DOING, HIS OWN WHITE HOUSE AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT, MEANS THAT IT IS VERY LIKELY TONIGHT THAT DONALD TRUMP IS LEARNING THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME. IT IS VERY LIKELY TONIGHT THAT DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT KNOW UNTIL I JUST SAID IT THAT HE MADE THAT PROMISE. TODAY, DONALD TRUMP'S JUSTICE DEPARTMENT LAWYERS DESPERATELY BEGGING AN APPEALS COURT TO PAUSE THE UNANIMOUS RULING LAST NIGHT BY THE UNITED STATES COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AGAINST THE TRUMP TARIFFS. KNEW THOSE LAWYERS KNEW WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO TELL THE APPEALS COURT TO GET THE APPEALS COURT TO PAUSE LAST NIGHT'S RULING THAT THE TRUMP TARIFFS ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND ILLEGAL. AND SO DONALD TRUMP'S JUSTICE DEPARTMENT LAWYERS PUT IT IN WRITING TODAY THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL ISSUE REFUNDS OF HIS ILLEGAL TARIFFS IF THE FINAL RULING IN THE CASE BY THE APPEALS COURT OR THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AGREES WITH THE REAL JUDICIAL EXPERTS ABOUT INTERNATIONAL TRADE, THAT THE TRUMP TARIFFS ARE ILLEGAL. THE BEST WAY TO HIDE IMPORTANT NEWS LIKE THIS FROM MOST PEOPLE IN THE NEWS MEDIA IS TO PUT IT IN WRITING, IN LEGAL PLEADINGS, THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE IN THE NEWS MEDIA EVER ACTUALLY READ. THERE ARE SOME NEWSPAPER REPORTS ABOUT THE APPEALS COURT DECISION TODAY TO GRANT THE TRUMP JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S REQUEST TO PAUSE THE RULING IN THE CASE, BUT EVEN THOSE REPORTS DON'T FIND THE REASON WHY THE APPEALS COURT DID THAT. THE FEDERAL APPEALS COURT DIDN'T GIVE A REASON WHY THEY DID IT. THE FEDERAL APPEALS COURT UNANIMOUSLY GRANTED A TEMPORARY PAUSE IN LAST NIGHT'S RULING BY THE UNITED STATES COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE, SAYING TODAY, QUOTE, THE REQUEST FOR AN IMMEDIATE ADMINISTRATIVE STAY IS GRANTED. THESE CASES ARE TEMPORARILY STAYED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. WHILE THIS COURT CONSIDERS THE MOTIONS PAPERS, AND THAT'S ALL THE APPEALS COURT SAID, THEY DON'T HAVE TO SAY WHY THEY WERE DOING THAT, AND THEY DID NOT SAY WHY THEY STAYED THE CASE UNTIL AT LEAST JUNE 9TH, WHICH IS NOW THE DEADLINE THEY ISSUED FOR BRIEFS FROM BOTH SIDES TO BE FULLY SUBMITTED TO THE APPEALS COURT. ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS IN ISSUING A STAY DURING AN APPEAL LIKE THIS IS THE STAY WILL NOT HARM THE OTHER SIDE. WHEN YOU'RE ASKING FOR A STAY, YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE COURT THAT THE STAY WON'T HARM THE OTHER SIDE IN THE CASE, AND SO ON. PAGE 25 OF THE TRUMP LAWYERS PLEADING TO THE APPEALS COURT TODAY FOR A STAY IN THE CASE, DONALD TRUMP'S LAWYERS PUT THIS PROMISE FROM DONALD TRUMP IN WRITING TO THE APPEALS COURT, QUOTE, IF TARIFFS IMPOSED ON PLAINTIFFS DURING THESE APPEALS ARE ULTIMATELY HELD UNLAWFUL, THEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL ISSUE REFUNDS TO PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING ANY POST-JUDGMENT INTEREST THAT ACCRUES AND A HUGE AMOUNT OF INTEREST COULD ACCRUE ON THE TARIFFS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN PAID. SO THERE'S DONALD TRUMP'S PROMISE IN WRITING THAT IF AND WHEN HE LOSES THIS CASE IN THE FINAL ADJUDICATION BY THE APPEALS COURT OR BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, ALL OF THE ILLEGALLY COLLECTED TARIFF MONEY BY DONALD TRUMP, ALL OF IT COLLECTED FROM AMERICANS AND AMERICAN BUSINESSES AND ONLY AMERICAN BUSINESSES. ALL OF THE TRUMP TARIFFS WILL BE REFUNDED TO THOSE AMERICANS WHO PAID THOSE ILLEGAL TARIFFS. THE TREASURY OF THE UNITED STATES, WHERE THAT MONEY WAS COLLECTED, KNOWS EXACTLY HOW TO ISSUE REFUNDS. THEY ISSUE REFUNDS TO MANY OF YOU, MILLIONS OF YOU, EVERY YEAR AFTER YOU FILE YOUR TAX RETURNS AND YOU SHOW THAT MORE MONEY HAS BEEN WITHHELD FROM YOUR PAYCHECKS FOR TAXES DURING THE YEAR THAN YOU ACTUALLY OWE, THE TREASURY SENDS OUT MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF SUCH TAX REFUNDS EVERY SINGLE YEAR. TREASURY KNOWS HOW TO DO REFUNDS. AND NOW, WHEN DONALD TRUMP LOSES THIS CASE, THE TREASURY WILL BE BUSY SENDING OUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TRUMP TARIFF REFUNDS. AND WITHOUT DONALD TRUMP'S PROMISE TODAY TO REFUND THAT MONEY, IT IS VERY UNLIKELY THAT THE APPEALS COURT WOULD HAVE GRANTED THE TRUMP SIDE OF THE CASE A PAUSE IN BEING SUBJECT TO THE RULING MADE BY THE FEDERAL JUDGES ON THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF TRADE COURT, WHO KNOW MORE ABOUT INTERNATIONAL TRADE THAN ANY OTHER JUDGES IN OUR FEDERAL SYSTEM. THE VERY FIRST FEDERAL CASE IN A FEDERAL COURT IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WAS AN INTERNATIONAL TRADE CASE. LITIGATION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE BECAME INCREASINGLY MORE COMPLEX OVER THE CENTURIES, AND IN THE 20TH CENTURY, CONGRESS DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO CREATE A UNIQUE FEDERAL COURT WITH EXPERTISE AND JURISDICTION OVER INTERNATIONAL TRADE CASES. IN 1926, CONGRESS CREATED THE UNITED STATES CUSTOMS COURT. IN 1980, WITH THE JET ENGINE HAVING BROUGHT INTERNATIONAL TRADE TO THE THRESHOLD OF TRUE GLOBAL TRADE, THE CONGRESS CLARIFIED AND ENHANCED THE STANDING OF THE CUSTOMS COURT AND CHANGED ITS NAME TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE. DEMOCRATIC SENATOR DENNIS DECONCINI, WHO SPONSORED THE LEGISLATION, SAID THE NEW COURT WOULD BE, QUOTE, A VASTLY IMPROVED FORUM FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES DEALING WITH IMPORTATIONS. THE PROVISIONS MAKE IT CLEAR TO THOSE WHO SUFFER INJURY IN THIS AREA THAT THEY MAY SEEK REDRESS IN A COURT AND, IF THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL, THE COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD THEM. RELIEF WHICH IS APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY TO MAKE THEM WHOLE. AND SO TODAY, DONALD TRUMP, THROUGH HIS LAWYERS, HAD TO PROMISE TO MAKE THEM WHOLE, HAD TO PROMISE TO REFUND ALL OF THE TRUMP TARIFFS PAID SO FAR IF AND WHEN THEY ARE FOUND TO BE ILLEGAL AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN A FINAL COURT RULING. AND SO, AS MANY HUMILIATION DAYS AS DONALD TRUMP HAS HAD SINCE HE STARTED HIS FAILED TRADE WAR REFUND DAY WILL BE THE ULTIMATE HUMILIATION DAY AT THE END OF DONALD TRUMP'S DISASTROUS TRADE WAR. REFUND DAY IS COMING, AND IT WILL BE THE MOST HUMILIATING DAY DONALD TRUMP WILL SUFFER IN HIS LOSING TRADE WAR. TONIGHT. DONALD TRUMP HUMILIATED HIMSELF ONCE AGAIN BY SHOWING HOW IRREVERSIBLY STUPID AND FLAWLESSLY IGNORANT HE IS OF THE ACTUAL WORDS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THEIR MEANING. HE DID THAT IN A SOCIAL MEDIA POST THAT ONCE AGAIN REVEALS THE MOST SEVERE MENTAL WEAKNESS, NOT JUST IN THE HISTORY OF THE PRESIDENCY, BUT IN THE HISTORY OF FEDERAL ELECTED OFFICIALS IN THIS COUNTRY. THE TRUMP SOCIAL MEDIA POST BEGINS BY SAYING THE US COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE INCREDIBLY RULED AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ON DESPERATELY NEEDED TARIFFS. OF COURSE, THE CORRECT WAY OF PUTTING THAT IS THE UNITED STATES COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE PREDICTABLY RULED IN FAVOR OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. DONALD TRUMP GOES ON TO SHOW HIS INABILITY TO PASS A HIGH SCHOOL CIVICS TEST BY SAYING THE HORRIFIC DECISION STATED THAT I WOULD HAVE TO GET THE APPROVAL OF CONGRESS FOR THESE TARIFFS. IN OTHER WORDS, HUNDREDS OF POLITICIANS WOULD SIT AROUND D.C. FOR WEEKS AND EVEN MONTHS TRYING TO COME TO A CONCLUSION AS TO WHAT TO CHANGE, CHARGE OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE TREATING US UNFAIRLY. THAT IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN FOR HOW THIS COUNTRY SETS TARIFFS, OR HOW THIS COUNTRY SETS TAX RATES, TARIFFS, THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF CONGRESS ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION. AND HUNDREDS OF POLITICIANS HAVE BEEN SITTING AROUND D.C. FOR WEEKS AND EVEN MONTHS NOW, TRYING TO COME UP WITH A REPUBLICAN BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES, WHICH THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES MANAGED TO PASS BY EXACTLY ONE VOTE. AND YOU NEVER HEARD DONALD TRUMP COMPLAIN ABOUT THE HUNDREDS OF POLITICIANS BEING INVOLVED IN THAT LEGISLATION, HUNDREDS OF POLITICIANS DECIDING EXACTLY HOW TO CUT MEDICAID, HOW TO TAKE HEALTHCARE COVERAGE AWAY FROM AMERICANS. THAT WAS THE WORK OF HUNDREDS OF REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS SITTING AROUND D.C, AS DONALD TRUMP WOULD PUT IT, FOR WEEKS AND EVEN MONTHS. AND WHILE THEY WERE SITTING AROUND D.C, THOSE HUNDREDS OF REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS DECIDED JUST HOW BIG A TAX CUT TO GIVE TO DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY, AND TO ELON MUSK AND TO THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. DONALD TRUMP DIDN'T DECIDE THAT HE'S JUST GOING TO GET TO SIGN THE LEGISLATION WHEN IT ARRIVES AT THE WHITE HOUSE. AND IN FACT, INTERNATIONAL TRADE DEALS OFTEN TAKE SEVERAL YEARS OF PEOPLE SITTING AROUND D.C. AND SITTING AROUND GENEVA AND OTHER CAPITALS IN THE WORLD NEGOTIATING WITH OTHER COUNTRIES THE SPECIFICS OF TRADE DEALS AND WORKING ON THE DETAILS OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE THAT THEN GETS PRESENTED TO CONGRESS IN A FINAL BILL THAT CONGRESS VOTES ON, THAT SETS ALL OF THE TARIFFS THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS. CONGRESS DOES THAT, NOT THE PRESIDENT. AND THERE IS NOT A SINGLE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT IN AMERICA TAKING AN AP GOVERNMENT COURSE THIS YEAR WHO DOES NOT KNOW THAT. DONALD TRUMP GOES ON TO SAY, IF ALLOWED TO STAND, THIS WOULD COMPLETELY DESTROY PRESIDENTIAL POWER. THE PRESIDENCY WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME. EXCLAMATION POINT. NO, DONALD, NO, NO NO, DONALD. IF THE COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE'S DECISION IS ALLOWED TO STAND, THAT MEANS THE PRESIDENCY WOULD BE THE SAME AS IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PRESIDENCY IN WHICH NO PRESIDENT, OTHER THAN DONALD TRUMP, EVER TRIED TO RANDOMLY SET NEW TARIFFS ALL AROUND THE WORLD, ALL BY HIMSELF. NO PRESIDENT FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON TO BARACK OBAMA AND THEN JOE BIDEN EVER DID THAT. PRESIDENTS ARE EMPOWERED BY LAW TO MAKE VERY MINOR, VERY SPECIFIC, VERY TEMPORARY CHANGES IN TARIFFS FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCTS FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID. HE PUT A 10% TARIFF ON THE ENTIRE PLANET. CONGRESS COULD DO THAT. THEY COULD PASS AN ECONOMICALLY IDIOTIC 10% TARIFF ON THE ENTIRE WORLD. BUT EVEN THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS ISN'T THAT STUPID. THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS IS NOT AS STUPID AS DONALD TRUMP ABOUT TARIFFS. AND SO DONALD TRUMP HAS LAUNCHED INTO HIS TARIFF MADNESS ALONE, THE ONLY PRESIDENT IN HISTORY TO HAVE DONE SO. AND WITH AN EXCLAMATION POINT, THE UTTERLY LOST OCCUPANT OF THE WHITE HOUSE TELLS US THAT THE PRESIDENCY WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME IF WE ACTUALLY RESTORE, THROUGH SANE COURT DECISIONS, PRESIDENTIAL POWER TO WHAT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN. FROM THE DAY GEORGE WASHINGTON TOOK THE OATH OF OFFICE, DONALD TRUMP'S PERMANENTLY SMILING AND TOTALLY INCOMPETENT ECONOMIC ADVISOR, WHO NEVER ACHIEVED TENURE. IN HIS BRIEF CAREER AS A LOW LEVEL ECONOMICS PROFESSOR BEFORE BECOMING DONALD TRUMP'S ECONOMICS PROFESSOR IN RESIDENCE, TOOK HIS FROZEN SMILE TO FRIENDLY TELEVISION INTERVIEWERS TODAY BY SAYING THAT THE RULING BY THE COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE WILL NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT AT ALL ON THE TRUMP TEAM'S SO-CALLED TRADE NEGOTIATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, IN WHICH THEY PROMISE TO DELIVER 90 TRADE DEALS AND 90 DAYS, AND HAVE NOT YET DELIVERED A SINGLE TRADE DEAL, NOT ONE. AND WHILE THE CHILDISH BY STANDARDS OF THE ECONOMIC PROFESSION. KEVIN HASSETT WAS PUBLICLY SPEWING HIS NONSENSE ABOUT A COURT RULING AGAINST THE TRUMP TARIFFS HAVING NO EFFECT ON THE COUNTRIES THAT THE TRUMP TEAM IS TRYING TO NEGOTIATE WITH. OF COURSE, OF COURSE, THE TRUMP TEAM WAS IN COURT PUTTING IN WRITING EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. THE OTHER POINT THAT THE TRUMP LAWYERS HAD TO CONVINCE THE APPEALS COURT OF TODAY IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A STAY WAS THAT IF THEY DIDN'T OBTAIN A STAY, THEIR SIDE OF THE CASE WOULD SUFFER WHAT THE LAW CONSIDERS IRREPARABLE HARM. WHILE INSISTING THAT THE PLAINTIFFS WOULD SUFFER NO HARM BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT WILL SIMPLY REFUND TO THEM THE TRUMP TARIFF MONEY IF THEY WIN. THE TRUMP LAWYERS INSISTED THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS ALREADY SUFFERING HARM TO HIS SO-CALLED TRADE NEGOTIATIONS BY THE RULING OF THE COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE, BECAUSE IT TAKES AWAY WHAT THE TRUMP LAWYERS CALLED THE CREDIBLE THREAT. THAT WAS THEIR THEIR PHRASE, CREDIBLE THREAT OF DONALD TRUMP'S TARIFFS, WHICH MEANS THAT, QUOTE, FOREIGN COUNTERPARTS WILL HAVE REDUCED INCENTIVES TO REACH MEANINGFUL AGREEMENTS. THE SECRETARY OF STATE, SECRETARY OF TREASURY AND US TRADE REPRESENTATIVE SIMILARLY EXPLAINED THAT THE TRADE NEGOTIATIONS CURRENTLY ONGOING WITH DOZENS OF COUNTRIES, ARE IN A DELICATE STATE AND COULD BE SHATTERED BY AN INJUNCTION AGAINST THE TARIFFS. SO THERE WAS THE SMILING CLOWN OF TRUMP ECONOMIC POLICY ON TELEVISION, TELLING YOU THE RULING BY THE COURT HAS NO EFFECT AT ALL ON THEIR NEGOTIATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, WHILE AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME, THE TRUMP JUSTICE DEPARTMENT LAWYERS ARE IN COURT TELLING THE APPEALS COURT THAT THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN SHATTERED BY THE COURT RULING AGAINST THE TRUMP TARIFFS. QUOTE, THOSE NEGOTIATIONS ARE PREMISED ON THE ABILITY OF THE PRESIDENT TO IMPOSE TARIFFS UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY ECONOMIC POWERS ACT. JUST ANOTHER DAY IN TRUMP LAND, THE TRUMP CLOWNS ON TV SAYING ONE THING THE TRUMP LAWYERS FUNCTIONALLY UNDER OATH IN COURT, SAYING EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE, AND THE GOOFY CHAOS AGENT AT THE CENTER OF IT ALL NOT HAVING THE SLIGHTEST IDEA WHAT HE'S DOING OR WHAT THE PEOPLE ON HIS TEAM IN COURT ARE SAYING. DONALD TRUMP IS LOST IN THE WHITE HOUSE TONIGHT. HE IS LOST IN THE MADNESS OF HIS TRADE WAR. HE DOES NOT HAVE AND HAS NEVER HAD THE MENTAL CAPACITY TO COMPREHEND A SINGLE ELEMENT OF WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. DONALD TRUMP MAKES EVERY PRESIDENT WHO PRECEDED HIM LOOK BETTER, INCLUDING THE CRIMINAL RICHARD NIXON, WHO WAS NOT HALF AS CRIMINAL AS DONALD TRUMP, WHO, UNLIKE RICHARD NIXON, HAS ACTUALLY BEEN CONVICTED OF CRIMES AND WAS RICHARD NIXON WAS SUPREMELY COMPETENT COMPARED ONLY TO DONALD TRUMP. RICHARD NIXON'S WORST DAY WAS BETTER THAN DONALD TRUMP'S BEST DAY IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND THAT IS NOT SOMETHING I SAID DURING THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. BUT THE SECOND TRUMP PRESIDENCY HAS TURNED OUT TO BE MUCH, MUCH WORSE THAN HIS FIRST PRESIDENCY. OF COURSE, THE TRUMP TARIFF REFUNDS WON'T MAKE SOMEONE WHOLE IF THEIR COMPANY HAS ALREADY GONE OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE OF THE TRUMP TARIFFS. AND SO, UNTIL THE FINAL ADJUDICATION OF THE TRUMP TARIFF CASE AT THE APPEALS COURT OR THE SUPREME COURT, THE TRUMP TARIFFS WILL CONTINUE TO HARM" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="many say he was a pope like no other Outspoken and forthright Pope Francis took a stand on many critical issues facing our world The head of the Roman Catholic Church called out the Israeli government while appealing for peace in Gaza and criticized right-wing European politicians as he advocated for an open door policy for migrants and refugees So how will he be remembered especially by those in the global south this is Inside Story [Music] Hello and welcome to the program I'm Fib Batibbo Pope Francis was widely regarded as the people's pope The first Latin American to lead the Roman Catholic Church with more than a billion followers worldwide He was often a voice for the poor and faced fierce resistance to reshape the highly traditional and conservative church The pontiff's message about peace poverty and climate change have resonated loudly across Asia Africa and the Middle East But will his legacy translate into lasting change and where does the Catholic Church go from here we'll discuss these questions with our guests in just a moment But first this report from Dimmitri Medvenko on the outpouring of tributes to the late Pope Francis Millions mourning the Pope's death thousands gathered in St Peter's Square just a day after he last appeared here for Easter blessings Visibly frail after weeks in hospital Pope Francis mustered his strength for what turned out to be his final public service Elected in 2013 he set out a new tone for the Vatican A champion of the poor Pope Francis was the first pontiff to travel the world's most vulnerable countries including Myanmar South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo Despite the violence there the Pope called on the waring sides to value human life above all else no to corruption Let's all say no to corruption He navigated the Israeli Palestinian conflict by reaching out to both sides In the beginning of Israel's war on Gaza in 2023 Pope Francis delivered these words perhaps foreshadowing months of continued violence They suffer so much And I heard how both sides are suffering This is what wars do And here we have gone beyond wars This is not war This is terrorism Terrorism Pope Francis was considered a disruptor encouraging debate about topics that were taboo for centuries on LGBTQ inclusion and the role of women in the Vatican He's opened the door to many fundamental reforms to take place in the church I like to think of Francis as the disruptor pope He came here as a real outsider having never studied or worked in Rome And he really shook things up with his approach He changed the whole style of being a pope He changed the priorities of the church in terms of its pastoral practice and its public policy He opened up the church for more conversation and debate and discussion Uh these are all dramatic ways that he changed the church uh from what it was earlier Cardinals who are senior members of the church will now elect a new pontiff One who will either continue Pope Francis's legacy or someone more centrist and conservative Dimmitri Medvenko Alazer for Inside Story Let's bring in our guest now for today's show in Ramla in the occupied West Bank Reverend Munther Isaac a Palestinian pastor in Bethlehem and author of the book Christ in the Rubble: Faith the Bible and the Genocide in Gaza In Juba we have Father James Oed Lantazio a Catholic priest and general secretary of the South Sudan Council of Churches And in Kazison in the Philippines Father Francis Lucas a Catholic priest and executive director of the Catholic Media Network Gentlemen thank you so much for being with us on Inside Story A warm welcome to you all Reverend Isaac in Ramala if I can start with you Pope Francis was the first Western leader to refer to what's going on in Gaza as a genocide How significant is it that his final global message was centered on Gaza and how has his death been received by Palestinians not just in Gaza but in the occupied uh territories and around the world yeah First um this is a sad day for uh many of us for not just the Christian world I would argue for for humanity Uh Pope Francis was uh widely respected and beloved by many in the world Uh particularly in context of of oppression Um and he truly for us and the fact that I here as a Lutheran pastor extend tribute and and love for his legacy says a lot about the kind of ministry uh he has Uh for us as Palestinians uh we truly lost uh a friend uh someone who uh spoke with compassion uh with full humanity about the plight of Palestinians Uh and I would argue that his position on Palestine reflected his overall theology of solidarity with the marginalized and the oppressed Uh and this is the the teachings of of the gospels Um his position in Palestine started long before Gaza uh in 2014 when he visited Bethlehem uh we can never forget the iconic image of him leaving the car uh which was not planned stepping into the wall praying uh a prayer that touched many many millions of hearts A prayer that left uh an impression on us Palestinians that he sees our pain He recognized the cruelty of of the uh situation we live in of of the oppression of the occupation Uh and and we truly uh were touched by that moment Um that iconic image Reverend that iconic image of the pope at the wall How do you think that act in particular shifted the Vatican's diplomatic standing on the Israel Palestine conflict i think it clearly pointed that this pope is going to move beyond the traditional uh diplomatic kind of um attitude of many faith leaders to be honest who uh prefer the comfort of calling for peace from a position of neutrality And certainly the pope recognized all sides and he wouldn't just speak on on the Palestinians he recognized all victims including Israelis But uh his choice of language uh the fact that uh he uh stood by the wall the fact that throughout the war he's used vocabulary like cruelty terror calling for an investigation whether there is a genocide or not clearly showed that this is a pope who's going to move beyond the traditional kind of diplomatic neutral uh line of many faith leaders beh be before him um into the language of justice uh into the language of of accountability Okay And more so also into the language of compassion and humanity because this is precisely behind his uh praying next to the wall Father James in Juba let me come to you Why did Francis's papacy matter for Africa what stand stands out for you today for us in South Sudan uh were in sorrow uh the Catholic war the Christian world even Muslim world in South Sudan because Pope Francis brought to the light the suffering and the marginalized people of South Sudan We had been in at war for years and had not been taken consideration He brought this to light when he invited the political leadership of South Sudan to the Vatican in his residence of Santa Marta for a retreat of two days and during the retreat he kissed the feet of these political leaders begging them just to give the people of South peace That gesture made a Uturn in a lot of hearts Even the political leadership some of them said they were renewed M however his legacy for us in South Sudan was confirmed when he visited us 2 years ago Yeah And we that image I just want to come back to that image Father James if you can because that image in 2019 really stunned the world when the Pope knelt to kiss the feet of South Sudan's rivals urging them to embrace peace But it clearly wasn't enough because here we have the country once again on the brink of war What do you think you know that gesture change ultimately and what is it going to take to ensure that the church um remains a credible voice uh amid the violence and political uncertainty in South Sudan can you imagine even from his hospital bed as we go through some minor crisis these days he wrote a letter to this rival leadership in South Sudan he wrote a letter to president Salvakin he wrote a letter to vice president first vice president Dr Mach calling on them begging them please be leaders who give peace to your people Can you imagine and the kissing of their feet was a gesture just to beg them please give these people South peace So you should not be remembered as leaders of war but leaders who brought peace to the people This has been a turning point Well politics you know in South Sudan is very complex People look at things politically but when such Christian gestures moral gestures are done is very touching to the point today Yes Yeah We we'll continue that uh in a moment I just wanted to bring uh Father Francis into the conversation Father Francis you're in the Philippines Why was Pope Francis so popular in your part of the world what what endeared him to Filipinos in the Philippines our population has a very high Catholic membership and we are the biggest Catholic population in the whole of Asia So we are we called the Christian country in Asia So we love the pope all the popes who come over but Pope Francis he was the last pope to visit our country and he showed us so much love for the population and like when he went to Tacloan a place where it was devastated by typhoons and you know first time in my life I saw a pop wearing uh protection from the rain a rain that is so thin and what he said in the the victims of the disaster was really touching for all of us and many cried because of this So he's so staunch in his in his u purpose because if there was a typhoon and he could have said no more I won't go there because I might get stuck almost he did get stuck because the the his plane was able to escape the the storm and then one of the three planes had to stay because of the strong wind Let me ask you Father Francis about something he said when he was in the Philippines He said he wanted a poor church for the poor What was he saying there directly to the Catholics uh on on the periphery those in the Philippines those in the global south and do you think his legacy uh will continue to inspire you know the transformative action uh in in social justice and environmental issues that he called for when he was in the Philippines yes indeed That's true Because it's always a reminder for us especially the clergy and the leaders of the church to smell like the sheep meaning to say that you have to embed yourself like what Vatican 2 had said that was more than 50 years ago and uh this is what touches also our heart for example in the Vatican he tried to tell us this truth is not a career come on it's not a career you try to do away with privileges like in the Philippines when you have preed so privileges given to you by the community It's now getting less you know even the titles uh in the Vatican he removed the title of holy lord you know this is just a title you're not even bishop how come you get an entitlement the privilege now it's only given to all this people okay that's that's very interesting yeah that's very interesting reverend uh Isaac let me come to you um and talk about the legacy now especially on uh the Israel Palestine conflict the current war in Gaza W with Francis now gone are you concerned Reverend Isaac that the Vatican and the Catholic Church might retreat from from his active moral voice on Palestine and the war in Gaza do you think he his legacy is going to uh translate into lasting change or was his vision too tied to his personal presence uh to endure i think first and foremost uh those trapped in the churches and Gaza besieged will miss him will miss his uh almost daily calls to the extent that uh he called them from the hospital in his uh sickness Um I think this is the legacy that many of us will remember him with The fact that in his last sermon he spoke about uh Gaza and in his book as I said he called for accountability Um and I hope that um this will continue Uh I trust that the Catholic Church uh will continue with this um with the legacy he set Clearly there is the personal element in it there is his own uh beliefs theology his own uh even upbringing I would argue in Latin America The fact that he served as a priest among the poor uh and then continued uh that lifestyle and that ministry throughout his career whether as bishop or archbishop or uh cardinal and then um pope of the church So certainly there is this um uh personal element Uh and I think now clearly the Catholic Church uh represents and understands that Christianity has become a global phenomena and that the majority of Christians live in the global south Uh and we understand the gospel maybe in a different way as truly the solidarity of God with the marginalized and the oppressed And I hope and believe that the the church will continue uh in that trajectory Uh Father James as as Reverend Isaac said there the majority of Christians live in the global south in Africa is home to one of the fastest growing Christian uh Catholic populations in the world today And uh the Pope as we heard advocated for the poor He advocated for migrants But he also advocated for the rights of the LGBTQ community Right he famously declared in 2023 that being a homosexual is not a crime Those views were divisive To what extent do you think that alienated um traditionalists especially on on the African continent we in Africa we don't uh I don't take that into heart but we understood his line the pressure he was going through but for the African context the south the global south it was clear that homosexuals are viewed as a significant people not only because of government policies even the cultural our African cultural lives don't give space for this so when the holy father came out recently with decide situation We on our sides we took it calmly giving time for prayers and understanding and knowing what was in his heart At at a certain time he came out saying that well this line of sexuality or he tried to exempt the African churches from it But however that was a global point of view However it was disturbing But we are looking at him in terms of a man of mercy a man who brought us out of this darkness of no attention That's why we took little about the LGBT issue in this policies Uh Father Reverend sorry Reverend Isaac if I can come to you and ask you about um the Pope's uh uh you know visits to to places like Iraq and and the Arabian Peninsula the his his role in emphasizing uh interfaith dialogue and the importance of peaceful coexistence between different religions Do you think do you see these uh initiatives having a lasting effect uh on on interreligious understanding in in this reg region in particular which is such a volatile one uh h how do you see you know his legacy lasting uh in terms of you know his attempt to bridge uh the divide between the different faiths in these regions I think uh Pope Francis was truly a peacemaker and uh he spoke to both sides He crossed the walls of of division and he did so in the most difficult times uh in the times in which uh sectarian and religious violence was at the rise in the Middle East uh his visits were so timely and more importantly the message from those visit uh were so important and then on the one hand showing solidarity with uh the communities affected by the violence most notably of course the Christian community whether in Iraq or in other context but then also extending a a warm hand uh for uh reconciliation and for more uh understanding between uh Christianity and Islam in the Middle East was very important We all know about the historic document he signed with al- Aar uh the document on human fraternity which spoke about u peace living together Uh I think that was a monumental um document signed between uh uh Pope Francis and uh al Ahar representing the uh Muslim world uh which I hope would set um the road for more of these engagements that are built on equality on uh as as the document said our human uh fraternity uh and let's remember again the context the times in which such a document was written the uh importance especially given that usually when there is religious violence many use that to promote more polarization extremism stereotypes of other faiths uh and uh the leadership of Pope Francis resented that and said no this is precisely the time in which we need to build bridges rather than characterize other religions or you know stereotype and create this culture of polarization Uh and we see today uh very beautiful words of tribute uh said about Pope Francis from Muslim leaders uh from this region uh as well uh as you know appreciation for all his uh work Let's look ahead to the future now if we can Uh gentlemen uh father James in Juba um let me come to you first on this Now that uh Pope Francis is gone what are the risks that conflict zones whether South Sudan Sudan the DRC Central African Republic that he's spoken uh out uh about that he's you know where he's preached for peace where he's called for peace What are the risks that these issues will be sidelined uh by by the global Catholic leadership what kind of pope would the African continent like to see next to keep these struggles in focus well thank you Regarding the future as I look to the future Pope Francis uh crossed lines where there were other popes never came to He made news in central Africa when there was war there He came to South Sudan He spoke of Sudan He spoke of the Gaza strip He spoke of all these conflict zones Looking forward my prayers and hope is that the Catholic leadership uh who are going to elect a new person through prayers when may the Holy Spirit inspire them to elect someone who can continue this legacy are you hopeful for an African pope finally well it depends to the spirit of God Where does the spirit when if the African pop comes well and good when if another Latin American pop comes well and good where if an Asian comes I ask because Cardinal Lambongo of the DRC is is one of the potential successors What would that mean for the African continent if he were elected no I I don't me as a a Catholic and Catholic priest I don't look at uh at what they call potentials even like somebody would go to the to the conttory as a pope and he comes back as a cabinet in the sense to say uh that person who is ambitious who who is going to be referred as a potential candidate not choose him not be yeah let's ask father Francis his thoughts about Father Francis about the future Cardinal Tagley the former Archbishop of Manila uh his name is often mentioned as a possible successor to Pope Francis I mean uh do you believe that could happen and do you believe that would mean Asia playing a more central role in shaping the Catholic Church's future i can't always say that it's very difficult to predict because often times those people that you predict that do not win So I always trust the Holy Spirit because during any and all the conclave they even vouch from God those candid below 80 years of age that it's not actually their own that they are voting for a vote There is always a possibility of anybody winning especially those who are told are very close to the pope and very close to the Vatican but you never know who will really will inspired by the Holy Spirit All right Reverend Isaac your thoughts uh finally on this I mean do you think uh the Pope's legacy and and and his diplomacy can continue under a new leadership uh particularly if someone like Cardinal Petro Parlin known for his diplomatic work i mean he's also one of the names that's been circulating uh were elected What What are your thoughts about who could lead the Catholic Church well speaking from my position as a Lutheran pastor I can only pray uh that God will lead the Catholic Church in in choosing uh the right uh candidate Um and certainly I would not deny that uh many of us prefer to see someone from the global south to continue uh this path of Pope Francis but as I said this is you know something for the Catholic church and we pray for them at the same time you know uh Pope Francis is often referred to as the people's pope and I think this is important because the legacy he left for us is that it must continue in all of us uh those of us who were inspired by his teaching by his light by his examples It's now I think up to us to continue his legacy Uh if we truly uh want to honor that legacy it's more about what responsibility do we take uh in speaking for the marginalized in defending the oppressed in defending the rights of the poor the refugees the things that he taught must continue uh on every level in the parish level in the congregational level among us theologians uh and uh regardless of what path you know uh uh the the church takes in the future and we will accompany uh the Catholic Church with our prayers I think as I said it's now up to us to continue that legacy through our own ministries in every context I as a Palestinian pastor was uh incredibly influenced and impacted by the legacy of Pope Francis by his life by his teachings And for me the best way to honor the life and legacy of Pope Francis is to continue my ministry of defending the marginalized the oppressed speaking for the plight of people here in Palestine who yearn for justice and equality Thank you so very much for a very fascinating

          <attvalue for="6" value="the federal government just made a major cut to its immigration plan for both permanent and temporary residents with the goal of not just slowing population growth in Canada but actually reducing it to basically zero it's reducing permanent immigration Levels by at least 20% cutting temporary immigrant numbers by nearly 500,000 a year this is a huge about face for the liberal government they basically hit paws on the system for for 3 years it's just unbelievable dramatic Vision downwards the government had been signaling for a while that it was going to make some changes to its immigration plan but no one we spoke to expected the cuts to be this big so why is such a dramatic U-turn let's go through it when the Prime Minister announced these cuts to Canada's immigration plan he said there was one main priority to give all levels of government time to catch up time to make the necessary investments in health care in housing in Social Services to accommodate more people in the future at its core this is a story about a massive spike in demand for housing for public services and a supply that just couldn't keep up and here's what I mean on average over the past few decades Canada's population has grown by somewhere between 200 and 600,000 people per year that dropped off during the the pandemic when borders were closed but look what happened since then Canada's population has grown by more than a million people over the past two years that type of population growth in in kind of a rich country is unheard of that that that's just off the charts Canada usually grows by around 300,000 people a year so to be growing by over a million is substantial we haven't had that sort of population growth in really more than a century and if you look back at the federal government's immigration forecast a few years ago they said the plan was to welcome around 1.2 million new immigrants over a three-year period that was already a record-breaking number that made headlines all over the world but here's the thing that forecast didn't include any mention of temporary residents that would end up coming to Canada over those three years and by temporary we mean International students and temporary foreign workers so after the pandemic um there was a narrative of a labor shortage crisis there was a belief that you know we're in a in an economy now where we can't have too many immigrants entering the country there can't be too many I mean our vacant job vacancies are so high they've reached a million we just need more workers this was an urgent problem that needed fixing and there was no target No Limit set on how many of these temporary visas the government could hand out so the door was thrown wide open and Canada's population actually grew by about 3 million people in 3 years almost triple the official forecast and according to statistics Canada if you're comparing natural population growth to immigration 98% of that growth was from immigration it took a lot of people by surprise including the provinces and cities that became home to all of these new people 560,000 temporary immigrants it's too much the number of people coming here is too fast this growth was so sudden and it caught policy makers off guard that there was basically no time to react they lost control of the system it was a runaway train that they they couldn't slow down even the Prime Minister himself has acknowledged this in the tumultuous times as we emerged from the pandemic between addressing labor needs and maintaining population growth we didn't get the balance quite right now in terms of what exactly local and provincial governments need time to catch up on Trudeau mentioned three specific things Health Care in housing in Social Services let's start with housing when a country's population is growing you need more homes for people to live in right here's what that looked like over the past few decades you can see it's about a 2:1 ratio new people to new homes which is according to urban planners around where you want to be but the Gap started to grow a little bit between 2016 and the pandemic and then by 2021 it had basically doubled Canada is now building on average one new home for every four new working age people and this mismatch between supply and demand doesn't just mean it's become harder to find a place to live which it has it's also driven up prices you get a big sudden increase in the demand for housing when you combine that with a very what we call in elastic unresponsive supply of housing then you get big increases in prices in early 2020 right before the pandemic the average cost of a house in Canada was around $540,000 by 2022 that shot up to a whopping $840,000 it since leveled off a little but a home is still almost 200 Grand more expensive than it was pre pandemic and it's not much better if you're renting last year according to the cmhc Canada had the lowest vacancy rate ever on record and what happens when your landlord knows there's a line of people waiting to fill their unit they bump up the rent play that out across the entire country and you get this a record-breaking jump in the average cost of rent now to be clear house prices in Canada have been high for a while now and yes unaffordability is made worse by high interest rates building costs red tape it's all part of the picture too but even the Bank of Canada has been clear that strong population growth has added pressure to house prices and rents and there was concern among economists that pressure was only going to keep building a recent CIBC report estimated even if the population continued to grow slightly less than it has over the past couple of years we'd still have a shortage of about 5 million houses by 2030 and building 5 million units in the next 6 years you'd be hardpressed to find someone anyone who thinks that's realistic the reality is that when you add 1.3 million people to the population within the space of the year we can't possibly match that on the supply [Music] side okay so in a free market prices are intimately linked to the balance between supply and demand that makes sense but what happens when there's a supply and demand problem for public services like healthcare what you get are shortages and cues and lineups people wait waiting longer and longer to get a service now the problems with Canada's Health Care system are wide- ranging and complex it is a system suffering from Regional disparities record numbers of burnt out health care workers an aging population but it also hasn't grown as fast as the number of people who need it in 2019 there were just over 91,000 doctors in Canada over the next 4 years there were about 6,000 more but for a population that's grown by millions in that time so what does that mean for all those people who need a doctor essentially fewer and fewer have access to one researchers estimate the number of Canadians without a family doctor went from about 4 A5 million in 2019 to about 6 A5 million in 2023 and a recent Angus re survey suggests more often than not it's recent immigrants that are suffering most from this discrepancy more and more people are coming here not being able to access the care they need in a timely manner and often what happens is if you can't uh see your family doctor you end up having to go to emergency because of of a lack of options and let's talk about the ER last year there were a million more emergency room visits in Canada than the year before which has meant those admitted are now waiting about 40% longer than they were in 2020 and it's really put a tremendous amount of pressure on the hospital system but also Primary Care big population swings like this can also have a big impact on infrastructure take Pei last year the province saw a 33% jump in Immigration the highest on record and its Regional power provider Maritime electric says it hasn't had time to update its grid and it's about to reach capacity this year we're over 9 ,000 customers that's a new threshold for us if we get into cold weather events for extended periods of times it could be challenge for us we've seen massive econ and massive population growth over the past years particularly in the area of temporary workers and temporary residents and we are now saying okay we need to let our communities our po our our infrastructures catch up to the population and that's the Crux of this Canada's population grew by a lot really fast housing infrastructure Public Services they've been buckling under the pressure and everyone including and often especially new immigrants have been suffering because of it but one other thing that might explain why the government acted so drastically so suddenly public support for Canada's immigration system has been dropping fast the consensus in around immigration is one that is that is under threat in Canada Canadians have some legitimate questions about the increase and the rapidity of the increase a recent National survey suggests around half of Canadians now view immigration as harmful to the country that's up 10 points from last year and what's driving this shift a so-called scarcity mindset according to the survey authors when it comes to housing healthare and social services so solving this problem quickly might be as much a political matter as it is a pragmatic one for the liberal government they really realize that it's a weak spot for them that the immigration file has become something that a lot of Voters are talking about and so they're sending a message to voters saying we hear you we are going to respond in a big time way we understand that we didn't get this right AIA kulpa it's very clearly AIA kulpa the big question is now to what extent will slashing immigration fix the problems that we've mentioned and what of the reason that Canada welcomed so many new immigrants in the first place how will this affect the economy that's only avoided a recession over the past year or so because of immigration [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="- [Narrator] This is a Ukrainian drone flying out of a truck in southeastern Siberia 2,700 miles from the front line, targeting Putin's warplanes deep in the heart of Russian territory. Ukrainian officials said it was part of a clandestine attack that saw four military airports hit, destroying more than 40 war planes in the biggest blow of the war against Moscow's long-range bomber fleet. - What we have here is not only a victory for Ukraine in terms of debilitating Russia's ability to launch missiles against Ukraine, but it's actually a strategic victory which helps the west enormously. - [Narrator] The attack, known as Operation Spider's Web, hit 34% of Russia's strategic cruise missile carriers, causing an estimated $7 billion worth of damage. In total, Ukrainian officials said 117 drones were used, and that the operation took more than a year and a half of planning. - Ukraine has long used long-range drones launched from Ukraine, which then fly into Russian airspace and strike a variety of targets. But this attack was rather different. Some of the airfields that were struck were thousands of miles from Ukraine, and the operation didn't involve these long-range drones, which we've become used to seeing launched from Ukraine. Instead, these were small drones which were launched from containers on trucks. We don't yet have the details of exactly how this happened. The SBU has not revealed it. It has shown some photographs of what these containers looked like, which were clearly loaded onto the trucks and the way that the drones were concealed within these containers. We don't know exactly how they got into Russia, but it seems to be that Ukraine has taken advantage of commercial networks to deliver a weapon deep inside the territory of its enemy in a way that the Russian security services and military have been stunned by and were absolutely not ready for. - [Narrator] Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the operation had tangible losses. US officials said that Kyiv didn't provide advanced notice of the strikes to the Trump administration. - This operation appears to have used only Ukrainian equipment, non-US equipment, and therefore Ukraine has clearly felt that it doesn't need to inform the US. - [Narrator] Russia has not confirmed how many planes were hit, but has said that aircraft were damaged and set on fire. - What we're seeing here is an extraordinary assault that not only is it a demonstration of Ukraine's ability to innovate and strike Russia where it's not expecting it, it's also a clear indication that Russia is not invincible. Russia has been seeking to portray its victory in Ukraine as inevitable. This extraordinary operation shows that Ukraine is still in this fight and can cause significant damage to Russia well beyond the battlefield. - [Narrator] In this video, the journal was able to confirm the location by analyzing satellite imagery. The smoke scene is rising in the direction of the Belaya air base, located around 2,700 miles from the front line. - It's clearly a big blow for Russian air capabilities. We don't know how many of Russia's strategic bomber fleet is actually still airworthy, but clearly what what we've seen is Ukraine claiming 41 airplanes that have been taken out. So far, online analysts say they've visually confirmed about 14, and that number is likely to rise as more imagery comes out. Ukraine has asked the Trump administration for more air defense systems. Those have not yet been forthcoming, but Ukraine has, through this attack, has found an even better way to try to stop Russian missiles from striking their cities killing civilians and children. And that is by taking out the aircraft before they even take off. - [Narrator] Analysts say Russia will now have to rethink how it stores and defends its bombers. Ukrainian officials say some of the planes that were destroyed are no longer produced by Russia. - These aircraft that Russia has lost, either damaged or destroyed, were an important part of Russia's power projection. They are the strategic bomber fleet. These are the ones that would deliver nuclear missiles. The fact that Ukraine has been able to destroy some of these aircraft and in a quite spectacular way is a demonstration not only of Russian weakness, of Russian security flaws, as well as Ukrainian ingenuity, but it also cramps Russia's ability to project that power because the size of its strategic bomber fleet is now small. - [Narrator] The attack came a day ahead of planned peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. - Russia must feel what its losses mean. That is what will push it toward diplomacy. And when Russia takes losses in this war, it's obvious to everyone that Ukraine, either one, holding the line, not just for itself, but for all of Europe. - There's a message for Russians that Ukraine can cause severe damage to Russia, deep, deep inside Russia. And it's a message for the other partners that have been supporting Ukraine, particularly for the US, which under Donald Trump has been wavering somewhat in its support, it's a message to them, Ukraine is still in this fight.

          <attvalue for="6" value="we can break Donald Trump's trade war with the world into a series of repeating patterns step one make a maximalist threat in a few moments I will sign a historic executive order instituting reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world step two let it simmer to create leverage us tariffs rattling investors sparking dramatic losses global financial markets are tanking again step three pull back that President Trump has announced that there will be a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs and step four no matter the outcome claim a historic win which justifies the cycle we have many meetings planned today and tomorrow and every country wants to be making deals he's the closer he gets deals done that we could never get done this is the art of the trade deal we can use two key US trading partners China and the UK to answer the question does this strategy even work then there's a third case which might suggest maybe the strategy has its limits let me explain donald Trump has a history of finding and taking the most aggressive line possible in attempting to resolve even the most delicate and complex issues rocket Man should have been handled a long time ago this is Donald Trump a few minutes ago i too have a nuclear button but it is a much bigger and more powerful one than his the US will take over the Gaza Strip my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal and we've already started doing it so there's something called the madman theory of politics which is sometimes applied to Donald Trump but originally to Richard Nixon people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook well I'm not a crook i've earned everything I've got yeah that Richard Nixon but before he was swept out of office by the Watergate scandal Nixon's most pressing problem was how to end the Vietnam War and this madman theory was about cultivating an image of Nixon so willing to go to extremes that he would even use nuclear weapons if necessary when Americans are risking their lives in war it is the responsibility of their leaders to take some risks for peace trump has adopted a version of this as step one of his playbook step one starts off by asking for the moon and requesting that the counterparty builds and finances a staircase to the moon so let's consider Trump's approach to China china china china's been ripping this off for many years trump's position is that China cheats at trade that they manipulate their currency unfairly subsidize their industries and maintain artificially low labor standards allowing them to flood global markets with cheap goods no one can compete with so he threatened tariffs the US imposing a 10% tax on all Chinese goods additional 10% a 34% tax additional 50% the total rate of 145% you try to use every single kind of point of leverage that you have against somebody you make very broad demands of people and suggest that you're very firm in these demands that you're not backing down yes step one is all about making it seem like you're ready to go to infinity and beyond and really when you're talking about 145% tariffs they might as well be infinity tariffs tariffs under 50% will tend to squeeze profit margins tariffs above 50% will tend to end all trade and that leads to step two which is to simply wait and watch carnage panic bloodbath doesn't even begin to cut it chinese markets deep in the red now Hong Kong stocks plunged the most in almost three decades china sells more product to the United States than any other country in the world almost half a trillion dollars worth in 2024 alone meaning every single day Americans are buying more than a billion dollar in Chinese goods if that source of revenue dries up well that's real pressure but it's pressure that acts both ways there has been an acknowledgement that this is creating problems with the US economy so we come to step three which has tended to arrive just when things start to look really bad in China's case Trump's tariffs slowed traffic at US shipping ports on the West Coast to an absolute crawl that's lost money and lost jobs businesses unsure whether to stockpile Chinese goods or abandon them altogether they paid the steepest price and China's counter tariffs only added to the worry that this was all making for a very shaky economic future so China and the United States have agreed to drastically reduce tariffs on both sides for a 90day period and this paved the way for step four which is to claim any outcome as a big win even if the only measurable outcome of a trade deal the White House celebrates as historic is a partial roll back of tariffs that Trump had himself initiated and then caused the agreement does include vague language about future talks and cooperation but these are aspirational there are no enforcable commitments no clear timelines not that that matters much especially for those who are predisposed to seeing Trump's actions in a favorable light it's incredible what President Trump has done over the weekend he brokered that IndiaPakistani ceasefire uh he got Zalinsky and Putin to go to the table and then also the US and China trade deal well I've been busy but I've enjoyed it because we're getting things accomplished we're getting things done the pattern often is to do something that makes things dramatically worse for everybody so let's imagine we're at 0 he'll take something and make it 20 and then the thing he declares as a win is something like -5 so it is substantial uh how much they came down with these tariffs at this point and how much they got done this weekend is a massive surprise he's firing on all cylinders maybe we finally get the markets are responding positively to this this trade deal being done it's a framework there's still more negotiation to go but it's a step in the right direction so it's an improvement from where he put the parties but it's actually typically not an improvement from where we started now not all of Trump's trade deals go this way what makes the strategy work is that he does sometimes extract concessions that he probably wouldn't have gotten otherwise let me show you what that looks [Music] like the way Trump defines trading relationships the US currently rips off the UK because it runs a trade surplus with them if it were the other way around Trump would call it unfair and impose tariffs but it's not and Trump imposed tariffs anyway the United States can no longer continue with a policy of unilateral economic surrender among Trump's tariffs that would come to affect UK goods a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum and a 25% tariff on cars which was a particularly big blow considering the number one UK export to the United States is cars the classic bully strategy is you push around the small guys and if you're the United States you know most economies are smaller what Trump knew from the start though is that bullying works so once the threat was made and the economic damage made clear the two sides made a deal this morning I'm thrilled to announce that we've reached a breakthrough trade deal with the United Kingdom credible country and it was more than a breakthrough according to the White House this was once again historic a great deal for America the deal was certainly lopsided the United States main concession was simply to undo some of the tariffs Trump had just imposed the universal 10% tariff on UK goods that would stay in effect but the tariff on cars and the tariff on steel and aluminum would largely be dropped or at least reconsidered the design is other countries come here offer concessions and we decide whether they're acceptable or not and then the US concession is that we won't do what we threaten to do so this was a great deal in the same way give me your wallet or I'll shoot you is a great deal if you're mugging someone and the wallet in this case is what the White House refers to as a $5 billion opportunity created by the UK granting American ethanol and cattle farmers higher sales quotas and lower tariff rates basically more market access for American companies but let's be clear even the White House is careful to call this only an opportunity because access is not the same thing as a sale what the UK didn't change for example are its strict food safety standards which have kept American chlorine washed chicken and hormone treated beef out of British markets so American industry players are pretty cautious calling the so-called historic deal an important first step in expanding markets but also acknowledging more work is needed to remove the arbitrary barriers that have excluded American grown food from grocery stores in the UK and so here's the prevailing takeaway though hailed by the leaders of the two countries as significant analysts said it did not appear to meaningfully alter the terms of trade between the countries as they stood before the changes introduced by Trump this year meaning this is no trade deal there just isn't enough in it to call it that at best it's a framework for a deal among industries that don't even form a major basis for US UK trade to begin with us agriculture products um ethanol American beef those aren't big imports for the UK these aren't like major big ticket items that are really going to have a large-scale effect on the US economy these are the things that we can point to as being legitimate concessions that don't really make a whole lot of a difference [Music] at this stage I should state something pretty plainly that my point here isn't to show you how little Trump has accomplished because his administration can and does argue the exact opposite they all want to make a deal because we have something that they all want but what I think I can show you is how steep a price the US may pay for whatever it is Trump believes he has accomplished markets are tumbling as investors are really digesting worse than expected tariffs wall Street reacted with fear and pessimism we know Trump's tariffs imposed on nearly every single country in the world caused the American stock market to suddenly lose trillions of dollars in value and we know this is both a symptom and a cause of an awful lot of economic uncertainty with the profit outlook dimming what firms will do is they'll start layoffs or some costcutting measure they're certainly not going to expand and add that new fleet of trucks or that new warehouse and that too will bleed into the real life economy of everyday people but there's also an additional cost one that you can't easily measure in dollars and cents at least not right away the notion that you take a single issue and anchor in a kind of take it or leave it way um in a bullying kind of way to extract a few concessions falls apart and the reason why it falls apart is what it does is it eviscerates trust what does he mean by that well consider for a moment how America's closest ally now appears to see things when one polling firm asked Canadians in February how they viewed the US nearly a third saw it as an enemy that was nearly on par with the number of people who saw it as a friend and it's worth just pausing on that for a moment because that is an extraordinarily harsh judgment on Americans in a relationship that arguably spent the next several months getting worse we know now that feeling has had an impact on how Canadians shop how Canadians travel and where this country's leaders look for long-term relationships our old relationship based on steadily increasing integration is over consider once again the UK they just agreed to a free trade deal with India one of the biggest tariff reductions slashing Indian taxes on British cars from 100% down to 10 which gives the UK a potential alternative to the US for one of its most important exports and consider the case of China which was forced to pivot after Trump's first term i am the chosen one somebody had to do it so I'm taking on China over the last several years China forged stronger economic ties with countries like Japan South Korea and Australia as the number one buyer of soybeans worldwide it buys more today from Brazil than it ever has and its imports from the US have dropped significantly it is China not the US who is right now the largest trading partner of most countries on planet Earth and I think that in the long term there is that risk to the United States of America that the other countries are going to realize US is no longer magnanimous is quite mechavelian it's quite transactional and so the rest of the world has to reorient as well and act accordingly when you are at war inconsistency chaos surprise attacks are exactly what you want but when someone is your business partner are they people who are arbitrary capricious and random there's no question on some level what Donald Trump does just works the US has unquestionable leverage constantly using it keeps Trump at the center of attention and his supporters admire that show of strength even when the results are fuzzy but experts tell us Trump also risks sending the world a message that undercuts and erodess the very thing he relies on the signal the US is sending is that we're no longer a reliable economic partner and if that signal were to get louder and take hold in a more permanent way the world might inch closer to a very different future one that doesn't always revolve around the United States [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="okay we are going to move to Dr curtis while you guys work through the mic issue but Mr balden please be assured we will be coming back to you so we'll we'll just pass we will be coming back though dr curtis if you can thank you my story begins when I left my office to go to get some to eat before I did surgery and to do that I had to go by the emergency room and when I went by the emergency room a policeman came out of the door into the emergency room grabbed my shoulder and said &quot;Are you a doctor?&quot; Can everybody hear yes sorry Dr curtis uh Mr balden we can hear you now your your microphone's working but Dr curtis is doing their opening statement so if you could just pause real quick and then put yourself on mute thank you dr curtis please continue all right so uh the policeman asked me if I was a doctor and I said yes and he grabbed me by the arm and pulled me into the emergency room and took me to the trauma room and uh when I looked in the trauma room there was three people in the room one was the president and he was laying on the gurnie and an extremist and the other was Dr carico James Carico and one nurse and the reason Dr carico was on his own is because the uh Governor Connley was brought in before him and he was uh had very seriously ill and the staff all the staff in the emergency room went to help him and then Dr carico was left to take care of the president by himself so I walked in and he had just placed a endotracchial tube and uh then I walked up and held the tube so he could connect the bird machine to it the bird machine is an intermittent positive pressure respiratory help and it works by filling the lungs and and then letting the air come back out and the way it works is that the uh the inspiration continues to of certain pressure and then the expiration continues to another low pressure and therefore uh that that spaces the uh the the breathing normally that's about 10 or 15 minutes uh 10 or 15 times during a minute and but in this case it was it was going to about 100 to 125 minute uh uh conversions in a minute so it was ratat and and I had never I knew the machine dr carico knew the machine we used it a lot and uh so the question was is is the machine not working or is the tube blocked or what and he had placed the tube in and if you place an intraal tube you place it between the cords and then you know you're in the trachea and you've got an airway but in this case apparently we didn't have an airway and finally uh it was a question is it the machine or is it what is it and so finally it got to a point where I said Jimmy what do you want to do and he had already made a decision he said he asked me we need to do a TRA so if there was going to be a TRA well I knew the shirt would be in the way so I moved around to take the shirt off and the nurse way ahead of me with her scissors we took the shirt off and in the meantime Dr malcolm Perry uh came in and he's uh on the medical staff he's a professor in the medical school senior to Dr carico so he decided to do the tracheosttomy and then Dr carico said to me &quot;Don why don't you go ahead and do a cut down on that left leg?&quot; And uh so I I went and did that a cut down is a very small operation but it has is very important thing to do the um uh reason for doing it is that most patient come in to the emergency room as be bled out where their blood volume is low and if the blood volume is low well then the heart doesn't have anything to pump and that is cause a death well if you can replenish the blood volume quickly well then that causes a better chance of survival though so the cut down is uh to put a catheter in a vein so that you can uh get the fluid in or faster and the operation is to make an incision across the the front of the shin and dissect out the saffronos vein which is a large vein that goes right up the front of the leg put a cathe make a little hole in the catheter put a the catheter in there and uh then put a a stitch around the uh vein to close it off and hold the the catheter in place the nurse at the meantime has the uh uh bag hanging with the IV fluid in 500 cc's in a collar that she can pump up and when she does that well she uh it forces the fluid into the into the vein and so that's what I did then after I did that then Dr perry had already completed the tracheosttomy and I was uh looked up and then uh the president had heart had stopped or it wasn't running they put a monitor on the president found out his heart was not bleeding and so the uh and and so he external cardiac massage was being done by uh Kemp Clark the chief of neurosurgery and somebody relieved him and Kemp Clark went and picked up the head and stopped the resuscitation this wound is not compatible with life you got dead quiet nobody knew what to say nobody said anything for the longest time then he said &quot;Okay let and he looked at by that time the chiefs of all the surgical services were against the wall across the room from me and all in white coats and they had responded to the to the call that they needed help.&quot; And so he said the pointed them out &quot;I need to tell each of you individually what the wound is so you can say that later on.&quot; And uh then he described the wound as about a 3 or 4 inch hole in the posterior cranium and then uh there's a a bullet hole in the right temple so he described it that the bullet came through the temple into the cranial vault created huge pressure in the cranial vault and when the bullet finally tumbled into the posterior wall it blew it out and he explained all that to individually to these five doctors seven doctors and those doctors knew what was happening and what happened to the president and the the wound that killed him and they never were called by the by the uh warrant commission so uh that didn't work and so after that I stood there and I I couldn't leave because Mrs kennedy was to my right and I couldn't get past her so I had to just stay there for a while but then eventually everybody left and I went around to look at the wound and I couldn't see it was laying on the pillow but I could see where it was then I left there and went into an adjacent room the uh X-ray waiting room it was a large room and right in the middle of the room was Lyndon Johnson and he was telling people to go talk on the phone and and he was obviously he set the government up and he had taken control and then I looked around and I couldn't see a single person I thought looked like Secret Service i couldn't see any weapons that were protecting him and I so I was a little uncomfortable being there myself because at that time we had no idea what was going on with our government we didn't know if the government would be intact or not but it made me feel good to know that he was right in the middle of the room and and he was the president he was absolutely fearless then I wondered why is he so absolutely fearless i mean cuz he if if it was a coup he'd be the next one to go so with that I left and and that's what I learned in the emergency in the wrong trauma room then uh later we uh found out that the residents and interns should not talk to each other about this and so we didn't and Dr carico and I would have lunch together many times often just him and me and we never mentioned it to each other and uh so one thing I'd like to get started today is that the magic bullet was a product of the Warren Commission that that doesn't make any sense and I could go through these these bullets that fell on the but I think I'm out of town well so just so you know we will be giving you opportunity to go back to that because we are very interested in that and thank you for that um because of previous uh technical issues Mr balden if you can please give your opening statement" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="away i now recognize Judge Tonheim for an opening statement thank you Madam Chair thank you uh Mr ranking Member uh appreciate this opportunity to speak today uh my name is John Tunim i'm a federal district court judge for the District of Minnesota i'm in my 30th year as a federal judge i served as chief judge of our district from 2015 until 2022 and as a member of the US Judicial Conference from 2020 to 2024 i was originally nominated by President Clinton in 1995 after serving 10 years as the Minnesota's Chief Deputy Attorney General i was chair of the assassination records review board during its entire existence from 1994 through 1998 the review board was an independent federal agency its five member board members were confirmed by the US Senate after being nominated by President Clinton congress created the uh review board for the express purpose of reviewing all of the still secret records of the tragic assassination of President John Kennedy and declassifying as much information as could be publicly released the impetus for the law which was enacted in October 1992 was Oliver Stone's movie JFK the President John F kennedy uh assassination records collection act of 1992 uh provided for a five member decisionmaking board which would make decisions on agency requested redactions from classified documents we had declassification authority first time and maybe the only time an outside group had that authority the board members were by law to be recommended uh for appointment by professional organizations two national historical associations an archavist association and the American Bar Association besides me the members included a renowned provost from a major university later university president two distinguished history professors and a senior archavist at Princeton we were confirmed in 1994 and began our work with no appropriation or offices we worked out of the National Archives for a time until I was able to secure some funding from the White House to get us started before Congress could provide an appropriation the agency's presentation of records was seriously delayed because of the delay in the appointments we were ready to begin review uh with our staff by early 1995 the statute did not require us to reach any conclusions about uh prior investigations or what happened on November 22nd rather our task was to conduct a wide-ranging search for records to create the largest possible collection of assassination related records as open to the public as possible the goal was to allow the interested public to make up their own minds about what happened and uh based on an open and transparent and complete record the congressional mandate and this is important it stated that the records relating to the assassination would quote carry a presumption of immediate disclosure and quote only in the rarest of cases is there any legitimate need for continued protection this is Congress in 1992 Congress defined the term assassination records broadly and indicated that the review board could further define the term assassination record which we did so in June of 1995 our definition was that any record that was reasonably related to the assassination would be an assassination record subject to the board's jurisdiction and we included all records collected by government agencies in conjunction with any investigation or analysis of or inquiry into the assassination of President Kennedy we developed detailed guidelines for agencies to follow and agencies did have the right to appeal our decisions directly to the president we were authorized to redact words we did not ever redact entire documents uh that the agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that was a standard that the harm of disclosure outweighed the public interest in the uh document in four categories national security intelligence gathering methods personal privacy or methods of protecting the president that was it we held many public hearings experts conferences around the country in addition to our private meetings to discuss our decision-making we also tried to clarify unclear evidence where we could digitalizing autopsy materials and analyzing them and deposing the autopsy physicians we also gathered artifacts including photographs and film clothing and other uh artifacts we had limited time to do our We had limited time to do our work uh which was not enough time we're granted just one more year by Congress so we had a total of three years we began to lose staff as we approached the end of our mandate in all the board issued over 27,000 individual rulings these were decisions uh on requests by agencies to protect information most redacted information had release dates attached to them we made it easy for the researchers to determine whether a redacted name appeared in different locations so that they would know it was the same person there were a further 33,000 consent releases which is essentially means that the agency saw the handwriting on the wall and released the documents directly since we were likely to order release when we finished there were nearly 5 million pages at the National Archives we made the decision early that we would not protect any information directly related to the assassination because of the high level of public interest by 2017 when the last records were to be released under the act there were probably not more than 1500 review board redactions that were remaining the act was clear in stating that despite the review board wrapping up its work in 1998 the act was to continue in effect which meant that agencies had the obligation to continue to present uh information most of the redactions now in the documents are within documents never shown to the review board but were transferred to NAR at a later time agencies largely complied with the mandate to present records to the review board however there are many delays and denials with records that we specifically requested and there were many skirmishes along the way it does not take a rocket scientist to realize that agencies were awaiting the end of our three-year mandate the first 500 or so adverse disclosure decisions we made in FBI records were appealed to the president and the appeals were dropped when White House counsel former judge and uh representative Abner Mikva told the FBI to drop the appeals because President Clinton would deny all of them fbi staff was helpful to us but I'm now seeing records in the new releases that were not disclosed to the review board the CIA was cooperative and processed many documents with us but never we never received much of what we specifically asked for when asked for example for documents involving James Angleton that we had not seen I was told the documents were no longer maintained as a collection we received only three memoranda that incorporated the AY's review of Angleton's counter intelligence files not the files themselves just a review by someone else of the files we were told that all the other documents had been destroyed i'm now seeing a flood of documents that clearly meet the definition of assassination records involving Angleton and others that were not submitted to us for review when CIA analysts would not tell us the details of their secret operations our response was &quot;Okay we'll release the record in 10 days.&quot; We then heard the details and could make a reasonable decision we had in our hands a small file on George Joeites that was disclosed that disclosed nothing really so it was returned we didn't know the details of his work at the time we now know much more about Joanites and his files should be immediately disclosed there's no reason anymore for protecting those files clearly we were misled i actually wrote to President Biden asking that he order the CIA to release the Joe and file and I never received a response the Secret Service was very difficult they were the only agency that we were aware of that tried to reclassify assassination records after we were in office they attempted to classify documents that had already been released publicly and fought us over 1963 threat sheets that were still that was still in process when we left office the Department of State was less than helpful although they released records in their possession when we negotiated with Russian officials over the Oswald files in Moscow they did not lift a finger to help us not even allowing us access to the United States embassy uh when we tried to get access to Bellarian records on Oswald they did not help when we planned meetings with Mexican and Cuban officials they stopped us from direct contacts the act specifically required the department of state to help us uh find foreign records the National Archives was very helpful to us when we did our work a very dedicated staff member Steven Tilly was instrumental in getting our work done but since we left office I've been disappointed the archives has not devoted more personnel to the records we had planned that the archives would continue our work to the extent possible for the most part that has not happened and the agency has never been in contact with me so there are other files that should be released we came close to an agreement to copy the entire KGB file on Lee Harvey Oswald that is maintained in Minsk Bellarus lastm minute disputes prevented the agreement from moving forward copies of the files are in Moscow i just have a little bit more here we were particularly interested in the files of Walder Sheridan an investigator for Robert Kennedy when we took office he removed the files from the Kennedy Library where we had access to them and gave them to NBC for safekeeping i don't think those files have been released the William Manchester taped interviews of Jacqueline and Robert Kennedy are protected by a 1967 legal agreement now controlled by Caroline Kennedy we encouraged her to release the files and she finally responded in August 1998 that she would not agree to their release or even let us listen to the recordings and out there somewhere are files on Jack Ruby we could not find them other than the files maintained by the earlier investigations in the final report of the board a copy of which I will give to Madame Chair today we made 10 recommendations that are relevant today still uh I won't go through them all but they deal with the problems of excessive government secrecy which has plagued the public's understanding of the Kennedy assassination for decades we strongly endorsed the method uh selected for independent declassification of executive branch records that was used in our case but also detailed the problems inherent in the review board's legislation most important to deal with massive overclassification we recommended a federal classification policy be developed that substantially one limits the number of those in government who can actually classify federal documents two restricts the number of categories by which documents might be classified three reduces the time period for which documents might be classified four encourages the use of substitute language to immediately open material that might otherwise be classified and five increases the resources available to agencies and NARA for declassifying federal records thank you Madam Chair thank you very much and just so everyone knows we are going to be following up on getting that file uh the KGB file in Minsk i'm interested in seeing that and I think that with peace talks right now it might be prime time for that so we will be following up on that it stands about 5 ft" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="recognize Mr new House for 5 minutes thank you Mr chairman i appreciate that and enjoy the work that we do together on important stuff mr secretary welcome to the committee appreciate you being here uh you you've uh picked up the ball very quickly and and are running fast with it i appreciate all your hard work i wanted to bring up a couple different things uh try to get to them in the short amount of time that we have but first the lower Snake River dams as we've talked about before you know hydroelectric power it's vital to my region of the country it produces um a reliable lowcost electricity for rateayers it provides us so many different kinds of benefits from irrigation uh the power the clean power uh generation that is critical uh for us it also provides us a tremendous amount of uh help for the agricultural industry and the irrigation water it provides uh flood control transportation is huge all these different benefits um that we we we we derive from the dams but as you know there's been efforts over the past decades to breach the dams due to to one reason and that's migrating fish the the salmon that are very important to the Pacific Northwest as well so I'm just I wanted to bring that up unfortunately Mr simpson isn't here we've engaged in a lot of conversations about this but I just wanted to to make sure that hear your commitment to work together with us so we can continue to derive the benefits of the hydroelectric system as well as a strong salmon population i think we can do both we've proven that uh efforts that if allowed uh we've been able to make significant increases in the number of salmon and u your insight even though this is a congressional decision your insight your help on this issue will be tremendously important just wanted to ask if there's any plans in place as you're getting up to speed at conversations you might have that u we could we could maybe utilize to u I get away from the efforts of the federal government particularly executive branch recently of of of removing such an important asset in the Pacific Northwest uh thank you Congressman New House and yes I share your perspective on that hydroelect electric dams were again large infrastructure projects when America was bold we built a number of great dams they've been critical to the economic prosperity of our country very early suppliers of firm reliable power what's great about dams is when when when demand for electricity goes up you can release more water when you're in low demand periods you can release less water so they provide what I call high value electricity which means it's there when you need it and and you can hold it back when you don't need it uh they're very valuable assets we're going into a period of significant demand for growth in electricity driven by AI and resourcing of manufacturing we got to be ready to meet those demands without harming rateayers by driving up price to kill demand so yes I I I am passionately in support of those dams staying in place they've been tremendous assets for decades uh we should not spend money to go backwards to reduce our energy generating capacity particularly of such high value electricity as that from those dams so yes I I am fully aligned to work with you and so is the whole administration um to think to think first about the American taxpayers and and the American citizens that need it and I was a board member of an environmental group until I was confirmed into this role though also passionate about fish and and and the outdoors and animals and and clean air and clean water and all that and as you said they go they go together they they are not always in opposition in fact they're rarely in opposition yeah absolutely that's great i appreciate hearing that and in that note you we've talked about Hanford mr simpson talked about that as well mr mr chairman did as well um when you come out to visit Hanford which I know you will as Secretary of Energy I'd love to be able to include in your trip a visit to one of the hydroelectric dams on that absolutely absolutely when I go out to PNNL I'll also visit Hanford and I'd love to go visit uh a dam or two with you as well good good good we'll make that happen um so B talking about Hanford a significant uh effort on the part of DOE in in central Washington some of the legacy cleanup of our efforts in the to win World War II and in the Cold War the Manhattan project all those things that tremendously important u but we have a problem that that we're facing um I I do appreciate the comments that you've made and conveying the importance of that and really anxious to to have you out there and and visit firsthand so you can see exactly what's going on tremendous work that is happening there requires a stable steady budget in order to make that successful and long-term commitment which fortunately that has been there and we want to continue that i I just wanted to um uh ask you about any kind of uh uh thoughts that you've been putting into this are you planning to enhances that are necessary for Hanford as that as this work continues and ramps up we're just about close to opening the vid plant which is an exciting thing um so just wanted to get your perspective on that and again reiterate looking forward to your I'm sure will be upcoming visit yeah one of my key picks for my team for assistant secretary was environmental management you know and I picked a guy who's been a constructor developer investor businessman about building things um and and moving dirt and making stuff happen so I think he will be a great asset to environmental management team uh but yeah Hanford is key you know the funding for that unlike almost everything else in the department is flat for uh that we have proposed in our budget for 2026 versus 2025 i'm very excited to see the direct feed uh low activity waste plant come online this year i've had multiple meetings with Becttel about that and um and I've continued to express the importance of it and and uh and I've gotten great assurances all the way from the top of the company that top people are on it and that that plant will be operating this year i'm excited to see that in fact I'll probably be out for the ribbon cutting when we get that going i'm thank you for your commitment to that thank you Mr secretary for your indulgence i just had a couple more things I wanted to bring up real quickly the first has to do with the Bonavville Power Administration and let me just say I do appreciate the efforts that are going in uh on behalf of the federal government by this administration to reduce spending it's something we have to get a control of government waste and taxpayer funds those those are the things that we we have to pay particular responsibility to and time um however with the um Bonavville Power Administration that's that's an organization as you know that does not receive federal funds and they've been impacted by the uh by these efforts lost 200 employees up to date uh which is significant lots of institutional knowledge has gone out the door that's not easily replaced and certainly has a potential for all PMAs throughout the country to impact the um um operations and reliability of producing power for years to come um so I just wanted to bring that up and ask you how these reductions have affected your agency and what kinds of precautions uh that you're taking to ensure that they don't uh impact the grid grid reliability and raise electricity costs so great great question and and it it is a concern for for us as well in the in the department when we did our first sort of voluntary who wants to step out a drip we call it deferred resignation program to give pe to let people go out on the best possible terms we had acceptance across the department from it um and we we granted those wishes of people that chose in then we did a second round that's been much bigger but we've been specific at saying we can't have people leave um from Bonavville Power and the and the other power marketing agencies because it's I don't think we have room to reduce headcount there anymore and so I think and when I arrived uh and I only learned this in the last you know few weeks that Bonnyville Power Administration was already below well below its sort of desired staffing so absolutely true that gap was much bigger than the the one or 200 hundred people that have left since then it was already several hundred short so there'll be no more shrinkage in headcount at at Bonville Power and one of the key things there is to be is in all of these things is to make sure we're delivering on the mission make sure that that that thing is getting done that the power is being marketed transmitted and and and bettering the lives of the citizens all in that region so I understand your concern there and we share it and and um good we'll keep I appreciate that keep headcount flat there appreciate that commitment and then I wanted to jump to to uh another thing that very proud of in the state of Washington and that's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory as you as you probably know they're celebrating 60 years of scientific brilliance and I hope we can add that to your list of things you're going to have to be in Washington for a few days you know that don't you i do i do and I'm okay with that i've climbed many mountains in Washington and that that that took several days as well well the lab uh it's focused on addressing some of the most complex national issues that we uh have the challenges that we're trying to meet it also conducts important research for the energy efficiency and renewable energy programs as well as nuclear and nonp proliferation so lots of crucial funding um in offices of the EERE Office of Science um the skinny budget proposals um are significant cuts to these areas i just want to uh make you aware of this and ask you about what what actions you could take to ensure that the lab and all our labs actually throughout the country uh have the resources necessary to continue all their important work yeah and I think that was basically the criterion in developing the budget we don't want to shrink or stop any of the critical research in our national labs you know from cyber security that that PNA is so strong at to you know fusion energy to advanced computing artificial intelligence basic fundamental physics all of these things will go on virtually unimpacted we had had certainly over the last several years a growth of what I would sort of call political science we want you to work on this problem because it's part of our messaging or it's part of our campaign universities have been overrun with science that you know politically sounds good so students drift into that and we're seeing a shrinkage of the percent of people in technology that are in sort of hard fundamental basic technology that enables everything else and so this is really and this is together with the labs to kind of just not touch the hard science not touch the basic science not touch the stuff we did 10 years ago or 30 years ago or going to do 10 years from now but to trim out the the the fluff that that we've been working on so I I I think the future of our natural labs is very bright and that and the scientific and and and substantiative output from the labs will not be reduced good again thanks for coming to the committee we look forward to having you come out to the state of Washington thank you thank you Representative New thank you Mr" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="i want to talk today uh about operation spiderweb this was the operation out of the Ukrainian uh military the special operatives in Ukraine that put 117 drones into either four or five you know military airplane installations deep into Russia and uh and very successfully targeted those drones at weak points in uh more than 40 aircraft uh bombers primarily and destroyed about $7 billion dollar about 34% of Russia's aircraft with these drones and the reason that I want to talk about that is twofold today one is that that's uh a gamecher in the war of Russia on Ukraine but also because it's a gamecher in war strategies themselves this is a really big deal and when I say really big deal so you think about the history of warfare different technologies dramatically change warfare so for example in the American Civil War which is the war I know best um the the all of the tactics stopped being operative uh in that war because the United States began to manufacture in high numbers rifles and the difference between a rifle and a musket is that a rifle actually has inside the barrel sort of a bead that enables a bullet an elongated bullet to spin as it as it fires and those longer bullets that could spin as they fired were um so much more accurate that it was rather like throwing a fast ball versus a knuckle ball and that meant that artillery became far more I'm sorry that rifles became far and artillery became far more accurate than they had ever been before so it's a real gamecher um the the similarly the concept of total war in that war changes the way people think about war well in the case of operation spiderweb the reason it matters in the um in the struggle between Russia and Ukraine is this first of all in 1994 with the Budapest memorandum uh the United Kingdom the United States and Russia guaranteed to Ukraine protection of its sovereignty that they would not invade either economically or invade so the Ukraine's sovereignty on the condition that Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons it did so and it was supposed to have this protection of its sovereignty but Russia broke that in 2014 when it invaded Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and there's a now a bridge to that to that peninsula called the Kersh bridge I'll tell you more about in a second but so when Russia um invaded Crimea the United States stood behind Ukraine and put sanctions on Russia started to equip the Russian milit I'm sorry the Ukraan Ukrainian military and so on and that was a bipartisan support for Ukraine after the 2014 invasion that's one of the reasons that Russia got involved in the 2016 American presidential um race because they wanted those sanctions taken off and they wanted um some some the the the incoming American president if it were Donald Trump to sort of wink as they tried to take over the four or they did take over the four eastern oblasts of Ukraine so um the United States has always stood on the side since then has stood on the side of Ukraine but Donald Trump changed that when he went into office pretty dramatically changing it on February 28th 2025 when he had Ukrainian President Wimir Zalinski into the Oval Office and he and JD Van sort of blindsided him and made it very clear that they were siding with Russia they kept saying you don't have the cards if you remember that saying and a lot of people were really horrified that the United States was was pretty openly supporting Russia in its attack on Ukraine rather than what we had traditionally done so in in the moment that we're in now so what happened after that is that um Ukraine um and and European countries began to work together to try and make up the slack that the United States was now the scope that it was now giving to Russia but at the same time Ukraine began to um to say &quot;Okay,&quot; to Donald Trump &quot;Okay you want a ceasefire we're behind a ceasefire.&quot; They agreed to a ceasefire i think it was March 11th um and and of course Vladimir Putin who is the president of Russia has simply refused to do that in fact he has increased the bombing of Ukraine both with aerial bombing and with drones even as he claimed to be talking about a ceasefire with Donald Trump so Trump has been sort of saying he's frustrated but at the same time he's not doing anything to to make Russia come to the table to do things like sanctions now interestingly enough in the Senate there is a bipartisan move there are 80 there are now 80 senators from both parties that are co-sponsoring tighter sanctions or higher sanctions on Russia but until Donald Trump gets behind it there's no point to push that forward so they currently are not but the reason I just set all that up is that's where things stood until June 1st when Operation Spiderweb which is the name of this operation to send these drones into uh behind very deep into Russia and to hit military targets as opposed to the civilian targets that the Russians have been hitting in Ukraine this is a gamecher because the United States was not informed that this was happening and what it did was it illustrated to the Russians that the Ukrainians could bring the war home to them and you're seeing in a number of places people saying &quot;Oh it's like it's it's Russia's Pearl Harbor.&quot; But it's really not because America's Pearl Harbor which was December 7th of 1941 the United States was not involved in World War II when that happened it got involved and the timing I actually did out the months today it's rather as if America had a Pearl Harbor in January of 1945 when it had already been involved in that war for more than three years so this was a really big sign of Russia's vulnerability and then today the Ukrainians hit the Kersh um not as in such a damaging way but again demonstrating that they can hit crucial targets and they have those are both very symbolic the attack on the aircraft was on a Russian military holiday and and Putin always likes to hit things on special days to him and the Kersh bridge is something that Putin feels very strongly about that's sort of one of his babies so what they were doing for this moment is to say you know you might want to get yourselves to the the bargaining table because we could we got a lot of stuff up our sleeves all right so that's why it matters in terms of Russia and Ukraine but in terms of the war strategy of countries going forward the drones that the Ukrainians used to hit 7 billion dollar worth of aircraft cost between $600 and $1,000 a piece now you do that math what this has shown is the extraordinary power of asymmetric warfare that's when those sides aren't even and uh so long as one side is very adaptable has quick technology and has really good intelligence so all of a sudden all of the countries that have just been pouring their energies into having the most stuff the most hardware um including the United States which you know the Donald Trump administration wants to put $1 trillion into the US military much of it into hardware uh are looking at the fact that this group of very agile um very uh secretive because they didn't let it out for 18 months operatives managed to destroy almost 35% and again we don't know for sure because you never really know the numbers in warfare and different sides exaggerate or downplay their numbers and so on and so forth the they demonstrated that with ex an extremely small inlay of money and the use of um technology and intelligence they were able to do have this major major strike against a a major military power and that all of a sudden if you were following this at all today it's been a fascinating day because all sorts of people who are interested in war strategy are like you know we knew this moment was coming but we it's just weird to see it and that's one of the reasons that I'm calling it out now is because again when you teach the American Civil War for example you cannot teach that war without talking about the importance of rifles and of artillery it changes everything and you know you get the the these different technological moments that change warfare and this is one of them so it's it's I just wanted to call it out because it's um it's a you know it's a gamecher not only for the geopolitical structure right now between uh Russia and Ukraine but also for how countries prepare for war going forward so I wanted to call that out just so that people are watching that i'm not suggesting things are going to happen tomorrow but those of us who are going to be watching going to be lucky enough to be watching this for the next generation and I'm obviously not at my age they're going to write this in the history books as here's a day that really mattered because it illustrated what you can do with technology and intelligence in the modern world with with the capabilities that we now have to have in this case piloted drones uh that operated underneath the air defenses of Russia because they were able to use uh intelligence essentially and to use the civilian population to deliver those drones to write outside the airfields if you're interested in this as you can tell I am there are now pictures available from uh the BBC at the very least there may be more those were the ones I was looking at of the drones that were actually put inside the roofs of wooden structures cabins that the Ukrainians had delivered by truck drivers to the sites where they needed them as if they were actually mobile homes and to me to my eyes they look for all the world like like like bats nestled in the crawl spaces of an attic i mean they they're literally drones they look like drones but they're kind of nestled in there it's It's just a as a historian you can tell I'm sort of gobsmacked that the to have seen this day um because you don't usually get to watch history change in you know in the news in front of you and this did" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="the play follows um Mary Todd Lincoln in the weeks  leading up to her husband's assassination and this   is not a Mary Todd Lincoln we would have learned  about in high school not that most people I don't   know where you went i don't know where you went  yeah um no this is um this is my interpretation of   uh what happened what really happened you've said  that this is basically your story mhm what do you   mean i mean it's about someone who is it's about  someone who has a dream well it's about all the   characters um have dreams that no one around them  understands and every character has um a passion   that is deeply embarrassing to them so she is this  Mary Todd Lincoln is an aspiring cabaret star yeah   a former cabaret performer aspiring to get back  into um cabaret meanwhile her husband is just   wrapping up the civil war right and so he's more  concerned with um keeping the country together you   know he's he's very unpopular at this point which  I believe is actually true from history hated him   half the North did hate him as well right and and  when he mentions the South Mary says &quot;The South   of what?&quot; Um Yeah because she's focused she's  focused she's got a goal she's got a goal she's   got a a a passion and um you know there there is a  I I glibly uh say that you know I did no research   for this and you know and that's just sort of my  um talk show anecdote but I I I was inspired by   um stuff that I read about her about um she would  come to New York to go on shopping sprees and the   nation was furious with her because she was  you you know they were in the middle of a war   and she was coming to New York spending all this  money on furniture and clothing to redecorate and   um I just really related to that to that kind of  kind of mania or Yeah partly mania but also what   else what was she supposed to do mhm she like just  stay in the house like No no no no like you need   to like um you need to act like you're deeply  serious i I I don't know like she you know it   was just like stay in this cage and um act the  part of uh first lady or go to New York and go   you know and run up the credit card debt just  buying stuff yeah and so almost as if there was   something more honest about that or Yeah yeah i  mean what did how did we all cope during you know   quarantine like right ordering stuff online  you know um running up credit card bills to   you know get some sort of TikTok foot massager  that everyone was raving about for seven seconds   um yeah but that's that's interesting that that  little kernel of information those shopping sprees   that kind of some would say extreme behavior  you found compelling yeah yeah as a you know   also a recovering addict alcoholic myself like I  um you know just those sort of coping mechanisms   um are so relatable right yeah and and so you're  not joking when you say this is really your story   no no I I I mean it like all of the things  that that she feels are all things that I   still feel or have felt and um you know all of the  characters are are different parts of me i think   that's true for any writer that you know they  they those things have to come from somewhere   and they're not just pulled from thin air so yeah  I mean she has a quest here she has a quest right   yeah cabaret right and is that is that something  you can relate to this idea that quest that drive um Yeah yeah i I I think I'm a little more um  self-conscious and afraid of admitting my I mean   even even the way that I I I've been talking  about like well I'm not really an actor it's   like well meanwhile you're acting on Broadway Cole  so what is this like no shrinking violet sort of   like no I'm I'm not really I don't really act you  know yeah meanwhile I'm I care so much i care so   deeply i'm on my days off I'm watching interviews  of Zoe Caldwell and Marian Seldes and and and you   know like writing things down and then sitting  down with you being like well I don't really act   you know yeah well I mean it's because the show in  many parts is broad it's outrageous but you don't   get laughs like that unless the timing is precise  yeah yeah yeah yeah we We really have to stay on   top of timing um and and just keeping the show  tight and um I check the stage manager's report   every night and see you know how long was the show  and like okay was the audience reaction did that   really justify this extra minute that we've added  on and yeah and for those who don't understand a   show of this length I think it's about an hour and  and it's like 80 minutes um 85-ish but more closer   it should be it should be 82 and that And and this  is this is not just silly talk here that really   matters it really matters and you know like of  course there's um if the audience is particularly   responsive you have to wait for some of those  laughs to crest and so that does add a little   time but like you know I I can tell when um it's  when the time doesn't match the audience response   so when did you come up with the idea in 2009 um I  sent an email to myself that said &quot;What if Abraham   Lincoln's assassination wasn't such a bad thing  for Mary Todd?&quot; But then I think at that point   the idea was more like sort of a Nancy Meyers  sort of like my second chapter you know like Mary   starting over like now I'm single I can date you  know um but then the really great furniture right   the great furniture yes beige beige beige beige  like I loved this idea so much i didn't want it   to get on paper and for it it to disappoint me  to disappoint me not just the audience but like   me yeah um which I think a lot of writers  can relate to like there are certain ideas   that you're just like &quot;Oh I don't want to plant  this seed because what if it's an ugly flower?&quot;   Yeah so this is not a revival it's it's an  original play it's not based on a movie it has no   Hollywood stars it is breaking speak for yourself  please it's breaking box office records what does   that say says that um inflation is high that's all  it says and that ticket prices are outrageous and   that ticket prices are outrageous i I think  I don't know i I'm always like well when you   account for inflation are we really breaking box  office records you know like I don't know but the   point is it's a hit but the point is it's it's a  big hit and I don't know i I I don't want to lead   you anywhere um but does it say something about  being is the word uncompromising or I don't know   being true to your vision and not you know I want  to use this line it's a crowd-pleaser but there's   nothing crowdsourced about it right who who said  that i'm saying it i want to jam it into somehow   i already have but it's true though there's no You  don't come to see the show and go &quot;Oh there were   layers and layers of development people that  were saying &quot;No you've got to tweak it for this   audience and do this for that audience.&quot; No and I  I I like Yeah there is there is something special   about the fact that I I wrote this like like I I  said like just for me and my friends and for the   the my audience that I've had in downtown venues  and stuff and the fact that it's successful is   um I don't know it makes it that much  sweeter it really does but we you know   um it could have gone the other way like  you know like it could have been it could   have tanked and then it we would be having  the conversation of like well you've got   to compromise a little bit and let you know it's  just there's no accounting for taste right right   yeah so there was never a time where you thought  I need to be more like this person to make people   respond to me no i mean because if if it has to  be funny to me it would be like trying to speak   um German when I don't actually know any German  you know like I I it has to make me laugh in   order for it to even have a chance of making  someone else laugh right because the audience   can sniff out Yeah probably they've got good  noses right yeah right so you've always been   that way i think so yeah yeah where did you  grow up rural Oregon clatsky Oregon birthplace   of Give me Wait wait uh Ray Bolger no uh uh  Ray Bradbury closer okay uh Ray Ray um Walston ray wait it's a Oregon rural dark uh uh uh  alcoholic bu alcoholic or bucolic alcoholic   and bucolic so an alcoholic rural Oregonian yes  um uh Ray ray oh god this is so embarrassing it's   It's not Ray Bradbury it's Ray um what's the  first letter raymond Carver ray marman Carver   right yeah okay yeah who I actually um I  actually see a lot of um similarities in   us are you serious yeah yeah yeah so uh just  um I mean alcoholism and uh the the sort of um just the sort of dark confusion over uh and  and rejection of of um conventions um I don't know   yeah I just I do feel a spiritual sort of  connection and what kind of a town is it or   was it um it it's gone now i'm kidding oh my god  they're going to come after me um it uh it's it's   about like 1,800 people um it's in the middle of  the woods basically it's the If you've ever gone   from Portland to the coast you've probably stopped  for gas there um gray rainy um home and is it true   that your family lived in a trailer okay from  what no that I'm I'm afraid is a lie that I the   an MGM put out to uh build my story no I um yeah  we when I was um uh maybe five years old um my   father chased us out of the home with a a shotgun  he was having some sort of alcoholic manic break   and thought that there were people after him and  so he chased my mother my brother and I out of the   trailer and then we moved out and didn't come back  and at that point did you start spending a lot   more time with your grandmother yes yeah we moved  in with my grandmother and you know it it's that   weird like childhood thing of like at the time I  was like &quot;Oh yay we get to go live at grandma's   house.&quot; So then her and I shared a bedroom and  I remember that's when she taught me to read and   um That's a big deal yeah i mean yeah yeah right  yeah and I I loved she had Alzheimer's and she was   um uh in the beginning stages of of of Alzheimer's  so she would repeat stories a lot and um but I   loved them i loved her stories and um uh I realize  now that we were when she would tell these stories   we were like meeting in the middle of of of her  memory like she was living out the fantasy of her   childhood and I was also living out my fantasy  of being a young girl on a farm in Alberta and   so I don't know i I I it's um And you didn't mind  that she was repeating the story no no it was like   I loved it and um because she would remember  certain details in a new telling or like leave   something out and then I got to be like you know  and you were wearing a dress right Grandma and   um Yeah and is it right that she gave she gave  you a Barbie when you were five yeah she gave   me my first Barbie she was very Maybe it was a a  symptom of her dementia um but but just completely   took me at at face value there was nothing like  when I was doing something that wasn't like not   what boys were supposed to do you know you saw  some apprehension apprehension or concern or   like you know looking around to make sure you know  no one was looking but she just accepted at face   value yeah when I was 11 years old I um got my  booked my first professional acting job in Grapes   of Wrath at Long View Stage Works and I played  Winfield Joad um I had uh two lines um hello and   ma look over there and God my voice rang out when  I did that i was about to say you were there you   Did you project like that as a kid i think  I'm sure I did i'm sure I did and I also   was really proud i came up with this one bit  the the family is saying grace and one day I   um you know like opened one eye and snuck a piece  of food off of my plate um coming up with some   comic stage business business that's right yeah i  love that a bit um but it was in a town that was   like 30 miles away from my home and like during  tech week you know late nights um my mom couldn't   come pick me up so I stayed at my grandmother's  nursing home with her and um that was so odd i   I I wonder now like what the rest of the cast of  adults thought like they would give me rides after   and I wonder what they thought dropping me off  at a nursing home right right and I know one of   them was buying you meals yeah the the woman that  played Rose of Sharon her name was Susan oh god um everyone's crying in interviews nowadays um  uh I think we all just want to feel something but she yeah she bought me food every day and  um at the time I didn't think anything of   it i thought you know well I'm I'm the  star of the show of course she's buying   me food yeah like I was just so taken  care of by all these actresses teachers   um all these these people growing up that  you know I look back and I I I'm like I I   was like like Mr magoo you know like all  these people just sort of like pushing me   on to the the right path like taking care of  me and and yeah I have a question um uh for   those who don't understand and want to understand  would you explain why you use they them pronouns um I have always felt not male not female and you  know it I it's funny because there are recently   I saw um like photos of me on on Instagram for  like uh I can't remember if it was Vogue or GQ   or one of these other publications but um the  comments were like you know like like what is   that like that's not a man well it sure as hell  ain't a woman either and I was like exactly like   you do get it but it's not about getting it  it's about power over like wanting to hurt   me for not fitting into uh I don't know  the boxes they have to be in you know i I I sort of I I just sort of bristle when I when I read  him in in in print or like young young man or   or boy or whatever in in reference to myself  it just sort of takes me a second to like be   like &quot;Oh me that's me.&quot; Um but you know now that  they them pronouns are are um more of a thing more   in usage I was like that that fits me more um  that feels more in line with how I see myself   um you know I'm not someone who's who's like  angry when when people get it wrong um I certainly   understand when when people do feel hurt by that  um for me it's more of a a a clarification than an   identity i sort of see myself outside  of gender really and so I don't feel like militant about um you know the proper  pronouns but I'm also afraid of getting it wrong   being like a spokesperson for other people you  know I I I can't speak for everyone and I I do get   afraid of of um speaking about my experience with  with gender and you know using they them pronouns   and and somehow misrepresenting how other people  feel this is this is your experience this is my   story and my life and I'm going to live it the way  I want um it it it's more like oh that's an option   i'm going to use that one thank you so after you  moved to New York you had some you had some pretty   lean years i mean you you were dressing up as  Clifford the Red Dog yes at one point was that   right for fun uh no i worked at the Scholastic  bookstore in Soho i played Clifford the Big Red   Dog at children's birthday parties and I was a  a cashier um and then I was mugged and beaten um   twice in in one month the second time at gunpoint  and then the second time was was really like very   serious oh very very serious one guy um you know  they knocked me to the ground and one guy held a   gun to my head while the other guy like kicked my  teeth in to the point that they were loose and I   had to go to the hospital and I I I didn't really  know anyone in New York at that point i had like   two friends who I was you know um vaguely close  with that uh it was it was a really bad time so I   left New York you went back to Oregon went back to  Oregon i lived on my mother's couch long enough to   see Jane Seymour on Dancing with the Stars did she  win i don't think so okay um but I know her mother   died and she um and the show went on and she did  a Was it a fox trot or a waltz in her honor i   think it was a I don't know it was an apostoite i  don't think it was a posado you have fact checkers   organization a ticker at the bottom um uh I was  I was going to go back to community college there   but actually I I stepped on you right there here's  that thought but you you mean that like that Jane   Seymour went on even though her mother had died  yes could you continue that thought sir no i just   remember that was one of the things that I was um  watching at the time i would um I was obviously   like in shock and going through a lot um and um  that's all I really remember is watching so it   wasn't like you were inspired no no no no i'm so  sorry we're not going to use that would have been   great i thought it was I thought if she can if  she can waltz I can get back to New York jane oh   my god she's here yeah you flew her in because you  knew this story um I I'm going back a little bit   more in time because I missed one thing I wanted  to get to which is when you were a kid in Oregon   did Broadway seem like another planet yeah it it  it was never even a possibility like you might   Yeah you might as well have said the moon and the  moon was at least I could see at night you know   it's so rare that I get to ask this on CBS Sunday  Morning but you've been described as a demon twink   um what is that and do you You interviewed Mitzy  Gaynor i did well okay you didn't ask her about   being a demon twink right i you know I should  have and it's too late now but um but but but what   is a demon twink and and and do you accept the  charge um that is for the critics to decide and   uh for the Tony voters to decide um whether or  not I'm a demon twink I you know I that's not   a label one can give oneself right and you know  usually I would end this interview asking what's   next for Cole Escola but instead I'm going to  ask you who's the next first lady you're going   to play oh my god um I I I think the next thing  that I do will have to be so different from from   this but if I was forced if it was like you have  to choose from these first ladies was it um uh   Buchanan's first lady that was his niece harriet  Lane Buchanan was his niece yes right because he   was our only bachelor president confirmed bachelor  president and I've been to his house you have yeah   oh yeah we sure Fire Island that's his summer  house his regular house is Wheatland it's in   Lancaster Pennsylvania and he has an outhouse with  five holes i'm telling you it's completely true   this place is But it's a nice house but I mean  that's fascinating to me like First Niece you know   there's sort of an Emily in Paris quality i That  doesn't sound like a play to me that's more of   like a miniseries like like Harriet Lane Buchanan  in London okay yeah i helped give you that idea   did you it's on tape okay this is it it's not home  but it's much yeah did you design this no um Amy   Sedaris um decorated this oh careful um uh Amy  Sedaris and Liz Wolf who owns Cure Thrift Shop   uh decorated this whole thing like um uh I said I  wanted like a 30s actress dressing room it feels   like like something you could picture Glynis  Johns in um and Amy was really disappointed   cuz she wanted to do she wanted to make it a sick  room like a hospital bed um yeah does this look   anything like the dressing rooms in theaters  depicted in those early Hollywood movies you   would watch this feels like something I could see  um a uh you know Ginger Rogers character or a Ruby   Keeler whatever um except for this Amy Sedaris  touch my um my inspiration here my um Marie   Dressler memoir um Billie Burke and Yeah so Marie  Dressler Billie Burke these were big stars at one   point big stars yeah and um so this isn't just a  goop like you really No I I I love um love them i   I've read these books there's this section in here  about her first time on Broadway i pinch myself   black and blue but I cannot make myself believe it  is my name up there in Letters of Fire maybe the   miracle is real but it's too hard to credit marie  Dressler a great gawk of a nobody from the sticks   a star on the street of stars that is a great line  I just love that line marie Dressler a great gawk   of a nobody of a gawk of a nobody oh my god I love  that i want that in the piece yeah like I love" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="the broadway theater has produced some of the greatest entertainers in the world and as the times have changed so has the performer what they have in common is a magnetic quality that draws the audience in it emanates from their talent the aura they cast from the stage or across the screen naturally yours truly has their own favorite performers people who at one time or another i might have obsessed over you know when you went to the library and signed out all of their cast albums in bulk when you stayed up late to record their three and a half minute letterman performance on vhs or in the dead of new york winter when you stormed the stage door of the marquee theater to get a picture with them after the show yeah i don't know if i have a favorite i don't have a top ten a top five those sorts of things actually really stress me out but if i were to have a favorite audrey mcdonald would be right up there i know i briefly talked about her in a previous episode but i think audra deserves her very own episode the accomplishments of this woman are both impressive and inspiring and since 2020 has been a dumpster fire of the year i think we should finish it off with a bit of inspiration if i say so myself audrey mcdonald's career has been defined by memorable and iconic broadway performances countless awards and accolades and an ability to navigate through different mediums with seeming ease this unique and singular career is the result of a unique and singular path that she has forged through the merits of her talent a commitment to her craft and her advocacy for equality in the theater community and for the world at large in this episode i'm going to be talking about audra mcdonald her peculiar path to broadway and how her work in the entertainment industry continues to break barriers and forge new opportunities for the next generation when you think of audra mcdonald one of the first things that comes to mind is her voice her clear and classically trained lyric soprano that soars one moment then coos gently with assured and controlled ease she appears just as comfortable in any opera house or concert hall as she would be on the broadway stage audra mcdonald's mammoth talent is simply too special to be confined to one art form one wonders what her younger self might have thought if she knew where her career would take her audra mcdonald was raised in fresno california growing up in a musical household she fell in love with broadway music to harness her hyperactive energy audra's parents helped her get involved with the local theater scene and by her teens she was performing regularly in dinner theater productions like the wiz and evita i decided i wanted to be an actress and a musical theater actress and my voice teacher at the time i was kind of studying and he would say sing this r and be like no i'm going to belt you know and i was always trying to belt everything out so yeah so he said come on just why don't you try and audition for juilliard just to see what it's like just to see what the operatic program would be like i said okay it'll be a nice trip to new york and and you know my mom will pay for it cool i'll do it and i sang a soprano aria and i told them i was a mezzo soprano and i did some optional ending just things you're not supposed to do at all in classical music and they laughed at me at my audition and then they asked me they said how old are you and i said well i'm 17 and they just laughed again and i thought well i blew this but to her own surprise she was accepted making the move to new york city audra's time at juilliard was difficult to say the least often finding herself at odds with teachers who pushed her to find the operatic side of her voice in classical voice programs the quality of the voice is most often the first concern and considerations of acting are cast secondary while many institutions today take acting components much more seriously this fundamental shift in audra's training caused her tremendous anxiety even though she was living in the city she had always wanted to be in i just wanted a ticket to new york it's a tough school it is a very very tough school and i was it was tough for me especially because i was there uh in this classical program and not wanting to be there i was in the wrong place and i could see broadway you know from my dorm room and what was i doing you know singing in italian things got so bad audra suffered a mental breakdown and attempted suicide she has always credited juilliard for their support during her recovery granting her permission to take a sabbatical from her studies rather than just dismissing her she has also credited specific teachers at the school who supported her inherent talent teachers like ellen fall a retired opera singer who had vocally trained broadway performers like gwen verdin and sarah brightman ellen fall would help keep her head in the game as otter would later put it assuring her that whatever paths she chose after juilliard a classical technique would do her well in her career during audra sabbatical from juilliard she auditioned and was cast in the ensemble for the national tour of the secret garden eventually transferring to the new york production where she made her broadway debut before graduating from juilliard in 1993 but it was her next broadway show that would make audiences and critics take note of her [Music] british director nicholas heitner cast audra in the 1994 broadway revival of rogers and hammerstein's carousel in the role of carrie pitbridge david richards of the new york times called audra's performance in carousel the real find in this production commending her voice and her comedy most critics didn't make mention of a black actress playing a role traditionally played by a white one though there were inevitably others who found the casting problematic i talk about this in episode 4 so i won't go into it much more here but when asked on certain critics citing issue with the non-traditional casting audra said it's a universal story with universal music if these people are concentrating on the fact that i'm black well there's nothing i can do about it [Music] audra's tony award for best featured actress in a musical was obviously validation from a majority of members from the american theater wing and the broadway league but a tony award does not always bring forth more work and this is especially true for performers of color in the broadway theater the new york times reported that in 1994 minorities accounted for 15 percent of broadway performers and besides carousel the broadway production of miss saigon that was running at the time accounted for about half of that 15 and if you remember episode 4 there are some problems with the representation in that show so while carousel was a great breakout opportunity for audra the american musical theater at that time didn't foretell any great promise for her audra's next opportunity would come from a play inspired by the master classes held by maria kalas at the juilliard school back in the 1970s terence mcnally's master class has madame kalas coach three opera voice students interjecting at times to reminisce about the ups and downs of her career the final student is sharon entering the stage near the end of the play the role wasn't written specifically for audra but when it came to playing a talented ambitious and misunderstood opera student there may have been a few things she could relate to in masterclass she showed off even more of her seismic range and classical technique but masterclass also showed audra off to be an intuitive actress one that could hold her own on stage with greats like zoe caldwell you will believe women can have balls sharon some women yes i do their dears daring you to show us yours will you do it yes audra's performance and master class would garner her second tony award in 1996 this time for best featured actress in a play i i need to thank uh the en entire family of juilliard the juilliard school for whom without i i would not have been able to be as neurotic of a student as i was in master class so thank you to juilliard at 26 audrey was starting to be recognized for the diversity of her talent and musical theater writers wanted to write for her in the summer of 1995 just before the broadway opening of masterclass audra flew to toronto to take part in the first workshop productions of a new musical based on the novel by el doctoro ragtime which was produced by this guy featured a book by terence mcnally and a score by stephen flaherty and lynn ahrens while performing in masterclass would keep audrey from taking part in the next two workshops audra was invited to originate the role of sarah brown first in the premier production in toronto in december 1996 followed by the broadway premiere in january 1998 ragtime was in a word huge boasting an enormous cast grand set designs the show actually ran in a newly built theater on 42nd street all financed by garth drubinski and his company livened many broadway insiders speculated how drabinsky was able to successfully finance all of this which of course we now know he wasn't regardless of the show business drama ragtime was one of those once in a lifetime shows that boasted an embarrassment of broadway talent for her third featured role on broadway audra mcdonald won her third tony award she would round out the rest of 1998 by releasing her debut album featuring songs from then emerging musical theater writers like adam gettle jason robert brown and michael john lacuza audra had actually auditioned for lacuza back in 1993 and based on that audition he set out to write a musical for her the culminating piece was marie christine a retelling of the medea story set in new orleans in the 19th century the show opened for a limited run at broadway's lincoln center at the end of 1999 while lincoln center gave the show an open-ended option the show's mixed reviews eliminated this possibility before opening the show some had questioned audra's ability to helm a lead role on broadway but her performance in marie christine became the show's central praise in his review for the new york times ben brantley said when audra mcdonald sings her first notes as the medea-like heroine of marie christine there is clearly sorcery at work the commitment conviction and full-strength talent she brings to the evening becomes its own argument for the endurance of the american musical after receiving a leading actress nomination for her work on marie christine audra spent the next few years establishing herself in film and television one of her first notable roles on tv was as grace farrell in disney's adaptation of the musical annie the film was well received though apparently there were some people at disney who felt nervous showing daddy warbucks proposing marriage to his black assistant but one of audra's best appearances during this time was an hbo's adaptation of margaret edson's play wit in wit she plays suzy a hospital nurse put in charge of the care of vivian baring a stern and armored woman undergoing treatment for virulent cancer while audiences may have been used to audra's expressive and grand performances on the stage her performance in wit demonstrates a subtle but confident presence on camera the slightest shift in her face says so much without her having to speak a word her scenes with emma thompson are charged alive and for me a highlight of this movie if you haven't seen it i cannot recommend it enough in 2003 audrey was approached to play the role of ruth younger in a broadway revival of the play a raisin in the sun which came attached with grammy winning rapper puff daddy or pee diddy diddy puffy now let's just call him sean combs he was fully committed to playing the role of walter lee younger originated on stage by sidney poitier along with felicia rashad who had been approached to play the role of lena younger archer mcdonald was apprehensive felicia rashad and i fought it we didn't want to do it yeah we were like freezing in the sun come on i mean yeah everybody does raising in the sun you know it's just mama on the couch and then when shawn got cast we really got concerned we didn't understand audra mcdonald and felicia rashad met with sean combs and director kenny leon to discuss the revival which would put raisin in the sun back on the broadway stage for the first time in over 40 years a raisin in the sun was written by lorraine hansberry with the play's premiere in 1959 she became the first female black writer produced on broadway we live in a nation where everything which is talked about is talked about in terms of the fact that we are going to be the mightiest the toughest the roughest cats going you know in the whole world and when a negro says something about i'm tired i can't stand it no i want to hit somebody you say that we're sitting here panting and ranting for violence you know that's not right a raisin in the sun tells the story of the younger family following the death of the family patriarch the youngers are presented with the opportunity to leave their cramped kitchenette apartment in the south side of chicago and move into a house in claiborne park a white neighborhood among its many themes a raisin in the sun explores the limitations of the american dream as experienced by black americans i wouldn't read the script again i think it was by the time i got to ruth's big explosion when she finds out that they're going to move that i thought i am a fool i have to do this i have to do this and then to bring in the audiences that we brought in and these people would be loud before the show started getting for a couple minutes into it and then by the end of the show they were quiet as a mouse they were they were standing and applauding they were crying and this was an introduction to theater for them so for me the whole experience once again me running from this experience it turned out to be you know life-altering for me and it was the hardest character i've ever played maybe it's because there were so many things about her that were too close to me that i had a hard time finding the 2004 revival of a raisin and the sun brought this american classic to a whole new generation a few years later audrey mcdonald would return to the stage in the reimagining of another american classic the gershwin's porgy and bess is considered by many to be america's greatest opera at the same time the piece has been subject to controversy since its premier in 1935. the classification of its score has been debated time and time again but more crucially the opera's depiction of african americans has long drawn criticism facing accusations of misogynistic and racist stereotypes after a series of workshops commissioned by the gershwin estates in 2011 audra mcdonald was cast in the role of bess in diane paulus's new production of porgy and bess the production hired playwright susan laurie parks to adapt the piece for a contemporary audience it's a show with some dramatic holes you know some some missteps dramatically i have to make it right i have to flesh out the characters from the very beginning we were setting out to make sure that this is about these people and their struggles and their story and really focusing on on the dramatic story as opposed to look at all those black people up there boy they sing well and oh they get passionate and you know and then they kill and you know and they drink the whiskey and they smoke the you know whatever patrick healy of the new york times visited rehearsals leading up to the pre-broadway tryout in boston his article recounting what he saw that may have sensationalized the revival's planned changes prompted steven sondheim to write a scathing letter that accused audra mcdonald among others for having no respect for the history of the piece the letter that ran in the new york times caused a wave of negative press ahead of the show's out-of-town tryout it would prompt a number of investors to drop out endangering the show's broadway transfer in spite of this negative press porgy and best did successfully make the move to broadway in january 2012. while critics were divided on the success of the textual and dramatic revisions the production did find an audience and at the tony awards that year it was awarded best revival of a musical and for her performance audra mcdonald was awarded best leading actress in a musical this was her fifth tying with angela lansbury and julie harris for the most tony wins in february 2014 it was announced that audra mcdonald would return to broadway that spring in laney robertson's play lady day at emerson's bar and grill in the role of billy holliday over the course of the past year audra had quietly workshopped the play with director lonnie price who had brought the piece to her the two had previously worked together on the 2007 broadway revival of 110 in the shade and a concert staging of sweeney todd with the new york philharmonic after a successful backers audition producer jeffrey richards gave the green light setting a broadway opening for april this is billie holiday performing on television in 1958 [Music] seemingly this performer and her very distinctive voice has little in relation with audra mcdonald which would make her eventual transformation all the more [Music] [Music] impressive [Music] set in 1959 just four months before her death the play takes place in a seedy philadelphia nightclub during one of billy's performances broke and riddled by addiction she struggles to get through the performance at times recounting stories from her life audra's transformation into billy is uncanny the timber of her voice her vocal phrasing that hangs behind the beat her clenched right hand swinging in rhythm to the song she simply channels billie holiday but her performance goes beyond imitation there is just as much of the actress and the role as the character she inhabits while billie holiday is often remembered for her tragic circumstances audra brings a surprising and welcome amount of joy and humor to this role in spite of the bigotry and turbulence she faced in her life audra's billy holliday is a woman who refuses to be seen as a victim or a tragic figure this performance was recorded live in its entirety as an album and for an hbo special after its broadway run the american theater wings tony award goes to audra mcdonald audra's win for best leading actress in a play was her sixth tony win not only winning the most of any performer but being the first to win in all acting categories [Applause] let's be clear audra mcdonald is a legend her massive and diverse body of work is argument enough that she is one of the greatest artists we have today one could see her historic and deserved tony win for lady day as the broadway theater's recognition of this but even with or without these awards and recognitions audra mcdonald is an artist that strives to challenge herself with every new project she takes on for me what attracts me is something most definitely that scares me usually if i'm scared of it i know i have to do it something where i'm going to be challenged something where i feel at the end of the day or the end of the run or the end of the experience i will know more than i did going into it i will be a better actress a better artist doesn't necessarily mean that i will succeed at the role i may not necessarily you know be revelatory in the part or have figured it all out by the end of the run or or you know ever but will i have grown as a result um that's very important to me evolution is very important to me as an artist i feel like you have to continue to evolve as an artist or stop doing it you know from the beginning of audra mcdonald's career she has made tremendous strides for greater representation in the entertainment industry such strides are not easily made but audra has navigated these waves with grace humility and a generous spirit that resonates to her audience and the next generation of performers audra has also used her platform to raise awareness for causes that are close to her she is an ally of the lgbtq community that fiercely advocated for the marriage equality act she serves on the international board of directors for the covenant house that helps homeless youth in need throughout canada latin america and the united states and most recently along with other members of the black theatre community she is co-founded black theater united an organization with a wide range of goals from forcing civic engagement of black and brown communities fighting systemic racism in the theater and breaking barriers through mentorship within the arts for young black artists in her tony speech for lady day audra acknowledged black women in the industry that had preceded her even when being recognized for her own achievements she shares her awareness that they might not have been possible without those who came before her but i want to thank all the shoulders of the strong and brave and courageous women that i am standing on i am standing on lena lena horn's shoulders i'm standing on my anger loose shoulders i'm standing on diane carroll and ruby d and most of all billie holiday you deserved so much more than you were given when you were on this planet this is for you billy thank you so much while we look at audra mcdonald in reverence for all of her past accomplishments we must also remember that we are watching an artist that is still evolving she continues to hone her craft and give voice to what needs to be said even in the dark the world is just a little brighter with audra mcdonald in it i can't wait to see what she does next" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="Welcome to The Daily Show. I'm Ronny Chieng We got so much to talk about tonight. Kristi Noem fails a pop quiz. The FBI wants you to shut up about Jeffrey Epstein already. And while you were stuck at the airport, Sean Duffy did some redecorating. So let's check in with the best cabinet ever in another installment of The Worst Wing. [INSPIRATIONAL MUSIC] # # What a bunch of losers. [LAUGHTER] Let's start with Kristi Noem, secretary of Homeland Security and one-woman kill shelter. She's in charge of the country's pathway to citizenship, which for hundreds of years has been a solemn, dignified process for achieving the American dream. But what if instead, it was tacky and gross? A surreal report that could turn immigration into a TV show. The Trump administration says it's in the very beginning stages of the vetting process for a reported immigrant reality TV show, where immigrants would compete to prove they are the most American with a chance to win US citizenship. A reality TV show for citizenship is somehow the most un-American and most American thing I've ever heard. Although, we already have a contest to prove who's the most American. And it's called the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest. What's more American than eating until your colon explodes and then going bankrupt from medical bills? But let me be clear, I hate this idea-- unless they're looking for a host, then I love this idea. And I'm available on Fridays. I-- [APPLAUSE] I will say, it might be a nicer way to get deported. Instead of ICE agents disappearing you up in unmarked vehicles, Ryan Seacrest walks into your living room with a TV crew and is like, Carlos. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] We're taking you out of the USA. [LAUGHTER] But meanwhile, Kristi Noem was testifying in Congress today about whether her administration is deporting people without habeas corpus, which is their right to due process. If you didn't know what habeas corpus was, don't worry, Kristi Noem didn't google it either. What is habeas corpus? Well, habeas corpus is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country, suspend their right-- Let me stop you, ma'am. Habeas corpus-- excuse me. That's incorrect. [LAUGHTER] OK, look. If Kristi Noem was just a random person on the street, I'd get it if she was like, habeas corpus? That's-- that's a Harry Potter spell, right, like, la, la, la, la? Makes you invisible? But the Secretary of Homeland Security should know that habeas corpus prevents the president from deporting you without due process, not that it lets the president deport you without due process. That's the opposite of what it means. And I didn't know you could have dyslexia for laws. [LAUGHTER] Either way, Noem whiffed hard on that question. But unfortunately for her, the quiz was just beginning. Do you know what section of the Constitution the suspension clause of habeas corpus-- KRISTI NOEM: I do not, nope. Do you know which article it is in? - No, I do not, sir. - OK. Well, it is in Article 1. [LAUGHTER]  It was in 1. It was the first-- you didn't even read the first one. So can you stop? We get it, OK? Stop asking her harder questions. Like, how would senators like it if Kristi Noem asked you questions that she was an expert in, huh? Hey, Senator Kim, do you know how to trick a puppy into walking into an open grave? [LAUGHTER] No? Not so smart, now, are you? Anyway, Kristi Noem, you still don't know the basics of American law. So I'm sorry to say-- [DRAMATIC MUSIC] We're going to have to take you out of USA. But luckily-- [CHEERING]  I know. [APPLAUSE] Won them back after the dog-killing jokes. But luckily for America, Kristi Noem isn't the only one in charge of keeping the country safe. We also got Kash Patel and Dan Bongino, two guys who look like they should be henchmen in a Ninja Turtles movie but are somehow running the FBI now. And before he took over, Dan Bongino wasn't afraid to tell us the truth about what the FBI was covering up. Nobody knows how much material people have on Jeffrey Epstein. It's unbelievable. The guy killed himself. And now nobody's going to know. Yeah, exactly. Epstein killed himself? Bleh. Bongino knows the truth. And now he and Kash Patel get to see all the files. So on Sunday, they sat down for an interview to tell us what really happened. Because we know Epstein didn't just kill himself. He killed himself. [LAUGHTER]  What? He-- he killed himself without air quotes? That is the craziest thing I've ever heard, all right? I was a single-issue voter on this. Why did you change your mind? As a public defender, as a prosecutor who's been in that prison system, who's been in the Metropolitan Detention Center, who's been in segregated housing, you know a suicide when you see one. And that's what that was. Again, you want me to-- I've seen the whole file. He killed himself. I've never seen someone so sad that the deep state didn't kill someone. And also, hey, you can't talk so much shit about how the deep state did this and make it your entire personality. And then now you're in it, and you're like, just shrugging it off, like, uh, yeah, I guess they were right the first time they investigated this. Hey. If you fail that hard, you got to let Hillary Clinton kill you, right? And finally-- [CHEERING] Yeah. I don't know what we're cheering for. [LAUGHTER] And finally, let's talk about the Department of Transportation. Recently, air travel in America has become what's known in the industry as totally [BLEEP]. And I'm sure Secretary Sean Duffy has been working on a great plan to fix it. We are moving Jesus out of the basement. [AUDIENCE MURMURING] What? [LAUGHTER] What, is that the new air traffic controller? Because that's what we need right now. To all the great midshipmen at the Merchant Marine Academy, you let me know how important this painting was to all of you. Now, we all know it was taken out of a place of prominence and put in down in the basement. I've worked with the academy. And because this is such a historic painting, I'm announcing that through that work with the academy, this painting is going to go from the basement back to its place of prominence. It'll be a moment to celebrate. [CLAPS] Oh, thank God. [CHEERING]  No, no. No. No, thank God. Because when my plane is going down, I can tell the person next to me, don't worry. There's a shitty Jesus painting. It's upstairs at the Merchant Marine Academy now. For more on the return of the Jesus painting, let's go live to the painting and hear from the king of kings himself, Jesus Christ. [CHEERING]  Hello, my child. Wait, hang on. Jesus, you're white? I mean, I thought the real Jesus was, like, Middle Eastern or something. Uh, well, I can take any form I wish. And this particular one gets me through airport security faster. Oh, right. Of course. But-- oh, hey, Your Majesty, Sean-- Sean Duffy is taking you out of the basement. I mean, you got to be happy about that. No. No, I'm not happy about it. There's plenty of other things to be worried about right now. Planes are falling out of the sky. Boats are crashing into the Brooklyn Bridge. Newark Airport killed itself. I mean-- [LAUGHTER] --not to brag, but when I was on Earth, we had zero plane crashes [LAUGHTER] Uh, yeah. I guess that's technically true. But, um-- hey, at least you can be seen by more people in this historic painting. This shitty painting? [LAUGHTER] The one that looks like it was made at a bachelorette party drink and draw? [LAUGHTER] I've seen better portraits of myself on toast, OK? [LAUGHTER] You think this is how I want to be seen, hovering over a boat full of sailors? Hey, everybody, look, it's that famous painting. Jesus drowns in seamen. No, no, no, no, no. I was fine in the basement. I've had my pictures in worse places-- Irish grandmothers' bedrooms, prison cells, Mexican restaurants with a C health rating. [SPEAKING SPANISH] No me gusta. The point is, worry about stuff that's actually going on. OK. Well, I mean, you're kind of Jesus. Like, can you help us with some of this airport stuff? No, no, I've got more important things on my plate than fixing all your unforced errors. There's war, famine, the Knicks. [LAUGHTER] You're welcome, by the way. Oh, whoa, holy crap. Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. So that was you. (SARCASTICALLY) Oh, no, the Knicks got this far by themselves. [LAUGHTER] Yeah. Of course it was me. OK. So are they going to go all the way? Oh my god, this really is a comedy show. All right. All right. Well, hey, can you get me courtside seats? - For you, anything. - All right, awesome. I'm going to bring my friend, Jordan Klepper. No [BLEEP] way, all right? I hate that guy-- not my best work, you know? You can't make the body long and the head long. I mean, what was I thinking? RONNY CHIENG: OK, amen to that. That's very accurate. Hey, Jesus Christ, everybody." />

          <attvalue for="6" value="joining me now is best-selling author Douglas Murray His latest book on democracies and death cults Israel and the future of civilization has hit the shelves Uh get yourselves a copy Douglas uh we had some extraordinary scenes today in the Oval Office where President Donald Trump in front of the media sought to shame the South African president with the ugly truth of the anti-white anti-boa racism and violence in his country He played a clip showing among other things politicians calling for white farmers to be killed Kill the blue The farmer Kill the blue Astonishing Killed the boa Kill the farmer Douglas The South African president claimed that anti-white violence wasn't an issue And then he was played a fairly lengthy video showing otherwise That's right By the way the position the South African president um had there uh was must be now the least desirable seat uh in any political meeting I think you could see in his face that he thought &quot;Oh no it's going to be Zalinski Mark 2.&quot; Um it it was it was a fascinating exchange And of course the denial uh from the South African government uh is not new This is something that they have done for years They've allowed the most appalling anti-white racism to go on in their country Uh they still um all these decades after the end of apartheid find it very very useful and indeed easy uh uh to allow anti-white racism uh to run rampant and often with lethal consequences I'm very glad that President Trump did call this out It's maybe only President Trump among all world leaders really could have done so and done so so forcefully Um but I I would just look to the backlash that uh I would expect in the coming days for much of the media internationally not just in South Africa about this I've already seen that you know papers like The Guardian are saying you know Donald Trump pushing conspiracy theories uh about the killing of white uh South African farmers And I I'd expect a lot more of that Um they will join in the denial that the South African government has so gleefully uh engaged in for so many years Now the uh South African president Siril Ramaposa brought golfers Ernie El and Ratif Gusen to the White House with him to I guess diffused tensions with the Trump administration Uh we know Donald Trump loves his golf but uh it didn't go well Douglas listen here as Gusen recounts his own family story adding further weight to Trump's uh claims about violence against white farmers Yeah some of his buddy farmers got killed Um the farm is still going My brothers run it but it's a constant battle with farms trying to get they're trying to burn the farms down to uh chase you away And Douglas you're right about the media They're already in meltdown mode trying to claim this issue isn't real and the usual suspects are pushing this notion that any concern for this issue means you're racist Yes Well that's that's something that uh much of the media has done for a very long time about that There are even politicians in America today who are saying uh why would President Trump push this issue as opposed to all of the other um murders massacres human rights abuses that go on around the world And there's an obvious answer to that which is that there are actually a lot of people who speak about a lot of issues Um speaking about it and doing something of course two very different things But what President Trump has picked up here is one of those issues which other political leaders do not want to talk about Um there are always as it were popular human rights issues popular um human rights abuses uh for politicians to latch on to Look at the way in which the French British Canadian governments have been obsessing for the last week as indeed for the last 18 months about the exact amount of nutrition that people in Gaza have had access to in recent days They they do that because of a constituency at home that they believe wants to hear that and because they believe that it burnishes their credentials as people at the forefront of liberal human rights issues In fact it takes far more guts to do what President Trump has done today and as well as all of the other issues that he's highlighted and that many other leaders have highlighted Highlight one that has been conspicuously ignored by people who would otherwise hold themselves out as great defenders of human rights around the world And you could suggest it's being ignored precisely because of race So those claims are racism Um yeah those making it perhaps need to look in the mirror Now to another case of censorship and and frankly madness in the UK where a retired policeman was arrested and handcuffed in his own home by six police officers six officers from Kent Police the same force he served for around the decade and his crime Well he tweeted something warning about the threat of anti-semitism in Britain As the Telegraph reports police body cam camera footage captured officers scrutinizing the 71year-old's collection of books by authors such as Douglas Murray and issues of the spectator pointing to what they described as and I quote very Brexity things Douglas what is going on in your motherland uh it's it's it's pretty amazing you know Rita like you I sort of think I can't be shocked uh by the denigration of the British police and the British state and then here you know you wake up one morning and discover that police have gone into a man's house and are rumaging through his bookshelves and accusing him of effectively wrong think Uh the man that they uh briefly handcuffed and then took down to the police station for hours of questioning had obviously extremely good taste in reading material Uh he not only had my international bestseller the war in the west he had copies of the spectator magazine This means that this is one ex policeman at any rate uh who's definitely thinking about the right things and reading the right things What an extraordinary thing it is uh that people in Britain have to live in a society where that would happen And I can tell you something Rita like you if the police went into people's houses and rummage through their bookcases and found uh copies of some uh uh badly selling left-wing magazine and some uh left-wing author's uh latest book Uh I would be insensed by that as well the police have absolutely no darn right to do this sort of thing from any political direction But but you know of course they think they can in this occasion There's one thing that does need to be said on this read and I said this in the spectator the magazine that the police in Britain don't want you to read apparently uh despite it being Britain's uh bestselling and oldest weekly uh magazine Uh there's something has to be said Kent police who have the audacity to do this have solved in areas over which they have uh control zero burglaries I'll do that again Zero burglaries in areas where there have been hundreds of home breakins Kent police have managed to solve none of those crimes Not one So maybe there is a correlation isn't there between a police force that cannot police crime and a police force that would like to go to go around to a retired police officer's house and rumage through his bookcases and articles relating to his late daughter's uh death in a hit-and-run accident that was never solved Maybe maybe they do that stuff because they can't do their job And that's the connection that I would like to see more people call out Uh uh not just this thought policing but the fact that the thought policing or the wouldbe thought policing is done by police forces that seem to have no ability to do actual policing Absolutely Uh and and that is a widespread issue in Britain isn't it the failure of the police force to solve crimes real crimes like breakins and acts of violence Yes Uh meanwhile we've got K Star the prime minister well he's in danger of being arrested with some of the commentary he's been tweeting Uh Douglas uh extraordinary stuff He seems to be morphing into Donald Trump if his work on X is to be believed In the past couple of weeks he's posted about coming for illegal immigrants He said he'll put Britain first and end the reliance to cheap overseas labor that's taking jobs from Brits He posted if you want to live in the UK you should speak English That's common sense Bravo Uh he also said settlement in the UK is a privilege It's uh that has to be earned It's not a right And he also said this about strong borders that the Tories lost control of our borders and let net migration sore to record levels undercutting hardworking Brits I won't stand for it Douglas uh is the prime minister going to get a visit from the constabularary for these sorts of non-rime hate incidents because that is a real thing in Britain I'm frankly a little bit surprised by how he's become some right-wing reactionary Well of course if anyone else had said this if I'd have said this or you'd have said this Rita uh um I'm sure Karma and his police force would take a different view Uh but of course I don't believe a word of it Uh first of all it's perfectly true the last conservative government lost control of the borders Absolutely true It's also true though that Karma has lost control of the borders Um almost a thousand people came in a couple of days ago on one day alone uh uh on the illegal just on the illegal crossings across the channel on on boats uh organized by criminal gangs Uh when he says that that that that it's it's not a right to land in Britain and just stay he's right I it it's just something anyone can do However it's just something that nobody in his government or his border force are doing anything to stop Uh they behave as though it's impossible to stop tens of thousands of people arriving just across the channel every year illegally let alone the hundreds of thousands of other people who arrive in the UK every year legally and illegally and get net migration up to almost a million in in in uh uh the last couple of years Um but just just as I say this is the most cynical cynical tactic and I at any rate don't believe a word of what Kharma says I have heard politician after politician labor and conservative say this for decades They always say the same pabulum They say when they feel like they might need to just sort of enforce the base of it They say these things like I think that people should speak English if they come to England And everyone's meant to say my gosh what an amazing breakthrough It doesn't matter Adan if you're losing your country all the time because you don't enforce your borders This is abs I don't even know if K star has seen these tweets I'm sure he doesn't write them His own home secretary and foreign secretary and others have distanced themselves from the language he's used himself But it's just language games Rita That's all it is It's language games They don't do anything Not in the real world Thousands of people will continue to break into Britain every week illegally And in the meantime what do we have karma the brave tweeter Well as you say Rita it's lucky that he's prime minister and not for instance a white or workingclass uh mother in the north of England or otherwise he'd be having his collar felt this evening Absolutely Douglas before you go you've written a superb piece for the Telegraph about America's leftist media paying a price for their role in covering up Joe Biden's incapacity It's been obvious incapacity for some years You argue the fact that so many serious journalists denied what was obvious to all of us explains why trust in their reporting has collapsed Is the damage too steep to fix or can they restore their credibility uh well you know the interesting thing uh with the American uh media class is that so much of it just covered this up for years not just the past four years for many years with Joe Biden even before the 2020 election They were all rooting for him and so they covered things over for him And now they all say that they're brave uh truth warriors for uh writing books about it Now um they claim things like you know well um uh uh you know there was a sort of cover up from the White House about the extent to which Joe Biden was mentally incapacitated There wasn't just a cover up from the White House or Jill Biden There was a cover up by much of the American media But not all just as not all the media was to blame for this There is sure there is a fall-off in public trust in America as elsewhere in the media because of a concerted cover up like that But you know Rita if if uh those that same political and media class had read the New York Post they'd have been able to know about this oh 5 years before they themselves agreed and broke the story If they'd have watched you Rita and me Rita on Sky Australia talking in recent years they'd have seen that we knew something was up We identified something was up You and I weren't silent uh when uh Joe Biden was claiming that he just spoken uh to dead world leaders uh or was wandering off stage and off script in ways that were weird even for Biden So no it's not everyone who ignored this but that it really it really is quite hard to stomach uh to see the very journalists uh who spent years covering up Biden's cognitive decline uh now writing books saying &quot;Oh it turns out that Biden in 2024 wasn't peak Biden after all.&quot; And how could we have known there were no signs nothing to tell us Yeah when it doesn't matter suddenly they've got the breaking news And it's been fascinating to see the reception they're getting from other leftist media who are treating all this as if it's some revelation when the rest of the country uh has known this as we have discussed it for years Douglas Murray always a pleasure to speak with you Thanks for your time Thank you" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="On 1,100 acres in the middle of the Arizona desert. Only one set of buildings rises above the horizon as far as the eye can see. We started construction well before the CHIPS Act came along, and that's in April of '21. This recently completed 3. 5-million-square-foot building is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's first Arizona chip fabrication plant– or fab- making history not only for its enormous size- but because it's by far the most advanced chip fab on U.S. soil. So pilot production has started in this building when we are here. Three years ago, it was steel beams and dirt. What kind of investment has it taken to get to this point? About $20 billion. When we first visited, TSMC was far from a household name. But the chip shortage and AI boom has thrust it into the spotlight. TSMC manufactures some 92% of the world's most advanced chips, in everything from Nvidia GPUs to Apple iPhones. And now, for the first time in history, TSMC is starting to make those advanced chips here in the U.S. customers like Apple are starting to make their chips here, with two more fabs planned by the end of the decade. The facility over here is our fab 2. You can see the steel has been completed. But bringing advanced chip manufacturing to the U.S. has proven difficult. Volume production, is supposed to begin this year, is delayed until 2025. The Commerce Department recently hit TSMC with new shipping bans after its chips ended up in Huawei devices, despite export controls. And incoming President Donald Trump stirred up fears when he expressed opposition to the CHIPS Act during his campaign. TSMC is getting $6.6 billion from the bill. The CHIPS Act was bipartisan and it had huge Republican support when it passed. Right now, we buy every single AI chip from one company in Taiwan. That makes America less safe, and so repealing the CHIPS Act would make Americans less safe, I just don't think they'll do that. CNBC visited northern Phoenix for an exclusive first look at TSMC's first completed fab – and asked its top executives exactly what's in store for U.S. manufacturing - under an incoming Trump administration, and ever-mounting need for advanced chips. Inside the huge new fab just completed in Arizona, there's enough concrete to make ten Empire State Buildings; over 15-million-feet of cable and wire that could stretch from New York City to Los Angeles; and steel that weighs as much as 970 Boeing Triple Sevens. Now, pilot production is officially underway. Running actual product through to make sure that the entire line works end to end. And then you use those wafers to sample the customer so that they can decide if we've met their standards. Now chairman of TSMC Arizona, Rick Cassidy has been with the company 27 years. And how close are we to full production in this building? Very close, very close. But according to TSMC's initial timeline, full production should already be happening. Getting the right talent and of course, doing so during a pandemic when there were shortages, you couldn't build a house, let alone build a chip foundry. It gives you some idea for like what is required to build like massive scale in this industry. Like, it's not a game for sissies. Like it's hard and it's expensive. When we came to the U.S., we knew we were going to go through a learning process. And I want to tell you, no surprise, we had a lot of learning that we went, whether it was permitting, learning how to work with the trades, learning how to work with the unions, local labor laws, lots of learnings that went on. Now we've overcome those. But maybe the biggest challenge that we had was MEP– mechanical, electrical and plumbing. The fab is filled with billions of dollars of machinery operating at the very edge of what scientifically possible – like these bus-sized EUV machines made by a single company, ASML - the only machines in the world able to perform the extreme ultraviolet lithography necessary for etching minuscule designs on the most advanced chips. So these are quarter-billion dollar tools. In order to hook one up requires something over 2,000 electrical connections, over two kilometers of cabling, 100,000 parts, 40,000 bolts. We're talking about massive. So learning how to overcome that challenge was something that was good for TSMC. Good for the trades, good for Phoenix, good for the U.S. And yes, we're dang near back on the original schedule. So far, TSMC has 2,000 people working around the clock to run the operation. Cassidy showed us the &quot;gowning&quot; building, where workers suit up in ultra-sterile &quot;bunny suits&quot; before crossing a skybridge into the new fab. Dust particles are the bane of wafer fabrication. If it lands on a wafer, it'll kill a die. And what kind of yield are you anticipating to get out of fab 1? You know, yields vary, but we intend to be right on par with our Taiwan compatriots. The yield - what percentage of chips coming out of the fab are usable – depends on that sterile environment and precision of the machines. But even with great yields, the biggest volume of chips will still come out of Taiwan for years to come. So the U.S. is far from self-reliant. It's difficult or impossible for the U.S. or any country to be fully self-sufficient in everything that they need to build semiconductors. I think that's a pipe dream. And although the first fab was originally slated to make 5-nanometer – it's now on track to pump out even more advanced 4-nanometer chips at a rate of at least 20,000 wafers per month. Wafers that cost upwards of $18,000 and continue to rise in price, taking TSMC's stock value with it. Over the past couple of years. We've seen TSMC been able to kind of name its price, and everyone's going to pay it because right now it's the dependability and the quality that is needed. Despite being the birthplace of microchips in the 1950s – and remaining a top chip design hub - the U.S. now manufactures only 10% of the world's chips – and none of the most advanced ones. When supply chain chaos collided with booming demand for consumer electronics during the pandemic, the resulting chip shortage exposed the big risks of relying on outsiders for such critical technology. How important is it for supply to come from elsewhere than just Taiwan? I think the pandemic is probably a good example that highlighted supply chain diversification requirements, and customers want us in the U.S., they want us in Japan, they want us in Europe. Talks with TSMC about bringing advanced production to the U.S. actually began in 2018, under President Trump's first term, and his then commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross. Well, it began with select USA, which is an annual event that the Commerce Department puts on to encourage U.S. investment by foreign companies. TSMC came to that session. TSMC has actually been manufacturing in the U.S. since 1998, at an older generation chip fab in Washington state, where Cassidy says TSMC is currently investing to upgrade and expand. But Ross says some major customers wanted advanced chips made on U.S. soil. I set up a phone call between the chairman of TSMC and the head of Apple, where Apple would became very strongly supportive of the idea of TSMC coming. By 2020, TSMC announced its Arizona plans, then broke ground there in April 2021. And now you've got, you know, atrium and building, and you'll be seeing all of the fab in the back. 26-year company veteran Rose Castanares is the newly appointed president of TSMC Arizona. It was one of my customers that had first requested that TSMC build a fab in the United States. They wanted supply resilience. The world's massive reliance on TSMC's fabs in Taiwan has made the global chip supply vulnerable to risks of the region. We can't be sure that we can make enough chips here in the U.S. in the event of, say, some sort of aggression between China and Taiwan, some sort of even earthquakes and events that take down that particular island for a period of time, the entire market, the entire world, could suffer from lack of availability of leading edge nodes. A deadly 7.4 magnitude earthquake in April briefly halted production and led to a $92 million loss for TSMC. We're used to earthquakes. We are well prepared for earthquakes. We build for earthquakes. We've overbuilt this structure because we use the same designs as in Taiwan. Relying on chips from Asia has also kept the U.S. from full control over its position in the constant race for technological dominance. Being the global technology leader in AI is the most important thing to preserve over the next two decades for economic prosperity. That's why President Biden has hit the chip industry, with export controls meant to keep China from pulling ahead with advanced tech. But in October, TSMC alerted the U.S. that some of its chips were spotted in Huawei devices, despite bans on selling to the Chinese company. This problem is as old as time. There's a lot of complex rerouting of goods to different countries that have limited access to Leading edge or the most advanced technology. But of course, TSMC, a big, successful company, is supposed to be a good partner to the U.S. It is seen as extra problematic that that happened. And of course that's going to be monitored very carefully. We stopped shipment right on schedule. We're very law abiding. Just down the road in Chandler, Arizona, another chip giant-Intel-is also building two huge new fabs. The U.S. company's business model is far different - designing and manufacturing its own chips, while TSMC is what's known as a pure play foundry, only manufacturing chips for others. Cassidy says the relationship between the two is solid. We meet with them weekly and the feedback is, is we're helping them increase their ranks. We're helping them train on the most advanced stuff. So I think they're pretty happy with what we're doing. Both companies have delayed the timelines for full production at their new Arizona fabs. But where TSMC has remained the uncontested leader in advanced chips, Intel has stumbled time and again. They're in a tough spot, you know? And I don't want to see Intel go under like we need Intel. Intel is the largest recipient of funds from the $52 billion CHIPS act, signed by President Biden in 2022, meant to offset the incredible cost of building a fab to make chips in the U.S. TSMC has said the cost of U.S. construction could be at least four times what it would cost in Taiwan. Once complete, TSMC estimates all three fabs will cost $65 billion. If you take a look at the State Farm Glendale Stadium, that was roughly about $500 million. That $65 billion that we're committed to do on this site for three fabs means 130 Glendale stadiums, and that's a huge number. In November – after some complaints over delays - the Commerce Department finalized $7.9 billion for Intel, and days before, $6.6 billion for TSMC. So their deal is done completed. They're expanding hugely in Arizona. It's incredibly exciting. The race to complete the CHIPS Act deals has sped up in the weeks since the election. Trump criticized the CHIPS act as &quot;so bad&quot; in October, suggesting tariffs could be the answer instead. If there are tariffs, that will affect our customers, consumers and the broader economy, and we're at the foundational part of that economy where we are building chips that power data centers and computers and phones. So in that respect, everyone will be affected as well as TSMC. While federal funds start getting doled out to TSMC, Intel - and other recipients like Samsung, Micron, GlobalFoundries and Texas Instruments. They'll also be competing for another scarce resource in the U.S. chip industry: workers. When we finished the construction of this fab, it was really the first advanced manufacturing fab that had been built in the United States for at least ten years. And semiconductors is a very, very tough technology. You have to build upon what you learned in the previous node. And so once you stop with one particular node, you don't have the learnings to continue. The experience is just not here in the United States. So TSMC sent some 600 engineers to train in Taiwan – like Jeff Patz, who left in 2021 for an 18- month stint there. At the time, there was no facility in Arizona, and the purpose was to go and actually make things right? And learn how they're made. So you have to have a kitchen to cook, like to physically touch the $200 million piece of equipment. Like you can't do that anywhere other than at the Fab in Taiwan. Now, Patz has had the chance to see the EUV machines inside the new fab in Arizona too. I went in once very recently, and I think the 3 to 6 month gap of when I was on the construction team to where we are now, I think was astounding. It's like, oh, it looks like it did in Taiwan. TSMC plans to hire at least 6,000 workers by the time all three fabs are complete at the end of the decade. For engineers, we are actively recruiting at universities in Arizona and all across the U.S. ASU even has what they call a TSMC day. TSMC has also brought experts over from Taiwan on 3-year temporary assignments. Getting to meet like 20-30 year old industry veterans that brought us down from micron scale to nanometer scale, and get to have conversations with them about how we were going to do that in the U.S. We've brought that to Arizona. The biggest culture difference is Hawaiian Shirt Fridays, so we don't have that in Taiwan. Arizona, we have. Water scarcity, meanwhile, is something Taiwan. and Arizona have shared. A recent drought in Taiwan means TSMC is no stranger to recycling the massive amount of water it needs to make chips. TSMC says it will take 4.7 million gallons of water daily to run the first Arizona fab, but it will bring that demand down to 1 million gallons a day by recycling some 65% of that. We are working on an air WC in industrial reclamation water center. When we get that in place, we will have near zero discharge to waste, which means basically the only water we'll lose is through evaporation. Another concern: the massive amount of power it takes to make chips. TSMC did build solar on site –but it's not nearly enough to cover the 2.85 gigawatt-hours per day needed by the first fab –equivalent to the power used by roughly 100,000 U.S. homes. TSMC says it's purchasing renewable energy credits to offset all that. Still, amid the AI-fueled data center boom. Arizona's largest utility warned it could run out of transmission capacity before the end of the decade. That's also when TSMC plans to start production at its third Arizona fab. Fab 3, which you can't see, but it's down this way. It's probably going to be 2 nanometer and more advanced. The most advanced in the world? Most advanced in the world. Its global ambitions also reach far beyond Arizona. TSMC opened its first fab in Japan in February, broke ground on an $11 billion fab in Germany in August, and has been in talks about building in the United Arab Emirates – although nothing is concrete as TSMC navigates export controls on its chips into China, a UAE trading partner. Within the U.S., TSMC's plans are likely to grow too. What about other fabs in the future? There's space, right? Well, there's space for more. I don't want to speculate on what the future might bring, but we've got 1,100 acres here plus, so there's room for lots of fabs." />

          <attvalue for="6" value="now I the Australian Institute of Sport ruled me to be an unco back as a kid that continues to be reaffirmed and any opportunity I've got anywhere near it it is confirmed steven Conroy loves the world of skiing so that's why I give him the little bit of information he's just here to help and Lucy Zel how good to have her here too where are you on the snow sports are you the type of person who loves it or like me and I'll just have a smoke next to the fire let me tell you when the winter Olympics Paul and first and foremost thank you for giving me the opportunity to come program and I know that um Mr conroy there also loves his football too we have shared a similar journey over the years but when it comes to ski sports I would love to sit by the fire like you and happy to tune into the Winter Olympics and Barrack for Australia correct but Steven though is licking his lips how good's this going to be now speaking of what the hell is happening in Tasmania right now Stephen where let's be honest right now okay you know we know the history that is taught the left-wing version of the dismissal in and around the 70s of course reaffirmed by the Australian public this is always left out of the textbooks not once but twice after that moment but now we're going to have a scenario where uh Labour who've tried to knee cut the libs for multiple times in Tasmania look like they might get there and we're off to an election and who knows the whole joint's red at the federal so who knows what's going to happen at the state election but do you agree with me that perhaps we should actually save these moments for when something maybe criminal has happened something borderline criminal has happened because if pissing money against a wall is a reason to get rid of a government can you join me down at Government House in Victoria tomorrow morning well look firstly Paul uh just to correct one of your analogies uh in 1975 the Senate blocked supply correct the House of Representatives the chamber in which government is formed it had nothing to do with the blocking and bringing down of the government what you have in Tasmania is a lower house uh that they decided they wanted to expand the number i thought it was brave uh slashcourageous to borrow from Sir Humphrey uh and what this has led to is neither party was going to go close to a majority so you were never going to have as you had under the old parliament an easy path to 13 seats or what is it now yeah now it's 18 17 18 you need 18 now libs 14 mhm out of 35 so this was a decision yeah this was a decision taken by the Tasmanian Liberal government uh and it's ultimately come back to bite them uh so I mean sometimes you know karma really does catch up with you people told them this would happen they said you won't form a majority and now it's the floor of the house in which you choose the government yeah I'm fluid in Conroy and I think you this is a monumentally incompetent government yeah fine fair enough but an election supposed to but I'm saying elections are supposed to solve that aren't they Lucy not the the the the the numbers on the floor now again we saw there was the minority government of of that's existed for multiple state governments all over the shop for the Gillard government yes constant pressure but you've really got to pick your moment for when you want to pull one of these things on and unless you've got an you know unless you've actually got a plan to turn around the thing that you're claiming is broken and I don't think this bloke's got any idea we're starting a 10 billion debt right so why don't we talk about all the other states and territories that are experiencing monumental debt why don't we talk about the federal debt that we're now staring down the barrel of which is 1.1 trillion dollar of debt correct why didn't we issue a no confidence vote in Victoria with Dan Andrews after the you know the the lunatic if I could call him that as respectfully it's late night in the man co say what you want say what you want but you know after that lunatic totally destroyed the the city right through the co period what about the monumental debt that's been left for David Chrisley from the former Labour government in Anastasia Palish so really to issue a no confidence vote over something like this and to think that the Liberal party could lose its leadership over Let's be frank a very controversial decision and to quote Jackie Lambi stick your stadium up your bum i mean come on and And Andrew Bolt rightly said &quot;Is this woman ever going to be able to just kind of rein it in a little bit?&quot; Because although she has he's being rewarded for Well she does but maybe she is speaking to a core constituent of people who finally feel as though they're they're also being seen because we're getting so caught up in political speak here but I think to drag Tasmanians through this circus who are also at the same time having to fend off you know threats from Tanya Plebec over the salmon farming and the threat to 5,000 jobs already um they've been through enough but also there's such a north south divide and this is part of the extra members in parliament which helped produce those extra members particularly those extras when it comes to Lambi that she wasn't able to hold on to is that literally u look and I love Tasmania right this is not me bagging just saying literally when there is a public holiday for the southern half of Tasmania that's at a different time of the year to the one for northern Tasmania okay so their politics and many other things end up being quite divided everyone's heard the number so far tonight $9 billion in counting when some of these climate change bills um again as Andrew said today remember when Kevin Rudd said it would just cost a dollar just a dollar per person reality though is we can't hide from at least Australia rehired them and how well this is the problem right is that they won the election based on not just lies surrounding Medicare nuclear energy which they said was going to cost you know upwards of $600 billion that was a lie but they won the election in the face of a cost of living crisis having spent $400 million on the failure of the voice uh a housing crisis 1.1 people 1.1 million people coming through the gates here in Australia which I would deem an immigration crisis because what has it then done Paul the consequence of it has been further pressure on our medical system and our housing crisis got longer every queue got longer right and so they were able to successfully win in the face of all of this which is actually terrifying when you think about it and it's something that you also pushed in the leadup through the election campaign do your research know who you're voting for look at your preference cards We've seen what's just happened in the seat of Bradfield yeah correct right which is very interesting as well and and some of these votes not being counted because preferences weren't correctly entered so there's so much to think about in all of this but the fact that it's $9 billion now and it's you know increased in that period in the last decade from 600 million to that now is is just it's it's a shameful shameful exercise this pursuit of net zero but Stephen is is the reality that hey 95 seats we went up we didn't go backwards uh the you know not that it matters the first poll post election shows you know it's 110% to minus 400% I think they got the North Korean counters to come in and have a look at that but I mean still it's it's huge amounts of money again if we're talking about you Tazzy government's going to get rolled over $10 billion this is $9 billion in one year which is still an awful lot less than the $600 billion The opposition went to the government went to the government all right i I will use David a little proud's number $300 billion double said publicly no but I'm I'm prepared to say I will concede that $300 billion to do the nuclear conversion so 9 billion it's a bit less yeah yeah but the CSO says that that that that changing from the system that we've had to the three-wheel car now used to be a trillion now it's half a trillion dollars 300 billion would be less than half a trillion right we agree on that basic maths uh no unfortunately the CSR report does not say that oh hang on what that it's now half a trillion that it's $500 billion for the cost of transition i'll send it to you was there the energy works report that there's a transition transition is different from the actual cost of the build okay and the Liberals have not costed their transition okay they got to 300 or 600 depending on who you want to believe without covering transmission imagine what it would have been deflection scrap the deflection though Stephen because at the end of the day it's the Liberal Party's policy but at the end of the day mate we're talk we're talking in semantics here we've got a moratorium we can't even have a discussion about nuclear in this country right so we can't even put it out to market to talk about that let's talk about the $9 billion going to market that we're staring down going to market well it should go out to market policy 400 million voice why don't we actually spend money on a re a referendum on energy and let the Australian people decide once and for all so we can finally have some certainty around the direction this country is going in with energy we look at our allies across the UK and the US they have bipartisan support for nuclear energy there is an understanding even those radical lunatics the Democrats can agree that nuclear is the right path forward and we are sitting here still debating on whether or not renewable energies is is is in is is costing us billions of dollars it is that's a fact i got to get to Megan Kelly so give me 30 seconds stephen I'm I'm glad I'm glad you're having to be on in the year 2040 look at that not even going good luck waiting till 2040 to get cheaper power bills and electricity on i like this can we luck getting those transmission lines up by 2040 killed off all the farmland Mr conroy i love these two rip it in i can hear you cheering from home thank you Lucy thank you St" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="The EV revolution could put a major strain on the nation’s electric grid, an aging system built for a world that runs on fossil fuels. To upgrade the grid to meet growing electricity demand, the U.S. needs to build a massive amount of new transmission and distribution lines to connect new renewable energy resources to population centers. But there are major regulatory hurdles to grid infrastructure buildout, and the government is not investing near the amount that analysts say the nation needs in order to meet its electrification targets. &#10;&#10;Chapters: &#10;00:00 – Introduction &#10;02:42 — Increasing electricity demand&#10;05:56 — Grid needs&#10;09:33 — Challenges faced&#10;12:19 — Future&#10;&#10;Produced and Shot by: Katie Brigham&#10;Edited by: Evan Lee Miller&#10;Supervising Producer: Jeniece Pettitt&#10;Animation: Jason Reginato&#10;Additional Reporting: Catherine Clifford&#10;Additional Footage: Getty Images, Ford, Rivian, Kia, Hyundai, Nissan, Volkswagen, PG&amp;E&#10;&#10;» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC&#10;» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision&#10;&#10;About CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

          <attvalue for="6" value="By 2030, electric vehicles are forecast to make up over half of all new cars sold in the U.S. That could put a big strain on our nation's electric grid, an aging system that was built for a world that runs on fossil fuels. Electricity demand across the United States is really expected to increase in coming decades, somewhere between 14% and 19% by 2030 and between 27% and 39% by 2035. Over the past decade, demand only increased by about 5%. But now &quot;electrify everything&quot; has become a strategy and a mantra for the clean energy movement, calling for the electrification of transportation, but also of space heating for homes and offices, household appliances like stoves, and to the extent possible, processes like iron, steel and chemical production. About 60% of electricity generation in the U.S. still comes from fossil fuels, and so electrifying all of these sectors isn't a climate solution unless we also invest in a major buildout of renewables. So you electrify as many things as possible and you then decarbonize the supply of electricity, and in so doing, decarbonize the economy. That happens to be happening at the exact same time. So we have both supply side and demand side drivers of big grid needs. That means we need major changes to the grid. More high-voltage transmission lines to transport electricity from new wind and solar power plants to the areas where it's needed most, smaller distribution lines and transformers for last mile electricity delivery, and hardware like inverters that allows customers with home batteries, EVs and solar panels to feed excess electricity back into the grid. But it's not going to be cheap. In a study commissioned by the California Public Utilities Commission, Shumavon's grid analytics company, Kevala, forecasts that California alone will have to spend $50 billion by 2035 in distribution grid upgrades to meet its ambitious EV targets. And that's just one state's transportation sector. Other parts of the country and the economy are electrifying quickly, too. When you carry this through to the whole country and you think about beneficial electrification, we're probably talking about a number that looks more like 3.5 to $5 trillion. But the U.S. Is not on track to spend anywhere near this. And building the high-voltage, interstate transmission lines that are key to greening our electric grid is a bureaucratic nightmare, given all the utility and regulatory agencies involved. Permitting can take a decade or more. But our nation's grid needs are at least starting to gain attention. So this is a known problem, but it is also a very hard problem. It's endemic to the way that power has been generated in this country since we started building electric grids. Scrambling to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the Biden administration has set an ambitious target of creating a 100% carbon-free electric grid by 2035. But with electricity demand increasing every year, that's going to require a massive buildout of both renewable energy resources and grid infrastructure. An owner of a new Tesla Model 3, who drives the national average of around 14,000 miles per year, would use about the same amount of electricity charging their vehicle at home as they would on their electric water heater over the course of a year, or about ten times more electricity than they would to power a new, energy-efficient refrigerator. Larger electric vehicles, like the Ford F-150 Lightning, would use more electricity than a central AC unit in a large home. And then it's not just electric vehicles, but it's building heating and cooling. And Congress just decided we wanted to manufacture silicon chips in this country. Those use a lot of power. And you're hearing about artificial intelligence everywhere, and that's a lot of churning chips somewhere in a data center. So we got a lot of power demand coming to this country when we really didn't have any for the last like 25 years. By 2035, light-duty electric vehicles, a segment which excludes large trucks and airplanes, are projected to comprise about 14.6% of total electricity demand, up from just 0.6% today, according to data from Princeton's Zero-carbon Energy Systems Research and Optimization Laboratory, or ZERO Lab. This number represents an optimistic scenario in which the provisions in Biden's Inflation Reduction Act prove highly effective. In this same scenario, residential electricity use, such as heating, cooling and lighting, will represent about 34% of electricity demand, while commercial use in places such as offices or data centers will be about 26%, and industrial uses such as iron, steel and paper production will represent about 20%. But though transportation is projected to use less electricity than these other segments, it's driving the overall increase in demand, especially in the short-term. The electricity use of light-duty vehicles is projected to increase 3,400% by 2035. Compare that to a mere 18% increase in the residential sector or 7% growth in the commercial sector. Today we have about 470-ish thousand vehicles connected to PG&amp;E's grid. We have a goal of connecting 3 million, building out the grid to connect 3 million vehicles by 2030. PG&amp;E's service territory in Northern and Central California covers about one in seven electric vehicles in the U.S. How it handles the EV transition could serve as a model for the nation, but it's no easy task. The utility is tied to a four year funding cycle for grid infrastructure upgrades, and Krefta says that the currently allocated funding relies on outdated data that didn't anticipate such rapid EV adoption. That has PG&amp;E applying for numerous state and federal grants that could help it meet its electrification targets. I think right now people have an overly simplistic view of what electrification of transportation means. What I actually would caution is that it's very much a double-edged sword. If done right, it will be phenomenal. If mismanaged, there are going to be a lot of upset people, and that is a real risk. That's a risk for regulators, that's a risk for politicians, and that's a risk for utilities. If the nation doesn't match the EV boom with a comparable boom in grid infrastructure buildout, Shumavon says that drivers can expect charging difficulties. That could look like long queues or only being able to charge at certain times and places. And an overly strained grid will be more vulnerable to extreme weather events and prone to blackouts, which California experienced in 2020 and has only narrowly avoided since. The most straightforward way to meet growing electricity demand and keep our electric vehicles charged is to bring more energy resources online, preferably green ones. But though it's easy to site coal and natural gas plants close to population centers, the best solar and wind resources are usually more rural. As the United States tries to move its power and electricity generation from small, local, regional, fossil fuel-powered generation points to a renewable grid, a clean grid, you're going to have to completely remake that because wind power comes from places where the wind is blowing. Solar power comes from places where the sun is shining. Wind and solar power are not generated exactly where there are large sources of demand for energy. That means that what the U.S. really needs is more high-voltage transmission lines, which can transport solar and wind resources across county and state lines. These large power lines will also help address the intermittency of renewables, because if the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing in one state, green electricity can be imported from whatever region happens to be windy or sunny at that moment. But Gramlich says that while we're constantly spending money replacing and upgrading old lines, we're hardly building any new ones. I think we need probably about 20 or $30 billion a year on new capacity, new line miles and new delivery capacity. We're spending close to zero on that right now. Princeton's ZERO Lab found that the Inflation Reduction Act has the potential to cut emissions by about 1 billion tons by 2030. But if transmission doesn't expand beyond its historical growth rate of 1% per year, over 80% of these reductions could be lost, since the growth of wind and solar would be severely limited. We're going to need 2.3% growth in transmission lines per year to be able to maximize the benefit that the Inflation Reduction Act is bringing to our energy system. Shumavon agrees that while we must build more, we also need to build smarter. So historically, planning for the grid has happened mostly by looking at trends and waiting until capacity is needed to be added and then adding that. It's been essentially, straight line assumptions that you can do in Excel. But as consumers adopt solar, home battery storage and EVs, their electricity use has become more difficult to predict and for utilities to adapt to. In Kevala's study for the California Public Utilities Commission, the company utilized power use data collected from customers smart meters in combination with demographic and purchase history data to forecast when customers are likely to adopt green energy technologies like solar power or EVs based on what's in their economic best interest. That data can provide utilities and regulators with insight into exactly when and where the grid needs upgrades, helping to get all the stakeholders on the same page so that hopefully permitting for local distribution lines as well as larger transmission lines can be expedited. So certainly we all understand that we'll need new wires or bigger transformers or things along those lines. But the grid is actually managed, it is operated, and the tools that are necessary to operate the grid will need to evolve to be able to support the level of complexity that we are talking about. The U.S. electric grid is actually made up of three distinct grids, the Eastern, Western and Texas interconnections, which are almost completely isolated from each other, save for a few small connection points. That means that very little electricity is exchanged between them. And though there's widespread agreement that a national grid would be better, actually building the large transmission lines that would make this possible is a regulatory headache. Building more transmission is like herding cats. If you think about those 3,000 plus sources of power generation spread out all throughout the United States, every single utility, county, stakeholder, regulator that needs to be involved in order to get the approval to put a new line of transmission up, it is pulling teeth. And who's supposed to pay? How much, and how are we going to decide? And then permitting is another area. You know, all these horror stories you hear about a transmission line that takes 18 years to get permitted. You know, that's true. That's happening. Before new energy projects like solar or wind farms can get grid-connected, they undergo a series of impact studies to evaluate what new transmission equipment is required, how much it will cost and who will pay. The list of projects took somewhere in this process is massive. There are two terawatts of power generation stuck in these queues, compared to there's only 1.25 terawatts of generation operating in the country. So more than the amount we have operating is stuck in these interconnection queues. 1,350 gigawatts of that potential capacity comes from over 10,000 new energy generation projects, the overwhelming majority of which are solar or wind. The remaining 680 gigawatts are energy storage projects. But in the meantime, distributed energy resources like residential, solar and battery systems can help to pick up the slack as customers can generate their own power, sell excess electricity back to the grid or store it for later use. And automakers are increasingly equipping their EVs with bidirectional charging capabilities, which allows customers to use EV batteries to power homes or provide electricity back to the grid just as a regular home battery system would. Tesla doesn't currently offer this functionality, but has indicated that it will in the coming years, while other models like the Ford F-150 Lightning and Nissan Leaf already do. We're doing a lot of work right now with different automakers to really kind of understand what it would take to enable that vision of the future. So what does it mean to connect your vehicle to your home? How can you leverage your vehicle to charge whenever there's renewables on the grid and they're clean and low cost and then discharge back to the grid during the evening hours? While it's clear that electrifying the nation's vehicle fleet, as well as the clean energy transition overall, relies on a large investment in grid infrastructure, experts agree that current funding falls far short. There's a $2.5 billion program called the Transmission Facilitation Program, but there's only $2.5 billion there. And we spent $2.5 billion on transmission in a month and a half. Just it's like a drop in the bucket. The Inflation Reduction Act also includes $3 billion in funding for transmission line buildout. But though these numbers sound impressive, they're far from the 20 or 30 billion per year that Gramlich says we need for such a massive infrastructure expansion. And even if we did start spending big today, transmission lines take years to build. There's going to be an in-between period where the need is very high, but the transmission can't be built during the time period where the need happens. And distributed energy resources are going to play a very active role in managing that process because no other resources will be available. I would imagine we're going to end up depending on batteries. I would imagine we're going to end up depending on micronuclear reactors. I'm going to imagine that we're really going to focus and there's going to be a lot of emphasis on energy efficiency and energy timing use. PG&amp;E, for example, is thinking about how to optimize charging times for large electric vehicle fleets. So one thing that we're trying to do is to work with some of these companies that are putting in substantial loads to provide flexible load constraints where we can say, you can only charge 50 EVs at 7 p.m. but at 2 a.m. you can charge all 100, or you can charge 90 of your EVs. Krefta hopes these constraints are temporary though, and says that as the grid evolves, PG&amp;E is looking to implement dynamic pricing, incentivizing consumers to use more electricity during off-peak hours through lower electricity rates. But ultimately, many believe that what's needed most is a legislative deal on transmission infrastructure buildout. Democrats seem pretty lined up around the need to build out transmission, mainly because of their interests in clean energy growth. Republicans seem to want permitting reform for a wide variety of infrastructure, that includes fossil infrastructure. If Democrats and Republicans can agree to expedite permitting for all types of energy infrastructure, fossil and renewable, Gramlich says that's where we might see a deal. West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin is spearheading this effort, with a Biden-backed permitting reform bill introduced in May after similar measures failed last year. The politics will be tricky to navigate, but whether it's this bill or another effort, something has to give and soon. We need to start yesterday and get this done very soon. We don't have very much time at all if we want to actually meet our decarbonization targets." />

          <attvalue for="3" value="Micron, the largest US maker of computer memory chips, posted its biggest gain in more than 12 years after giving a surprisingly strong sales forecast, buoyed by demand for artificial intelligence hardware. Micron CEO and President Sanjay Mehrotra joins Caroline Hyde and Ed Ludlow on &quot;Bloomberg Technology.&quot;" />
          <attvalue for="4" value="70" />
          <attvalue for="5" value="Bloomberg Technology" />
          <attvalue for="6" value="Let's get right to the outlook for the fiscal third way up. The factors for us was this all about the recovery in DRAM? Traditionally commoditized or is this more about the ramp up in HBM three that is going in support of things like the 200 from India? First of all, thank you, Caroline and Ed, for having me on the show here. Our recovery is really driven by a demand related to air with tight supply and actually demand that is strong across most of our end markets, particularly datacenter driven demand. And Micron has a strong portfolio of products. Very excited about our latest offering of HP and 3D that you referred to earlier. We have just begun shipments of this and we see strong growth in the several quarters that are ahead of us and supply is tight. Leading edge nodes in particular are in tight supply. That's leading to price increases as well. So as we look ahead at 2020, for our year of recovery, we see increasing prices and driven by the demand supply fundamentals. And we look at 2025 to be a record year for Micron's revenue with it with significantly improved profitability as well. 2025 supply, although mostly already allocated, you sold out on 2024, Sanjay. Just let's dig in on the high bandwidth memory, because was it Jason Huang over it and video calling this a technology miracle? Will it not get commoditized? Will prices remain elevated? First of all, it's an H-bomb product that is sold out for calendar year 24. And vast majority of the supply for ah, 2025 is allocated as well. This is a critical product and three is in very, very early stages here and it's key enabler of what I platforms, generative platforms are able to do. Just think about it. I mean, the latest Blackwell platform that has been announced. It has 64 die of memory in it. So tremendous amount of silicon. H.M. is growing fast. Expect it to be about 15% high teens, mid-to-high teens of the industry revenue over the course of next several years compared to being just half of that last year. And as you look ahead at the new product platforms being announced, NVIDIA earlier this week, Broadcom yesterday, they are all placing tremendous emphasis on the performance and the power of HBM memory. As it becomes bigger data becomes bigger, data lives in the products that Micron makes for the AI applications lives and the kind of products such as HBM three but high density DIMM modules, right, as well as other products that Micron makes Ddr5 memory and datacenter SSDs. So it is really driving tremendous growth trajectory. H VMC is absolutely going to be critical. This is in very early innings and you know, even if there are any perturbations in supply, they will get absorbed over time. It was important to understand is because each HBM three E product is extremely silicon intensive across the industry. It is really leaving not enough supply for non HBM products and those are in tight supply and that's what is driving it. Tremendous strength in terms of demand, supply fundamentals and pricing trajectory for memory. And the question is, Sanjay, how do you keep up for a three year running at 5.2 gigabits per second? You've already mentioned Blackwell. You're going to have to bring that next generation HBM nine gigabits per second faster. Just walk us through the real time ramp of your products, getting them into the real world. And when they show up in your financials in the in the near and medium term. Well, we talked about yesterday in our earnings call that we have begun shipments of IBM three product. It's an industry leading product. It has the best performance and the lowest power in the industry, which, you know, for data center applications, poverty is critical. 30% better power for our HP and 3G product. So we have really long legs in this IBM three product for foreseeable future here. And HBM three has begun shipments. And we mentioned in the call yesterday that it will be accretive to our gross margins and we'll have several hundred million dollars of revenue of this IBM three product in our fiscal year, which will end in August timeframe. And of course, we look at significant growth ahead for the HP entry as well. Production has begun. We are extremely focused on continuing to ramp this product. Our target is to get our share in hbm2 equal and to our DRAM industry share, and we're going to remain extremely disciplined. Key will be absolutely managing the supply and demand fundamentals overall for the DRAM industry. So we look at a strong growth ahead for our HP and we keep in mind that HBM is expected to have a category greater than 50% over the course of next few years in terms of bit growth that IBM will be driving. Of course it will be all the journey applications that will be driving this. And I just want to add here that of course, datacenter is a big driver of our growth. We are shifting our business more toward datacenter given the demand and the profitability profile of that part of the market. We are doing that with our deep end products as well as with our SSDs. But just wanted to point out that other markets such as smartphones and PCs, they too are implementing AI enabled devices and you will start seeing them coming out from later this year. And of course 2025 will be the first full year of all these devices on the edge, such as AI enabled smartphones. And because they take much higher memory content than their prior generation of devices, you're really excited about the opportunities for that. It enables for us enables forward memory, which is at the heart of A.I. revolution in terms of from data center all the way to the edge. Going back, though, to this high bandwidth memory and going back to that market share that you say you want to own, can you watch it clearly exactly what that share is going to be for our audience right now when we have Hynix Samsung likely to be unveiling that product at the first half of this year. I share in them today in the industry is approximately 23% and we are targeting that. That CBM share would be in line with that DRAM industry share. Of course, it will be ramping gradually over time sometime in 2025. We expect to be getting to a share in the HBM equaling to DTM share. It's a product that has greater profitability and as we said, it really will be a driver of our revenue and profit growth along with the rest of the market. That has a strengthening fundamentals as well for Bloomberg Television. And let me just point out, the most important thing is that our product has leadership specs and that's why it's getting a strong customer pull leadership products again in terms of performance bandwidth being about 10% better than other competitive products, power being 30% lower datacenters, they take up about 3% of the world's energy over the course of next several years, expected to continue to increase. Getting to closer to high single digit percentage. That's where memory becomes extremely important in making sure that these accelerators for Genii are running low power. Low power memory are 30% lower. Power solution is extremely attractive to our customers. Sanjay, for our Bloomberg television and radio audience worldwide, you can point out a lot of things. We have a lot of questions for you, so bear with us. Let's go back to on device, because you clearly want to talk about that. We talk about on device a lot on this program, the smartphone and PC contacts. You are saying that there is a tangible benefit that you're seeing in orders for that. But is that happening right now? There is a lot of skepticism that on device processing of lens and generative AI tools is some way away. Are you telling us that this is material now or you're predicting that it's coming soon? Then earlier this year, you saw Samsung as 24 getting announced at Mobile World Congress. One, it announced its magic six, plural. And these are great examples where EAI is being implemented. Great examples of inferencing on the edge is being implemented. That's intent based and that's really going to drive tremendous opportunity. Of course, these kind of high end next gen AI capabilities and pieces in smartphones will start getting into the marketplace later this year. 2025 will become the first full year over the course of next few years and next few short years we will see that AI enabled devices will be representing, let's say, about a third of smartphones and PC markets, and they take much more content anywhere from 40% to 100% more content in flagship AI enabled PCs and smartphones versus flagship AI and PC devices today. Sanjay, we've got to actually have smartphone and PC devices today. We've got a couple more key questions and we're going to keep it tight, Sanjay, because we have been thinking about the CHIPS Act when thinking about Intel getting that money. We've been thinking about you still building out in China and in India. Will you still be committed to putting money into Boise and to New York as well? Are you going to get the money from the government? Well, with respect to the chipset and our previously announced plans for leading edge memory manufacturing in Boise and in the Santa Cruz area, Avery applications for CHIPS Act is under processing with the CHIPS Program Office making good progress there. Of course, we'll make the announcements when that process is completed. Important thing is that CHIPS Act enables us to bring with CHIPS Act grants sufficient level of chips that grants investment tax credits and local state government support. It helps bridge the cost gap with Asia operations, so it helps us bring leading edge memory manufacturing into semiconductors. And of course, that creates many jobs. It supports economic as well as national security. And memory is pivotal. We just talked about how pivotal memory is to A.I. applications. So think about it today, only 2% of world's memory total world's memory production is here in the US. Of course, it's all by Micron at our facility in Manassas, Virginia, which chips tech support as we expand our leading edge memory manufacturing in Boise and Syracuse next decade. Sometime in the next decade, we'll be able to get to 10% over 10% of world's leading edge memory production here in the US. And that's really, Sanjay, significantly moving the needle in Micron, of course, is committed to that. Sanjay, we're running out of time here. Bloomberg's reported that the US is considering restricting one of your Chinese rivals, CIE X70. My understanding is that Micron has been in support of that. Could you just outline Micron's position on the US restricting SI x70. Look, the governments make their own decision and we are not going to speculate or speak on behalf of any of the government actions. What we can tell you is that, of course China is an important market for us, just like China is an important market for the entire semiconductor industry, and we are well engaged with the customer ecosystem there in terms of bringing value of our leading edge products in memory and storage, helping them drive their innovation roadmaps." />

fumbled that lead and is struggling to catch up to its Mega cap peers in the race to bring aite Tech to the public Google has been I think hesitant to really push with the urgency that they need to push with to win the game of AI open AI has not been hesitant at all and I think that tells the story between you know why open AI is is ahead and Google's not under hbas Deep Mind was known for developing its technology through games like breakouts we started off with games at the beginning of Deep Mind this is back in 2010 so this is for about 10 years ago is our first big breakthrough and

challenges in biology for decades Deep Mind open sourced it essentially giving it away for free we decided that there was so many Downstream applications of alpha fold um that we couldn't possibly even imagine what they all were so the best way to to accelerate uh drug Discovery and also fundamental research would be to to um give all that data away Alpha fold is a a kind of a gift from us to to to the scientific community and back in 2017 a team of Google researchers separate from Deep Mind published a breakthrough study on Transformers a way for AI models to better process the text they train on that essentially jumpstarted the wave of AI Innovation that we're seeing today open AI reportedly used that very paper to create its own chatbot Transformers that's the T in chat GPT it was ultimately that userfriendly chatbot released by open AI that brought generative AI into the mainstream not the groundwork that hassabis and deep mind and Google had laid for Chachi BT to even exist Google was simply giving away its biggest products and research helping its competitors they had the lead and they were being very cautious they were being very cautious both about generative a for images and about the large language models and when open AI teamed up with Microsoft and um chat GPT was being used by Microsoft de uh Google couldn't afford to be cautious anymore that same Source says chat GPT caught hasus offg guard and also fired up his extremely competitive Spirit Google got more aggressive too The Washington Post reporting in May of 2023 that Google was internally announcing a big departure from its previous policy employees had to stop sharing their research with the world only publishing papers after the research had been turned into products and Alpha fold now a business opportunity hababa says the newly released version Alpha fold 3 could be a multi billion doll business the company has also secured commercial Partners like Eli Lily and novaris for drug Discovery I think what the chat PT moment did that changed was and fair play to them to do that was they demonstrated I think somewhat surprising ly to themselves as well that um the public were ready to you know the general public were ready to embrace these systems and actually find Value in these systems when we're working on these systems mostly you're focusing on the flaws and the things they don't do and hallucinations and things you're all familiar with now we were thinking you know would anyone really find that useful given that it does this and that and the other uh and we would wanted to improve those things first before uh putting them out but interestingly it turned out that um even with those flaws many tens of Millions of people still find them very useful and so that was an interesting update on maybe the convergence of products and the science that actually um uh uh all of these amazing things we've been doing in the lab so to speak are actually ready for prime time for General use um beyond the rarified world of science all eyes are now on Google as it tries to prove that it can go beyond that rarified World of Science and turn AI Research into cold heart cash hbus is fully aware of his new directive telling us that his unit is like the engine room of Google bringing the latest AI Technologies to every corner every product in Google to serve its billions of users what you can see today is that the research tracks and the product tracks have converged you can have metrics academic metrics coming out of your ears but you you you the the real test is when millions of users use your product and do they find it useful do they find it helpful is it beneficial to the world and you get obviously a ton of feedback that way and um and then that leads to very rapid improvements in the underlying models in the past year though as Google has shipped those actual products the feedback has been mixed but among Silicon Valley and AI insiders Demis hassabis is shaping up to be one of Google's most promising assets Demis is extremely competitive um I don't think I've ever met anybody more competitive Google has been consolidating its AI effort and power around hbas and a move that Senator Pai said would quote accelerate our progress in AI that Cutthroat competitiveness that got him to chess Prodigy status and shipping an award-winning video

          <attvalue for="6" value="Human language, mathematics, logic. These are all ways to formalize the world. And in our century, there's a new and yet more powerful one: computation. For nearly 50 years, I've had the great privilege of building up an ever-taller tower of science and technology that's based on that idea of computation. And so today, I want to tell you a little bit about what that's led to. There's a lot to talk about, so I'm going to go quickly. And sometimes I'm going to summarize in a sentence what I've written a whole book about. But you know, I last gave a TED talk 13 years ago, in February 2010, soon after WolframAlpha launched, and I ended that talk with a question. Question was, is computation ultimately what's underneath everything in our universe? I gave myself a decade to find out. And actually, it could have needed a century. But in April 2020, just after the decade mark, we were thrilled to be able to announce what seems to be the ultimate machine code of the universe. And yes, it's computational. So computation isn't just a possible formalization, it's the ultimate one for our universe. It all starts from the idea that space, like matter, is made of discrete elements, and from that structure of space and everything in it, it's defined just by a network of relations between these elements that we might call atoms of space. So it's all very elegant, but deeply abstract. But here's kind of a humanized representation, a version of the very beginning of the universe. And what we're seeing here is the emergence of space and everything in it by the successive application of very simple computational rules. And remember, these dots are not atoms in any existing space. They're atoms of space that get put together to make space. And yes, if we kept going long enough, we could build our whole universe this way. So eons later, here's a chunk of space with two little black holes that, if we wait a little while, will eventually merge, generating little ripples of gravitational radiation. And remember, all of this is built from pure computation. But like fluid mechanics emerging from molecules, what emerges here is space-time and Einstein's equations for gravity, though there are deviations that we just might be able to detect, like that the dimensionality of space won't always be precisely three. And there's something else. Our computational rules can inevitably be applied in many ways, each defining a different kind of thread of time, a different path of history that can branch and merge. But as observers embedded in this universe, we're branching and merging, too. And it turns out that quantum mechanics emerges as the story of how branching minds perceive a branching universe. So the little pink lines you might be able to see here show the structure of what we call branchial space, the space of quantum branches. And one of the stunningly beautiful things, at least for physicists like me, is that the same phenomenon that in physical space gives us gravity, in branchial space gives us quantum mechanics. So in the history of science so far, I think we can identify sort of four broad paradigms for making models of the world that can be distinguished kind of by how they deal with time. So in antiquity and in plenty of areas of science, even today, it's all about kind of, what are things made of. And time doesn't really enter. But in the 1600s came the idea of modeling things with mathematical formulas in which time enters, but basically just as a coordinate value. Then in the 1980s, and this is something in which I was deeply involved, came the idea of making models by starting with simple computational rules and just letting them run. So can one predict what will happen? No. There's what I call computational irreducibility, in which, in effect, the passage of time corresponds to an irreducible computation that we have to run in order to work out how it will turn out. But now there's kind of something, something even more -- in our physics project, there’s things that have become multi-computational, with many threads of time that can only be knitted together by an observer. So it's kind of a new paradigm that actually seems to unlock things not only in fundamental physics, but also in the foundations of mathematics and computer science, and possibly in areas like biology and economics as well. So I talked about building up the universe by repeatedly applying a computational rule. But how is that rule picked? Well, actually it isn't, because all possible rules are used, and we're building up what I call the ruliad, the kind of deeply abstract but unique object that is the entangled limit of all possible computational processes. Here's a tiny fragment of it shown in terms of Turing machines. So this ruliad is everything. And we as observers are necessarily part of it. In the ruliad as a whole, in a sense, everything computationally possible can happen. But observers like us just sample specific slices of the ruliad. And there are two crucial facts about us. First, we're computationally bounded, our minds are limited, and second, we believe we're persistent in time, even though we're made of different atoms of space at every moment. So then, here's the big result. What observers with those characteristics perceive in the ruliad necessarily follows certain laws. And those laws turn out to be precisely the three key theories of 20th century physics: general relativity, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics in the second law. So it's because we're observers like us that we perceive the laws of physics we do. We can think of sort of different minds as being at different places in rulial space. Human minds who think alike are nearby, animals further away, and further out, we get to kind of alien minds where it's hard to make a translation. So how can we get intuition for all of this? Well, one thing we can do is use generative AI to take what amounts to an incredibly tiny slice of the ruliad aligned with images we humans have produced. We can think of this as sort of a place in the ruliad described by using the concept of a cat in a party hat. So zooming out, we saw there what we might call Cat Island. Pretty soon we’re in a kind of an inter-concept space. Occasionally things will look familiar, but mostly, what we'll see is things we humans don't have words for. In physical space, we explore the universe by sending out spacecraft. In rulial space, we explore more by expanding our concepts and our paradigms. We can kind of get a sense of what's out there by sampling possible rules, doing what I call ruliology. So even with incredibly simple rules, there's incredible richness. But the issue is that most of it doesn't yet connect with things we humans understand or care about. It's like when we look at the natural world and only gradually realize that we can use features of it for technology. So even after everything our civilization has achieved, we're just at the very, very beginning of exploring rulial space. What about AIs? Well, just like we can do ruliology, AIs can in principle go out and explore rulial space. Left to their own devices, though, they'll mostly just be doing things we humans don't connect with or care about. So the big achievements of AI in recent times have been about making systems that are closely aligned with us humans. We train LLMs on billions of web pages so they can produce texts that's typical of what we humans write. And yes, the fact that this works is undoubtedly telling us some deep scientific things about the semantic grammar of language and generalizations of things like logic that perhaps we should have known centuries ago. You know, for much of human history, we were kind of like the LLMs, figuring things out by kind of matching patterns in our minds. But then came more systematic formalization and eventually computation. And with that, we got a whole other level of power to truly create new things and to, in effect, go wherever we want in the ruliad. But the challenge is to do that in a way that connects with what we humans, and our AIs, understand. In fact, I've devoted a large part of my life to kind of trying to build that bridge. It's all been about creating a language for expressing ourselves computationally, a language for computational thinking. The goal is to formalize what we know about the world in computational terms, to have computational ways to represent cities and chemicals and movies and humor and formulas and our knowledge about them. It’s been a vast undertaking that spanned more than four decades of my life, but it's something very unique and different. But I'm happy to report that in what has been Mathematica and is now the Wolfram Language, I think we firmly succeeded in creating a truly full-scale computational language. In effect, every one of these functions here can be thought of as formalizing and encapsulating, in computational terms, some facet of the intellectual achievements of our civilization. It's sort of the most concentrated form of intellectual expression that I know, sort of finding the essence of everything and coherently expressing it in the design of our computational language. For me personally, it's been an amazing journey, kind of, year after year, building the sort of tower of ideas and technology that's needed. And nowadays sharing that process with the world in things like open live streams and so on. A few centuries ago, the development of mathematical notation, and what amounts to the language of mathematics, gave a systematic way to express math and made possible algebra and calculus, and eventually all of modern mathematical science. And computational language now provides a similar path, letting us ultimately create a computational X for all imaginable fields X. I mean, we've seen the growth of computer science, CS, but computational language opens up something ultimately much bigger and broader, CX. I mean, for 70 years we've had programming languages which are about telling computers in their terms what to do. But computational language is about something intellectually much bigger. It's about taking everything we can think about and operationalizing it in computational terms. You know, I built the Wolfram Language first and foremost because I wanted to use it myself. And now when I use it, I feel like it's kind of giving me some kind of superpower. I just have to imagine something in computational terms. And then the language sort of almost magically lets me bring it into reality, see its consequences, and build on them. And yes, that's the sort of superpower that's let me do things like our physics project. And over the past 35 years, it's been my great privilege to share this superpower with many other people, and by doing so, to have enabled an incredible number of advances across many fields. It's sort of a wonderful thing to see people, researchers, CEOs, kids, using our language to fluently think in computational terms, kind of crispening up their own thinking, and then in effect, automatically calling in computational superpowers. And now it's not just people who can do that. AIs can use our computational language as a tool, too. Yes, to get their facts straight, but even more importantly, to compute new facts. There are already some integrations of our technology into LLMs. There's a lot more you'll be seeing soon. And, you know, when it comes to building new things in a very powerful emerging workflow, it's basically to start by telling the LLM roughly what you want, then to have it try to express that in precise Wolfram Language, then, and this is a critical feature of our computational language, compared to, for example, programming language, you as a human can read the code, and if it does what you want, you can use it as kind of a dependable component to build on. OK, but let's say we use more and more AI, more and more computation. What's the world going to be like? From the industrial revolution on, we’ve been used to doing engineering where we can in effect, see how the gears mesh to understand how things work. But computational irreducibility now shows us that that won't always be possible. We won't always be able to make a kind of simple human or, say, mathematical narrative to explain or predict what a system will do. And yes, this is science, in effect, eating itself from the inside. From all the successes of mathematical science, we've come to believe that somehow, if we only could find them, there'd be formulas to kind of predict everything. But now computational irreducibility shows us that that isn't true. And that in effect, to find out what a system will do, we have to go through the same irreducible computational steps as the system itself. Yes, it's a weakness of science, but it's also why the passage of time is significant and meaningful and why we can't just sort of jump ahead to get the answer. We have to live the steps. It's actually going to be, I think, a great societal dilemma of the future. If we let our AIs achieve their kind of full computational potential, they'll have lots of computational irreducibility and we won't be able to predict what they'll do. But if we put constraints on them to make them more predictable, we'll limit what they can do for us. So what will it feel like if our world is full of computational irreducibility? Well, it's really nothing new because that's the story with much of nature. And what's happened there is that we've found ways to operate within nature, even though nature can sometimes still surprise us. And so it will be with the AIs. We might give them a constitution, but there will always be consequences we can't predict. Of course, even figuring out societally what we want from the AIs is hard. Maybe we need you know, a promptocracy where people write prompts instead of just voting. But basically, every control the outcome scheme seems full of both political philosophy and computational irreducibility gotchas. You know, if we look at the whole arc of human history, the one thing that's systematically changed is that more and more gets automated. And LLMs just gave us a dramatic and unexpected example of that. So what does that mean? Does that mean that in the end, us humans will have nothing to do? Well, if we look at history, what seems to happen is that when one thing gets automated away, it opens up lots of new things to do. And as economies develop, the pie chart of occupations seems to get more and more fragmented. And now we're back to the ruliad. Because at a foundational level, what's happening is that automation is opening up more directions to go in the ruliad. But there's no abstract way to choose between these. It's a question of what we humans want, and it requires kind of humans doing work to define that. So a society of AI as sort of untethered by human input, would effectively go off and explore the whole ruliad. But most of what they do would seem to us random and pointless, much like most of nature doesn't seem to us right now, like it's achieving a purpose. I mean, one used to imagine that to build things that are useful to us, we'd have to do it kind of step by step. But AI and the whole phenomenon of computation tell us that really what we need is more just to define what we want. Then computation, AI, automation can make it happen. And yes, I think the key to defining in a clear way what we want is computational language. And, you know, even after 35 years, for many people, Wolfram Language is still sort of an artifact from the future. If your job is to program, it seems like a cheat. How come you can do in an hour what would usually take you a week? But it can also be kind of daunting because having dashed off that one thing, you now have to conceptualize the next thing. Of course, it's great for CEOs and CTOs and intellectual leaders who are ready to race on to the next thing. And indeed, it's an impressively popular thing in that set. In a sense, what's happening is that Wolfram Language shifts from concentrating on mechanics to concentrating on conceptualization, and the key to that conceptualization is broad computational thinking. So how can one learn to do that? It's not really a story of CS, it's really a story of CX. And as a kind of education, it's more like liberal arts than STEM. It's part of a trend that when you automate technical execution, what becomes important is not figuring out how to do things, but what to do. And that's more a story of broad knowledge and general thinking than any kind of narrow specialization. You know, there's sort of an unexpected human centeredness to all of this. We might have thought that with the advance of science and technology, the particulars of us humans would become ever less relevant. But we've discovered that that's not true, and that, in fact, everything, even our physics, depends on how we humans happen to have sampled the ruliad. Before our physics project, we didn't know if our universe really was computational, but now it's pretty clear that it is. And from that, we're sort of inexorably led to the ruliad, with all its kind of vastness so hugely greater than the physical space in our universe. So where will we go in the ruliad? Computational language is what lets us chart our path. It lets us humans define our goals and our journeys. And what's amazing is that all the power and depth of what's out there in the ruliad is accessible to everyone. One just has to learn to harness those computational superpowers, which kind of starts here, you know, our portal to the ruliad. Thank you. (Applause)" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="I'd like to acknowledge and pay my respect to the Anishinaabe Nation and its Council of Three Fires, the Ottawa, the Chippewa, and the Potawatomi peoples. I am grateful to be here on your sacred ancestral lands. Do you see fire as friend or foe? In Australia, we have a growing issue around fire that challenges us every fire season. And because of our changing climate, there are now other places in the world that are confronted with this same challenge. My story is about my personal and cultural relationship with fire. It has been a life-long relationship and as a Mangarda Balladong Nyungar, a person from the southwest corner of Australia, I acknowledge fire not only as a friend but as a part of my being and my spirit. However, I have also seen firsthand how big a threat fire is. During the Black Summer of 2019 and 2020, the east coast of Australia burned like never before. And the whole world saw. The smoke that was huge drifted across the southern Pacific Ocean all the way to Chile and Argentina. And there were glaciers in New Zealand that turned brown from that same smoke. Paradoxically, Australia needs fire. My people applied the right fire diligently and expertly for millennia. It shaped the evolution and the DNA of the landscape and of nature itself. The elder in this shot gently reached down and lit the grass and the ground that we were standing on. As the fire slowly trickled, he said to us, &quot;Go and stand near a tree and observe what you see.&quot; What we saw was amazing. There were all these various insects and critters clambering up the tree trunk, escaping the slow-moving fire. The elder then said to us, &quot;This is the best indication that our burn is the right fire.&quot; Fire has a sacredness when it is applied through our cultural lore. What manifests during the cultural burning is a spiritual enlivening of nature, where country is renewed and the spirit of the land is awakened. Kaarl-ngariny is our sacred practice of burning country. Country, or ancestral lands, in my language is “Boodja.” This is me applying kaarl-ngariny on my sacred lands, Nyungar Boodja. Nyungar Boodja is 200,000 square kilometers in size. This map shows the 14 language groups of my people, the Nyungar nation. My language group is Ballardong. Boodja gives my people identity, connectedness and spirit. This is Aboriginal Australia. At the time of first contact, there were over 800 First Nations language groups and 250 distinctly Indigenous nations. Pre-colonization and for 65,000 years, our lands were managed by cycles of creation through our First Law ways. However, since 1788, Boodja has been suffering from the introduced destructive cycles of colonialism, developmentalism, capitalism and industrialization. These have all contributed significantly to climate change on my Boodja. Part of my relationship with fire included me having an 18-year-long career as a professional firefighter in Perth. It is here that I learned a deep respect for the destructive force of fire and its awesome power. Since fire was considered our enemy, as fierys, we were trained to control it. So we learned about fire behavior and fire management. I would have attended over 2,000 bush fires many of which resulted from controlled burns getting out of control and becoming wildfires. As a professional firefighter, I learned that our mission is to protect property and save life. But as First Nations and traditional custodians of our lands, our two key principles for applying the right fire is to put Boodja first and to keep nature balanced. We cannot keep countries safe by burning everything indiscriminately to the ground. The ground is sacred, and we must protect and preserve it. This is the result of a controlled or prescribed burn. It was carried out by DBCA, an agency in Western Australia that manages parks and wildlife. This type of burning occur when incendiary devices are dropped from aircraft in order to take out as much bushland as possible in the shortest amount of time. This burning is destructive to nature and to Boodja. The burn marks on this jarrah tree, one of our very sacred species, is 10 foot high. This is not consistent with our cultural lore and standards for applying fire. The dark charring indicate the intensity of the heat and the height of the flames. You can see that this landscape is devastated from this controlled burn. I remember a Nyungar elder in my community once very angrily referred to this type of burning and the people that carry it out as “legal arsonists.” Right across Australia, and in many parts of the world, the very real impact of climate change and wildfires are destroying nature in many ways. We must today provide care for Mother Earth like never before. As Nyungar people, our fight to stay connected to our sacred lands is dependent on our ability and freedom to practice kaarl-ngariny. Kaarl-ngariny requires us to be able to read country, keeping Boodja healthy keeps us healthy. This is kaarl-ngariny, the right fire, as it is applied in Queensland, northern Australia. This is what a healthy, clean burn looks like. When we burn the right way, we know country will regenerate in balance. The balanced health is dependent on how and when fire is applied. Remember the right fire at the right time, in the right place. Cultural burns are different across differing ecological regions. This is a cool burn in Victoria, in southeastern Australia. The principles of how, why and when to burn remain consistent across all regions and amongst all First Nations groups. Fire is medicine for country. It heals the land and it cleanses it, and it renews the spirit of Boodja. In 2008, my family took possession of 2,100 acres in our ancestral lands in the wheatbelt region of western Australia. This country had been badly overcleared, overgrazed, overfertilized and overcropped. Our vision, which we saw as our responsibility, was to heal this land. So we set out to plant native endemic species of plants which in turn attracted all sorts of other native birds, animals, flowers and grasses to also return. My brothers and I and our children have been practicing kaarl-ngariny on this Boodja now for 15 years. This is the same photo seven years later. Today, the trees in the foreground are so large, they restrict the view of this landscape. The right fire at the right time is very good for our environment. It's very good for Boodja and it's very good for us. This is it today. A big part of what helped us achieve our goal, our patient ambition, was the application of kaarl-ngariny across our landscape. Kaarl-ngariny is an important element of our First Nations regenerative land management model. This regenerative land management model is a contemporary version of our traditional practice of caring for country. Seeing country in a holistic sense and understanding how it is a part of us and we are a part of it is important in the practice of caring for country. Fire management in Australia is critical to the biodiverse and ecological health of our land. When ecological health is poor or nonexistent, biodiversity and spirit is also poor or nonexistent. Therefore, to heal the spirit of our lands, we must protect, conserve and regenerate the biodiversity and ecology of Boodja everywhere. Fire can be either a very important ally or a massively destructive threat, if we don't commit to manage and apply the right fire at the right time in the right place. Thank you. (Applause)" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="So in college, I was a government major, which means I had to write a lot of papers. Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out a little like this. So, you know -- (Laughter) you get started maybe a little slowly, but you get enough done in the first week that, with some heavier days later on, everything gets done, things stay civil. (Laughter) And I would want to do that like that. That would be the plan. I would have it all ready to go, but then, actually, the paper would come along, and then I would kind of do this. (Laughter) And that would happen every single paper. But then came my 90-page senior thesis, a paper you're supposed to spend a year on. And I knew for a paper like that, my normal work flow was not an option. It was way too big a project. So I planned things out, and I decided I kind of had to go something like this. This is how the year would go. So I'd start off light, and I'd bump it up in the middle months, and then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase. How hard could it be to walk up the stairs? No big deal, right? But then, the funniest thing happened. Those first few months? They came and went, and I couldn't quite do stuff. So we had an awesome new revised plan. (Laughter) And then -- (Laughter) But then those middle months actually went by, and I didn't really write words, and so we were here. And then two months turned into one month, which turned into two weeks. And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline, still not having written a word, and so I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, pulling not one but two all-nighters -- humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters -- sprinted across campus, dove in slow motion, and got it in just at the deadline. I thought that was the end of everything. But a week later I get a call, and it's the school. And they say, &quot;Is this Tim Urban?&quot; And I say, &quot;Yeah.&quot; And they say, &quot;We need to talk about your thesis.&quot; And I say, &quot;OK.&quot; And they say, &quot;It's the best one we've ever seen.&quot; (Laughter) (Applause) That did not happen. (Laughter) It was a very, very bad thesis. (Laughter) I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought, &quot;This guy is amazing!&quot; (Laughter) No, no, it was very, very bad. Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy. I write the blog Wait But Why. And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination. My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me, and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators, and why we are the way we are. Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people. And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator, so I could compare them. I actually brought them here to show you today. I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference. I know that if you're not a trained brain expert, it's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK? So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator. (Laughter) Now ... here's my brain. (Laughter) There is a difference. Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey. Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator? Well, it means everything's fine until this happens. [This is a perfect time to get some work done.] [Nope!] So the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision to do something productive, but the Monkey doesn't like that plan, so he actually takes the wheel, and he says, &quot;Actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan/ Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered that that happened. (Laughter) Then -- (Laughter) Then we're going to go over to the fridge, to see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago. After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much, much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom. (Laughter) &quot;All of that's going to take a while, so we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today. Sorry!&quot; (Sigh) Now, what is going on here? The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel. He lives entirely in the present moment. He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things: easy and fun. Now, in the animal world, that works fine. If you're a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things, you're a huge success! (Laughter) And to the Monkey, humans are just another animal species. You have to keep well-slept, well-fed and propagating into the next generation, which in tribal times might have worked OK. But, if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times. We're in an advanced civilization, and the Monkey does not know what that is. Which is why we have another guy in our brain, the Rational Decision-Maker, who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do. We can visualize the future. We can see the big picture. We can make long-term plans. And he wants to take all of that into account. And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now. Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun, like when you're having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well-earned leisure time. That's why there's an overlap. Sometimes they agree. But other times, it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant, for the sake of the big picture. And that's when we have a conflict. And for the procrastinator, that conflict tends to end a certain way every time, leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the Makes Sense circle. I call it the Dark Playground. (Laughter) Now, the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well. It's where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening. The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn't actually fun, because it's completely unearned, and the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred -- all of those good procrastinator feelings. And the question is, in this situation, with the Monkey behind the wheel, how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone, a less pleasant place, but where really important things happen? Well, turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel, someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments -- someone called the Panic Monster. (Laughter) Now, the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close or there's danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster or some other scary consequence. And importantly, he's the only thing the Monkey is terrified of. Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently, because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk. (Laughter) Now, of course, I said yes. It's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past. (Laughter) (Applause) But in the middle of all this excitement, the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind. He was saying, &quot;Are we clear on what we just accepted? Do we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future? We need to sit down and work on this right now.&quot; And the Monkey said, &quot;Totally agree, but let's just open Google Earth and zoom in to the bottom of India, like 200 feet above the ground, and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country, so we can get a better feel for India.&quot; (Laughter) So that's what we did that day. (Laughter) As six months turned into four and then two and then one, the people of TED decided to release the speakers. And I opened up the website, and there was my face staring right back at me. And guess who woke up? (Laughter) So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind, and a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem. (Laughter) And the Monkey -- remember, he's terrified of the Panic Monster -- boom, he's up the tree! And finally, finally, the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk. Now, the Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior, like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper, and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages. And this entire situation, with the three characters -- this is the procrastinator's system. It's not pretty, but in the end, it works. This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago. When I did, I was amazed by the response. Literally thousands of emails came in, from all different kinds of people from all over the world, doing all different kinds of things. These are people who were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers and lots and lots of PhD students. (Laughter) And they were all writing, saying the same thing: &quot;I have this problem too.&quot; But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails. These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives, about what this Monkey had done to them. And I thought about this, and I said, well, if the procrastinator's system works, then what's going on? Why are all of these people in such a dark place? Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination. Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've given, they all have deadlines. And when there's deadlines, the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved. But there's a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline. So if you wanted a career where you're a self-starter -- something in the arts, something entrepreneurial -- there's no deadlines on those things at first, because nothing's happening, not until you've gone out and done the hard work to get momentum, get things going. There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don't involve any deadlines, like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health, working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship that isn't working. Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things is the Panic Monster, that's a problem, because in all of these non-deadline situations, the Panic Monster doesn't show up. He has nothing to wake up for, so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained; they just extend outward forever. And it's this long-term kind of procrastination that's much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier, short-term deadline-based kind. It's usually suffered quietly and privately. And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, and regrets. And I thought, that's why those people are emailing, and that's why they're in such a bad place. It's not that they're cramming for some project. It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator, at times, in their own lives. The frustration is not that they couldn't achieve their dreams; it's that they weren't even able to start chasing them. So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany -- that I don't think non-procrastinators exist. That's right -- I think all of you are procrastinators. Now, you might not all be a mess, like some of us, (Laughter) and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines, but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren't there. Now, I want to show you one last thing. I call this a Life Calendar. That's one box for every week of a 90-year life. That's not that many boxes, especially since we've already used a bunch of those. So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar. We need to think about what we're really procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating on something in life. We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey. That's a job for all of us. And because there's not that many boxes on there, it's a job that should probably start today. Well, maybe not today, but ... (Laughter) You know. Sometime soon. Thank you. (Applause)" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="The human voice: It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound in the world, probably. It's the only one that can start a war or say &quot;I love you.&quot; And yet many people have the experience that when they speak, people don't listen to them. And why is that? How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world? What I'd like to suggest, there are a number of habits that we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking. I'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list, but these seven, I think, are pretty large habits that we can all fall into. First, gossip. Speaking ill of somebody who's not present. Not a nice habit, and we know perfectly well the person gossiping, five minutes later, will be gossiping about us. Second, judging. We know people who are like this in conversation, and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time. Third, negativity. You can fall into this. My mother, in the last years of her life, became very negative, and it's hard to listen. I remember one day, I said to her, &quot;It's October 1 today,&quot; and she said, &quot;I know, isn't it dreadful?&quot; (Laughter) It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative. (Laughter) And another form of negativity, complaining. Well, this is the national art of the U.K. It's our national sport. We complain about the weather, sport, about politics, about everything, but actually, complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world. Excuses. We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blamethrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility for their actions, and again, hard to listen to somebody who is being like that. Penultimate, the sixth of the seven, embroidery, exaggeration. It demeans our language, actually, sometimes. For example, if I see something that really is awesome, what do I call it? (Laughter) And then, of course, this exaggeration becomes lying, and we don't want to listen to people we know are lying to us. And finally, dogmatism. The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind. You know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are, seven deadly sins of speaking. These are things I think we need to avoid. But is there a positive way to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones, foundations, that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make change in the world. Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is &quot;hail,&quot; and it has a great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition, to greet or acclaim enthusiastically, which is how I think our words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for? See if you can guess. The H, honesty, of course, being true in what you say, being straight and clear. The A is authenticity, just being yourself. A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The I is integrity, being your word, actually doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love, but I do mean wishing people well, for two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want. I mean, my goodness, you look ugly this morning. Perhaps that's not necessary. Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really wishing somebody well, it's very hard to judge them at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously. So hail. Also, now that's what you say, and it's like the old song, it is what you say, it's also the way that you say it. You have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible, and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take away and play with, which will increase the power of your speaking. Register, for example. Now, falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches. You can locate your voice, however. So if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us speak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference? We vote for politicians with lower voices, it's true, because we associate depth with power and with authority. That's register. Then we have timbre. It's the way your voice feels. Again, the research shows that we prefer voices which are rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate. Well if that's not you, that's not the end of the world, because you can train. Go and get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing, with posture, and with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice. Then prosody. I love prosody. This is the sing-song, the meta-language that we use in order to impart meaning. It's root one for meaning in conversation. People who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the word &quot;monotonic&quot; comes from, or monotonous, monotone. Also, we have repetitive prosody now coming in, where every sentence ends as if it were a question when it's actually not a question, it's a statement? (Laughter) And if you repeat that one, it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody, which I think is a shame, so let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very excited by saying something really quickly, or I can slow right down to emphasize, and at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk, is there? We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs. It can be very powerful. Of course, pitch often goes along with pace to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? (Higher pitch) Where did you leave my keys? So, slightly different meaning in those two deliveries. And finally, volume. (Loud) I can get really excited by using volume. Sorry about that, if I startled anybody. Or, I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time. Try not to do that. That's called sodcasting, (Laughter) Imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately. Not nice. Of course, where this all comes into play most of all is when you've got something really important to do. It might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people. It might be proposing marriage, asking for a raise, a wedding speech. Whatever it is, if it's really important, you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on, and no engine works well without being warmed up. Warm up your voice. Actually, let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand up for a moment? I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do. Any time you're going to talk to anybody important, do these. First, arms up, deep breath in, and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that. One more time. Ahhhh, very good. Now we're going to warm up our lips, and we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good. And now, brrrrrrrrrr, just like when you were a kid. Brrrr. Now your lips should be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. Beautiful. You're getting really good at this. And then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally, and if I can only do one, the pros call this the siren. It's really good. It starts with &quot;we&quot; and goes to &quot;aw.&quot; The &quot;we&quot; is high, the &quot;aw&quot; is low. So you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww. Fantastic. Give yourselves a round of applause. Take a seat, thank you. (Applause) Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now let me just put this in context to close. This is a serious point here. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well to people who simply aren't listening in an environment that's all about noise and bad acoustics. I have talked about that on this stage in different phases. What would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously in environments which were actually fit for purpose? Or to make that a bit larger, what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound? That would be a world that does sound beautiful, and one where understanding would be the norm, and that is an idea worth spreading. Thank you. (Applause)" />

          <attvalue for="5" value="TED" />
          <attvalue for="6" value="So anyone who's been paying attention for the last few months has been seeing headlines like this, especially in education. The thesis has been: students are going to be using ChatGPT and other forms of AI to cheat, do their assignments. They’re not going to learn. And it’s going to completely undermine education as we know it. Now, what I'm going to argue today is not only are there ways to mitigate all of that, if we put the right guardrails, we do the right things, we can mitigate it. But I think we're at the cusp of using AI for probably the biggest positive transformation that education has ever seen. And the way we're going to do that is by giving every student on the planet an artificially intelligent but amazing personal tutor. And we're going to give every teacher on the planet an amazing, artificially intelligent teaching assistant. And just to appreciate how big of a deal it would be to give everyone a personal tutor, I show you this clip from Benjamin Bloom’s 1984 2 sigma study, or he called it the “2 sigma problem.” The 2 sigma comes from two standard deviation, sigma, the symbol for standard deviation. And he had good data that showed that look, a normal distribution, that's the one that you see in the traditional bell curve right in the middle, that's how the world kind of sorts itself out, that if you were to give personal 1-to-1 to tutoring for students, then you could actually get a distribution that looks like that right. It says tutorial 1-to-1 with the asterisks, like, that right distribution, a two standard-deviation improvement. Just to put that in plain language, that could take your average student and turn them into an exceptional student. It can take your below-average student and turn them into an above-average student. Now the reason why he framed it as a problem, was he said, well, this is all good, but how do you actually scale group instruction this way? How do you actually give it to everyone in an economic way? What I'm about to show you is I think the first moves towards doing that. Obviously, we've been trying to approximate it in some way at Khan Academy for over a decade now, but I think we're at the cusp of accelerating it dramatically. I'm going to show you the early stages of what our AI, which we call Khanmigo, what it can now do and maybe a little bit of where it is actually going. So this right over here is a traditional exercise that you or many of your children might have seen on Khan Academy. But what's new is that little bot thing at the right. And we'll start by seeing one of the very important safeguards, which is the conversation is recorded and viewable by your teacher. It’s moderated actually by a second AI. And also it does not tell you the answer. It is not a cheating tool. When the student says, &quot;Tell me the answer,&quot; it says, &quot;I'm your tutor. What do you think is the next step for solving the problem?&quot; Now, if the student makes a mistake, and this will surprise people who think large language models are not good at mathematics, notice, not only does it notice the mistake, it asks the student to explain their reasoning, but it's actually doing what I would say, not just even an average tutor would do, but an excellent tutor would do. It’s able to divine what is probably the misconception in that student’s mind, that they probably didn’t use the distributive property. Remember, we need to distribute the negative two to both the nine and the 2m inside of the parentheses. This to me is a very, very, very big deal. And it's not just in math. This is a computer programming exercise on Khan Academy, where the student needs to make the clouds part. And so we can see the student starts defining a variable, left X minus minus. It only made the left cloud part. But then they can ask Khanmigo, what’s going on? Why is only the left cloud moving? And it understands the code. It knows all the context of what the student is doing, and it understands that those ellipses are there to draw clouds, which I think is kind of mind-blowing. And it says, &quot;To make the right cloud move as well, try adding a line of code inside the draw function that increments the right X variable by one pixel in each frame.&quot; Now, this one is maybe even more amazing because we have a lot of math teachers. We've all been trying to teach the world to code, but there aren't a lot of computing teachers out there. And what you just saw, even when I'm tutoring my kids, when they're learning to code, I can't help them this well, this fast, this is really going to be a super tutor. And it's not just exercises. It understands what you're watching. It understands the context of your video. It can answer the age-old question, “Why do I need to learn this?” And it asks Socratically, &quot;Well, what do you care about?&quot; And let's say the student says, &quot;I want to be a professional athlete.&quot; And it says, &quot;Well, learning about the size of cells, which is what this video is, that could be really useful for understanding nutrition and how your body works, etc.&quot; It can answer questions, it can quiz you, it can connect it to other ideas, you can now ask as many questions of a video as you could ever dream of. (Applause) Another big shortage out there, I remember the high school I went to, the student-to-guidance counselor ratio was about 200 or 300 to one. A lot of the country, it's worse than that. We can use Khanmigo to give every student a guidance counselor, academic coach, career coach, life coach, which is exactly what you see right over here. And we launched this with the GPT-4 launch. We have a few thousand people on this. This isn't a fake demo, this is really it in action. And then there is, you know, things that I think it would have been even harder, it would have been a little science fiction to do with even a traditional tutor. We run an online high school with Arizona State University called Khan World School, and we have a student who attends that online school, based in India. Her name's Saanvi. And she was doing a report on &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot; And when she was reading &quot;The Great Gatsby,&quot; Jay Gatsby keeps looking at the green light off into the distance. And she's like, &quot;Why does he do that?&quot; She did some web searches, and people have obviously studied this and commented about the symbolism of that, but none of it was really resonating with her. And then she realized that she had Khanmigo and that she could talk to Jay Gatsby himself. And so, &quot;Ah, splendid choice, old sport. I am now Jay Gatsby, the enigmatic millionaire from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic.” And so, &quot;Why do you keep staring at the green light?&quot; &quot;Ah, the green light, old sport. It's a symbol of my dreams and desires, you see. It's situated at the end of Daisy Buchanan's dock across the bay from my mansion. I gaze at it longingly as it represents my yearning for the past and my hope to reunite with Daisy, the love of my life.&quot; And what was cool is, Saanvi then said, “I had this long conversation,” she called him “Mr. Gatsby,” and at the end she actually apologized for taking his time, which I thought was very polite of her. But you can imagine this unlocks learning literature, learning ... You could talk to historical figures. We're even probably going to add an activity you can talk to like, the Mississippi River. It brings things to life in ways that really were science fiction even six months or a year ago. Students can get into debates with the AI. And we’ve got this here is the student debating whether we should cancel student debt. The student is against canceling student debt, and we've gotten very clear feedback. We started running it at Khan World School in our lab school that we have, Khan Lab School. The students, the high school students especially, they're saying &quot;This is amazing to be able to fine-tune my arguments without fearing judgment. It makes me that much more confident to go into the classroom and really participate.&quot; And we all know that Socratic dialogue debate is a great way to learn, but frankly, it's not out there for most students. But now it can be accessible to hopefully everyone. A lot of the narrative, we saw that in the headlines, has been, &quot;It's going to do the writing for kids. Kids are not going to learn to write.&quot; But we are showing that there's ways that the AI doesn't write for you, it writes with you. So this is a little thing, and my eight year old is addicted to this, and he's not a kid that really liked writing before, but you can say, “I want to write a horror story,” and it says, &quot;Ooh, a horror story, how spine-tingling and thrilling. Let's dive into the world of eerie shadows and chilling mysteries.&quot; And this is an activity where the student will write two sentences, and then the AI will write two sentences. And so they collaborate together on a story. The student writes, &quot;Beatrice was a misunderstood ghost. She wanted to make friends but kept scaring them by accident.&quot; And the AI says, &quot;Poor Beatrice, a lonely spirit yearning for companionship. One day she stumbled upon an old abandoned mansion,&quot; etc. I encourage you all to hopefully one day try this. This is surprisingly fun. Now to even more directly hit this use case. And what I'm about to show you, everything I showed you so far is actually already part of Khanmigo, and what I’m about to show you, we haven't shown to anyone yet, this is a prototype. We hope to be able to launch it in the next few months, but this is to directly use AI, use generative AI, to not undermine English and language arts but to actually enhance it in ways that we couldn't have even conceived of even a year ago. This is reading comprehension. The students reading Steve Jobs's famous speech at Stanford. And then as they get to certain points, they can click on that little question. And the AI will then Socratically, almost like an oral exam, ask the student about things. And the AI can highlight parts of the passage. Why did the author use that word? What was their intent? Does it back up their argument? They can start to do stuff that once again, we never had the capability to give everyone a tutor, everyone a writing coach to actually dig in to reading at this level. And you could go on the other side of it. And we have whole work flows that helps them write, helps them be a writing coach, draw an outline. But once a student actually constructs a draft, and this is where they're constructing a draft, they can ask for feedback once again, as you would expect from a good writing coach. In this case, the student will say, let's say, &quot;Does my evidence support my claim?&quot; And then the AI, not only is able to give feedback, but it's able to highlight certain parts of the passage and says, &quot;On this passage, this doesn't quite support your claim,&quot; but once again, Socratically says, &quot;Can you tell us why?&quot; So it's pulling the student, making them a better writer, giving them far more feedback than they've ever been able to actually get before. And we think this is going to dramatically accelerate writing, not hurt it. Now, everything I've talked about so far is for the student. But we think this could be equally as powerful for the teacher to drive more personalized education and frankly save time and energy for themselves and for their students. So this is an American history exercise on Khan Academy. It's a question about the Spanish-American War. And at first it's in student mode. And if you say, “Tell me the answer,” it’s not going to tell the answer. It's going to go into tutoring mode. But that little toggle which teachers have access to, they can turn student mode off and then it goes into teacher mode. And what this does is it turns into -- You could view it as a teacher's guide on steroids. Not only can it explain the answer, it can explain how you might want to teach it. It can help prepare the teacher for that material. It can help them create lesson plans, as you could see doing right there. It'll eventually help them create progress reports and help them, eventually, grade. So once again, teachers spend about half their time with this type of activity, lesson planning. All of that energy can go back to them or go back to human interactions with their actual students. (Applause) So, you know, one point I want to make. These large language models are so powerful, there's a temptation to say like, well, all these people are just going to slap them onto their websites, and it kind of turns the applications themselves into commodities. And what I've got to tell you is that’s one of the reasons why I didn’t sleep for two weeks when I first had access to GPT-4 back in August. But we quickly realized that to actually make it magical, I think what you saw with Khanmigo a little bit, it didn't interact with you the way that you see ChatGPT interacting. It was a little bit more magical, it was more Socratic, it was clearly much better at math than what most people are used to thinking. And the reason is, there was a lot of work behind the scenes to make that happen. And I could go through the whole list of everything we've been working on, many, many people for over six, seven months to make it feel magical. But perhaps the most intellectually interesting one is we realized, and this was an idea from an OpenAI researcher, that we could dramatically improve its ability in math and its ability in tutoring if we allow the AI to think before it speaks. So if you're tutoring someone and you immediately just start talking before you assess their math, you might not get it right. But if you construct thoughts for yourself, and what you see on the right there is an actual AI thought, something that it generates for itself but it does not share with the student. then its accuracy went up dramatically, and its ability to be a world-class tutor went up dramatically. And you can see it's talking to itself here. It says, &quot;The student got a different answer than I did, but do not tell them they made a mistake. Instead, ask them to explain how they got to that step.&quot; So I'll just finish off, hopefully, you know, what I’ve just shown you is just half of what we are working on, and we think this is just the very tip of the iceberg of where this can actually go. And I'm pretty convinced, which I wouldn't have been even a year ago, that we together have a chance of addressing the 2 sigma problem and turning it into a 2 sigma opportunity, dramatically accelerating education as we know it. Now, just to take a step back at a meta level, obviously we heard a lot today, the debates on either side. There's folks who take a more pessimistic view of AI, they say this is scary, there's all these dystopian scenarios, we maybe want to slow down, we want to pause. On the other side, there are the more optimistic folks that say, well, we've gone through inflection points before, we've gone through the Industrial Revolution. It was scary, but it all kind of worked out. And what I'd argue right now is I don't think this is like a flip of a coin or this is something where we'll just have to, like, wait and see which way it turns out. I think everyone here and beyond, we are active participants in this decision. I'm pretty convinced that the first line of reasoning is actually almost a self-fulfilling prophecy, that if we act with fear and if we say, &quot;Hey, we've just got to stop doing this stuff,&quot; what's really going to happen is the rule followers might pause, might slow down, but the rule breakers, as Alexandr [Wang] mentioned, the totalitarian governments, the criminal organizations, they're only going to accelerate. And that leads to what I am pretty convinced is the dystopian state, which is the good actors have worse AIs than the bad actors. But I'll also, you know, talk to the optimists a little bit. I don't think that means that, oh, yeah, then we should just relax and just hope for the best. That might not happen either. I think all of us together have to fight like hell to make sure that we put the guardrails, we put in -- when the problems arise -- reasonable regulations. But we fight like hell for the positive use cases. Because very close to my heart, and obviously there's many potential positive use cases, but perhaps the most powerful use case and perhaps the most poetic use case is if AI, artificial intelligence, can be used to enhance HI, human intelligence, human potential and human purpose. Thank you. (Applause)" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="“I think what is happening in America is they are building a techno-authoritarian surveillance state.” Carole Cadwalladr, the award-winning journalist behind the Substack newsletter “How to Survive the Broligarchy,” talks to Jon Stewart about how the U.S. government ignored the huge wake-up call that was the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook data breach scandal – a story Cadwalladr broke and which resulted in no legislative protections for citizens’ private data. She warns about the unregulated dangers that data-mining and AI pose to individual privacy and freedom, and what people and institutions can do to push back on big tech’s authoritarian agenda. #DailyShow #JonStewart #CaroleCadwalladr&#10;&#10;Subscribe to The Daily Show:&#10;   / @thedailyshow   &#10;&#10;Follow The Daily Show:&#10;Twitter:   / thedailyshow  &#10;Facebook:   / thedailyshow  &#10;Instagram:   / thedailyshow  &#10;&#10;Stream full episodes of The Daily Show on Paramount+: http://www.paramountplus.com/thedaily...&#10;&#10;Follow Comedy Central:&#10;Twitter:   / comedycentral  &#10;Facebook:   / comedycentral  &#10;Instagram:   / comedycentral  &#10;&#10;About The Daily Show:&#10;Jon Stewart and The Best F**king News Team host The Daily Show, an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning program analyzing the biggest stories in news, politics, and culture through a sharp, satirical lens.

          <attvalue for="6" value="Thank you for joining us. Very surreal. It's very surreal. It's very surreal. I want to introduce you to our audience who might be unfamiliar with your work. Carole was one of the first journalists that broke the Cambridge Analytica data story. This was many years ago-- [CHEERING] --back when nobody was writing about it. And give us a little bit of just that backstory of what happened when you exposed what this group was and what happened to you. Well, basically, Facebook lied repeatedly, you'll be shocked to hear. They said, no, this company, of course, it didn't have our data. This is ridiculous. And then guess what. It turned out that this company, Cambridge Analytica, did have that data, 87 million people's Facebook data taken without their consent. And yeah, and we broke that story. And it turned out it was grossly illegal. And Facebook got fined a record breaking $5 billion by the FTC, $100 million by the SEC, and hundreds of thousands of pounds in other countries around the world. And guess what. Nobody was ever held to account. So Mark Zuckerberg got away with it scot-free. Nothing actually changed. Nothing changed. Nothing changed. Actually, the one person who was put through the ringer during all of this-- Yeah. Yeah. --was you. Well, that's the thing I say. In all of this, we found there was gross lawbreaking at every level by Facebook, by Cambridge Analytica, by the Leave campaigns in Britain, by the Trump campaign. And yet only one person got put on trial. And that was me. JON STEWART: RIght. You were put on trial for discovering this very true thing. And they really tried to destroy you. Yeah. So, well, it was a particular Brexiteer who came after me. And-- The whole term &quot;Brexiteer&quot; makes it sound like Disney. I hate that. Yeah. (SINGING) I'm a Brexiteer. You're a Brexiteer. But they said-- You're not, thank God. I hope. - What? Are you kidding me? I'm in America. We don't care what happens there. [LAUGHTER] No, but it is-- But you were on the cusp of-- Does that story now with Cambridge Analytica sort of siphoning the data from Facebook, weaponizing what would get people agitated, and trying to influence those elections, does that almost seem quaint by today's standards? I mean, I think it's the blueprint in many ways for what we're seeing now, which is that it was the dream of big data, which is what could happen if you take millions of people's data, vast quantities of it-- because what they did, what Cambridge Analytica did, as well as getting access to all of these people's personal-- And it wasn't just-- it's every post they'd ever put on Facebook, every post they'd ever liked, even their private messages. But they combined this with masses and masses of commercially available data. And then what they did is they brought these together to create algorithms, which they then used to target people. It was weaponized against them to send them Facebook ads to provoke them in a certain way. And that is, I think, in many ways now you can see, is the game plan of what we are seeing now, which is that-- There's a question about how effective Cambridge Analytica's methodology was, but the dream of it was this sort of big data surveillance engine in which they would know everything about everybody, and they would know how to provoke you, how to touch every single person, and how to manipulate us. JON STEWART: Was the change of that-- because there is a sense-- you think of that sort of in the capitalist sense or the consumerist sense. Like, I'll be talking to my wife about a certain something, and then the very next thing on Instagram is an advertisement for that very thing. And you think, oh, they've weaponized what we're interested in to get us to buy things. But this is a very different scenario in that they've weaponized it to defang Democratic processes. Yeah, and more. I mean, I think what is happening now in America is absolutely, they are building a techno-authoritarian surveillance state. We can see that happening in real time. This is huge amounts of data on every single person in America that can and will be used in opaque and unaccountable ways. And it is terrifying. JON STEWART: But on the plus side-- [CLEARS THROAT DRAMATICALLY] On the plus side-- So when you hear about that from Palantir, is that-- are you describing something generally? Or are you describing exactly-- like, Palantir is getting all of our data. I mean, that was what they announced. Well, it's DOGE is the tip of the spear here. So this is Elon Musk's unvetted operatives going into every government department, and they're going in to access the databases of those separate departments. And now what's happening is that this company, Palantir, owned by Peter Thiel, a very interesting and-- did you see the adjective I picked there? Slow down. I was like, which adjective shall I go for? We went for &quot;interesting.&quot; This company, owned by Peter Thiel, is now amassing these different pots of data. It's putting it into one massive database, where it's merging them. It's applying AI now to this database. JON STEWART: And what is the AI's purpose? Is it to sift through the data to target you for messaging? Or is it also to prevent you from accessing government programs? I mean, it can be used in so many different ways. And I think that's the difficult thing which is hard for people to get their heads around. But this is a system of control. This is what other authoritarian countries do. JON STEWART: And there's no regulation on this, by the way. There's no regulation. Basically, you had-- since we broke this scandal-- it's 2018, the big story then. And, you know, one of the key things about it was you have no privacy legislation in the US. There is nothing to protect your data. You have no rights here whatsoever apart from California now has a bill. So you had all of this time to do something about it, and you didn't. And-- That doesn't sound like us. [LAUGHTER] Normally, we're quite prompt with this type of activity. I'll go even further. In the Big Beautiful Bill, there is a segment of that that says, for the next 10 years, they are not allowed to legislate or regulate AI in any way, shape, or form. It is prohibited by an act of Congress if this goes through. What does that do to this? It gives them a 10-year head start on whatever it is they want to do with it? I mean, it's just-- it is the tech-- it's the technocratic dream. I mean, this is what these tech bros want. They want to just build their beautiful AIs and do whatever they want in any way that they want so that they can get to Mars and colonize it-- great, glorious goals such as-- But how does any of this square with their so-called libertarian principles? It's nonsense. If there is a centralized control of data run by an opaque algorithm that nobody understands but them, and when they want to make changes-- Grok for, like, a week, no matter what you asked, it was like, do you know South African farmers that are white are being killed? Like, they can do whatever they want. And is the idea that we're supposed to just trust that it's in our best interest? I mean, it's the literal opposite of libertarian. But then that's always the thing. You just have to-- whatever they say, you've just got to realize it's the exact opposite. So the idea that this is libertarian, which is a state-controlled machinery to surveil and control every citizen in America, to deny them access to services, to make inferences about them, about anybody in the country, to label them domestic terrorists based upon what these different databases throw up, it's authoritarian. It's authoritarian. And it's also the pathway to fascism. That is what it is. And that's-- and here's the other thing that really bothers me about it. So everything that we're doing to China, the tariffs and everything else, is because they don't play fair. They steal our IP. They steal-- what is AI if not vacuuming up anything that is proprietary, not just about our work but of our souls? Like, it is sucking up everything that we are and using it for whatever they want to do. And what's our recourse to that? I mean, it is just-- it's based upon totally illegal behavior. It's just theft. It's that you have-- copyright laws are just property laws. You don't go into people's house and then just take their furniture and their stereo and then flog it on eBay and claim that it belongs to you and keep the profit. I mean, that is literally what they are doing. And I mean, this is the Silicon Valley model. This is The Silicon Valley model. And this is exactly what's now being transported into to government, which is, you break the law first. You see if you can get away with it. And generally you do. And do you see-- is it different in the EU? Do they have a sense of the peril of this, and they're acting more robustly? Is this something that you see in the United States as the Wild West? Who is keeping an eye on this? And can we get our own AI to keep an eye on their AI? [LAUGHTER] I mean, I think the point is, in Europe, the dangers of this are much more recent and much more present. So the country-- the one country in the world which does really understand this is Germany. And first, it was Nazism, and then it was Communism. And both of those systems used technology to control and surveil people. And that's why there has been-- So how is-- if this is the Stasi, or this is the KGB, or this is the CIA, look, this country is rife with examples of government, MKUltra and FBI surveillance on Martin Luther King and John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy. We are not unfamiliar with those kinds of police state activities. Is this of a different piece? Is it just that it's more opaque? Is it more efficient at doing it? Are we seeing something really different than we've seen? We are seeing something really different. It's really, really systematic, what's happening. There is already-- we are all of us emitting, you know, hundreds of thousands of data points a day, a week, which are-- they're all being collected somewhere. And so the idea now that those can be brought together and merged in some vast database that is going to profile you, that is going to judge you, that is going to make assumptions about you-- And used for predictive purposes as well. And can be used-- but because it's now we're laying generative AI on top of that-- I mean, you know how bullshit ChatGPT is. I mean, it's not very good. I don't use that. I do my own work. What are you saying, that these questions I just plugged into ChatGPT? But-- [LAUGHTER] It's just easier, Carole. [LAUGHTER] It is, but it's also just pretty dumb. It's stupid. It gets things wrong. It hallucinates. It makes up references. JON STEWART: That's the other thing. And it's that system which is going to be deciding whether you get Medicaid or not? Boy, did you just nail, I think, such a crucial point there. Beyond even the more sort of dystopian visions of where they're going to be taking this is the practical application of a technology that is wildly fallible. That is something that-- they just put out the MAHA report, and apparently there's seven studies in it that don't exist. And nobody thought, like, oh, we should probably check that. You know the whole thing of, like, trying to get through to customer services at any of these tech companies. If you've ever had your Facebook account hacked or your Twitter account, there's no-- you can't get through to anybody. Now imagine that that is you trying to get hold of your whatever it is, your benefits or the services that you're entitled to. JON STEWART: Social Security. - The computer-- Any of those things. Exactly. The computer has just said, no, you don't-- you have got no idea why what that's based on. And then, like, how do you challenge that? What do you do? I mean, that is the reality that is absolutely going to be-- millions of Americans are going to be facing. Right, to try and contact-- and it won't be anybody. It'll just be, for this press 1, but nobody will ever come on the line. Exactly, exactly. And it's-- it's like, if you get turned down, like I say, won't know why. But also, there's no saying that it's based on accurate information whatsoever. JON STEWART: And not transparent in any way by removing the people. Yeah, It's a black box. It's just everything is going to go into some black box. It's going to get mixed up, and it's going to spit out answers. So you've been looking at this for many years. You have faced a great deal of personal repercussion for doing this. You continue to push on it. Is there anything that you've seen within this move that makes you feel like we have the ability to, in any way, slow the inevitability of it? Yes. Oh, Carole. Carole, I got to tell you-- And I'm going to say this to the audience at home. I probably should have started there before everybody was on the ledge. What do you see? Because they're just-- like, all of these tech bros, they are selling absolute bullshit, OK? The whole AI-- [CHEERING] The whole AI scam is a scam. And they're making out that it's inevitable, that we have to-- that they have to-- we're having to chuck millions upon millions of dollars at building better AI because the AI is otherwise going to kill us, and it's going to come anyway. And it's inevitable. It is not inevitable. It is based upon illegal behavior. Take it. Challenge these companies in the courts. Media organizations, stop doing crappy deals with these people. You work for The Guardian. They just were sold to an AI company. They just did a really crappy deal with OpenAI. Or as I say, they married it's rapist. They're rapists. [CROWD GASPS] Ooh. This was the optimistic part of the show. This was the part of the show where you were going to bring us all back from the ledge. And look what you've done! [LAUGHTER] They're all crying again. We can. We have power. We can stand up to these companies. We have to stand up to these companies. We don't pre-obey. We don't make deals with OpenAI. We do try and stand up for-- defend our legal rights. This is law, OK? And that's the one thing which the tech companies, these Silicon Valley platforms just can't tolerate. And that is-- And that's always been their strategy is that they subvert it, and they get away with it. And they get away with it because they act fast. We don't realize until too late. And then it seems too late to try and do anything about it. So we can do stuff about it. And we can also-- we are giving our data to these companies. We have to really think about that. You know, Instagram is not your friend. Don't post your kids' photos on there. I mean, if there's one thing to take away from that is that these companies are now allied to your government, which is, A, I have to get out through the border in a couple of days' time. So I'm slightly wary of what I say. But I mean, it's not in a good place. I understand. The only way I would push back is just to say Instagram is actually my only friend. [LAUGHTER] Carole, I just-- I can't tell you how impressed I am with the work that you've done, that you continue to do, the way that you continue to stand up for this, even when it has cost you such a great deal in your life. Be sure to check out Carole's Substack. It's how to survive the broligarchy, and her nonprofit called The Citizens. Is that correct? - That's correct. The Citizens. Carole Cadwalladr.

Maybe you didn't eat your vegetables i don't know i have no idea all I do know is nothing lights up a crowd of young people like a story about 89year-old golf legend Gary Player except maybe for a warning about trophy wives i tell a story sometimes about a man who was a great great real estate man he ended up getting a divorce found a new wife could you say a trophy wife i guess we can say a trophy wife it didn't work out too well but it doesn't and that doesn't work out too well i must tell you a lot of trophy wives doesn't work out but it made him happy for a little while at least think we just found out what it would be like to take a whole graduating class to visit grandpa in the home i mean how long before we find him wandering in his bathrobe along the side of the road in fairness he did get into military stuff at one point dazzling the graduates with insight into some of the new technology and weaponry that awaits them it's a very different uh war fair out there today now they've introduced a thing called drone right well drone it's It's controlled by a thing called computer he always sounds like a caveman who just got thawed out of a block of ice as far as I know Trump didn't charge the cadetses for the speech that was a freebie unlike the event he had at his golf course an exclusive dinner with the president for the top 220 grifters who purchased his cryptocurrency in large amounts the VIP guest list reportedly shelled out a total of $148 million for the chance to dine with the president of the United States just as our founding fathers intended some of these people paid tens of millions of dollars to be there expecting to get the chance to talk to Trump instead he showed up he spoke for about 15 or 20 minutes he danced his way off stage to YMC he danced out of the room and all the way to the bank and said &quot;No.&quot; He treated these crypto bros like they were his own sons and didn't meet personally with any of them didn't take photos they said the dinner was bad a lot of them left disappointed you know we talk a lot about how much Trump hates people who don't agree with him he also seemed to be too fond of the ones who do one of the items on the menu for dinner was what they called a Trump organic field green salad which is funny because salad is the only thing he knows less about than crypto it's quite an in celebration there are about 200 people in this photo i think about four of them are women and the number one token holder was Chinese-born crypto mogul Justin's son well even Chinese crypto bros are named Justin ain't that something and if that name sounds familiar it's because you remember that dope who blew $6.2 million on a banana duct taped to a wall that's Justin's son so you got some savvy investors here including former Lakers and Clippers star and Kardashian mate Lamar Odum who came out of hiding uh one time Lamar Odin I don't remember spent $75,000 on a 4-day trip to a brothel that is now Lamar's second biggest waste of money but good for him you know this here's how you know this club coin is legitimate when the top holders are former uh sex drug and gambling addicts and Chinese banana collectors it was a turbulent weekend for Donald Trump you know how he promised he would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours well it turns out he hasn't and he's starting to now realize that he may have misjudged his KGBF yeah I'll give you an update i'm not happy with what Putin's doing he's killing a lot of people and I don't know what the hell happened to Putin i've known him a long time always gotten along with him but he's sending rockets into cities and killing people and I don't like it at all okay we're in the middle of talking and he's shooting rockets into Kiev and other cities i don't like it at all he doesn't like it at all i mean what happened he used to be such a sweet guy now he's firing rockets trump has two modes there's the I know more than everyone mode and the I'm just finding out what everyone already knew what do you want to do about that i'm surprised i'm very surprised we'll see what we're going to do what am I going to tell you you're the fake news aren't you you're totally fake all right any other questions i don't like what Putin is doing not even a little bit he's killing people and something happened to this guy and I don't like it something happened huh what happened this is not the Putin I married so this morning Trump issued a sternly worded something he wrote &quot;What Vladimir Putin doesn't realize is that if it weren't for me lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia and I mean really bad he's playing with fire.&quot; Well that should do it that should Vladimir Putin poisons people and throws them out windows you think you're going to scare him with the title of a John Cena movie but Trump isn't the only elder statesman with a a friend in need king Charles was in Canada today to show his support for the Commonwealth during this difficult time the King delivered an uncharacteristically fiery speech this morning in front of the Canadian Parliament [Laughter] [Music] sentences won't someone please come lick the royal thumb next i want to see him try to open a Capri Sun that would be better so then once once he was able to pry the Manila envelope pages apart the king spoke not just with power but also with grace every time I come to Canada a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream and from there straight to my heart gross i don't know sound like somebody went a little nuts on the poutine and while Charles had trouble showing who's in charge in Canada no one had a longer weekend than the president of France Emanuel Mcronone do you see the video of him getting smacked by his wife so the Mcron landed in Vietnam and and they open the doors and then you can see there he is in the back and you see his wife Rajit shoves him in the he realized he's on camera he gives a little bone shore let's see that again because you can see here um two hands straight to the head and then uh it's what the French call sakre blue this video was immediately everywhere mcronone claimed afterwards that they were joking around and I don't know about you I would have been open to believing that had I not watched them get off the plane and walk down the stairs because you can see he shakes this guy's hand now he offers his wife who has just um pushed him uh no no thank you she doesn't take the arm very Melania of her it's uh but who knows maybe they were joking we're looking at at this through American eyes they probably just finished having sex with the flight attendant you know a slap is how the French put a button on a manager that's how you know it's over it wasn't exactly a freakoff let's just say that have you been following this Diddy trial GMO no I haven't you have You do have a new um thing on your Yeah I have a new boot thank God yes okay very good well I will tell you things aren't looking pretty for Diddy right now the court heard testimony today from one of his former assistants a woman named Capricorn Clark who said on her first day on the job he told her &quot;If anything happens I will have to kill you.&quot; Which is a heck of a way to say welcome to the team it's not a great orientation but Kid Cuddy testified he said Diddy snuck into his house and unwrapped his family's Christmas presents which I would very much like to see depicted in a Hallmark Channel holiday movie at some point we can wait but Cuddi also claimed Diddy blew up his Porsche with a Molotov cocktail which is rude and then they asked Capricorn Clark about this today and she said she had no idea how Diddy and his security guy broke into Kid Cuy's house though considering everything we know about how much baby oil he used he's he probably slid in through the mail slot now I mentioned last week people have been going nuts online about the courtroom sketches people are are fascinated because they say they don't look anything like Diddy or the witnesses but it's easy to say that when you know who you're looking at they know it's Diddy to start with so they're biased so we decided to consult a jury of pedestrians who had not seen the drawings had no information about them at all we sent a team out to Hollywood Boulevard with the actual courtroom sketches to ask a simple question who is this who is this man i have no idea who is this um I have no idea i have no idea i have no clue he's either in the Lakers or he is in prison um it's not Malcolm X it's not MLK nero wasn't he some kind of leader or ruler was that the guy that just brought me over here ash I actually kind of see it who is this rodney Kenny i don't know jeffrey upstag came to mind not OJ Simpson is it and who's the attorney he's hugging johnny Cochran do you think OJ was innocent i would it's like I'm 50/50 with that one who is this man sean Cole that's him again that's him that's him again that's definitely him oh that's him in the hotel mom how did you hurt your neck oh I dislocated my shoulder did you slip on baby oil i know that's my hair gmo do you know how many subscribers we have on YouTube now uh 20 millions that's right yeah that's why we're wearing these glasses thanks for being a subscriber if you're not help us get to 20 million and one [Music]" />

Summer is almost here This weekend this weekend is Memorial Day a solemn occasion that we all mark in our own way Perhaps putting up a flag remembering a loved one who served or perhaps most solemn of all sipping your way through Memorial Day with $3 Duncan refreshers Thank you Thank you for your service tropical guava It's the kickoff to the summer travel season Of course big big road trip weekend Shotgun This year this year is expected to break travel records with more than 45 million Americans expected to hit the road And they are all in line ahead of you at the bathroom for the 995 James Fenmore Cooper service area right now Just gas up the car cuz they're going to be there for a while A lot of people are flying too That might be a problem Uh because with the FAA snafuss recently airlines are bracing for the summer of hell Yeah Or as Spirit Airlines calls it summer Of course a big part of the issue is safety concerns with air traffic control problems causing flight delays and cancellations In fact at this point it's not even safe to feed your baby And here comes the airplane Oh god Oh god No His mouth is Newark Pull up Pull up Pull up I'm sorry Your peas are being rerouted to Baltimore It's It's going to be harder to go abroad as well because the weakened value of the dollar is making overseas travel more expensive for Americans Explains why Delta has launched their new international flight classes economy minus dog crate plus and stand with the creature on the wing of the plane But if you are traveling ab abroad please be careful coming back because due to the new administration expanding uh phone searches for Americans re-entering the country you will definitely want to delete your nudes Wow Wh why why should I delete my nudes they're a lot more flattering than the lumpy outline of my fat kester in that scanner stance that you have to do Really i know what you're looking at And I you know I like to take a little lead paint and leave him a message down [Laughter] there Not a Wow Not a particularly long message Just Just Hi Trump continues to be obsessed with getting rid of what he calls woke programming uh down at the Kennedy Center This winter he fired the old Kennedy Center board named himself the new Kennedy Center chair and this week he said this at a dinner for the new regime We had some very inappropriate shows to put it I think to put it very nicely They had dance parties for quote queer and trans youth They had a Marxist anti- police performance and they had uh lesbian only Shakespeare Yes Yeah Oh yeah Oh yeah Yeah Absolutely You know those lesbian only Shakespeare plays like Lov's Labia lost and Julius Scissors and Thank you Thank you Thank you For the record we tried but we haven't been able to find a lesbianonly Shakespeare at the Kennedy Center though it would be totally cool if it was Uh some are some are speculating that Trump was referring to a recent touring production of And Juliet which is a musical which asked the question &quot;What would happen next if Juliet didn't end it all over Romeo?&quot; Uh I'm guessing she'd be in therapy for a while I mean she's 13 years old and she wakes up in a tomb next to her dead boyfriend Wherefore art thou Lexapro another thing another Lexapro fans There you go Get in line Another thing another thing that Trump has railed against is drag performances down at the Candace Center But even though he's in charge now the new season is full of drag including drag performances in Mulan Rouge Chicago and Mrs Doubtfire Mrs Doubtfire That whole thing is drag Oh if it's a drag they're going to have to quickly rewrite that one as Mr Straight Water Hello Hello my own children I am your new manly nanny Time to grill you a steak Oh no my testicles are ablaze Not Not my breast cuz I don't have them Cuz I am a man Uh the uh the vice trump uh the vice trump JD Vance is uh he's in the news He's he's in the he's in the news again Good for him Um after probably not killing Pope Francis It seems I mean probably not right That probably probably didn't happen It probably didn't happen No way to prove it but it probably didn't Seems like our vice president is taking a unique approach with the new pontiff because JD Vance says he and the pope discussed online dating during their private meeting Dude know your audience The guy is celibate Good lord Oh hey Just wanted to pop by this AA meeting to see if anyone has any thoughts on the new black cherry flavored White Claw I think it's too sweet What do you think what it's White Claw Just try it Vance explained on a podcast I talked to the to the Holy Father about this today You know if you look at basic dating behavior among young people and I think a lot of this is is the the dating apps are probably more destructive than we fully appreciate I'm going to say JD Vance's views on this may not be as valuable as he thinks considering considering the last dating app he was on was Raymore and Flanigan Not true It didn't happen He never did it and I do not care the uh the vice president continued I think part of it is technology has just for some reason made it harder for young men and young women to sort of communicate with each other in the same way Yes these days the technology makes it harder In the old days it was so much simpler Nice to meet you I just gave your father my finest goat Let us go make children Come on Come on We also have an update about Trump's interim US attorney for Washington DC Former Fox News host Janine Pro seen here swearing she's good to drive Give me the keys Hannity Judge Janine's been on the job for just one week For one week but yesterday she dropped this bombshell filing Hi everyone it's Judge Janine I'm at the water cooler in the United States Attorney's office in Washington DC Okay that's a new office fear unlocked It now goes running into Judge Janine at the water cooler calling your boss dad and getting a text from your wife about your prescription hemorrhoid cream while screen sharing in a meeting And then when you try to stop screen sharing your computer starts playing the last song you were listening to And yeah it's Gangdom Style precast version Oh how many times how many times Piro Piro continued the US attorneys as well as a staff in order to get water they have to join a water club and they have to pay It's a duespaying membership and today they asked for our patience Why because we couldn't get water delivered today Today there was no water delivered to the United States Attorney's Office Now ain't it grand to be a part of the government and I'm just thrilled to be here You know you could quit You could No one's shackling you to a radiator But you know what to be fair I get why she's upset Without water in her glass is harder for her to pretend that she isn't drinking vodka In baby news Go Oh in baby news yesterday the morning broadcast up at CBS's own WRGB Albanesey's news leader got off to an unusual start Good Wednesday morning I'm Olivia JW and I'm Julia Dunn We do have some breaking news this morning Literally Olivia's water has broke and she is anchoring the news now in active labor Early labor Early labor Okay Some people were shocked but I know that staying at the desk while in labor is a CBS news tradition We all We all remember how Kronhite used to sign off And that's the way it is Oh my water broke Put down some towels What a mess That's every night Every every night his water broke Yeah hard to stay hydrated And the thing is that's not the only upstate baby in the news Uh up at the uh the University of Buffalo something happened at their commencement last weekend One of the graduates tried to bring his baby on stage which is apparently against the rules and it led to the dumbest police chase of all time Wow Hot pursuit Really really cops a baby he even has a little cap and gown on up there And what was the ultimate plan all right Down on the ground All right Now now lift your head a little bit Come on buddy You can do it I know you hate tummy time but it's making you big and strong The dad says he had previously asked the administration if he could bring his baby up with him and he was told that he could But then when he got to graduation the answer changed According to the university only graduating students may participate in the graduation ceremony including walking in the processional and crossing the stage And the infant has not yet earned enough credits to receive a diploma We hope to see him back on stage in about 20 years so we can follow in his dad's footsteps Well that was a cute little response there But personally I don't think a baby should have to wait that long So tonight the Late Show is awarding this infant this bachelor's in baby There you go A bachelor's in babies Now like most recent grads like most recent grads uh he he does not have a job lined up yet and uh he's going to be living with his mom and dad for a while We got a great show for

to his uh tariffs over half of US companies say they will have to raise prices [Music] what what no no not companies that's where I get things what am I supposed to do now make things i don't even I don't even I don't know what they're made of well at least some companies are giving us a warning nissan has told dealers that it won't raise prices until at least June 2nd woo thank god I stocked up my pantry is always full of Ultimas given this news that's a great graphic don't given the Given this news it's no surprise that consumer confidence has hit a record low and it's not just consumers last week America lost its last AAA rating in its credit after a downgrade by the rating agency's Moody's well of course they're going to give us a bad rating they're Moody's why haven't we tried their competitor Good Attitudies so smart think the bad economy is even affecting people's love lives according to a new study nearly two in three Americans think frugality is an attractive trait and oh yeah and a majority of Americans said using a coupon on a date is perfectly acceptable oh yeah coupons are hot y'all and if you're feeling freaky maybe a group maybe all of us should take the pottery class and Americans don't just like deals they are horny for deals because 28% of people in the study said frugality is sexy that is going to give rise to a whole new type of pickup lines hey

there's no stopping it now unless unless it's landing at Newark and there you go there you go yeah there you go there it is and he's not alone trump's love of free jets has evidently inspired Secretary of Homeland Security and woman whose body is full of macrolastics Christy Gnome uh Secretary Gnome's been crisscrossing the country for photo ops and immigration raids and she wants to travel in style because lastm minute changes to the Coast Guard's proposed budget includes a request for a new $50 million luxury jet for Gnome's personal use what the hell is going on first Trump now Gnome come on guys what's wrong with Greyhound you know their motto Greyhound the bathroom door is meant to swing open like that [Applause] yesterday uh Secretary Gnome testified at a Senate hearing where she was asked about habius corpus which is the foundational right dating back to English common law that says a person cannot be detained by the government without trial because without habius corpus your government can just pop a bag over your head and drop you in a hole and nobody gets to say nothing but evidently Christine Gnome did not gnome that secretary Gnome what is habius corpus well habius corpus is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country no no no that is extra large wrong well the the first amendment means Donald Trump is always first in line the second amendment means he always gets seconds and no one gets Miranda rights because he's more of a Charlotte up on Capitol Hill Trump's been pushing his his big beautiful bill and uh we learned today was it today we learned that Trump's uh dream of building a nationwide missile defense system that he calls the Golden Dome yes gold because when I think impenetrable I think of stuff that pirates can bend with their teeth known for their dental hygiene pirates so to promote the protected gold dome yesterday Trump showed off some flashy posters in the oval including one with a quote emphasizing that this is a very dangerous world from renowned military analyst President Donald J trump that is so stupid and that's that's not just me saying it that's a direct quote from Late Show host Steven T colbear [Applause] he also had a poster showing a detailed schematic of the Great Golden Dome which protects the continental United States but not evidently Alaska or Hawaii i mean well they don't really need it they're already protected by their fortified boxes during the announcement During the announcement Trump talked about how America is finally worth defending our country was cold as ice a year ago and now we have the hottest country in the world this is the hottest country in the world we've went from being uh laughed at all over the world and

          <attvalue for="2" value="3" />
          <attvalue for="3" value="Ukraine’s future in NATO is now officially backed by all 32 alliance members. At a June 2 summit in Vilnius, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte confirmed that Ukraine is on an “irreversible path” to membership. The commitment counters Russian demands to halt further NATO expansion toward its borders.&#10;&#10;With leaders from the Bucharest Nine and Northern Europe pledging continued support, Ukraine’s position within the alliance is clearer than ever. The upcoming NATO summit at The Hague, scheduled for June 24–26, will likely shape the next steps in the country’s long-awaited accession process.&#10;&#10;Support us directly as we bring you independent, up-to-date reporting on military news and global conflicts by clicking here:    / @themilitaryshow  &#10;&#10;#militarystrategy #militarydevelopments #militaryanalysis&#10;#themilitaryshow &#10;&#10;SOURCES: https://pastebin.com/TKetXVxq" />

          <attvalue for="6" value="Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began, nations  of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,   or NATO Alliance, have stood by Ukraine.  They’ve shown support in various ways, with   many sending vital arms packages to the country,  helping it fend off repeated Russian attacks.  However, despite the pleas of Ukrainian  president, Volodmyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine has   not been allowed to join the alliance and  enjoy all the benefits membership brings.  But that’s going to change. At a recent summit involving   multiple key European leaders, as well as the  NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, leaders   strongly reiterated their support for Ukraine’s  future in NATO – reaffirming that the country   will eventually join the alliance, despite any  objections from Russian President Vladimir Putin.  The news came from the Bucharest Nine  and Northern European summit in the   Lithuanian capital of Vilnius on June 2. Those in attendance included leaders from   several Northern European nations, like Sweden and  Finland, as well as representatives from all nine   members of the Bucharest Nine, or B9 organization. B9 formed in 2015 in Bucharest, Romania,   unifying nine member nations: Bulgaria, the  Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia,   Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Its formation was a response to perceived   Russian aggression at the time, as Russia had,  in 2014, forcefully taken control of Crimea,   annexing it from Ukraine. Understandably, the  B9 nations, all of which are geographically and   historically close to Russia, were concerned that  their territory could be targeted in the future,   so decided to join forces, hosting regular  meetings, sharing information, and so on.  This particular summit was organized to allow  the B9 and Northern European nations to align   their respective security positions, strengthen  cooperation along the eastern flank of NATO,   and talk about how they might continue  supporting and aiding Ukraine ahead of the   upcoming NATO summit, scheduled to take  place at The Hague from June 24 to 26.  President Zelenskyy was also in  attendance, and a large part of the   discussions focused on Ukraine and its future. After hearing from Zelenskyy and discussing with   one another, the B9 and Northern European  leaders were in complete agreement:   they pledged to continue political, military,  economic, and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, with   the long-term aim of securing peace in the region. The summit chairs, including the President of the   Republic of Lithuania, Gitanas Nausėda,  President of the Republic of Poland,   Andrzej Duda, and President of Romania, Nicușor  Dan, all later shared a detailed statement,   outlining what was discussed during the meeting  and what conclusions the various leaders came to.  The statement repeatedly highlighted the  ever-present threat that Russia poses,   and the importance of a strong and  unified NATO push back against Putin:  “We met today at a pivotal moment when the  security environment continues to deteriorate as   Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine claims  lives, causes civilian suffering and violates   international norms and agreements. Russia remains  the most significant, long term, and direct threat   to Euro-Atlantic security and NATO must further  adapt its approach towards Russia. The Alliance   must be prepared for all possible contingencies.” The statement went on to discuss the power and   importance of the NATO alliance, and the shared  responsibility of its members to protect one   another and promote peace across the world. It also highlighted the attending members’   commitments to the cause, noting that they  were all gradually moving towards the target   of spending a minimum of 5% of their respective  GDPs on defense and defense-related investments,   as well as pushing for a strong Trans-Atlantic  defense industry, with faster production, smarter   procurement, and more international collaboration. The statement also condemned Russia’s aggression,   while also calling out several of the countries  that have supported the Kremlin’s cause,   like Iran, China, Belarus, and North Korea. Most importantly, it once more reaffirmed   all of the nations’ shared support for Ukraine: “We reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine’s   independence, sovereignty, and territorial  integrity within its internationally recognized   borders. Territorial integrity is a fundamental  and irreplaceable principle of international law,   which must be respected and always protected. We  reaffirm that the security of Ukraine is integral   part of the security of the Euro-Atlantic region. We will continue our political, military,   economic and humanitarian support to  put Ukraine in the strongest possible   position to reach a comprehensive, just, and  lasting peace, based on the principles of the   UN Charter and international law.” That’s all great news for Ukraine,   but it wasn’t the most important  statement to emerge from the summit.  No, that statement came from NATO’s  Secretary General, Mark Rutte,   when he was asked if Ukraine should become part of  NATO by 2030. He was unequivocal in his response: “Well, you know that when it comes to  Ukraine in Washington, there was a clear   commitment by all 32 Allies that there is an  irreversible path for Ukraine to come into NATO.   Not with an end date, not understanding  this as part of a peace settlement,   but clearly as a longer-term commitment by all  32 Allies. And we are building that bridge as   we speak with the command in Wiesbaden, with - in  Poland - JATEC, which is capturing all the lessons   and, of course, all the other cooperation  ongoing between NATO countries and Ukraine.”  A clear statement, and one that should send  shockwaves throughout the Kremlin, right to the   desk of Russian President Vladimir Putin, himself. Putin has consistently argued against NATO   membership for Ukraine, as Russia is deeply  concerned about the idea of having NATO forces   so close to its borders. He has even claimed  that the threat of NATO expansion was one   of the primary reasons behind the Ukraine  invasion itself. Indeed, in February 2022,   weeks before the invasion began, Putin gave a  speech, warning of the risks of Ukraine becoming   a NATO member. In that speech, he stated: “Do you understand it or not,   th at if Ukraine joins NATO and attempts  to bring Crimea back by military means,   the European countries will be automatically  pulled into a war conflict with Russia? Of course,   NATO’s and Russia’s potentials are incomparable.  We understand it. But we also understand that   Russia is one of the leading nuclear states and  by some modern components it even outperforms   many. There will be no winners. And you will be  pulled into this conflict against your will.”  Additionally, ever since the idea of peace  talks or a possible ceasefire in the war has   been brought up, Putin and other Kremlin officials  have repeatedly demanded that Ukraine be barred   from joining the NATO alliance. In June 2024, for example,   President Putin said that Russia was offering  a “concrete, real peace proposal” to Kyiv.  In that proposal, Putin outlined his terms: “As soon as Kiev agrees to these conditions,   agrees to completely withdraw its troops from  the DPR, LPR, Zaporozhye and Kherson regions and   actually launches this process, we are ready to  start negotiations without delay. I repeat, our   principled position is as follows: the neutral,  non-aligned, non-nuclear status of Ukraine,   its demilitarization and denazification.” Putin has doubled down on those   demands in recent days and weeks. One Russian official stated that “Putin   is ready to make peace, but not at any price.” Allegedly, the Russian President wants a   written pledge from major Western nations to not  enlarge the NATO alliance any further eastwards,   towards Russia. That would, effectively,  rule out NATO membership for Ukraine,   as well as other nations that have shown interest  in joining the alliance, such as Georgia,   Moldova, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Putin also is said to want Ukraine to   be essentially declared a neutral state, without  any alignment to Western nations like the U.S. or   parts of Western Europe, so that it could not be  turned against Russia in any way moving forward.  It’s easy to imagine why  Putin is making these demands.  Should Ukraine ultimately join NATO, it would  represent a massive failure in the story of   his leadership so far, as well as bringing  the alliance – which he sees as one of,   if not the biggest threat to Russia’s  future – even closer to his borders.  With Sweden and Finland recently joining  NATO – the former in March 2024 and the   latter in April 2023 – the alliance has been  creeping ever closer to Russia, slowly putting   pressure on the Kremlin and limiting any  possible routes of invasion or territorial   gains it might try to make in the future. It seems, for the time being, that Russia will   not acquiesce to any peace deals unless Ukraine’s  NATO membership is completely off the table.  But, based on Mark Rutte’s words, NATO  is not going to back down on this.  Ukraine will be part of the alliance. It’s no  longer a case of if it will happen, but when.  And the country has already been waiting quite  some time. In fact, it was way back in 2008,   at the Bucharest Summit, that NATO leaders made  the decision that Ukraine would eventually become   a member of the alliance. And perhaps that was the  very moment that Putin started to put his plans   into action, eventually annexing Crimea in 2014  before launching the full-scale invasion in 2022.  It’s not uncommon for the process of a country  joining NATO to take several years, though the   timing varies massively from country to country. In the case of Finland and Sweden, for instance,   they both applied to join NATO on the same  day: 18 May 2022. Allied leaders agreed to   invite both countries into the alliance mere  months later, in June 2022, and they were   both in the alliance within two years. In other cases, it takes much longer.  Montenegro, for example, was first invited  to NATO’s Membership Action Plan (MAP) in   2009. It began accession talks at the end of  2015, signed the Accession Protocol in 2016,   and officially became a member in 2017. So,  the whole process took around eight years.  The Republic of Macedonia, meanwhile, had to  wait over two decades to join the alliance. It   joined the MAP in 1999, but didn’t begin accession  talks with NATO leaders until 2018, and eventually   became a fully fledged NATO member in 2020. So, there’s no telling exactly how long it   might take until Ukraine is granted NATO  status. It’s very likely that any accession   talks and agreements will not take place until  after the war is over, or at least until a   ceasefire of some sort has been established. Still, that hasn’t stopped the Ukrainian   President, Volodomyr Zelenskyy,  pushing to accelerate the process.  In fact, back in 2022, not long after the  invasion began, Ukraine submitted a request   for an accelerated entry of Ukraine into NATO.  At the ime, Zelenskyy argued that Ukraine had   already demonstrated it could completely comply  with NATO rules and values, and that it should be   allowed to follow in the footsteps of countries  like Finland and Sweden, which both enjoyed   relatively speedy access to the alliance. Zelenskyy has even gone as far as saying   he will step down as president of Ukraine if it  means that the country can be allowed into NATO.  These comments came in February of 2025, around  three years after the war began, and in the   wake of comments from the U.S. President, Donald  Trump, who had earlier accused Zelenskyy of being   a “dictator without elections.” Zelenskyy said:  “If to achieve peace you really need me to give  up my post – I'm ready. I can trade it for Nato   membership, if there are such conditions.” This demonstrates just how desperate and   eager Ukraine is to be a part of the  alliance, so Zelenskyy and his people   will surely be happy to hear the recent  statements from the Vilnius summit.  And it’s no exaggeration at all to say that NATO  membership would be a game-changer for Ukraine.  The country would instantly enjoy a whole host  of new benefits, protections, and much stronger   connections with allies across the Western world. Arguably the most important of those benefits   is NATO’s Article 5, which states: “The Parties agree that an armed attack   against one or more of them in Europe or North  America shall be considered an attack against   them all and consequently they agree that, if such  an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise   of the right of individual or collective  self-defence recognized by Article 51 of   the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the  Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith,   individually and in concert with the other  Parties, such action as it deems necessary,   including the use of armed force, to restore and  maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.”  In a nutshell, it means that any  attack on any NATO member is seen   as an attack on the entire alliance. And  the entire alliance will respond in full.  So, had Ukraine already been in NATO at the time  of Russia’s invasion in February 2022, it would   have been seen as war on NATO, and every member  – from the U.S. to the U.K., France, Germany,   and all of the other allied nations – would  retaliate, fighting side by side with Ukraine as   a collective force to counter Russia’s aggression. Indeed, with the colossal amounts of firepower on   the NATO side, led by the world’s most powerful  military force – the United States – Russia   would likely have never even contemplated the  idea of invading Ukraine in the first place,   despite President Putin’s bluster and boasting. The truth of the matter is that   Russia is no match for NATO. Even at a time when Russia has   ramped up military recruitment – even going as  far as offering up to $40,000 payments to those   who join the fight – and plans to expand its  army to up to 1.5 million active-duty members,   it’s a comparatively small force when put side by  side with NATO, which can call on more than 3.4   million active soldiers, as well as millions more  across its member states, should they be needed.  Recent statistics also show  that NATO would effectively   dominate Russia in almost any field of combat. In the skies, for example, NATO boasts around more   than 22,000 aircraft, which dwarfs Russia’s tally  of just under 4,300. NATO has far more fighters,   interceptors, transport aircraft, tanker aircraft,  and helicopters than Russia could ever muster, and   would easily overwhelm the Russian aerial forces,  especially with the aid of the U.S. Air Force,   which has the fastest, stealthiest, and most  powerful fighter jets and bombers on the planet.  At sea, too, NATO wins outright. It has over  1,100 military ships to call on in total,   more than double Russia’s total of 419. It has  16 aircraft carriers, while Russia has just one,   along with more than ten times more destroyers  and frigates, plus higher numbers of patrol boats,   submarines, and minesweepers. On the ground, meanwhile,   Russia has long been seen as one of the world’s  leading forces in terms of its numbers of tanks   and armored vehicles. And it’s true that Russia  does have a strong track record in this area,   boasting around 5,750 battle tanks, total, plus  thousands of armored vehicles and pieces of towed   and self-propelled artillery. But NATO still has  so much more firepower to call on, including over   11,000 tanks and thousands of armored vehicles. Even with home-ground advantage and all that   goes with it, Russia’s military would  be extremely likely to buckle, break,   and perish beneath the sheer might of NATO forces.  Plus, the power of NATO lies in its collaboration,   with military strategists and leaders from  32 member nations all able to work together,   exchange ideas, share intelligence, and support  one another’s efforts. It’s the strongest   collaborative force the world has ever seen,  the ultimate deterrent to another large-scale,   global war, and even Putin, with all his pride in  the Russian army and increased defense spending,   year after year, would be foolish to square  up against a force of such size and power.  Indeed, the only area in which Russia can  match NATO is in nuclear weapons. NATO has   three nuclear powers in its ranks – the U.S.,  U.K., and France – combining for around 5,177   nuclear warheads. Russia has a similarly  sized arsenal, with estimates around 5,459   nuclear warheads, including deployed, reserve,  and retired warheads awaiting dismantlement.   The exact numbers vary slightly depending  on the source, but in any case, the only   way Russia could even come close to coping with a  war with NATO would be to launch nuclear weapons.  And that’s something that even Putin would  be unlikely to want, as in a nuclear war,   nobody truly wins. Instead, there would be  colossal devastation and tremendous, unprecedented   loss of life on both sides, all over the globe. So, if Ukraine can eventually find a way to end   this war via diplomatic means, secure a ceasefire,  and then go on to become part of NATO, it will,   in effect, be at far lower risk of any  future Russian invasions or aggression.  Russia, meanwhile, would have to deal with the  fact that almost its entire eastern border,   stretching from Finland in the north past  Estonia, Latvia, and down to Ukraine in the south,   would be made up of NATO nations and completely  off-limits in regard to any military maneuvers.  The only nation along the border that would not  be part of NATO at that point would be Belarus,   which is one of the very few  strong allies Russia has left.  Ukraine’s NATO membership would also bring  other big benefits to the country, especially   its armed forces. They would enjoy newfound  access to the advanced military technology,   research projects, training programs,  and intelligence-sharing agreements that   exist among NATO member nations, which would  dramatically strengthen the Ukrainian military.   The country would also be expected to uphold  NATO standards in defense spending, investment,   and modernization, which could bring some  much-needed upgrades in case of future attacks.  There would likely be an economic boost, too. If Ukraine was part of NATO, other countries would   be likely to do more business with it, as the  country would be seen as a more stable and secure   trading partner, without the ever-present threat  of further Russian aggression. Ukraine’s people   would inevitably benefit from major investments  and trade deals, bolstering the quality of life   among the people, and helping Ukraine grow on  the global stage, exerting more influence and   perhaps even becoming a part of other unions  or alliances, like the EU, at some stage.  In short, it would be hugely beneficial across  the board, and even though Russia will surely   continue to argue against it, NATO should  remain steadfast in its pledge to bring Ukraine   into the alliance as soon as the time is right.

          <attvalue for="6" value="♪ (&quot;LAST WEEK TONIGHT&quot; THEME PLAYS) ♪ Our main story tonight concerns farming. Farms are where we get our food, our metaphors about fascism, and they are even the subject of surprisingly popular video games like this. NARRATOR: I played Farming Simulator. A whole new world was revealed to me. Agriculture, animal husbandry... (SHEEPS BLEATING) ...forestry, and a lot of exciting machinery. Never cultivated a field before and... (SIGHS) Oh boy, let me tell you about spraying a field with the double application rate and dynamic working width. That's something else. Believe me, farming is easy. Mastering it is a challenge. And there's always time to relax. You know, I have great news for that guy who's &quot;never cultivated a field before.&quot; You still haven't. You haven't grown a vegetable, you haven't sprayed anything with a double rate of anything and you haven't even really watched any barnyard animals go to pound town. That game is to farming what Call of Duty is to war. It looks similar, but if you were ever called upon to do the real thing, you would be categorically fucked. Now, that farmer looks pretty much like the stereotypical one in most people's minds. A white guy in overalls on a tractor. It's a trope drawn straight from children's picture books where farmers always seem to be a white man with some straw in his mouth who's holding an adorable little piglet that, while the book skips over it, he does eventually kill and eat. But while some farmers do indeed look like that, many of the people doing some of the hardest work on farms, hired farm laborers, do not. There are roughly one and a half million hired farm workers in the US. Mostly crop workers. And government estimates indicate that most of those are foreign born, and among them, the majority are undocumented. And this has been an open secret for years now. Just watch this interview with a farm owner from 2009 quickly take a turn. JASON MARGOLIS: MARGOLIS: MARGOLIS: Cut the camera. MARGOLIS: We talked off-camera, and a few minutes later, Myers allowed us to resume the interview. The legal documentation that has been presented to me is they are legal. Oh. Oh, they are, are they? I've gotta say, that is not a particularly convincing bit of misdirection there. Cover-wise, it's about as effective as a camouflage outfit that just says, &quot;Not a guy&quot; on it. The truth is, farms depend heavily on foreign-born workers to do harvesting and picking, as many crops are too delicate to be mechanized. That is why... And by and large, American citizens have shown very little interest in doing that. In fact, when Washington State spent thousands on an advertising campaign to find US farm workers in 2021, it resulted in... But over the past decade and a half, changes in immigration policy and enforcement have made it much more difficult for farmers to find workers, forcing some extreme choices. LUKE BURBANK: Six thousand people showed up on a Saturday for the chance to pick some free veggies. The farmer, whose family owns the field, had been sleepless for days and getting ever more agitated on TikTok. I need this video to go out and for people to see it and understand the ramifications of what's going on at the border and the lack of labor that we have in this country. BURBANK: Agitated that he couldn't hire enough people to pick the asparagus crop. Some 180,000 dollars' worth. So instead of throwing it away, he gave it away. BURBANK: Do you guys like eating asparagus? -Nope! -No. Yes. Okay, that third girl is clearly torn there between a child's natural hatred of asparagus and their natural love of disagreeing with siblings. Also, I'm a little embarrassed to admit, I didn't know that's what a field of asparagus looks like. You're telling me it doesn't grow together in a nice little bunch? It just sticks out of the ground individually like a big field of body hair? Tell me that doesn't look like you put the Jolly Green Giant's happy trail -under a microscope. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) I'm mad! The point is, without access to labor, crops just rot in the field. It's probably why farm workers were categorized as essential by the Department of Homeland Security during the pandemic. And yet, while we claim they're essential, we sure don't treat them like it. Farm workers are among our lowest paid workers, making on average... And they're often subjected to dangerous environments. During the California wildfire season, you may have seen videos of farmworkers toiling in the foreground of a raging fire. And even when their workplace isn't actively burning to the ground, they will tell you their work can sometimes feel pretty dehumanizing. GERARDO REYES CHAVEZ: One of the most difficult things is just to come to a realization how little you mean... to the people that you're working for. (SPEAKING SPANISH) TRANSLATOR: You don't officially start getting paid until your first bucket is filled. If you fall behind, you have to run to try and catch up. LUCAS BENITEZ: (SPEAKING SPANISH) TRANSLATOR 2: A lot of people can't stand it because it's so hot. Sometimes you can feel the breeze from the pesticide they were spraying over there. It felt good. That is pretty brutal. Although, appreciating the cooling air from the pesticides is some legendary glass-half-full thinking. &quot;Sure, it's hard work, but the poison breeze is nice. So it kind of balances out.&quot; The way our farm labor system works is deeply exploitative, but the thing is, that is very much by design. So tonight, let's talk about farm workers. The conditions they face, how we fail to protect them, and what we can do going forward. So let's start by acknowledging the history of farm work in America has always been rooted in exploitation. From its origins in slavery, to its later evolution into sharecropping. But what you might not know is that during the New Deal, as laws were finally passed to establish some bedrock labor protections, farm workers were repeatedly and specifically excluded from them. So, for instance, the 1935 law which protected employees' rights to join unions explicitly stated that... And the 1938 law, which created a federal minimum wage and overtime, again carved out an exception so those... Which is pretty insulting, isn't it? It's like announcing your company's new anti-sexual-harassment policy, but clarifying that none of it protects Jeff. Jeff is exempt, so slap his ass, twist his nips, we don't care. It is open season on Jeff. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And make no mistake, the reasons for that were explicitly racist. One representative even warned during debate on the minimum wage bill that... That representative, it was actually Tucker Carlson. -It turns out he's a Highlander. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Now, since then, the labor force has changed. Black Americans left the sharecropping system during the Great Migration and farmers increasingly came to rely on laborers from Mexico and other Central American nations. And over the years, leaders like Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta formed the United Farmworkers and won some significant gains. The federal minimum wage was expanded to include farm workers in 1978 and some states do now provide at least some access to overtime pay and collective bargaining. But the fact is, farm workers are still excluded from a lot of basic labor protections, including this major one. The child labor law in the US is pretty good, except when it comes to agriculture. And then it has a big, gaping hole. US law allows children to work in agriculture at far younger ages for unlimited hours outside of school in much more dangerous conditions than any other sector. So a child can work perfectly legally for any farmer at age 12. That child couldn't work serving the food but he can work 10, 12, 14 hours picking. Yeah. And that is absurd. And look, I am not saying that working in a restaurant isn't tough. Anyone who thinks otherwise should be forced to serve an imperfect omelet to James Corden. -But it's clearly not the same thing, is it? -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And this exception isn't just to let kids work on their own family's farms. There are hired children working fields all across America picking our food. 'Cause while most jobs are off limits to kids under 14, agricultural... And this should probably go without saying, but this work can be dangerous for kids. Just listen to this girl who started working in tobacco fields when she was only 12 describe her first day on the job. I felt really lightheaded and dizzy. And I wanted to go get a cup of water, and I could not see to where the truck was that contained the water. And I was looking for my mom and I couldn't find my mom. Eventually, I just fell. You don't really think about a childhood-- Like, I've never really thought that a child is really supposed to-- a 12-year-old is supposed to have fun, exactly. I always thought that you were supposed to work. That is terrible. Although, while a 12-year-old under no circumstances should be fainting in a field, I will say, it is a bit of a stretch to say that a 12-year-old &quot;is supposed to have fun.&quot; Because fundamentally, they are still 12. This is just around the corner for them. You are a hormonal ticking time bomb at that age. Honestly, the closest thing to fun that is available to you at 12 is going to the mall by yourself for the first time to just kind of walk around, I guess, since you don't really have any money, except for like a smoothie or something if you want to get a smoothie or whatever. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) The lack of laws applying to farm workers has left them facing truly dangerous conditions. Agricultural workers suffer fatal on-the-job injuries at a rate... Which is wild. Because it's one thing to look up at a tall building and shudder thinking about the physical risk it must've taken to put a pane of glass up that high, but it feels ridiculous to feel the same way about a beet and goat cheese salad. Farm workers face exposure to extreme heat, dangerous machinery, unsafe air quality and impromptu pesticide showers. And some farm owners can be abusive employers. Just take this story from a few years ago. LEON HENDRIX: It's quiet but cloudy at EDS Schoenborn Orchard today. TRAVIS SCHOENBORN: A loudmouth, fu-- (CENSORED) ni-- (CENSORED). HENDRIX: But not on this day. TRAVIS: A punk, mother-- (CENSORED) HENDRIX: It was hot. TRAVIS: He is a coward, fu-- (CENSORED) ni-- (CENSORED) (CENSORED). HENDRIX: The voice on tape, Travis Schoenborn, the son of farm owners David and Valerie Schoenborn. He was angry at one of the workers, and let it be known in front of others. TRAVIS: Tell him to pack his (CENSORED), and get the (CENSORED) out of here while he still can. He is not (CENSORED) with me, or my mother, at all. Holy shit. That was about 95 percent bleeps. And trust local news to always find a diplomatic way to describe things. &quot;He was angry and let it be known in front of others.&quot; Sure, that's not technically untrue, but I'd have gone with the more accurate description, &quot;He lost his fucking shit at an apple farm!&quot; A farm, remember, that his parents owned. And they had a truly special response when confronted with that video. HENDRIX: They blamed the migrant worker alleged victim in this case, and accused him of threatening Valerie, and being obscene. What did he do to threaten you? He called me a name in Spanish, I'm not repeating it. HENDRIX: There was no outright apology. Instead, this. First of all, they weren't Black, they were Mexicans. So I don't know why he called them the N-word. I just want to give you a chance to be clear and respond-- Yeah. Did you hear him referring to people as fu-- (CENSORED) ni-- (CENSORED)? We don't have-- We don't-- We didn't have no ni-- (CENSORED) work here that I know of. -(AUDIENCE GROANS) -Oh! Okay! Okay. Okay. Okay, here's the thing. I mean, while clearly, there are 9,000 things there, but here is just one of them. I bet you heard her say, &quot;They were Mexicans, so I'm not sure why he called them the N-word,&quot; and thought, &quot;Wow, that is the wildest shit anybody in this marriage is going to say in the next 15 seconds,&quot; and then, you were dead wrong. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Also, I just want to point out the inconsistency between having a problem with saying a vague, unknown word in Spanish and having no problem at all saying an extremely specific one in English. &quot;I won't repeat this Spanish word because it's offensive. But if you talk to my husband, he'll say the N-word in about four seconds. Anyway, I raised my son better than to use slurs incorrectly.&quot; Now, in that particular case, a worker caught that tirade on video, and gave it to Migrant Legal Aid. And the son later pled guilty to, of all things, disturbing the peace. But even that pathetic level of accountability is extremely rare. And look. Clearly, not all farmers are abusive employers. But to the extent that any want to be, there can be shockingly little to stop them. Because even when labor laws do apply to agricultural workers, there is almost no way to enforce them. Take California. The most productive agricultural state in the nation. The agency responsible for monitoring workplace safety there is so understaffed, that it currently has roughly one field inspector available for every 90,000 workers, with only a handful of those inspectors speaking any language other than English. And even when there are consequences, they can be laughable. After two farm workers in Idaho drowned in pits of cow manure at dairy operations, OSHA imposed fines of just 5,000 dollars for each of the men's deaths. Which is nothing! If an employee drowns in the universally agreed upon &quot;worst thing to drown in,&quot; that should cost their employer a lot more than a fifth of a Hyundai Sonata. And that's not even getting into the fact that some farms limit their liability by using so-called &quot;farm labor contractors&quot; who hire workers, and then contract them out. And who've been found to be the worst violators of federal employment law in agriculture. So at every turn, this is an environment where vulnerable workers can understandably feel reluctant to come forward. Take sexual harassment and assault, which farm workers say is a big problem. And yet, just watch how this head of a farm owners' trade group, responds when asked about it. LOWELL BERGMAN: You know Dolores Huerta? You know who she is? Yes. Okay. Can I read you something she said? Oh, please! I'd like to hear... her comment. BERGMAN: Okay. She says that this sexual harassment that we're talking about is an epidemic in the fields. Dolores Huerta, bring me those cases. Dolores Huerta, go have your UFW go, uh, go pick up the grower if all these cases have been going on. If our growers know there's a problem, we're gonna deal with it. Why didn't you go to the grower? And tell me that because, &quot;Well, we were fearful for their jobs and their lives.&quot; No, that's a poor excuse. Yeah. Is it though? Is it? 'Cause I've got to say, I can believe that people aren't bringing harassment cases to growers if they're acting anything like he just did. After all, merely hearing the name Dolores Huerta sent him into a visible rage. So I have to imagine that off camera, he's even more of a teddy bear. And at this point, you might be thinking, &quot;Well, perhaps one way to help workers would be to remove their fear of deportation and create a system where they can come into this country legally.&quot; Well, we actually did that. But unfortunately, the way we did it left massive gaps for bad actors to operate in. Back in 1986, we created what's known as the H-2A Visa program. It allows migrant workers to legally enter the country, temporarily, for agricultural work. For years, employers shied away from using it, because it was cheaper and easier to simply hire undocumented workers. But as it's become harder to find them, the use of H-2A has been ramped up considerably. In fact... Basically, the program's been around since the '80s, was on the backburner until a few years ago, and now, it's extremely popular. Think of it as the Kieran Culkin of the agricultural world. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And in principle, H-2A does sound good. More farm workers get temporarily legal status, which you would assume would make them feel safer. But sadly, that just hasn't been the case. For one thing, like many work visas, these are tied to your employer. So if you lose your job, you also lose your right to be in the country, causing a massive power imbalance. And given that imbalance, it is no surprise that many employers feel comfortable skirting the protections that workers are supposed to receive. For instance, under the law... But in practice, the conditions can be far below what the program requires, as this man quickly found out. (MIGRANT WORKER SPEAKING IN SPANISH) TRANSLATOR 3: The house where we lived, where Manuel brought us to, was very old. It had spiders, cockroaches, and the bathrooms didn't work. The house was gross. It was very dirty. You could clearly tell that the house was abandoned for a long time. And Manuel brought us there. The house didn't have heat, and the temperature hit sex degrees Celsius. And four of my coworkers and I had to sleep outside. We felt like we were on the border of death. That is horrific! No one would see that and say, &quot;That is a good place for people to live.&quot; They'd maybe say, &quot;That's a nice spot for ghosts to throw up.&quot; But that's it. And that's not a one-off. A DOL investigation a few years back found that one labor contractor housed H-2A workers in... This is the kitchen, which you can see, still had fake blood on the refrigerators and the floor. And workers clearly shouldn't be forced to sleep around a bunch of spooky decorations. Even people who work at Spirit Halloween don't sleep in the store. Except, of course, for Dennis, but he's made it very clear, that that is a sex thing. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But poor living accommodations are just the tip of the iceberg here. In 2021, the DOJ launched a massive indictment involving the treatment of H-2A workers on Georgia farms. And the details are appalling. VAUGHN HILLYARD: Prosecutors calling it &quot;modern-day slavery.&quot; In the fields of Southern Georgia, years' worth of damning, horrific allegations. Victims allegedly forced to live in cramped, dirty trailers, with raw sewage leaking into the trailers, threatened them with deportation, and detained them in a work camp surrounded by an electric fence. And in 2018, thirty individuals allegedly sold to another man in Indiana for 21,481 dollars. Wow. You know, at times, some people can be quick to play the &quot;this is slavery&quot; card. Whether you're a teenager asked to mow the lawn, or an office worker who has to come in on Sunday. But as frustrating as those situations can be, neither involves being sold in bulk to a man in Indiana, because that is actual fucking slavery! This case is ongoing, but the indictment asserted this was a massive operation, which sought visas for... ...to harvest onions and other crops. And the government says that... And while I'm glad that action was eventually taken, I will say, for a list of charges this sinister, the name they chose could have used some work. NBC NEWS REPORTER: A new 54-page indictment by the US Department of Justice, charging 24 individuals, is part of what it calls Operation Blooming Onion. -(AUDIENCE CHUCKLES) -Okay. Okay. Just pour one out for the social media person at Outback Steakhouse who saw &quot;Blooming Onion&quot; trending on Twitter and thought their job got easier for two seconds, before realizing it actually just got a lot fucking harder. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) And at this point, I've told you about everything, from child labor, to workers drowning in manure, to the sale of human beings. So you're hopefully wondering, &quot;How do we fix this?&quot; Well, farm workers have been organizing to address some of these issues for years now. Take what happened in Immokalee, Florida. As recently as a decade ago, the tomato fields there were being called... But a group called the Coalition of Immokalee Workers launched a campaign to improve conditions, pressuring not just farmers, but the big-name businesses that relied on their produce. MARK STRASSMANN: In 2005, Taco Bell became the first big buyer to sign on to the CIW's Fair Food Program. Buyers agree to pay an extra penny per pound for tomato, money that goes to workers, and buyers only do business with participating Florida farmers. More than a dozen restaurant chains and retailers have signed on, including McDonald's, Chipotle, Trader Joe's, and last year, Walmart, which sells 20 percent of America's tomatoes. Wow! Those are some massive brands that you can now, surprisingly, feel kind of okay about -in this one very narrow way. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Is Walmart a good company overall? It's not up to me to say, but let's say, -&quot;No. It's absolutely terrible.&quot; -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) But is it a good company regarding the tomatoes it sells from Florida specifically? Sure. On that one issue, they have my full, Florida-tomato-specific support. Which is, frankly, more than I can say for Wendy's, Kroger, and Publix, who, amazingly, have yet to sign on. So fuck them. -SPEAKER: Fuck them! -Exactly. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS) Under the Fair Food Program, signatories agreed... ...on their farms. It also covers a 24/7 complaint line for workers, and, perhaps most importantly, an independent regulatory body that conducts audits in which they interview at least half the workforce. And it's been a success. ...have joined the program... And the program is now expanding into other crops and other states. But it clearly shouldn't just be on farmworkers to fight for a decent life. We need to make sure that they are at least protected by the same labor laws that the rest of us enjoy and make sure that those laws are actually enforced. And I would argue that we also need to retool the H-2A program and ensure its participants, and ideally all farmworkers, have a potential path to citizenship. Because after working so hard to feed this country, frankly, they deserve one. After all, you made me a citizen, and I haven't fed you once. I know that you think I have, but that's Jamie Oliver, and we are different people. (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) Look. Farm workers provide this country with our most basic necessity, and in return, we act like they either don't matter or don't exist. The message that we've sent to them has consistently been, &quot;You don't count.&quot; And until we fix our broken system, the very least that we can do is fix our Farming Simulator games, so everyone's forced to have a much more accurate sense of what the people who grow their food are actually up against. ♪ (COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ NARRATOR 2: Welcome to the new Farming Simulator 2023. All your favorite features are back. Beautiful vistas, tough working tractors, and of course, animal husbandry. (SHEEPS BLEATING) But this year, we're also expanding to include the parts of farming most people don't like to think about, hired farmworkers. We're bringing cutting edge graphics and gameplay to the most ignored aspect of agriculture. You'll be able to choose between hiring undocumented workers with no protections against abuse or the legal version of that. You can customize their clothes, their hair, even choose from a surprising range of ages, from older to younger to dear God, how on earth is this legal? We've also got a brand new assortment of maps from Midwestern fields to vast asparagus taints to literally the middle of a raging wildfire. And if your workers need a pep talk, you can help them out with our new motivational mini game. You (CENSORED) little (CENSORED)! I will (CENSORED) you and every (CENSORED) if you say one more (CENSORED) word against my sister, my dad, or my (CENSORED) mother! Now, get back to work! NARRATOR 2: Your odds of getting caught are practically zero. Aw, shit. You can also use our new housing tool to design H-2A-compliant-ish housing for your workers. The less you spend, the more you save. And all of this is to put food on the table of people who will never once think about how it got there. Just remember. The real secret to mastering farming is being the master of other people. -Wait, not that. -Mm-hmm. NARRATOR 2: I guess kind of that. NARRATOR 2: Rated Not OK for Anyone." />
