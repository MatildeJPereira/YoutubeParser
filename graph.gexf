          <attvalue for="4" value="Introduction&#10;0:00&#10;- Fascism is a cult of the leader,&#10;0:03&#10;who promises national restoration&#10;0:06&#10;in the face of supposed humiliation by immigrants,&#10;0:10&#10;leftists, liberals, minorities,&#10;0:13&#10;homosexuals, women,&#10;0:15&#10;in the face of what the fascist leader says is a takeover&#10;0:20&#10;of the country's media, cultural institutions, schools&#10;0:25&#10;by these forces.&#10;0:26&#10;And that's why you need a really macho,&#10;0:29&#10;powerful, violent response.&#10;0:31&#10;The fascist leader says he will solve the problem.&#10;0:35&#10;Fascism is right-wing by nature.&#10;0:38&#10;It's based on ultra-nationalism.&#10;0:40&#10;However, you can have ultra-nationalist movements&#10;0:44&#10;that are ultra-nationalist movements of minority groups.&#10;0:46&#10;There is left-wing authoritarianism.&#10;0:48&#10;There are bad things on the left.&#10;0:50&#10;Stalin killed many, many people.&#10;0:53&#10;Mao killed many, many people.&#10;0:55&#10;These are terrible figures.&#10;0:56&#10;But not all terrible things are fascist.&#10;0:59&#10;Fascism is a very particular ideological structure.&#10;1:02&#10;When thinking about fascism, you can't think&#10;1:04&#10;about these individual elements in isolation.&#10;1:07&#10;They come as a bundle.&#10;1:09&#10;My name is Jason Stanley.&#10;1:10&#10;I'm the Jacob Urowsky Professor of Philosophy&#10;1:13&#10;at Yale University and the author of five books,&#10;1:16&#10;most recently,&#10;1:17&#10;&quot;How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them.&quot;&#10;1:27&#10;We forget that many fascist regimes started off&#10;1:32&#10;as democratic political parties.&#10;1:34&#10;We forget that Hitler, the Nazi Party, ran in an election.&#10;1:40&#10;Fascist parties start&#10;1:42&#10;as fascist social and political movements&#10;1:45&#10;before they come to power.&#10;1:46&#10;So it's important to see that these tactics occur even&#10;1:49&#10;in societies that do not have a fascist regime.&#10;1:52&#10;(dramatic music)&#10;Mythic past&#10;1:54&#10;All nationalism involves a mythic past.&#10;1:57&#10;You can say, &quot;Look, we're Polish people,&quot;&#10;2:00&#10;people who spoke Polish and were sheep herders&#10;2:03&#10;and another bunch of Polish people who were fishermen,&#10;2:05&#10;and you can talk about how things were wonderful&#10;2:08&#10;when we were all Polish together.&#10;2:10&#10;That's a fine mythic past,&#10;2:11&#10;but then there's the fascist mythic past.&#10;2:14&#10;In the past, we were great.&#10;2:16&#10;Wherein did our greatness consist?&#10;2:18&#10;In our military.&#10;2:20&#10;And in the past,&#10;2:21&#10;the dominant racial group ruled over others.&#10;2:24&#10;And then the fascist leader says,&#10;2:26&#10;&quot;That has been taken from you&#10;2:28&#10;by the leftists and communists.&#10;2:30&#10;They wanna weaken our military.&#10;2:32&#10;They wanna weaken our greatness.&quot;&#10;Propaganda&#10;2:37&#10;Propaganda is ubiquitous, and everyone uses propaganda.&#10;2:40&#10;In political propaganda,&#10;2:42&#10;your main message is something other&#10;2:44&#10;than the the information you're conveying.&#10;2:45&#10;Fascist propaganda is a very particular structure.&#10;2:49&#10;It's based around a friend/enemy distinction.&#10;2:52&#10;The political opponent, they are a merciless threat&#10;2:57&#10;to your very existence and your traditions.&#10;3:00&#10;They are the other.&#10;3:01&#10;When they are in charge, it subverts the nation.&#10;3:05&#10;So the structure of fascist propaganda is based on the idea&#10;3:08&#10;that the other are fundamentally opposed to the nation.&#10;Cult&#10;3:15&#10;As Hitler says in &quot;Mein Kampf,&quot;&#10;3:17&#10;&quot;Science is only useful insofar&#10;3:19&#10;as it strengthens the nation.&quot;&#10;3:21&#10;Fascism is a cult of the leader.&#10;3:23&#10;It involves the leader setting the rules&#10;3:26&#10;about what's true and false.&#10;3:28&#10;So any kind of expertise, reality,&#10;3:31&#10;all of that is a challenge to the authority of the leader.&#10;3:35&#10;If science would help him,&#10;3:37&#10;then he can say, &quot;Okay, I'll use it.&quot;&#10;3:41&#10;Institutions that teach multiple perspectives on history&#10;3:45&#10;in all its complexity are always a threat&#10;3:49&#10;to the fascist leader.&#10;Truth&#10;3:52&#10;The center of democracy is truth.&#10;3:54&#10;You're not free if you've been lied to.&#10;3:57&#10;Nobody thinks the people of North Korea are free.&#10;4:00&#10;The people of North Korea will vote&#10;4:02&#10;for Dear Leader every time because they've been lied to.&#10;4:05&#10;It's not a free vote&#10;4:06&#10;because they don't have access to the truth.&#10;4:09&#10;Equality, similarly, requires truth&#10;4:12&#10;because equality and democracy doesn't mean&#10;4:14&#10;we all have the same amount of money.&#10;4:16&#10;It doesn't mean we all have the same car.&#10;4:18&#10;It means political equality,&#10;4:21&#10;that each of our voices matters the same.&#10;4:25&#10;And political equality means speaking truth to power.&#10;4:28&#10;If someone really powerful is humiliated&#10;4:32&#10;when they're caught lying,&#10;4:33&#10;that's the core of political equality.&#10;4:35&#10;So if you're gonna rip the heart out of democracy,&#10;4:39&#10;you get people used to lies.&#10;Hierarchy&#10;4:42&#10;Here's a fact about humans:&#10;4:43&#10;we all pretty much suck to the same degree. (laughs)&#10;4:47&#10;One group of us is not better than another group of us.&#10;4:50&#10;Hierarchy is central here&#10;4:53&#10;because it's the big lie at the center of things.&#10;4:56&#10;What racism but one big lie?&#10;4:59&#10;Racism is a lie that one group is better than another.&#10;5:02&#10;You're told this religion is better,&#10;5:05&#10;this race is better, this gender is better.&#10;5:07&#10;It's really a moral claim, has more moral worth.&#10;5:10&#10;And then once you have hierarchies set up,&#10;5:13&#10;you can make people very nervous and frightened&#10;5:17&#10;about losing their position on that hierarchy.&#10;5:21&#10;Hierarchy goes right into victimhood&#10;5:24&#10;because once you convince people&#10;5:26&#10;that they're justifiable higher on the hierarchy,&#10;5:30&#10;then you can tell them that they're victims of equality.&#10;5:34&#10;German Christians are victims of Jews.&#10;5:37&#10;White Americans are victims of Black American equality.&#10;5:41&#10;Men are victims of feminism.&#10;5:43&#10;Once you convince people that they should be better,&#10;5:47&#10;that they have earned a position&#10;5:49&#10;on the hierarchy over others,&#10;5:50&#10;then you can tell them that equality is actually victim.&#10;5:56&#10;Loyalty to the dominant group means law-abidingness.&#10;6:00&#10;And the minority group is by its nature not law-abiding.&#10;Law and Order&#10;6:06&#10;Law and order in fascist politics means the members&#10;6:10&#10;of a minority group who accept their subservient role,&#10;6:15&#10;they're law-abiding,&#10;6:16&#10;and the members of the dominant group&#10;6:18&#10;by their very nature are law-abiding.&#10;6:20&#10;By definition, the leader can't violate law and order.&#10;6:24&#10;So law and order doesn't mean justice.&#10;6:27&#10;Law and order doesn't mean equality.&#10;6:29&#10;Law and order structures who's legitimate and who's not.&#10;6:35&#10;Everywhere around the world,&#10;6:36&#10;no matter what the situation is,&#10;6:39&#10;in very different socioeconomic conditions,&#10;6:42&#10;the fascist leader comes and tells you,&#10;6:44&#10;&quot;Your women and children are under threat.&#10;6:46&#10;You need a strong man to protect your families.&quot;&#10;6:50&#10;They make conservatives hysterically afraid&#10;6:53&#10;of transgender rights or homosexuality,&#10;6:57&#10;other ways of living.&#10;6:58&#10;These are not people trying to live their own lives.&#10;7:02&#10;They're trying to destroy your life,&#10;7:03&#10;and they're coming after your children.&#10;7:05&#10;What the fascist politician does is they take conservatives&#10;7:09&#10;who aren't fascist at all, and they say,&#10;7:11&#10;&quot;Look, I know you might not like my ways.&#10;7:14&#10;You might think I'm a womanizer.&#10;7:16&#10;You might think I'm violent in my rhetoric.&#10;7:18&#10;But you need someone like me now.&#10;7:20&#10;You need someone like me 'cause homosexuality,&#10;7:23&#10;it isn't just trying for equality.&#10;7:25&#10;It's coming after your family.&quot;&#10;Ruralurban divide&#10;7:29&#10;Fascist movements typically, though not invariably,&#10;7:33&#10;rest on an urban/rural divide.&#10;7:36&#10;The cities are where there's decadence,&#10;7:38&#10;where the elites congregate, where there's immigrants,&#10;7:42&#10;there's criminality, there's Sodom and Gomorrah.&#10;7:45&#10;In the city, there's not real work.&#10;7:48&#10;The pure, hard-working, real members of the nation live&#10;7:53&#10;in the rural areas, where they work hard with their hands.&#10;7:57&#10;When our politicians talk about inner-city voters&#10;8:00&#10;or urban voters, we all know what they mean.&#10;Free labor&#10;8:05&#10;Arbeit macht frei, &quot;Work shall make you free.&quot;&#10;8:08&#10;This was written on the gates of Auschwitz.&#10;8:11&#10;The idea is that the minority group, they're lazy,&#10;8:16&#10;and they need to be made to work.&#10;8:17&#10;Free labor.&#10;8:19&#10;The minority group and the leftists,&#10;8:21&#10;they're lazy by their nature,&#10;8:23&#10;and it gives them a work ethic.&#10;8:25&#10;Labor unions are run by communists&#10;8:28&#10;who are trying to make things easier.&#10;8:30&#10;Hard work is a virtue.&#10;8:32&#10;In liberal democracy,&#10;8:34&#10;we don't value people by how hard they work.&#10;8:37&#10;What would happen to disabled people who can't work?&#10;8:40&#10;They would then have no value.&#10;8:41&#10;It's why the Nazis had the T4 program to murder the disabled&#10;8:46&#10;because the disabled were Lebenunwertes Leben,&#10;8:50&#10;life unworthy of life,&#10;8:52&#10;because to be valued was to be capable of hard work.&#10;8:56&#10;Each of these individual elements is not&#10;8:58&#10;in and of itself fascist,&#10;9:00&#10;but you have to worry when they're all grouped together,&#10;9:03&#10;when honest conservatives are lured into fascism&#10;9:06&#10;by people who tell them, &quot;Look, it's an existential fight.&#10;9:09&#10;I know you don't accept everything we do.&#10;9:12&#10;You don't accept every doctrine.&#10;9:14&#10;But your family is under threat.&#10;9:16&#10;Your family is at risk.&#10;9:17&#10;So without us, you're in peril.&quot;&#10;9:20&#10;Those moments are the times&#10;9:23&#10;when we need to worry about fascism." />

          <attvalue for="4" value="Laplace's demon&#10;0:00&#10;- If one opens any dictionary&#10;0:01&#10;and you go to the entry of demon,&#10;0:04&#10;one of the entries refers to the scientific demons.&#10;0:07&#10;Descartes' demons, Laplace's demon, Maxwell's demon,&#10;0:11&#10;they're not considered to be real&#10;0:13&#10;when they're first mentioned,&#10;0:14&#10;they're considered to be possibly real.&#10;0:17&#10;They're trying to find a hole in their theories.&#10;0:20&#10;They immediately anthropomorphize this force.&#10;0:24&#10;So what they are, in the most literal sense,&#10;0:26&#10;are little creatures that are concocted by scientists.&#10;0:31&#10;When they're confronted with something&#10;0:32&#10;that they don't really understand,&#10;0:34&#10;these creatures that we have always thought of&#10;0:38&#10;as little entities that can bend or break&#10;0:42&#10;the laws of nature continue to be very useful&#10;0:45&#10;and very common ways to thinking in advancing our knowledge&#10;0:49&#10;and understanding of the natural world.&#10;0:58&#10;I'm Jimena Canales, I'm a historian of science.&#10;1:01&#10;I love science; I admire it tremendously.&#10;1:03&#10;That's why I started studying,&#10;1:05&#10;but there was this other aspect of it&#10;1:07&#10;that I felt that we had to talk about.&#10;1:10&#10;It was scientists discussing demons.&#10;1:12&#10;These demons share similar characteristics&#10;1:15&#10;to those other demons in the past,&#10;1:17&#10;like Beelzebub and Lucifer, they're usually very fast&#10;1:21&#10;or very big or very small.&#10;1:23&#10;They can break the laws of nature.&#10;1:25&#10;They're not necessarily evil,&#10;1:27&#10;but they create power imbalances.&#10;1:29&#10;They can be helpful or they can be mischievous.&#10;1:33&#10;And one of the strange things about it&#10;1:34&#10;is that you read scientists in their scientific papers,&#10;1:38&#10;actually talking about these creatures&#10;1:40&#10;and having other scientists name them&#10;1:41&#10;after the famous scientist.&#10;1:46&#10;Descartes' demon is very appropriate for us to start&#10;Descartes' demon&#10;1:49&#10;because he's the demon of virtual reality.&#10;1:52&#10;He had the ability to install an alternate reality&#10;1:55&#10;right in front of your senses.&#10;1:57&#10;Therefore you could no longer tell if you were,&#10;2:00&#10;you know, living in the matrix,&#10;2:01&#10;if you couldn't tell what the real world&#10;2:03&#10;was in front of you.&#10;2:04&#10;This was a very scary thought for Descartes.&#10;2:06&#10;I think it is for everyone.&#10;2:07&#10;It's one of the themes that continue&#10;2:09&#10;to be brought up in science fiction.&#10;2:11&#10;It was also a fascinating thought&#10;2:13&#10;because we were all fascinated by spectacle&#10;2:16&#10;and by creating these situations in which&#10;2:18&#10;we can fool ourselves to think we have reality&#10;2:21&#10;in front of us, and it's really just&#10;2:23&#10;an alternative reality or virtual reality.&#10;2:26&#10;And that's why Descartes, trying to fend himself&#10;2:29&#10;against the possibility that some demon had taken over&#10;2:32&#10;his impressions, he actually became one of the founders&#10;2:35&#10;of Modern logic, and in his famous text where he uttered&#10;2:39&#10;the phrase, &quot;I think, therefore I am.&quot;&#10;2:41&#10;He started to think about what were the few things&#10;2:44&#10;that this demon couldn't touch.&#10;2:46&#10;And he would say things like two plus three equals five,&#10;2:49&#10;or a circle is a circumference drawn around a certain point,&#10;Circumference drawn around a certain&#10;2:52&#10;or a triangle is made up of three lengths in three angles.&#10;2:56&#10;They're very simple things, but those became the basis&#10;2:59&#10;of modern science, of Logic,&#10;3:01&#10;and they were inspired by the fear of this demon.&#10;3:07&#10;Maxwell was a scientist of the second Industrial Revolution&#10;3:11&#10;of the Victorian Empire.&#10;3:13&#10;He didn't name the demon Maxwell's demon,&#10;3:16&#10;but he was the first to come up&#10;3:18&#10;with the speculations about it.&#10;3:20&#10;And he was named the demon by William Thompson&#10;3:23&#10;in the second half of the 19th century, I believe 1874.&#10;3:26&#10;And it was very important for physics.&#10;3:29&#10;It still is, it's at the foundation of how we understand&#10;3:32&#10;the first and second laws of thermodynamics.&#10;3:35&#10;One of the things that happens with statistical laws&#10;3:37&#10;is that statistical laws allow exceptions.&#10;3:41&#10;If you have a container or a soup and you throw ice on it,&#10;3:45&#10;eventually it will reach temperature equilibrium.&#10;3:48&#10;But if this laws is statistical,&#10;3:50&#10;and the consensus and the science says that it is,&#10;3:53&#10;then there's a chance that the opposite might happen.&#10;3:57&#10;And the demon was invoked in order to make sense&#10;4:01&#10;of the statistical nature of the laws of thermodynamics.&#10;4:05&#10;So he's a tiny little being&#10;4:07&#10;who is atomic size, and he can manipulate atoms.&#10;4:12&#10;And if he's sitting in a container,&#10;4:14&#10;he can push the fast atoms to one side&#10;4:17&#10;and let slow ones be on the other side,&#10;4:21&#10;because we understand heat as having to do&#10;4:23&#10;with the movement of particles,&#10;4:25&#10;that means that one part of a container&#10;4:27&#10;can spontaneously heat up and another one can become cooler.&#10;4:33&#10;And if you have a difference in temperature,&#10;4:35&#10;then you can create a motor.&#10;4:37&#10;And with a motor, you can create further power imbalances.&#10;4:41&#10;Most of the electronic gadgets that are all around us&#10;4:45&#10;use the science of Maxwell's demon,&#10;4:49&#10;and scientists and laboratories all over the world&#10;4:51&#10;are still trying to build&#10;4:53&#10;better versions of Maxwell's demon,&#10;4:55&#10;and they're still researching him.&#10;5:00&#10;So Darwin was speculating about a being,&#10;3 Darwin's demon&#10;5:03&#10;again, he didn't call it Darwin's,&#10;5:05&#10;it was only named Darwin's being later.&#10;5:08&#10;Before he wrote the origins of a species, he had this idea.&#10;5:12&#10;He said, &quot;What would happen if there could be a being&#10;5:15&#10;that can produce a new race?&quot;&#10;5:17&#10;Just like we are able to produce sheep&#10;5:21&#10;with particular qualities for our sweaters,&#10;5:23&#10;but then Darwin took a leap, and he said,&#10;5:25&#10;&quot;What if somebody could do that to us?&quot;&#10;5:29&#10;This was one of the fascinating questions&#10;5:31&#10;that drove his research.&#10;5:33&#10;Could this actually happen?&#10;5:35&#10;He ended up calling it natural selection.&#10;5:37&#10;So natural selection in a sense, became the substitute&#10;5:41&#10;or the embodiment of this early idea.&#10;5:45&#10;Then it was called Darwin's demon later on&#10;5:47&#10;by biologists in the 1960s.&#10;5:50&#10;I started more than a decade ago,&#10;5:52&#10;tracking the references to the word demon.&#10;5:55&#10;And it is tremendous fun,&#10;5:57&#10;you know, seeing the history of science&#10;5:58&#10;and the history of technology&#10;6:00&#10;in parallel with these great imaginary ideas.&#10;6:04&#10;It gives us a sense of how malleable and how powerful&#10;6:07&#10;our desires and our fears are for driving society forward.&#10;6:13&#10;As a historian, I think it is really important&#10;6:16&#10;that we think a little bit more carefully&#10;6:18&#10;about non-existent things,&#10;6:21&#10;about things that are not yet here.&#10;6:23&#10;I understand this is original and bizarre and strange&#10;6:26&#10;to try to move our thinking about history&#10;6:29&#10;and the past and the future based on non-existent things.&#10;6:32&#10;But if we don't start thinking about them,&#10;6:35&#10;the future development of our world&#10;6:36&#10;and our technological universe is really gonna escape us.&#10;6:39&#10;So I want us to take a step back&#10;6:41&#10;and think about what we're thinking about.&#10;6:46&#10;- Get

The author of books including How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them and Erasing History: How Fascists Rewrite the Past to Control the Future talks about authoritarianism, the impact of Trump’s policies on universities, and why he has now decided to leave Yale and the US altogether to relocate to Canada.&#10;&#10;For more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/&#10;&#10;Follow DW on social media:&#10;►Instagram:   / dwnews  &#10;►TikTok:   / dwnews  &#10;►Facebook:   / deutschewellenews  &#10;►Twitter:   / dwnews  &#10;&#10;Für Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie:    / dwdeutsch  &#10;&#10;Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutsche..." />

          <attvalue for="4" value="0:00&#10;what is happening to US democracy under&#10;0:02&#10;Trump some warn of a shift where&#10;0:05&#10;institutions remain but are manipulated&#10;0:08&#10;to consolidate power allies get&#10;0:11&#10;protection and benefits while opponents&#10;0:13&#10;face lawsuits regulations and financial&#10;0:16&#10;ruin critics say the government is&#10;0:18&#10;targeting media universities and civil&#10;0:20&#10;servants to weaken checks and balances&#10;0:23&#10;we're going to have more on that in just&#10;0:24&#10;a moment but first this report on&#10;0:26&#10;Trump's strategy to entrench his power&#10;0:31&#10;alleged Venezuelan gang members being&#10;0:33&#10;deported Landing in El Salvador headed&#10;0:36&#10;for a massive high security prison in&#10;0:39&#10;defiance of a US Federal judge's Order a&#10;0:42&#10;case that's now landed at the Supreme&#10;0:46&#10;Court the Trump administration's refusal&#10;0:49&#10;to obey the judge's order has led to&#10;0:51&#10;talk of a constitutional crisis but the&#10;0:54&#10;White House and the cabinet have many&#10;0:56&#10;other ways to consolidate power&#10;0:58&#10;operating within the con&#10;1:00&#10;institution the immense power of the&#10;1:03&#10;executive branch gives the president&#10;1:04&#10;many ways to reward friends and punish&#10;1:10&#10;enemies Hungarian prime minister Victor&#10;1:12&#10;Oran is widely cited as a model friends&#10;1:16&#10;have benefited from public contracts&#10;1:18&#10;he's been able to shut down the&#10;1:19&#10;opposition by cowing the Judiciary&#10;1:22&#10;intimidating the media and closing&#10;1:25&#10;universities the Trump Administration&#10;1:28&#10;has taken similar steps in its early&#10;1:29&#10;months in&#10;1:30&#10;office rewarding friends like Elon Musk&#10;1:34&#10;Trump's biggest campaign contributor&#10;1:36&#10;Trump announced he would buy a Tesla and&#10;1:39&#10;lavished praise on the vehicles produced&#10;1:41&#10;by musk's company the justice department&#10;1:44&#10;meanwhile says that attacks on Tesla&#10;1:46&#10;cars and dealerships will be&#10;1:48&#10;investigated as domestic&#10;1:51&#10;terrorism restructuring the government&#10;1:53&#10;musk's so-called Department of&#10;1:55&#10;government efficiency which isn't a&#10;1:57&#10;department at all just as musk is not an&#10;2:00&#10;elected official has been firing people&#10;2:03&#10;across agencies and in some cases&#10;2:05&#10;forcing closures many of these like&#10;2:08&#10;foreign aid and consumer protection&#10;2:10&#10;agencies are perceived as left leaning&#10;2:13&#10;or woke by&#10;2:15&#10;conservatives the media has been called&#10;2:17&#10;the enemy of the People by Trump and his&#10;2:19&#10;allies he's personally sued ABC news for&#10;2:23&#10;defamation some media owners have&#10;2:25&#10;distanced their companies from&#10;2:26&#10;controversy before trouble could result&#10;2:29&#10;the washhington post owned by Amazon&#10;2:32&#10;founder Jeff Bezos opted not to publish&#10;2:34&#10;an endorsement of Trump's presidential&#10;2:36&#10;rival kamla Harris before the election&#10;2:40&#10;Elite universities have also long been&#10;2:42&#10;seen as hot beds of leftist woke thought&#10;2:45&#10;Trump's Administration has clamped down&#10;2:47&#10;on private schools like Columbia&#10;2:49&#10;University canceling funding for medical&#10;2:51&#10;research unless the school makes very&#10;2:54&#10;specific changes to its policies&#10;2:56&#10;Colombia has agreed to some demands and&#10;2:58&#10;is in negotiations&#10;3:00&#10;setting an example for other&#10;3:05&#10;schools deportations aren't just for&#10;3:07&#10;migrants suspected of being gang members&#10;3:10&#10;foreign students who have legal&#10;3:11&#10;residents but who are accused of&#10;3:13&#10;supporting Hamas have found themselves&#10;3:15&#10;in detention locked in legal battles to&#10;3:18&#10;stay in the&#10;3:22&#10;country those early actions make it&#10;3:24&#10;clear that for some at least there is a&#10;3:27&#10;price to pay for being in the opposition&#10;3:29&#10;and a reward for playing along meanwhile&#10;3:32&#10;Trump has promised that what's happened&#10;3:34&#10;so far is only the&#10;3:37&#10;[Music]&#10;3:40&#10;beginning my next guest says the Trump&#10;3:42&#10;Administration is now engaged in a&#10;3:44&#10;campaign to terrorize and Destroy&#10;3:46&#10;American higher education and he warns&#10;3:49&#10;Trump 2.0 could be a fascist regime in&#10;3:52&#10;the making the Hallmarks of which he&#10;3:54&#10;outlines in several books including his&#10;3:56&#10;most recent erasing history how fascists&#10;3:59&#10;rewrite the past to control the future&#10;4:01&#10;and his 2018 book how fascism works the&#10;4:05&#10;politics of Us and Them the author andl&#10;4:10&#10;philosophy Professor Jason Stanley joins&#10;4:12&#10;me now Professor it's good to have you&#10;4:13&#10;with us you have a very compelling&#10;4:16&#10;personal story which which I would like&#10;4:17&#10;to discuss in just a moment but first&#10;4:19&#10;I'd like to ask you to put on your&#10;4:21&#10;teaching hat for just a moment for us&#10;4:23&#10;you know as well as I do that labels are&#10;4:25&#10;being thrown around all the time now&#10;4:27&#10;fascist socialist capitalist and many&#10;4:29&#10;times times people they don't know what&#10;4:31&#10;these labels really mean could you&#10;4:33&#10;explain what what is fascism and then&#10;4:36&#10;tell us where you see it emerging in the&#10;4:39&#10;Trump&#10;4:40&#10;Administration fascism is what the Trump&#10;4:43&#10;Administration is now&#10;4:45&#10;doing the uh so uh you know there was a&#10;4:49&#10;last decade had kind of what we call the&#10;4:52&#10;fascism debate where people were like is&#10;4:55&#10;this just authoritarianism or is it&#10;4:57&#10;Fascism and in a way my own view now is&#10;5:01&#10;we need to get away there's a waste&#10;5:02&#10;total waste of time uh because it's very&#10;5:05&#10;clear that what we're seeing uh is uh is&#10;5:10&#10;you know dangerous far-right&#10;5:13&#10;authoritarianism and no one should care&#10;5:15&#10;at all what you call it uh but uh you&#10;5:18&#10;know uh uh labels like right-wing&#10;5:23&#10;authoritarianism uh or or labels like uh&#10;5:27&#10;populism right-wing populism are really&#10;5:29&#10;bad because they don't convey the threat&#10;5:32&#10;their ways of whitewashing the threat&#10;5:35&#10;what we have is a far-right&#10;5:37&#10;authoritarianism I've argued in detail&#10;5:39&#10;in my book that it fits the label of&#10;5:41&#10;fascism but I really think it's a&#10;5:44&#10;distraction right now let's bring this&#10;5:46&#10;into higher education the Trump&#10;5:48&#10;Administration is threatening to&#10;5:49&#10;withhold funds from universities because&#10;5:51&#10;it says these universities have failed&#10;5:53&#10;to fight&#10;5:55&#10;anti-Semitism the administration says&#10;5:57&#10;it's acting to protect Jews in America&#10;6:00&#10;what do you say to&#10;6:02&#10;that I asked my class yesterday at Yale&#10;6:06&#10;University uh who had Jewish who knew&#10;6:10&#10;Jewish students at Yale who participated&#10;6:13&#10;in the anti-war protests and encampments&#10;6:16&#10;last year and um you know the majority&#10;6:20&#10;of students raised their hands uh Jewish&#10;6:23&#10;students at Yale uh were one of the&#10;6:26&#10;biggest identity groups participating in&#10;6:28&#10;the encampment and the protests the&#10;6:31&#10;administration this regime is drawing a&#10;6:34&#10;distinction between good Jews and bad&#10;6:36&#10;Jews and we know the history of that uh&#10;6:39&#10;the good Jews are right-wing Jews who&#10;6:41&#10;are pro-israel the bad Jews are people&#10;6:44&#10;like me and many of my students here at&#10;6:47&#10;Yale who uh criticize Israel's actions&#10;6:51&#10;in Gaza as uh as you know genocidal&#10;6:55&#10;actions um so the and or at least you&#10;6:59&#10;know demand a ceasefire so the Trump&#10;7:02&#10;admin and the Trump Administration is as&#10;7:04&#10;usual appealing to stereotypes here they&#10;7:07&#10;appealing to a very dangerous&#10;7:09&#10;anti-semitic stereotype that we American&#10;7:12&#10;Jews control the institutions they're&#10;7:14&#10;leaning into that stereotype and saying&#10;7:17&#10;see what happens when you cross America&#10;7:19&#10;when you cross Jews they destroy you so&#10;7:22&#10;that of course increases anti-Semitism&#10;7:25&#10;it makes us much less safe it's&#10;7:27&#10;obviously an anti-Semitic attack on uh&#10;7:31&#10;anti-Semitism it's using us as the&#10;7:33&#10;sledgehammer of fascism and that is&#10;7:36&#10;wrong and dangerous for us but you're&#10;7:38&#10;you're seeing universities I'm thinking&#10;7:39&#10;of of Columbia University that they have&#10;7:42&#10;given in to the president's demands and&#10;7:44&#10;they're changing things because they&#10;7:46&#10;were afraid of losing the money and you&#10;7:48&#10;know a university can't really do&#10;7:50&#10;anything without money I mean would you&#10;7:51&#10;agree to&#10;7:53&#10;that no a university I mean you know if&#10;7:58&#10;if you agree to these demands you're not&#10;8:00&#10;a university anymore University is not&#10;8:02&#10;some buildings in a name uh a university&#10;8:05&#10;is a place of free inquiry and critical&#10;8:07&#10;inquiry and uh in the United States&#10;8:10&#10;given our relationship to Israel it's&#10;8:13&#10;perfectly legitimate to have a protest&#10;8:16&#10;movement that demands divestment from&#10;8:19&#10;military support of Israel you might&#10;8:21&#10;agree or disagree with it but dragging&#10;8:23&#10;students off the street to deport them&#10;8:26&#10;to Louisiana prisons because they've&#10;8:28&#10;Co-op Ed oped uh you know criticizing uh&#10;8:33&#10;Israel uh that's authoritarian so&#10;8:37&#10;universities need like other Democratic&#10;8:39&#10;institutions to band together and defend&#10;8:42&#10;democracy let's talk about your&#10;8:44&#10;University you have been at Yale since&#10;8:46&#10;2013 and that is about to change you're&#10;8:49&#10;you're leaving Yale and the United&#10;8:51&#10;States and can I say would it be correct&#10;8:54&#10;to say that you're getting out while you&#10;8:57&#10;can no I I have no fear at all and Yale&#10;9:01&#10;has protected its Scholars and you know&#10;9:04&#10;I we could have we could be speaking up&#10;9:06&#10;more loudly but Yale is really committed&#10;9:09&#10;to protecting its Scholars and we've&#10;9:11&#10;done really well and much better than an&#10;9:14&#10;institution like Colombia which is basic&#10;9:16&#10;which forced Katherine Frank to retire a&#10;9:19&#10;very distinguished law professor there&#10;9:21&#10;so Yale's done a great job I'm not&#10;9:23&#10;afraid of being I I am afraid of being&#10;9:26&#10;targeted a little by the federal&#10;9:27&#10;government but uh but I think Yale will&#10;9:31&#10;uh Yale's done a great job uh so so you&#10;9:35&#10;know I'm leaving because my non-citizen&#10;9:39&#10;colleagues cannot speak about politics&#10;9:43&#10;on social media or elsewhere or else&#10;9:45&#10;they're going to they might have their&#10;9:46&#10;visas pulled and uh and our&#10;9:49&#10;International students uh you know our&#10;9:51&#10;International students might not be able&#10;9:53&#10;to get through the border and I'm seeing&#10;9:55&#10;the monk school to the University of&#10;9:57&#10;Toronto where we're planning on creating&#10;9:59&#10;the world's top Center for defending&#10;10:02&#10;democracy bringing journalists In from&#10;10:04&#10;democratically from authoritarian&#10;10:06&#10;countries like Russia and the United&#10;10:08&#10;States um uh bringing in journalists&#10;10:11&#10;training them and strategizing with them&#10;10:13&#10;and the University of Toronto and&#10;10:16&#10;Canadian universities obviously are&#10;10:17&#10;going to benefit from this tremendous&#10;10:20&#10;pressure placed on American universities&#10;10:22&#10;well let me ask you let me play Devil's&#10;10:23&#10;Advocate a little bit why not stay at&#10;10:25&#10;Yale and fight the good fight where the&#10;10:27&#10;battle lines are are being drawn&#10;10:31&#10;well it's kind of easier to defend&#10;10:32&#10;Canada than it is to defend Yale um so&#10;10:36&#10;uh so I you know I could spend a lot of&#10;10:38&#10;time defending this institution or I&#10;10:41&#10;could be happy with or I could my&#10;10:43&#10;institution could not be under attack&#10;10:45&#10;and I could just defend democracy uh and&#10;10:48&#10;then so it and you know we academics&#10;10:52&#10;Academia look Academia is a meritocracy&#10;10:55&#10;I have the privilege to have this offer&#10;10:58&#10;and I believe the University of Toronto&#10;11:01&#10;is going to be going to be able to take&#10;11:03&#10;advantage of this attack on our&#10;11:05&#10;universities uh and I believe the United&#10;11:07&#10;States is getting to be a scary place&#10;11:10&#10;generally and uh and I University of&#10;11:13&#10;Toronto can be a Haven we can bring&#10;11:16&#10;Scholars and journalists there to&#10;11:18&#10;protect them better than uh we can do in&#10;11:21&#10;the United States look I'm going to be&#10;11:23&#10;fighting for American democracy wherever&#10;11:26&#10;I am do you feel that going and living&#10;11:28&#10;in can&#10;11:29&#10;will you and your family feel safer&#10;11:32&#10;living there than you would if you&#10;11:33&#10;stayed in the United&#10;11:35&#10;States well I don't really want to talk&#10;11:38&#10;about my personal situation that much I&#10;11:41&#10;black and a Jew I black Jewish children&#10;11:44&#10;uh so uh so I think there I I think that&#10;11:47&#10;anti-Semitism is going to rise as a&#10;11:50&#10;result of using us as a weapon against&#10;11:52&#10;universities and black and obviously

          <attvalue for="1" value="Journalist and author Paul Mason breaks down 5 ways we can stop fascism and resist the rise of the far right. Order your copy of How To Stop Fascism here: https://amzn.to/3w6jGad &#10;&#10;The far right is on the rise across the world. From Modi's India to Bolsonaro's Brazil and Erdogan's Turkey, fascism is not a horror that we have left in the past; it is a recurring nightmare that is happening again - and we need to find a better way to fight it.&#10;&#10;In How to Stop Fascism, Paul Mason offers a radical, hopeful blueprint for resisting and defeating the new far right. The book is both a chilling portrait of contemporary fascism, and a compelling history of the fascist phenomenon: its psychological roots, political theories and genocidal logic. Fascism, Mason powerfully argues, is a symptom of capitalist failure, one that has haunted us throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first.&#10;&#10;History shows us the conditions that breed fascism, and how it can be successfully overcome. But it is up to us in the present to challenge it, and time is running out. From the ashes of Covid-19, we have an opportunity to create a fairer, more equal society. To do so, we must ask ourselves: what kind of world do we want to live in? And what are we going to do about it?&#10;&#10;-------------------------------------------------------------------------&#10;&#10;Subscribe to the Penguin channel: &#10;http://po.st/SubscribePenguinYouTube&#10; &#10;Follow us here:&#10;&#10;Twitter |   / penguinukbooks  &#10;Website | http://www.penguin.co.uk&#10;Instagram |   / penguinukbooks  &#10;Facebook |   / penguinbooks  " />

          <attvalue for="4" value="Intro&#10;0:00&#10;- If there is even the slightest possibility&#10;0:02&#10;of a second fascist era,&#10;0:05&#10;we need to redouble our efforts to stop it.&#10;0:08&#10;The first fascist era killed&#10;0:11&#10;tens of millions of people in a world war,&#10;0:14&#10;6 million people in a genocide,&#10;0:17&#10;destroyed the European labour movement,&#10;0:21&#10;and indeed destroyed the democracies&#10;0:23&#10;of most democratic countries at the time.&#10;0:25&#10;That's not nothing, that's not a minor detail of history.&#10;0:28&#10;We only escaped it at massive human,&#10;0:33&#10;psychological, physical, economic cost.&#10;0:37&#10;So if there's a slightest chance that it happens again,&#10;0:40&#10;we need to understand why and we need to stop it.&#10;0:44&#10;(dramatic piano music)&#10;0:47&#10;Hi, I'm Paul Mason, journalist, author, and filmmaker,&#10;0:52&#10;and these are five ways to stop fascism.&#10;5 WAYS TO STOP FASCISM&#10;0:55&#10;(dramatic piano music)&#10;Learn from history&#10;0:58&#10;Number one, learn from history.&#10;1:01&#10;The number one thing we need to learn from history&#10;1:04&#10;is that fascism takes off when large numbers of people&#10;1:07&#10;experience a kind of mass religious conversion&#10;1:11&#10;to far right ideologies.&#10;1:13&#10;It's not about going from a thousand people to 2000 people.&#10;1:17&#10;It's about going from 2% in an election to 17% overnight,&#10;1:22&#10;and then taking power within three years.&#10;1:24&#10;It's like a volcano. It happens very, very quickly.&#10;1:28&#10;And in modern culture, we see the results.&#10;1:31&#10;I mean, fascism is everywhere in the movies,&#10;1:33&#10;but there's almost never a depiction of how it happens.&#10;1:37&#10;That an ordinary person in a small town&#10;1:41&#10;becomes psychologically attuned to the idea&#10;1:44&#10;of killing millions of people.&#10;1:46&#10;We need to understand that from history.&#10;1:48&#10;In Britain, we rightly remember that in 1936, in October,&#10;1:53&#10;tens of thousands of people went to the streets&#10;1:56&#10;in Cable Street, East London,&#10;1:58&#10;and stopped the fascists marching through the east end,&#10;2:01&#10;which was a Jewish area.&#10;2:03&#10;So the first thing we need to learn is that if&#10;2:05&#10;thousands of people turn out&#10;2:06&#10;and physically prevent fascism from attacking minorities,&#10;2:10&#10;it can succeed.&#10;2:11&#10;It's also the case that throughout Europe, in the 1930s,&#10;2:15&#10;in places where fascism was a threat and then resisted,&#10;2:19&#10;the only real thing that stopped them&#10;2:21&#10;was a political alliance of the centre and the left.&#10;2:24&#10;When the centre and the left were fighting each other,&#10;2:26&#10;fascism won.&#10;2:27&#10;When the left and the far left were fighting each other,&#10;2:30&#10;as tragically, my book points out, happened in Germany,&#10;2:33&#10;the fascists won.&#10;2:35&#10;When the centre and the left combined&#10;2:38&#10;at great cost to both sides,&#10;2:40&#10;with huge compromises and huge amounts of angst,&#10;2:43&#10;they did stop fascism.&#10;2:44&#10;That's the lesson we should draw from the thirties.&#10;2:47&#10;People who study history&#10;2:48&#10;rightly say that what triggered the first fascism&#10;2:52&#10;was the possibility of workers' revolution.&#10;2:54&#10;First in Russia, then in Germany, then in Italy,&#10;2:57&#10;and indeed throughout Europe.&#10;2:59&#10;And large sections of the middle-class&#10;3:01&#10;and the political elite looked at the working class&#10;3:04&#10;and said, &quot;We're terrified of that.&#10;3:06&#10;We need something to stop it.&quot;&#10;3:08&#10;In fact, one of the best ways to understand&#10;3:09&#10;the fascism of 1930s&#10;3:11&#10;was a revolution against the revolution.&#10;3:15&#10;Today we don't have a strong working class.&#10;3:18&#10;We don't have a revolutionary working class.&#10;3:20&#10;We don't have 13 million workers, as in Germany,&#10;3:23&#10;voting for Marxist parties.&#10;3:26&#10;But what we do have is Black Lives Matter.&#10;3:28&#10;What we do have is large LGBTQ+ movements&#10;3:32&#10;supported by governments.&#10;3:34&#10;What we do have is the Me Too movement.&#10;3:36&#10;We have women's rights, women's reproductive rights.&#10;3:39&#10;And if fascism is the fear of freedom&#10;3:42&#10;triggered by a glimpse of freedom,&#10;3:44&#10;then today's equivalent of those workers' revolutions&#10;3:47&#10;are those movements where people, black people,&#10;3:50&#10;women, ethnic minorities, others&#10;3:53&#10;who the fascists don't want to be free&#10;3:55&#10;are trying to free themselves.&#10;3:57&#10;And it's the same impulse.&#10;3:59&#10;The fear of freedom triggered by a glimpse of freedom&#10;4:03&#10;among people who the fascists don't want to be free.&#10;4:07&#10;Number two, accept it. Western society is in trouble.&#10;Western society is in trouble&#10;4:13&#10;In the thirties, it's clear that the rise of fascism&#10;4:16&#10;in Germany, for example, was driven by mass unemployment&#10;4:20&#10;and the collapse of the economy.&#10;4:22&#10;But in reality, there was more than that.&#10;4:25&#10;It was about the collapse of a belief system,&#10;4:27&#10;the collapse of a self-image that many German people had.&#10;4:31&#10;We need to learn today to understand&#10;4:33&#10;the rise of the far right in that context,&#10;4:36&#10;because yes, since 2008, the collapse of Lehman brothers,&#10;4:39&#10;there's been an economic crisis.&#10;4:41&#10;There's been stagnation, there's been destabilisation,&#10;4:44&#10;but the people in power have thrown trillions of money,&#10;4:49&#10;borrowed and even printed, at that problem.&#10;4:51&#10;There are still new coffee bars opening.&#10;4:53&#10;There is not mass unemployment. So why is there fascism?&#10;4:57&#10;My answer is there is fascism&#10;4:59&#10;even despite no mass unemployment,&#10;5:01&#10;because there is mass disorientation,&#10;5:03&#10;because people can't see the future,&#10;5:05&#10;because they were sold the idea that history had ended,&#10;5:09&#10;that free market globalised economics&#10;5:11&#10;was the end point of world development&#10;5:14&#10;and nothing better could be imagined.&#10;5:16&#10;And now they look at a world where Afghanistan,&#10;5:19&#10;Kabul falls in two days and the Americans can do nothing.&#10;5:22&#10;And Russia walks into Ukraine, and lo and behold,&#10;5:24&#10;the American president is inciting a fascist mob.&#10;5:27&#10;And they think,&#10;5:28&#10;&quot;That's not the world I was told to expect,&#10;5:31&#10;what is the answer?&quot;&#10;5:33&#10;Now, unless the left or indeed liberalism&#10;5:35&#10;can come up with a convincing&#10;5:38&#10;living, breathing alternative,&#10;5:40&#10;the only alternative people have is the colour of their skin,&#10;5:43&#10;the religion they grew up with, and for men,&#10;5:47&#10;their status within male dominated societies.&#10;5:49&#10;And this is why we're seeing the return of racism,&#10;5:54&#10;nationalism, xenophobia,&#10;5:57&#10;and kind of organised violent misogyny.&#10;6:00&#10;The combination of mass disillusionment in the system&#10;6:04&#10;with mass dissatisfaction with democracy&#10;6:06&#10;is perfect for fascism because it says,&#10;6:08&#10;look, we can solve that.&#10;6:10&#10;You don't need democracy.&#10;6:11&#10;There's a man here who will solve all your problems.&#10;6:14&#10;He will deliver you from all the evils that you perceive.&#10;6:17&#10;Leave it to him.&#10;6:19&#10;And the left has a very difficult time countering that,&#10;6:22&#10;'cause left says, no, you do it yourself.&#10;6:25&#10;The left politics are always, life is complicated.&#10;6:29&#10;You must struggle.&#10;6:30&#10;You must, if you want freedom, you must achieve it yourself.&#10;6:34&#10;Fascists say, no, we can, we'll give it to you.&#10;6:36&#10;We'll give you freedom.&#10;6:37&#10;Just unfortunately involves&#10;6:39&#10;taking about 6 million people and killing them.&#10;6:43&#10;But you'll have freedom.&#10;6:45&#10;That, at a time of crisis, becomes very, very attractive.&#10;6:48&#10;We must never underestimate how attractive it was,&#10;6:51&#10;not to a few tens of thousands of evil people,&#10;6:54&#10;but to millions of really ordinary, quite good people.&#10;6:58&#10;That's the threat.&#10;7:00&#10;Number three, we need to be proud, active antifascists.&#10;We need proud, active antifascists&#10;7:06&#10;If I say to you the word anti-fascist,&#10;7:08&#10;or it's shortened form, antifa,&#10;7:11&#10;then you probably think of somebody on a demonstration&#10;7:13&#10;trying to stop the far right, marching through an area,&#10;7:16&#10;being chased by the police, having, you know,&#10;7:19&#10;their house under surveillance by the far right,&#10;7:21&#10;being threatened, being doxed.&#10;7:24&#10;We need to own anti-fascism as a mass thing,&#10;7:28&#10;we need to say no more.&#10;7:30&#10;Are we gonna leave it up to brave individual activists,&#10;7:34&#10;NGOs, monitoring groups, to do the anti-fascism?&#10;7:39&#10;We need to embody it first and foremost&#10;7:41&#10;in our everyday lives.&#10;7:42&#10;I mean just saying I'm against fascism,&#10;7:45&#10;I'm against racism, I'm against violent misogyny.&#10;7:47&#10;The idea of a global ethnic civil war is an abomination.&#10;7:52&#10;Fantasies of genocide are not acceptable.&#10;7:55&#10;We need to say that to the people&#10;7:57&#10;who are coming out with this stuff.&#10;7:58&#10;And ultimately yes,&#10;8:00&#10;in the end some of us are gonna have to stand&#10;8:03&#10;on street corners and stop the far right&#10;8:05&#10;marching into migrant areas.&#10;8:07&#10;Yeah, we're gonna do that,&#10;8:08&#10;but much more important is that we embody the principle&#10;8:13&#10;of anti-fascism, almost an ethos of anti-fascism,&#10;8:17&#10;in our everyday lives.&#10;8:18&#10;If we do that, the ideological space that's created&#10;8:23&#10;every time some taxi driver comes out&#10;8:25&#10;with some racist or sexist comment, if we do that,&#10;8:28&#10;we closed down the ideological space for the people who,&#10;8:34&#10;in the end, are gonna put us in a concrete box&#10;8:36&#10;from which we do not emerge.&#10;8:38&#10;It's no longer the case that simply by physically&#10;8:42&#10;suppressing fascist activity we're gonna stop it.&#10;8:45&#10;The ideas are out there.&#10;8:47&#10;They're out there in the form of&#10;8:48&#10;the Q-Anon conspiracy theory,&#10;8:50&#10;where the Q-Anon conspiracy theory says&#10;8:52&#10;Hollywood is full of people who drink children's blood&#10;8:55&#10;and use it to gain everlasting life.&#10;8:57&#10;It's just a repeat of the slander against the Jewish people&#10;9:02&#10;that the Nazis perpetrated, you know, a hundred years ago.&#10;9:06&#10;That's all it is, but it's out there.&#10;9:08&#10;We're dealing with them, with a mass process&#10;9:11&#10;of psychological and quasi-religious conversion.&#10;9:15&#10;It is underway, and so what do you do against that?&#10;9:20&#10;Sadly, the kind of liberal idea is,&#10;9:23&#10;well, you reason with them.&#10;9:25&#10;Yes, let's reason with them.&#10;9:26&#10;Let's introduce them to science,&#10;9:29&#10;but as you do so you will find&#10;9:31&#10;that they already have an anti-science, pre-prepared,&#10;9:34&#10;ready to copy and paste into any Facebook group,&#10;9:37&#10;any Reddit channel&#10;9:38&#10;where you're confronting them with logic and science.&#10;9:41&#10;So it needs to go beyond that.&#10;9:43&#10;In the 1930s there was this French anarchist&#10;9:46&#10;who toured early Nazi Germany.&#10;9:48&#10;And he said, look,&#10;9:48&#10;the only thing that could have stopped this&#10;9:50&#10;when it gets to the stage of mass quasi-religiousness&#10;9:53&#10;is a living, breathing alternative.&#10;9:56&#10;So we have to produce a living, breathing alternative.&#10;9:58&#10;And my alternative, yes, is anti-capitalism,&#10;10:01&#10;but yours doesn't need to be.&#10;10:03&#10;If you're a liberal, even if you're a liberal conservative,&#10;10:06&#10;you need to produce&#10;10:07&#10;a living, breathing alternative that is attractive,&#10;10:11&#10;and more attractive than the racist, misogynist utopia&#10;10:15&#10;being peddled by Trump and his supporters.&#10;10:19&#10;Number four, we need a political alliance&#10;A political alliance of left &amp; centre&#10;10:22&#10;of the left and the centre.&#10;10:24&#10;We're facing now a bunch of people&#10;10:27&#10;who want to kick off a global ethnic civil war.&#10;10:29&#10;They openly fantasise about genocide.&#10;10:32&#10;Now, if we're faced with that,&#10;10:33&#10;we need the maximum number of people united around this,&#10;10:37&#10;the one objective of stopping it,&#10;10:39&#10;and the history of the 1930s, which I explore in my book,&#10;10:43&#10;shows that that was the only way it was done.&#10;10:46&#10;When it was left to the working class alone,&#10;10:48&#10;the working class alone,&#10;10:49&#10;even when it had like millions of active Marxists,&#10;10:52&#10;couldn't stop fascism.&#10;10:54&#10;Neither could the liberal bourgeois elite.&#10;10:57&#10;When they combined together, what happened?&#10;11:00&#10;They didn't just combine or rather compromise&#10;11:04&#10;between their two ideologies.&#10;11:06&#10;A new ethos was born.&#10;11:07&#10;The ethos you see in movies like Casablanca,&#10;11:10&#10;which is an ethos of anti-fascism, it's a moral philosophy,&#10;11:14&#10;which doesn't just have a negative to it,&#10;11:16&#10;which is stopping the fascists.&#10;11:18&#10;It has something positive, a positive vision of humanity&#10;11:21&#10;that the left and the centre could,&#10;11:24&#10;for that one moment in history, share.&#10;11:26&#10;And indeed did share in the process of defeating Hitler,&#10;11:30&#10;defeating Mussolini, and ending the second world war.&#10;11:33&#10;I think the first thing we're gonna have to do&#10;11:35&#10;to create the alliance we need to stop fascism&#10;11:38&#10;is to just have a kind of frank discussion within the left&#10;11:41&#10;and a frank discussion within the liberal centre.&#10;11:44&#10;I mean the liberal center's just got to stop the kind of&#10;11:47&#10;ignore them, they'll go away attitude.&#10;11:49&#10;They've got to stop treating the left&#10;11:50&#10;as if it's the main enemy.&#10;11:52&#10;They've got to admit that some things they screwed up.&#10;11:55&#10;One would be imposing 10 years of austerity&#10;11:59&#10;so that life never gets better.&#10;12:00&#10;The left, well, the first thing you'd learn,&#10;12:03&#10;I've been a leftist for 40 odd years.&#10;12:05&#10;First thing you learn on the left is popular fronts are bad.&#10;12:08&#10;That cross class alliance of the 1930s ended in tragedy.&#10;12:11&#10;Well, it did.&#10;12:12&#10;It did end in tragedy, and the Spanish civil war was lost.&#10;12:15&#10;The French popular front stopped fascism,&#10;12:17&#10;but then fell apart.&#10;12:19&#10;I think we must cease awarding ourselves&#10;12:22&#10;the luxury of ignoring the real lessons&#10;12:25&#10;of the popular front.&#10;12:27&#10;The popular fronts' formal political agreements&#10;12:30&#10;between liberals, socialists and communists&#10;12:33&#10;did, for a time, stop fascism.&#10;12:36&#10;I will take that as a historical outcome,&#10;12:38&#10;despite all the compromises,&#10;12:40&#10;they had to sing the national anthem,&#10;12:42&#10;they have to vote for the army budget,&#10;12:45&#10;they had to fly the national flag and not the red flag.&#10;12:48&#10;And in France, they stopped supporting&#10;12:50&#10;the rights of French colonies to independence.&#10;12:53&#10;That was the price the communists paid&#10;12:55&#10;for joining the popular front.&#10;12:56&#10;What did they gain?&#10;12:58&#10;Mass strikes, mass movement, mass influence,&#10;13:01&#10;and the political, and indeed, a cultural movement,&#10;13:06&#10;the like of which we certainly haven't seen&#10;13:09&#10;in our lifetimes,&#10;13:10&#10;but then set the entire agenda of the next 10,&#10;13:14&#10;probably in the next 50 years.&#10;13:16&#10;Everything that was done after the second world war&#10;13:18&#10;to democratise the world, to instal human rights,&#10;13:21&#10;universally was done because of the anti-fascist ethos&#10;13:25&#10;that was born in the thirties.&#10;13:27&#10;And what I would like to do with my book&#10;13:29&#10;and in discussions around it&#10;13:31&#10;is invite people to rekindle a new version of that ethos&#10;13:35&#10;so that when we have defeated this far right,&#10;13:37&#10;we don't just stop.&#10;13:39&#10;We build a better world based on universal values&#10;13:42&#10;and a bubble on human beings.&#10;13:46&#10;The stakes are huge&#10;13:47&#10;and learning the lessons of the popular fronts in the 1930s&#10;13:51&#10;is obligatory for anybody who wants to do politics today.&#10;13:55&#10;Number five, we need new antifascist laws and regulations.&#10;New antifascist laws and regulations&#10;14:01&#10;Here's three things we could do legally&#10;14:04&#10;and using regulation to suppress modern fascism.&#10;14:07&#10;First, ban uniformed parades.&#10;14:10&#10;What they specialise in are,&#10;14:12&#10;even when they're wearing weird uniforms,&#10;14:14&#10;like the Boogaloo Boys with their Hawaiian shirts,&#10;14:17&#10;or the Proud Boys with their Fred Perry shirts&#10;14:20&#10;and their funny hats or their kilts.&#10;14:22&#10;What they want and what they specialise in&#10;14:25&#10;is the militarization of public space.&#10;14:27&#10;So that you are there just as an individual,&#10;14:29&#10;maybe protesting them, you know,&#10;14:30&#10;sometimes maybe with your kids, with you,&#10;14:32&#10;but they are there, tooled up, ready,&#10;14:36&#10;often armed in America.&#10;14:37&#10;You've just got to say no more.&#10;14:39&#10;That, you know, we can't have the luxury of that.&#10;14:41&#10;The second is to criminalise hate speech.&#10;14:44&#10;Now it already is criminalised, but it's still there.&#10;14:47&#10;So what's going wrong.&#10;14:47&#10;We're not enforcing laws against hate speech.&#10;14:50&#10;Twitter, Facebook, YouTube have become&#10;14:54&#10;the greatest accelerators of genocidal thought&#10;14:58&#10;and incitement to violence in the world.&#10;15:02&#10;You can pass laws against it,&#10;15:03&#10;but you also have to do something&#10;15:04&#10;to the corporations themselves.&#10;15:06&#10;And I've become convinced we need to regulate them&#10;15:08&#10;as if they were newspapers or TV shows.&#10;15:11&#10;If the Daily Mail incited violence it would be prosecuted.&#10;15:15&#10;Unfortunately Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and the rest&#10;15:20&#10;have become platforms for&#10;15:21&#10;exactly this. And so we need to regulate them.&#10;15:25&#10;We also finally, and this, again,&#10;15:26&#10;I know I'm gonna be unpopular here.&#10;15:29&#10;Anonymity is sometimes necessary for people,&#10;15:33&#10;but it's not necessary for the human species&#10;15:36&#10;to be interacting with millions of fake accounts.&#10;15:39&#10;An artificial person can slander me,&#10;15:43&#10;can threaten me with violence.&#10;15:44&#10;What's the downside of eradicating&#10;15:46&#10;large amounts of non-existent people&#10;15:48&#10;and content generated by them?&#10;15:50&#10;Why should there be anonymity for that person?&#10;15:54&#10;That's a hard thing to say, because of course,&#10;15:56&#10;anonymity is useful for people&#10;15:57&#10;who are suffering domestic violence,&#10;15:59&#10;people who haven't come out yet, who might be gay.&#10;16:01&#10;Yes, but there's always a trade off.&#10;16:03&#10;And I think we should have an honest discussion&#10;16:05&#10;about the trade offs that anonymity creates.&#10;16:09&#10;And we shouldn't automatically accept&#10;16:12&#10;that fascists have a right&#10;16:14&#10;to anonymously threaten us with death.&#10;16:16&#10;The legal crackdown on fascism does not, in itself,&#10;16:20&#10;defeat fascism.&#10;16:21&#10;Combined with a mass movement, mass resistance,&#10;16:25&#10;and combined with the fight for an anti-fascist ethos&#10;16:28&#10;within our culture and society,&#10;16:29&#10;I think it does give us a chance.&#10;16:31&#10;And the evidence for that is all the places&#10;16:35&#10;where fascism was a threat in the thirties,&#10;16:37&#10;where these three things were done:&#10;16:38&#10;Mass resistance, legal crackdown, anti-fascist ethos,&#10;16:42&#10;and they defeated fascism.&#10;16:44&#10;We only have one case study, the thirties,&#10;16:47&#10;and we have to draw every lesson we can from it&#10;16:49&#10;because the new thirties are approaching.&#10;16:53&#10;Yes, of course I believe we can defeat fascism.&#10;16:56&#10;The fascists, where they were defeated in the thirties,&#10;16:59&#10;were actually defeated by people who had hope,&#10;17:02&#10;who had made a moral choice&#10;17:05&#10;that they were going to stop fascism.&#10;17:07&#10;By taking that decision to be an anti-fascist,&#10;17:10&#10;to activate your anti-fascist impulses,&#10;17:14&#10;you will force others around you,&#10;17:15&#10;you will oblige those around you to take their decisions.&#10;17:19&#10;And before we know it, we'll have a mass cultural movement&#10;17:23&#10;that is positive, that celebrates life,&#10;17:26&#10;that celebrates diversity,&#10;17:28&#10;that celebrates women's advance&#10;17:30&#10;towards reproductive rights and personal freedom.&#10;17:33&#10;And the fascists will go back into their hole,&#10;17:35&#10;which is where they belong.&#10;17:37&#10;But it's gonna need you to do something,&#10;17:39&#10;not somebody else.&#10;17:41&#10;So think about it.&#10;17:43&#10;Thanks for watching.&#10;17:44&#10;You can get my book, &quot;How to Stop Fascism&quot;,&#10;17:47&#10;in hardback, audio book or ebook&#10;17:50&#10;by clicking on the link in the description below.&#10;17:52&#10;And don't forget to click here to subscribe to Penguin&#10;17:56&#10;for more videos like this." />

Desires are imitated from the first moment we are born. Our desires form from what our parents, friends, and significant others want in life. Now placed in a group, large or small, these imitative desires are even more powerful. These transferred desires within a group do create cohesion, but they're also the heart of where scapegoats are born.&#10;&#10;A scapegoat is someone outside of your group who also stands out from the social norm. The group then uses these scapegoats to transfer blame and negative emotions because they do not share the desires of the group. This blame, negative emotion, or fundamental truth is something the group does not want to acknowledge internally, so the blame is transferred to the scapegoat. &#10;&#10;In an instant, the problems of the group are gone because of the transfer of blame onto the scapegoat. Since scapegoats are identified as the root cause of the problem, they create a sense of relief, healing, and even protection for the group.&#10;&#10;Read the video transcript: https://bigthink.com/videos/scapegoat&#10;&#10;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &#10;&#10;About Luke Burgis: &#10;Luke Burgis has co-created and led four companies in wellness, consumer products, and technology.

          <attvalue for="4" value="Intro&#10;0:00&#10;(light classical music)&#10;0:01&#10;- Each of us thinks of ourselves&#10;0:03&#10;as kind of a little god.&#10;0:07&#10;It's very uncomfortable for us to think&#10;0:09&#10;that our desires might not be entirely our own.&#10;0:16&#10;There's a certain humility needed&#10;0:19&#10;to understand that I'm the product&#10;0:22&#10;of other people's desires, starting with my parents.&#10;0:28&#10;Humans tends to group people on the inside&#10;0:31&#10;and on the outside.&#10;0:33&#10;In order to maintain group identity and social cohesion,&#10;0:38&#10;it's a never-ending process.&#10;0:42&#10;And that can bring us into a dangerous vicious cycle&#10;0:47&#10;because as humans,&#10;0:48&#10;we have a natural tendency to transfer blame.&#10;0:53&#10;Which means, scapegoats are all around us.&#10;0:58&#10;All it takes is somebody to stand out a little bit&#10;1:02&#10;and that starts this process of scapegoating.&#10;1:08&#10;Once one person has identified a person or a group&#10;1:12&#10;as problematic, it makes it a lot easier&#10;1:15&#10;for the second and third and fourth person&#10;1:18&#10;to believe in the guilt of the scapegoat.&#10;1:23&#10;I'm Luke Burgis,&#10;1:25&#10;founder of Fourth Wall Ventures,&#10;1:27&#10;and author of the book&#10;1:28&#10;&quot;Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life.&quot;&#10;1:36&#10;(light music)&#10;Desire is memetic&#10;1:38&#10;Rene Girard was one of the great interdisciplinary minds&#10;1:41&#10;of the 20th century.&#10;1:44&#10;He was a French thinker who spent 15 years of his life&#10;1:46&#10;at Stanford University.&#10;1:49&#10;He was a genius of human nature.&#10;1:53&#10;He had this keen power of observation&#10;1:55&#10;to see what was at the root of human behavior.&#10;2:01&#10;And one of the observations that he had&#10;2:03&#10;was that desire is mimetic.&#10;2:08&#10;To say that desire is mimetic is to say&#10;2:10&#10;that it's imitative.&#10;2:12&#10;We imitate the desires of others,&#10;2:15&#10;really from the first moment that we're born.&#10;2:18&#10;And as groups, it's even more powerful.&#10;2:23&#10;This gets to the heart of the scapegoat mechanism.&#10;2:28&#10;The more people begin to engage in this mimetic process,&#10;2:31&#10;the easier it is to convince ourselves&#10;2:34&#10;of the guilt of the scapegoat.&#10;2:37&#10;(light classical music)&#10;What is scapegoating&#10;2:39&#10;A scapegoat is someone or some group&#10;2:43&#10;that is used to achieve a very specific purpose.&#10;2:49&#10;People make scapegoats when there's some fundamental truth&#10;2:54&#10;that they don't want to acknowledge.&#10;2:58&#10;A person or a society can transfer the blame onto them&#10;3:03&#10;and expel or eliminate them&#10;3:07&#10;and imagine that the cause of all of their problems is gone.&#10;3:12&#10;People do it because it produces a sense of catharsis&#10;3:17&#10;or relief or healing.&#10;3:21&#10;Scapegoating feels good&#10;3:24&#10;because it's a way of protecting ourselves&#10;3:27&#10;from having to suffer.&#10;3:30&#10;Somebody else has to pay the price for our sins,&#10;3:34&#10;for our weakness.&#10;3:37&#10;Scapegoating also forms group identity.&#10;3:42&#10;Throughout history, when there's absolute social disorder&#10;3:46&#10;is the time when there's most likely to be a scapegoat.&#10;3:51&#10;And the scapegoat brings a moment of peace and relief.&#10;3:56&#10;&quot;Ah, we finally identified the root of the problem.&#10;3:59&#10;We dealt with that.&quot;&#10;4:01&#10;(light music)&#10;4:03&#10;But the scapegoat mechanism never happens intentionally.&#10;4:09&#10;It's always subconscious.&#10;4:13&#10;If we thought that we were scapegoating,&#10;4:16&#10;it wouldn't produce the catharsis.&#10;4:18&#10;It wouldn't produce the desired effect.&#10;4:21&#10;So, scapegoats are selected&#10;4:23&#10;through an entirely unconscious process.&#10;4:28&#10;It could be totally random.&#10;4:30&#10;They could just be in the wrong place at the wrong time.&#10;4:35&#10;But it can also be people or groups&#10;4:38&#10;that deviated a little bit&#10;4:40&#10;from the societal norm.&#10;4:44&#10;They broke some taboo.&#10;4:46&#10;They said something that was threatening&#10;4:49&#10;to the social order.&#10;4:53&#10;And the interesting thing is,&#10;4:55&#10;the guilt or innocence at the end of the day&#10;4:58&#10;doesn't really matter.&#10;5:00&#10;- Picking up Simpson's trail as he and another man&#10;5:03&#10;rode along a Los Angeles freeway&#10;5:04&#10;in that white Ford Bronco that you see.&#10;5:06&#10;- Many scapegoats are innocent,&#10;5:09&#10;but a scapegoat doesn't have to be innocent&#10;5:12&#10;to make an effective scapegoat.&#10;5:14&#10;- And Bonds hits one high.&#10;5:16&#10;- A scapegoat can be guilty and still provide&#10;5:20&#10;that same catharsis to the people.&#10;5:24&#10;One of the ways that I think this plays out in our culture&#10;5:28&#10;is with the death penalty.&#10;5:31&#10;We certainly don't have to put anybody to death&#10;5:34&#10;in order to stay safe.&#10;5:36&#10;What if there was a mimetic process involved&#10;5:41&#10;with capital punishment&#10;5:43&#10;that was totally separate, an independent variable,&#10;5:47&#10;from the guilt or innocence of the person on death row?&#10;5:52&#10;There's more going on here than just criminal justice.&#10;5:58&#10;Think about all of the ritual elements&#10;6:00&#10;of the death penalty.&#10;6:02&#10;There's the back and forth in the media.&#10;6:04&#10;- I just wish that there could've been more suffering,&#10;6:07&#10;so to speak.&#10;6:08&#10;- In many states, there's a last meal.&#10;6:10&#10;- Timothy McVeigh's last meal consisted of two pints&#10;6:14&#10;of mint chocolate chip ice cream.&#10;6:16&#10;- There seems to be something deeper,&#10;6:19&#10;almost religious and sacred and sacrificial,&#10;6:22&#10;about capital punishment.&#10;6:24&#10;- Hearse carrying Bundy moved from the prison,&#10;6:26&#10;past a group of cheering spectators&#10;6:28&#10;who had waited for Bundy to die and some said&#10;6:30&#10;Bundy should've suffered more than he did.&#10;6:32&#10;(crowd cheering)&#10;6:33&#10;- It's worth asking where that's coming from.&#10;6:37&#10;And I think Girard and mimetic theory&#10;6:39&#10;provides some insight into this sacred function&#10;6:44&#10;of the scapegoating ritual.&#10;6:47&#10;Where people have to die in order for our society&#10;6:52&#10;to feel that something good has been done&#10;6:57&#10;and that we're able to move on.&#10;6:59&#10;(intense classical music continues)&#10;7:02&#10;We see these big scapegoats throughout history,&#10;7:05&#10;Jesus, the Holocaust,&#10;7:09&#10;but scapegoats happen on a micro level all the time.&#10;7:13&#10;(crowd cheering)&#10;7:14&#10;Steve Bartman, the Cubs fan who was scapegoated&#10;7:16&#10;for causing the Cubs to lose.&#10;7:19&#10;Sports teams that have a bad year,&#10;7:22&#10;what's the go-to method to make everything better?&#10;7:25&#10;You fire the coach.&#10;7:29&#10;We look around in our workplace&#10;7:31&#10;and we see people being scapegoated and fired.&#10;7:36&#10;Scapegoats are made in the news media&#10;7:38&#10;and in politics practically every day.&#10;7:42&#10;You make a scapegoat and 24 hours later, we need a new one.&#10;7:46&#10;The universe is swarming with scapegoats,&#10;7:49&#10;yet, none of us actually think that we have&#10;7:52&#10;any of our own.&#10;7:56&#10;So, the question to ask is,&#10;7:58&#10;who's your scapegoat?&#10;8:01&#10;Pull back and look at the systems of desire&#10;8:03&#10;that we're in.&#10;8:05&#10;Who are those people that are on the outside&#10;8:08&#10;of the economy,&#10;8:10&#10;that are on the outside of political processes,&#10;8:14&#10;who are the people that are bearing the weight&#10;8:17&#10;for the rest of us?&#10;8:19&#10;(intense classical music continues)&#10;8:34&#10;- Get smarter, faster with videos&#10;8:36&#10;from the world's biggest thinkers.&#10;8:39&#10;And to learn even more from the world's biggest thinkers.&#10;8:41&#10;Get

          <attvalue for="4" value="Intro&#10;0:01&#10;On July 13, 1944, William James Sidis’s landlord found him unconscious in his small&#10;0:07&#10;Boston boarding house.&#10;0:09&#10;He had suffered a massive stroke.&#10;0:11&#10;And lay dying.&#10;0:13&#10;William may have been the smartest person who ever lived.&#10;0:16&#10;His IQ was somewhere between 250 and 300.&#10;0:20&#10;To put that in perspective, Einstein’s was estimated to be 200.&#10;0:25&#10;William’s parents were brilliant Ukrainian Jewish immigrants.&#10;0:28&#10;Boris Sidis was a renowned psychologist, Sarah Sidis went to medical school at a time when&#10;0:33&#10;few women did.&#10;0:35&#10;William - or Billy as he was known - learned the alphabet by six months of age.&#10;0:40&#10;At 18 months, he could read the New York Times.&#10;0:43&#10;He enrolled at Harvard University at age 11!&#10;0:47&#10;When he graduated, William told reporters he intended to live the “perfect life”.&#10;0:51&#10;But that would not come to be.&#10;Early Life&#10;0:54&#10;William James Sidis was born on April Fool’s Day, 1898, in New York City.&#10;0:59&#10;Violent anti-Semitic attacks in Ukraine, which was then part of the Russian empire, drove&#10;1:04&#10;his parents to the promised land, where they met when Boris tutored Sarah in English.&#10;1:09&#10;She encouraged him to go to Harvard, where he studied psychology and used some of his&#10;1:13&#10;psychological principles to help mold his son.&#10;1:17&#10;He said: “You know the old saying - ‘As the twig is bent, the tree’s inclined.’&#10;1:22&#10;Parents cannot too soon begin the work of bending the minds of their children in the&#10;1:27&#10;right direction…”&#10;1:28&#10;William’s parents attributed his extraordinary intelligence not to genes but to his upbringing.&#10;1:33&#10;As a baby, they treated him like an adult.&#10;1:36&#10;When he was a few months old, William’s parents placed food and a spoon in front of&#10;1:41&#10;him.&#10;1:42&#10;They let William observe, and he learned to feed himself.&#10;1:44&#10;His mum recalled: “He squealed with delight.&#10;1:47&#10;No one had taught him; he had reasoned it out.”&#10;1:50&#10;This natural way of reasoning is also how his parents taught him how to spell.&#10;1:55&#10;Instead of learning through memorization, William learned to spell by focusing on the&#10;1:59&#10;underlying patterns and structures.&#10;2:01&#10;For example, if he learned the word “BAT” using letter blocks, then he understood that&#10;2:05&#10;modifying the word by, say, swapping out the “a” for an “e” would form a new word&#10;2:10&#10;with a different meaning.&#10;2:12&#10;In the same way that he learned to spell, William learned eight languages by the age&#10;2:16&#10;of eight by understanding the fundamental principles of language structure.&#10;2:21&#10;Besides English, he knew: Latin, Greek, German, Russian, Hebrew, Turkish, French, and Armenian.&#10;2:28&#10;He even invented his own language as a child, Vendergood which drew on European influences.&#10;2:34&#10;Instead of reading him fairy tales at bedtime, his parents read him Greek myths, which helped&#10;2:39&#10;him learn about the planets.&#10;2:41&#10;Jupiter is named after the Roman god Jupiter which is adapted from Zeus in Greek mythology.&#10;2:47&#10;Every moment was an opportunity to learn.&#10;2:50&#10;William had no time for or interest in playing with toys.&#10;2:54&#10;He didn’t play sports or any games at recess.&#10;2:57&#10;His father thought such childish pursuits were silly and meaningless.&#10;3:00&#10;For some reason, he had a tremendous fear of dogs.&#10;High School&#10;3:07&#10;His only enjoyment was riding on streetcars when his parents took him to museums, libraries,&#10;3:12&#10;parks, and zoos.&#10;3:14&#10;He collected 1,600 streetcar transfers by the time he was in his twenties.&#10;3:19&#10;William ended up finishing elementary school in less than one year, and high school in&#10;3:23&#10;six weeks.&#10;3:25&#10;His mom remarked: “The newspapers never missed a chance to try and prove that he was&#10;3:29&#10;insane, or psychotic, or simply a freak.&#10;3:32&#10;In truth, Billy was a completely normal child in every respect.”&#10;3:38&#10;The media attention followed him to Harvard.&#10;3:40&#10;Where they portrayed him as a “know it all”, like in this New Yorker cartoon where he’s&#10;3:44&#10;lecturing to a group of men.&#10;3:46&#10;After entering Harvard at age 11, he gave a lecture to the Math Club about the fourth&#10;3:51&#10;dimension, which is an extension beyond the 3D space we experience.&#10;3:55&#10;Here, he’s talking about shapes with many sides in the fourth dimension, which demonstrates&#10;4:00&#10;his astounding ability to comprehend complex mathematical concepts beyond his years.&#10;4:06&#10;A professor at MIT who attended the lecture proclaimed: “I predict that young Sidis&#10;4:11&#10;will be a great astronomical mathematician.”&#10;4:13&#10;Yet, this never happened.&#10;4:16&#10;In fact, he would grow to resent mathematics.&#10;4:19&#10;Shortly after the lecture, he fell ill, which made all the news.&#10;4:23&#10;The media reported that he had suffered a mental breakdown which was a rumor that dogged&#10;4:28&#10;him his entire life.&#10;4:30&#10;He did live with his family on an estate in New Hampshire that was also the grounds of&#10;4:34&#10;the sanatorium Boris was running.&#10;4:36&#10;(Sidis Psychotherapeutic Institute)&#10;4:37&#10;William only returned to Harvard several months later and never fit in.&#10;4:41&#10;His biographer Amy Wallace described how he was: “A complete freak in the eyes of his&#10;4:46&#10;fellow students, he had none of the social graces, no interest in sports or girls, and&#10;4:51&#10;was several years younger.”&#10;4:53&#10;When he graduated from Harvard, he told reporters, &quot;I want to live the perfect life.&#10;4:58&#10;The only way to live the perfect life is to live it in seclusion.&#10;5:01&#10;I have always hated crowds.”&#10;5:04&#10;His idea of the perfect life is described in a paper he wrote utopian society called&#10;5:10&#10;Hesperia.&#10;5:11&#10;Hesperia’s Constitution begins with: “We, the people”, reminiscent of the U.S. Constitution.&#10;5:17&#10;But that was where the similarities end.&#10;5:20&#10;In Hesperia, those who want citizenship have to pass an intelligence test.&#10;5:24&#10;Marriage is forbidden, while polygamy is completely legal.&#10;5:29&#10;Interestingly, children are not raised by their biological parents, and instead, “Male&#10;5:34&#10;children shall be assigned to the charge of male guardians, and female children to the&#10;5:38&#10;charge of female guardians.”&#10;5:41&#10;He rejected the influence of his parents, particularly that of his domineering mother.&#10;5:47&#10;After leaving Harvard, he took up a position teaching mathematics at Rice Institute, now&#10;5:51&#10;Rice University in Houston.&#10;5:54&#10;He was 17 years old.&#10;5:55&#10;Just like at Harvard, William didn’t fit in at Rice.&#10;5:59&#10;Students teased him for never having kissed a girl.&#10;6:01&#10;Girls faked crushes on him as a joke.&#10;6:04&#10;He stayed at Rice for only eight months and then enrolled at Harvard Law School in the&#10;6:08&#10;fall of 1916.&#10;6:10&#10;Then, for some unknown reason, he quit in his last semester and failed to earn a law&#10;6:15&#10;degree.&#10;6:16&#10;His mother was furious and would tell people that her son left his studies because Harvard&#10;6:19&#10;Law had to shut down due to World War I, which was not true.&#10;6:23&#10;William was very much anti-war.&#10;6:25&#10;He refused to register for the draft and nearly went to prison if it weren’t for the armistice&#10;6:30&#10;of 1918 that ended the first world war.&#10;6:33&#10;He was extremely passionate about politics.&#10;6:36&#10;He was briefly jailed after leading a May Day rally in Boston, an anti-war, workers’&#10;6:41&#10;rights rally organized by the Socialists that turned violent.&#10;6:44&#10;organized by the Socialists, organized by the Socialists, which also conveyed a strong&#10;6:45&#10;anti-war message.&#10;6:46&#10;He rebelled against the capitalist system that propelled his parents from their status&#10;6:49&#10;as poor immigrants to a position of success in American society.&#10;6:54&#10;While in jail, he met and fell head over heels for Martha Foley, a 20-year-old Irish girl&#10;6:59&#10;who grew up in Boston.&#10;7:00&#10;“HARVARD’S BOY PRODIGY VOWS NEVER TO MARRY SIDIS PLEDGES CELIBACY BENEATH STURDY OAK,&#10;7:01&#10;HAS 154 RULES WHICH GOVERN HIS LIFE, ‘WOMEN DO NOT APPEAL TO ME,’ HE SAYS; HE IS 16.”&#10;7:02&#10;Despite telling the Boston Herald earlier that he vowed to remain celibate, saying,&#10;7:05&#10;“Women do not appeal to me.”&#10;7:08&#10;After the arrest, he followed Martha to New York.&#10;7:10&#10;They kissed, but Martha assured him there would be nothing more.&#10;7:14&#10;William’s unrequited love may have affected the trajectory of his life.&#10;7:20&#10;William's friend Julius Eichel said: &quot;Sidis admitted that her love might have achieved&#10;7:24&#10;wonders with him…&quot;&#10;7:26&#10;He carried a photograph of her in his pocket until the day he died.&#10;7:30&#10;Martha went on to marry a writer and achieved notoriety for co-founding the literary magazine&#10;7:36&#10;Story.&#10;7:37&#10;When her memoirs were published, she briefly mentioned William in a single line, in which&#10;7:41&#10;she called him “the famous and tragic prodigy who was the first boy ever to pay court to&#10;7:47&#10;me.”&#10;7:48&#10;(72%)&#10;7:49&#10;Despite his brilliance, William failed to achieve greatness.&#10;7:52&#10;And any work that did show promise was overlooked.&#10;7:55&#10;In 1925, he published a book that challenged the Second Law of Thermodynamics, the principle&#10;8:01&#10;that the universe is headed toward “heat death” where all energy is evenly spread&#10;8:06&#10;out, so there won’t be any energy left to power any processes.&#10;8:10&#10;In this state, nothing will move, change, or live.&#10;8:13&#10;(frozen tableau imagery) In The Animate and the Inanimate, he explored&#10;8:17&#10;the possibility of reversing the universe’s direction.&#10;8:21&#10;He theorized that living things could tap into a hidden source of energy to counteract&#10;8:26&#10;the process.&#10;8:27&#10;He gave an example of a ball bouncing down the stairs, which, when played in reverse&#10;8:31&#10;on film, appears as if a hidden source of energy is pushing the ball up the stairs.&#10;8:36&#10;He did acknowledge that his work was speculative and his theory has never been proven.&#10;8:41&#10;But it was never taken seriously in the first place.&#10;8:44&#10;It was ignored.&#10;8:45&#10;There wasn’t a single review during its time.&#10;8:49&#10;He made headlines for being a boy prodigy and for his private life, yet no one paid&#10;8:54&#10;attention to his academic work.&#10;8:56&#10;He stopped writing about physics, math, and cosmology altogether.&#10;9:01&#10;While in New York, he took on menial jobs, including working as an operator in an office&#10;9:06&#10;that was using an early mechanical calculator called a comptometer.&#10;9:10&#10;The papers were all too keen to splash headlines about the boy wonder earning an average wage&#10;9:16&#10;of $23 bucks a week.&#10;9:18&#10;He hid his genius from his co-workers.&#10;9:21&#10;When they found out who he was, he’d move on to the next job.&#10;9:24&#10;He refused to accept higher-paying work in which he had to use his intellect.&#10;9:28&#10;Once, he was offered a job with a railway company that tried to put him to work solving&#10;9:32&#10;their technical problems.&#10;9:33&#10;One of the officials later found him crying.&#10;9:37&#10;William told him he couldn’t bear the thought of doing math.&#10;9:41&#10;Another time, a cousin needed his math skills to help solve a dental problem involving the&#10;9:45&#10;alignment of teeth.&#10;9:47&#10;He offered William $3,000, the equivalent of $55,000 today.&#10;9:51&#10;It would have taken him two hours to solve.&#10;9:54&#10;But he refused.&#10;9:55&#10;William’s biographer concludes: “...he could not take a job of complex figuring without&#10;10:00&#10;risking emotional and physical illness.”&#10;10:04&#10;His entire life had been defined by pressure to perform at a high level.&#10;10:08&#10;At the expense of mastering basic life skills.&#10;10:11&#10;He confessed to an aunt that he had never been taught to tie his shoelaces.&#10;10:15&#10;His parents may have provided him with an exceptional education, yet they failed to&#10;10:19&#10;teach him the basics of grooming.&#10;10:22&#10;He didn’t shave regularly, wore a worn-out cap.&#10;10:25&#10;He reportedly didn’t bathe, or at least not often, and the stench was brutal.&#10;10:31&#10;When his father suffered a stroke and died in October 1923, he never attended the funeral.&#10;10:37&#10;According to William’s biographer, the reason was that he refused to see his mum.&#10;10:42&#10;William hated the way she dominated him as a child.&#10;10:45&#10;They never reconciled.&#10;10:46&#10;The Sidis’ didn’t raise their other child with the same intensity.&#10;10:49&#10;William’s younger sister Helena did not get a formal elementary or high school education.&#10;10:54&#10;Helena said that her dad had become so fed up with William that he didn’t want to educate&#10;10:58&#10;her.&#10;10:59&#10;She was also seriously ill as a child.&#10;11:02&#10;Nevertheless, she thrived under the guidance of her brother, who taught her how to read&#10;11:06&#10;and write, and she passed the entrance exams to attend university.&#10;11:10&#10;In his thirties, William settled in Boston, again, doing menial jobs.&#10;11:15&#10;The media had a hay day when they found out he was working as a lowly office clerk.&#10;11:19&#10;An unflattering article in a Boston daily newspaper read:&#10;11:23&#10;“William J. Sidis, now thirty-nine, was once declared by a group of eminent scientists&#10;11:28&#10;to be a coming innovator in the field of science, with potentialities as great as Einstein and&#10;11:34&#10;as brilliant as Marconi.&#10;11:36&#10;Yet yesterday a Sunday Advertiser writer found him in a small room, wall-papered and dark,&#10;11:41&#10;where for the past five years he has lived unknown, unsung, uncaring.”&#10;11:49&#10;His health had also started to decline.&#10;11:51&#10;He was overweight and had high blood pressure, which eventually caused a stroke.&#10;11:56&#10;The kind that claimed his father.&#10;11:58&#10;On July 17, 1944, William James Sidis died of a cerebral hemorrhage which led to pneumonia.&#10;12:06&#10;He was 46 years old.&#10;12:09&#10;He was buried beside his father in New Hampshire.&#10;12:12&#10;Did William Sidis’ parents push him too far?&#10;12:20&#10;A faculty member at Rice University, where William briefly taught, disagreed.&#10;12:25&#10;Dr. Guérard believes: “He was the victim not of intensive education given him by his&#10;12:30&#10;father, nor of the romantic curse called Genius, but of the thoughtless cruelty of the public.”&#10;12:37&#10;The New York Times once excitedly described William James Sidis as a &quot;wonderfully successful&#10;12:42&#10;result of a scientific forcing experiment, and as such furnishes one of the most interesting&#10;12:48&#10;mental phenomena in history.&quot;&#10;12:51&#10;As we now know, early success did not guarantee a fulfilling and successful life.&#10;Brilliant&#10;12:58&#10;If William had experienced a different upbringing, the outcome of his life might have been entirely&#10;13:03&#10;different.&#10;13:04&#10;One thing that's certain is his exceptional mastery of science and mathematics.&#10;13:08&#10;If you’d like to sharpen your skills in STEM, I recommend Brilliant.org, a website,&#10;13:13&#10;and app where you can answer puzzling questions like this:&#10;13:16&#10;A cup of warm water is suspended in a large pot of water held at a steady boil.&#10;13:22&#10;Will the water in the cup ever boil?&#10;13:23&#10;Yes, no, or it’s impossible to say.&#10;13:24&#10;Assume the large pot never runs out of water.&#10;13:27&#10;The answer is that it will never boil.&#10;13:30&#10;As the cup of water heats up to 100°C in the boiling pot, heat flow stops since both&#10;13:36&#10;are at the same temperature.&#10;13:38&#10;Brilliant can enhance your scientific thinking, computer science, and math skills, giving&#10;13:44&#10;you a competitive edge in today's marketplace.&#10;13:46&#10;I use Brilliant to go through their Logic courses which have improved my analytical&#10;13:51&#10;thinking.&#10;13:52&#10;For more puzzling questions like these, you can try out Brilliant for free for 30 days&#10;13:55&#10;by heading to the custom link in my description: brilliant.org/newsthink.&#10;13:59&#10;And the first 200 people who sign up with my link will get 20% off their Premium subscription,&#10;14:06&#10;which gives you access to all the offerings.&#10;14:08&#10;Thanks for watching.&#10;14:09&#10;I’m Cindy Pom." />

          <attvalue for="4" value="In this episode&#10;0:00&#10;but I think it's palpably grotesque to deny that there has been a a world return of fascism and it didn't begin&#10;0:05&#10;yesterday and so then as you say if we're confronted with all these empirical signs of fascism and again one&#10;0:12&#10;can disagree about exactly what fascism is but the the signs no matter whose definition you take are overwhelming it&#10;0:19&#10;doesn't matter whose definition you take the signs are overwhelming they're there and so why why do we not accept that and&#10;0:24&#10;I think that has to do with the second part right because if you accept that it's fascism then you have to organize&#10;0:31&#10;because the way that you beat fascism is is with coalitions the way that you beat fascism is that you get to a majority by&#10;0:38&#10;including people who don't agree about everything [Music]&#10;0:45&#10;tim where does this podcast find you i'm in Toronto we were excited to have you on the pod because uh your book on&#10;Which leaders from history does Trump most resemble?&#10;0:51&#10;tyranny is a 20point guide to dictator proofing yourself which you published shortly after Trump was elected the&#10;0:58&#10;first time around and it's a New York Times bestseller again can you point to&#10;1:03&#10;one or two moments in history that most mimic where we are now uh and who&#10;1:10&#10;reminds you most of Trump and what it tells us about where things might be headed i want to start the answer by&#10;1:15&#10;saying that it's important to think about history as something that opens us up rather than closes us down the danger&#10;1:22&#10;of thinking about history in terms of analogy or repeating or even rhyming as&#10;1:27&#10;Mark Twain said is that that then puts you out of the story and the whole point of history is that humans are in the&#10;1:33&#10;story there isn't any overwhelming objective factor which means things have to go in a certain direction&#10;1:39&#10;that said um we're I as I think about it we're in a we're in a kind of second globalization and the moment is much&#10;1:47&#10;like the 1890s to the 1920s in that suddenly the globe is united people are&#10;1:52&#10;overwhelmed there new communication technologies there are certain kinds of fears about demographics um about things&#10;1:59&#10;changing too quickly about not being in touch with your children and so on and those anxieties can be used by certain&#10;2:04&#10;kinds of politicians who manage to combine um a view of the future with nostalgia for the past so in general I&#10;2:12&#10;think it's it's 1890s to 1920s is pretty is pretty similar as far as Trump I&#10;2:17&#10;don't think there is actually a perfect perfect analog i mean in my view he's a fascist but he's a different sort of&#10;2:23&#10;fascist in that I think he cares in in an odd way he cares much less about the&#10;2:28&#10;community than the first round of fascists did and unlike the first round of fascists he's actually very concerned&#10;2:34&#10;about personal wealth um which what everyone wants to say about them was generally was generally not their case&#10;2:40&#10;so I don't I don't think there's a I don't think there's a perfect analogy for him but it helps a lot to know the history of the 1920s and 1930s at this&#10;Does the current administration invite a terror attack?&#10;2:47&#10;point in a recent Substack post you wrote that the current administration open quote invites a terror attack close&#10;2:54&#10;quote that's a bold statement what did you mean by that um I mean I don't think it is actually i think I think it's I&#10;3:01&#10;think the opposite thesis would be very bold like the idea that the administration is doing what it can to&#10;3:07&#10;prevent a terror attack is is absolutely grotesque right and so one way to&#10;3:13&#10;consider the thesis is to consider the antithesis and like we would all like to think that we have a government which is doing the normal things to prevent&#10;3:19&#10;abnormal catastrophes and I'm afraid that's just obviously not the case when you put Cash Patel in charge of the FBI&#10;3:25&#10;when you put Tulsi Gabbard in charge of uh intelligence when you put Pete Hexath in charge of defense when you fire the&#10;3:31&#10;head of the NSA for no reason except that Laura Loomer told you to do so when&#10;3:36&#10;you demoralize the ranks of all the security agencies when you fire the mid-level people under dubious pretexts&#10;3:43&#10;these are all things that make it much easier to attack the United States and I think you just have to be you have to be&#10;3:48&#10;looking away pretty determinedly not to notice it so that's that's what I mean when I say they're inviting a terror&#10;3:54&#10;attack there is ambient danger all of the time and what they're choosing to do is is to ignore the actual danger this&#10;4:01&#10;is a second part and to focus their eyes and ours on invented things right so&#10;4:07&#10;suddenly like Tesla is a center of terrorism or you know Al Salvador and guys in Maryland are the focus of&#10;4:13&#10;terrorism and when you create when you create big lies around stuff like that when you focus the energy on stuff like&#10;4:18&#10;that it actually turns the head of the media it turns the head of your own institutions in such a way that you're&#10;4:23&#10;much more vulnerable to the real threats that are out there do you think that also the reduction in soft power whether&#10;Is the U.S. vulnerable right now?&#10;4:29&#10;it's cancelling US aid or just generally kind of declaring war it feels like on&#10;4:34&#10;everyone all at once that that also increases the likelihood that maybe not even of a terrorist attack but somebody&#10;4:40&#10;decides to say they're so distracted maybe I'll invade Taiwan or I'll start&#10;4:45&#10;setting off more missiles over the coast of Japan from North Korea if this sounds&#10;4:51&#10;like a comment phrases a question it is so let me just say the comment i I would argue that we're every world leader is&#10;4:57&#10;thinking if this is a time to distract a divided and and and distracted America it would be now yeah no I want to affirm&#10;5:04&#10;both the major and the minor thesis in that in that comment and I'm happy to treat your comments as questions i mean&#10;5:10&#10;the minor thesis is that when we are when we make enemies unnecessarily we&#10;5:17&#10;are encouraging terrorism so it's not just that we're putting our defenses down which we're clearly doing it's also that we're inviting the offense which&#10;5:24&#10;we're also clearly doing i mean one can't one can't be precise about what combination of motives is going to spark&#10;5:30&#10;people but we have a combination now of Trump giving permission Trump and the people around him giving permission to&#10;5:37&#10;at least right-wing domestic terrorists because he is pardoning them right um&#10;5:43&#10;and creating an atmosphere which normalizes their behavior many of their views are now held inside the White&#10;5:48&#10;House but he's he's also randomly alienating almost everybody at the same&#10;5:55&#10;time and the around the world and the people he isn't alienating like the Russians aren't going to stop operations&#10;6:01&#10;inside the United States just because he's trying to be friends with them right so it's it's really it's a&#10;6:07&#10;cocktail um of of all the worst things at the same time and then to pick up your your your major thesis yeah this is&#10;6:14&#10;also true at the level of conventional national security what the Trump people are doing is draining American power out&#10;6:20&#10;of the system because the international system our power in the international system depended upon among other things&#10;6:26&#10;relationships trust alliances um reliability treaties we're we're&#10;6:31&#10;breaking all of those things thereby draining our own power out of the system but everybody else's power remains&#10;6:37&#10;everybody else is now more relatively powerful with respect to us and so of course they can now afford to think&#10;6:42&#10;about interventions and adventures which they wouldn't have been able to think about before i agree completely if the risk profile has gone up for the US and&#10;Who are the winners and losers right now?&#10;6:50&#10;we're sort of have high blood pressure or incredibly high cholesterol meaning we're more prone to some sort of&#10;6:55&#10;exogenous event or opportunistic infection who do you think one is there&#10;7:01&#10;or are there winners and who are they from America's distraction and what feels like own yeah wonderful question&#10;7:09&#10;the the most obvious winner of course is Vladimir Putin and Russia the Russians&#10;7:15&#10;started a war that they couldn't win without American assistance and then for&#10;7:21&#10;the last year or so in 2024 they made it very plan plain that their their game&#10;7:26&#10;plan such as it was was to keep the war going in the hope and expectation that Donald Trump would return to power and&#10;7:32&#10;now that Donald Trump is in power he's conceded on behalf of the Ukrainians so&#10;7:37&#10;to speak pretty much every major issue territory NATO Russia's legitimacy in&#10;7:43&#10;the international system trade with Russia he's conceded all of these things without asking for any concession from&#10;7:49&#10;Russia and meanwhile pressured the Ukrainians to take a much worse deal that even the military facts on the&#10;7:55&#10;ground would dictate that they should take and in general Trump and the people&#10;8:01&#10;around him treat Russia as though it were a great power a superpower a power on on the scale of the world which it&#10;8:07&#10;really isn't unless you make it so and the Russians are of course eating this up and they're extremely happy about it&#10;8:13&#10;so there's that that's one that one set of winner would be Russia but I would say that Russia overlaps with another set of winners which is transnational&#10;8:20&#10;oligarchs in general you can think of Putin as as a leader of Russia but you can also think of him as part of a clan&#10;8:26&#10;of transnational oligarchs which would include South Africans who are very important in the United States such as&#10;8:32&#10;Peter Teal or Elon Musk or David Sachs right that that Putin is kind of in that tribe that Trump wants to join like&#10;8:39&#10;Trump really wants to be a rich transnational oligarch he's just never quite made it and now with like two&#10;8:44&#10;chances of being president of the United States he can finally make it into that club but in general those folks are&#10;8:50&#10;doing a lot better the people who want not just American state power not really to work or to apply to them but want&#10;8:56&#10;state power around the world generally not to work or not to apply to them those people in general are definitely&#10;9:01&#10;winners out of this and a third set of winners um would seem to be at first&#10;9:06&#10;glance the people that we call I think wrongly populists or you know far-right people um far-right extremists quasi&#10;9:14&#10;fascists or fascists they would seem to be the winner because Vance and Trump are explicitly on their side but that&#10;9:22&#10;said so long as they're democratic elections the fact that Vance and Trump are on your side is probably not going to help you it's going to hurt you again&#10;9:29&#10;so long as there are democratic elections I feel as if Democrats were just such wimps we're afraid to call&#10;What can we do about fascism in the U.S.?&#10;9:34&#10;this fascism when every key component or definition of fascism perfectly fits in my view what is going on right now&#10;9:40&#10;demonization of immigrants refusal to condemn political violence extreme&#10;9:45&#10;nationalism it's literally it feels like this is the definition of fascism and yet on the left we're afraid to use&#10;9:51&#10;these words for fear like we have this need to empathize and and take the&#10;9:57&#10;higher ground can you point to a point in history or best practices around when&#10;10:03&#10;a democracy moves towards some sort of authoritarianism or oligarchy or fascism&#10;10:09&#10;what can you point to and what lessons can we take from who's been most effective and what are the components of&#10;10:16&#10;that push back when when a country has flirted with fascism and then has been&#10;10:21&#10;pulled back from the brink what are the components of pulling back or pushing back let me break that question down&#10;10:27&#10;into two parts because I think there there are two two things that work&#10;10:32&#10;together that help us to answer it the the the so the question why aren't we&#10;10:38&#10;allowed to say fascism I think is directly related to the answer so as you say it's patently obvious that there&#10;10:44&#10;that there has been a return of fascism around the world for quite some time I started writing about it more than 10&#10;10:51&#10;years ago using the word and then as you quite rightly say that one can agree or&#10;10:56&#10;disagree about how big it is and just who exactly is in it but I think it's palpably grotesque to deny that there&#10;11:02&#10;has been a a world return of fascis ism and that didn't begin yesterday and so then as you say if we're confronted with&#10;11:08&#10;all these empirical signs of fascism and again one can disagree about exactly what fascism is but the the signs no&#10;11:16&#10;matter whose definition you take are overwhelming it doesn't matter whose definition you take the signs are&#10;11:21&#10;overwhelming they're there and so why why do we not accept that and I think that has to do with the second part&#10;11:26&#10;right because if you accept that it's fascism then you have to organize and&#10;11:32&#10;you have to organize with people that you might not necessarily like denying&#10;11:37&#10;that it's fascism is a purely academic pursuit right if you deny it's fascism&#10;11:42&#10;what you can do is you can sit at your office and you can edit the volume about how it's not fascism that's just about&#10;11:48&#10;my colleagues but more broadly speaking if you deny it's fascism then you can imagine okay the normal the normal&#10;11:54&#10;pathways of politics are going to work somehow things are going to self-correct the moment you accept that it's fascism&#10;12:00&#10;you have to organize you have to take action you have to organize and you have to organize with people who agree with&#10;12:05&#10;you and people who don't completely agree with you and this is part of the answer now to the question because the way that you beat fascism is is with&#10;12:12&#10;coalitions the way that you beat fascism is that you get to a majority by including people who don't agree about&#10;12:18&#10;everything it has to be a clear majority because they're they're ruthless and also they they may control aspects of&#10;12:24&#10;the state so the way that you pull back is that you get a coalition right this is Poland in 2023 for example the way&#10;12:31&#10;that you pull back is you get a coalition which can win an election but this goes to the Democrats i take I take&#10;12:36&#10;the point about the Democrats but it's very important i think your analysis is also correct but it's very important for&#10;12:44&#10;us who are not activists in the Democratic party to to remember that we can't do we we have to not make the same&#10;12:50&#10;mistake that they're mistake that they're making like the fact that they are inactive or they don't use a word is&#10;12:56&#10;not an excuse for us to be inactive and not use the word we have to create all possible bridges pageantry opportunities&#10;13:04&#10;for those of them who want who want to make a move so the more civil society activism there is the more protesting&#10;13:10&#10;there is the more chance there is that you pulled the establishment party or important elements of it in your&#10;13:15&#10;direction so they have a role to play but there but the only way for them to play that role is for them to be drawn&#10;13:20&#10;by things that other people are in fact organizing the town halls are a good example of this it was great that many&#10;13:26&#10;that several Democrats go out to these town halls but they didn't organize those things themselves right that had to come from that had to come from&#10;13:33&#10;somewhere else we'll be right back after a quick break&#10;Are there parallels between Nazi Germany and the U.S. right now?&#10;13:38&#10;so uh if I'm being an alarmist or paranoid it doesn't mean I'm wrong and I&#10;13:45&#10;want you to tell me if I'm wrong but I look at 1920s Germany thriving gay&#10;13:51&#10;community appreciation for academics the arts a progressive culture welcomed immigrants an economic shock a move&#10;13:58&#10;towards fascism and then something that really struck me this there was a 10-second Tik Tok where a guy just said&#10;14:04&#10;&quot;Remember that Awitz was in Poland.&quot; And I look at what's going on here and when&#10;14:09&#10;you start rounding up people it takes a diff on a different complexion but I would argue we're one economic shock&#10;14:15&#10;away in the US from accelerating what we already I would term as rounding up people for the wrong tattoo and shipping&#10;14:21&#10;them off to another country such that we don't have to hold to the same standards of due process or humanity one am I&#10;14:29&#10;being an alarmist believing that we're actually not as far as people would like to think from a really really ugly&#10;14:36&#10;situation and does this have echoes of different different situations do you&#10;14:43&#10;see another nation at this point in history and where you know that that&#10;14:49&#10;helps kind of draw or fill in the blanks around where this is going mhm let me let me zoom way back out and then let me&#10;14:56&#10;zoom in so the comparison to Germany in the first third of the 20th century can&#10;15:03&#10;be very helpful in the following way the&#10;15:08&#10;20th century as your question already suggests could have been Germany's&#10;15:15&#10;century there was an awful lot working in their favor um there was a very rich&#10;15:20&#10;and heterogeneous civil society there were um the best scientists and&#10;15:26&#10;engineers probably in the world active before the early 30s in Germany there&#10;15:32&#10;was a a flawed but nevertheless plausible parliamentary system um there&#10;15:38&#10;was an economy which um pound-for-pound was overtaking everybody else's right so&#10;15:45&#10;the United States was going to be a big deal in the 20th century but there's a there's a way in which the 20th century&#10;15:50&#10;could have belonged to Germany and they did the one thing in my view the one thing which could have prevented that&#10;15:56&#10;which was have someone who was the most extreme version of an extreme party come&#10;16:02&#10;to power with the connivance of business elites and with the misunderstanding or&#10;16:08&#10;willful misunderstanding of conservatives that somehow he could be controlled right that was the one thing&#10;16:14&#10;and they did it and so when you look at the US and the 21st century one one way to look at this is the 21st century&#10;16:21&#10;probably should belong to the US we there are all sorts of positive things there's the technology the civil society&#10;16:26&#10;the universities etc etc um but there is one thing we can do to prevent that from&#10;16:32&#10;happening and we seem to be doing that one thing okay now let me zoom in so the&#10;16:38&#10;big thing about Awitz in Poland it's it's important i would I have to contest that formulation because there wasn't a&#10;16:44&#10;Poland at the time by the time that Achvitz was established um on the on the on the on the on the territory of a&#10;16:51&#10;Poland what had been a Polish army base at Oshen Poland had been destroyed but this&#10;16:57&#10;this helps to make the point just in a slightly more subtle way which is important the killing of Jews in Germany&#10;17:03&#10;was not didn't happen in Germany it it happened in zones which which the Germans decided were stateless in zones&#10;17:11&#10;where the law didn't apply and so that could be a concentration camp the definition of a concentration camp is a&#10;17:17&#10;lawless zone but it could also be a broad swath of territory to the east where the Germans said we've destroyed&#10;17:23&#10;the state whether it's Poland or the Soviet Union we've destroyed the state and so the rules don't apply that for me&#10;17:29&#10;is the dangerous thing right not exactly another country although that's important but the idea of statelessness&#10;17:36&#10;the notion that what we're going to do is we're going to decide that certain people are beyond the protection of the&#10;17:41&#10;state in general once you do that then it becomes much easier to ship them away and it becomes much easier to kill them&#10;Are there similarities between today’s corporate and political leaders and those in 1930s Germany?&#10;17:48&#10;it's chilling you had mentioned something about u I forgot the word you&#10;17:53&#10;used the cooperation between Hitler and the industrial base or corporations or&#10;17:58&#10;corporate leadership and I don't think enough people know the history around the alliance between I think it was&#10;18:06&#10;loosely corporations as said Hillary if you crush the trade unions we'll support you and then it just ran away from them&#10;18:13&#10;and I see real parallels here now and that is I'm not exaggerating i've&#10;18:18&#10;probably talked to a dozen Fortune 500 CEOs who are just so angry and upset and think what Trump is doing is so wrong&#10;18:25&#10;and not a goddamn one of them has spoken out because they're they think short-term my obligation is to&#10;18:31&#10;shareholders and the easiest thing to do is bend a knee send a million dollars to the inauguration committee and not speak&#10;18:36&#10;out and this feels eerily similar to the same type of enablement or loose&#10;18:43&#10;cooperation or conspiracy between corporate leaders in Germany any thoughts on whether there are parallels&#10;18:50&#10;there that's such an interesting question and it you know I I feel like just pivoting a little bit Scott this is&#10;18:57&#10;really a moment when it would help if Americans listened to other people so like it's all well and good and I'm glad&#10;19:03&#10;to do it for us to for for us to be sitting here and talking about historical par parallels but there are&#10;19:08&#10;actually lots of German you know businessmen and women today and German foundations who act on the basis of what&#10;19:15&#10;they think they learned in the 1930s and so I mean maybe I'm wrong and something like this has already happened but there&#10;19:20&#10;probably would be much to be said for some kind of summit precisely among American and German CEOs to talk about&#10;19:26&#10;the question that you've just asked um because you know there there are plenty&#10;19:31&#10;of people now in Germany who are running corporations extremely well um but who&#10;19:36&#10;have these kinds of lessons on their mind all the time and that's also for me&#10;19:41&#10;a a broader lesson if you'll just forgive me you know to extend the pivot it's a broader lessons lesson about&#10;19:46&#10;resistance in the US now in general there are a lot of folks from Ukraine or Poland um you know successful cases or&#10;19:54&#10;even people from from from mixed cases uh like Slovenia or Hungary who have experience that is really&#10;20:01&#10;relevant to this moment and I feel like we don't we don't do enough to reach out to them and to get that relevant&#10;20:07&#10;experience we tend to be trapped in our own exceptionalism and say &quot;Okay something's happened.&quot; Um it's it's&#10;20:12&#10;never happened to anybody before what could we possibly learn and then we spend that moment obsessing about ourselves and then we move on to the&#10;20:18&#10;next to the next moment but yeah but getting getting back to your question there there were sort of two stages to&#10;20:23&#10;this the first is that you think you think it's okay because he's against the&#10;20:29&#10;labor unions and that really was the problem the first time around that that German businesses were against dem I&#10;20:36&#10;mean this is a little bit stronger but they were against democracy because they thought in democracy the labor unions were too strong and so that's not&#10;20:43&#10;exactly the case now but it's something that CEOs should be thinking about am I being drawn towards something because I&#10;20:49&#10;think these are the ones who are harder on the trade unions than the than the other ones and then the second move which you also already see is the&#10;20:55&#10;solicitation of specific companies um on the premise that they can make money&#10;21:01&#10;under this regime in a way they couldn't have made it before like Avitz to use something you mentioned earlier german&#10;21:06&#10;companies are brought to Ashvitz on the principle that look there's going to be cheap controlled labor there's access to&#10;21:12&#10;water you know we can do chemical manufacturing here this is a good site it's going to be profitable and of&#10;21:17&#10;course there's also money to be made by by rounding up American migrants there's money to be made by creating a&#10;21:24&#10;surveillance state and so particular companies are being recruited into that so yeah there's I mean capitalism&#10;21:32&#10;doesn't push obviously one way or another right like it's wrong to think that capitalism automatically generates&#10;21:38&#10;fascism it's certainly also wrong to think that capitalism automatically generates democracy um the the people&#10;21:44&#10;who are the people who are in charge of companies are historical actors and we know not just from the history of&#10;21:50&#10;Germany but from the history of coups and counter coups in general that how the leaders of industry react matters a&#10;21:57&#10;great deal to how things turn out so we've been talking a lot about Trump any historical reference&#10;What historical references ground Elon Musk?&#10;22:03&#10;uh or analogies explaining or or comparing uh similar situations to&#10;22:10&#10;what's going on with uh Elon Musk wealthiest man in the world uh the&#10;22:17&#10;seizure of what I would argue is u power that's not constitutional at the&#10;22:22&#10;approval of the president and just I haven't seen anything like this in my lifetime what&#10;22:28&#10;what historical references can you ground Elon Musk in&#10;22:33&#10;if any number one it's I mean we've been talking about the 20s and the 30s and&#10;22:38&#10;the um the Marxist analysis of fascism back then was that it had to do with the&#10;22:44&#10;wealthiest of people which it wasn't true i mean as we've talked about certainly certainly capitalists played a&#10;22:52&#10;role in the rise of Hitler to power and then certain capitalists profited in certain ways which are worth remembering&#10;22:58&#10;from Nazi rule but it wasn't actually the oligarchs of the world right there&#10;23:04&#10;was no overall plan of global capitalism to bring bring people like Hitler to power 100 years later there is that's&#10;23:11&#10;that's the ironic thing like 100 years later there we do have people like Elon&#10;23:16&#10;Musk who do have huge amounts of global power and who are quite literally trying to bring fascists to power around the&#10;23:23&#10;world and maybe it's you know maybe it's for reasons of ideology maybe it's for reasons of convenience because they don't like state power and state because&#10;23:29&#10;state power can regulate their companies but we actually now do have a thing which was I think talked about 100 years&#10;23:35&#10;ago but not real and now is real but not talked about which is you know not that all oligarchs are fascists I mean&#10;23:41&#10;they're oligarch arch all over the place politically but we do have fascist oligarchs and we have fascist promoting oligarchs we have oligarchs who are&#10;23:48&#10;promoting fascism so that's not exactly historical precedent it's more like historical irony that we have the thing now i gave a lecture a couple of weeks&#10;23:55&#10;ago in New York at the public library about um about paganism which was um you&#10;24:01&#10;know a little bit bold on my part but it and a little bit a little bit humorous because I think we need humor but I&#10;24:08&#10;think the kinds of politics we're talking about where people worship a a leader that's fascist right the way that&#10;24:15&#10;people worship Elon Musk is fascist but the the the way that Musk and Trump and&#10;24:20&#10;so on operate by giving out gifts the sort of everyday corruption or if you want to put it in an anthrop an&#10;24:26&#10;anthropologically neutral way a giftgiving culture where politics is reduced to there's a chieftain at the&#10;24:33&#10;center and the chieftain has the authority to give gifts and expects gifts in return i think there's a reason&#10;24:39&#10;why that's not familiar historically or you know personally to you or to me and that's because that's essentially a you&#10;24:45&#10;know pre-Christian or a pre-state way of doing things they're chieftains they come and go their power depends upon&#10;24:52&#10;charisma plus the ability to give gifts i think that's that's where we are and it's an almost prehistorical way of&#10;24:58&#10;doing politics which is why history flails a little bit when you when you try to find historical analogies for

are your thoughts on Elon Musk’s Nazi salute?&#10;26:41&#10;than just attacking them for for these actions or these g gestures Steve Bannon&#10;26:47&#10;and Elon Musk in my view purposely gave Nazi salutes and I'm trying to wrap my&#10;26:54&#10;head around what are the objectives there is it just to show a certain level of macho and thumbming your finger in&#10;27:01&#10;the face of convention is it an attempt to rally a group of people around a fascist ideology i'm just curious what&#10;27:08&#10;ran through your head when once not once but twice a person who's a senior&#10;27:14&#10;adviser to the president the wealthiest man in the world gave what looked like to me Nazi salutes what when you saw&#10;27:21&#10;that what ran through your head i'm going to I'm going to start in a place which I think is more interesting than&#10;27:27&#10;my head i was um not long after that I was I was in&#10;27:32&#10;Berlin and I was talking to uh a a very&#10;27:38&#10;courageous and consistent left-wing organizer friend we're at a bar they're&#10;27:44&#10;having a drink and and he said I think he's right he said you know eventually&#10;27:52&#10;they always do it like they have to do it and I knew what he meant he meant Musk and the Hitler you know the the the&#10;28:00&#10;that salute i want to take a step sort of below your question about what they're thinking or what the calculations are i think maybe something&#10;28:06&#10;more fundamental than that which is that they like to do it it makes them feel like they are who they are when when&#10;28:13&#10;they do it my friend's point was that there's something in their the shape of their lives which eventually leads them&#10;28:19&#10;to give that salute and I think we shouldn't discount that and think about it just in terms of the signal they're&#10;28:25&#10;sending or where it goes politically or what it means to you know people like me i think that that's a big part of it&#10;28:30&#10;that like that per performing with your body in a way which is which is&#10;28:36&#10;unambiguous which is not reject rejecting reason which is calling forth a similar salute from other people and&#10;28:43&#10;since we know the history is also referring to right the very heart of fascism the last time around i think&#10;28:50&#10;that the sheer pleasure of doing that is probably close to a complete explanation&#10;28:56&#10;i I think you know the secondary thing would be would be the normalization of it that you're trying to break all the&#10;29:01&#10;taboss and of course when you do it you then you know this is the 21st century part you do it then you deny it you say&#10;29:07&#10;it was just a joke you say it never happened whatever is a wave yeah exactly yeah you just but but what you're what&#10;29:14&#10;you're after though is you're ch you're trying to change normality right you're trying to turn every taboo into a joke&#10;29:19&#10;and you know the taboos around liberalism rule of law democracy are are built on notions of human decency the&#10;29:25&#10;protection of the private sphere respect truth and so on and so you're trying to turn those taboss into a joke i think&#10;29:31&#10;that's the secondary bit so you were at Yale and you moved to Toronto&#10;Why did you move to Canada?&#10;29:37&#10;um why why have you moved to Canada uh I mean there's a there's a baseball team&#10;29:43&#10;that plays downtown um I'm I'm theoretically a French speaker and u&#10;29:49&#10;they speak French here at least in this in this country um I was there like&#10;29:54&#10;there the major considerations had to do with you know family things which I'm not particularly keen to talk about you&#10;30:00&#10;know so lifesty it's a lifestyle move not ideological we don't need any deeper I mean if any no I mean there's this&#10;30:06&#10;weird timing thing now where I'm kind of caught in historical conjuncture and feel a little helpless about that but I&#10;30:12&#10;had already moved to Toronto I'd been rec I've been recruited for three years actually more like 10 enough said no one&#10;30:19&#10;needs an excuse to move to Toronto it's a wonderful city I moved London it's and it's been great and it it it's neither&#10;30:24&#10;here nor there in terms of politics and I think that's what you're saying yeah i moved here for reasons which had to do with time of life essentially um and now&#10;30:33&#10;that I am here I'm going to continue to do you know what I what I can i tend to think that people like a lot if I have&#10;30:38&#10;anything views to say it has to do with experiences outside the United States but I'm going to make you know really&#10;30:43&#10;sure that I also spend a lot of time inside the United States um this things have not turned out the way that I hoped&#10;30:48&#10;they would turn out but now that they have turned out this way you know now I have to stay engaged so I will so it&#10;30:54&#10;almost feels sort of inconsequential or somewhat trivial compared to the things we've been talking about but these&#10;30:59&#10;tariffs sort of declaring war on everyone all at once and I'm I can tell how old I'm getting I'm totally&#10;What are your thoughts on Trump’s tariffs?&#10;31:06&#10;fascinated with World War II and I'd like to I said everything against the context of World War II and I think of&#10;31:12&#10;you know Hitler's big mistake was essentially declaring war on everyone all at once specifically declaring war on Russia when he didn't need to help me&#10;31:19&#10;understand if we can understand these tariffs in an individual and what analogies or what historical context&#10;31:26&#10;there is for this sort of economic multifront declaration of war against everyone all at once well before I mean&#10;31:33&#10;before we get to that I'm just going to say something much more much more boring which which is that whatever the motive&#10;31:39&#10;of tariffs are they do have an objective effect and that objective effect we're&#10;31:46&#10;not actually really feeling yet in the United States the the knockoff effects on supply chains are just now starting&#10;31:53&#10;to take hold and they will be felt more and more severely in coming weeks and&#10;31:58&#10;months so whatever Trump thinks he's doing um one lesson of the 1920s and 1930s of course is that if you if you&#10;32:05&#10;wreck the economy by way of tariffs you're setting the stage for more radical things to happen so as far as&#10;32:12&#10;attacking everybody all at once my my take is that they think that&#10;32:21&#10;the way power works is by way of these kind of one-off demonstrations of like masculine barking where you do like you&#10;32:29&#10;you bluster like you take you you know you you stick out your chest and you bluster and you use lots of big words and stuff and then the notion is that&#10;32:36&#10;the other person makes concessions and you're better off in the end and I think they think that's how American&#10;32:41&#10;businesses will react to tariffs because everybody will look for a carve out and in looking for a carve out going back to your earlier question they will then be&#10;32:48&#10;you know less likely to speak up against the regime and they think that other countries will do the same thing that&#10;32:53&#10;other countries are by definition weaker than the US and so therefore they have to immediately react i I think it's I&#10;33:00&#10;think that's the theory it's a it's I think it's it's a dumb theory of course because you end up minimizing US power&#10;33:06&#10;because no one takes you seriously including they don't take you seriously also when you propose a remedy right&#10;33:12&#10;you're never you're never trusted again in the same way but it's also a dumb theory because it just overestimates the&#10;33:18&#10;scale of US power and this gives me occasion to say something I wanted to say and forgot in response to your earlier question I mentioned R when you&#10;33:25&#10;asked who does this benefit I mentioned Russia and I I mentioned oligarchs but the big winner the big long-term winner&#10;33:31&#10;is obviously China because what what we have done is we've said to the world hey&#10;33:37&#10;look China is a more reliable trade partner than we are right so we've&#10;33:42&#10;bailed Russia out in the short term in Ukraine and we've bailed China out in the long term on the scale of the world&#10;How do you see the future of America unfolding?&#10;33:49&#10;recognizing none of us have a crystal ball are you comfortable making any sort&#10;33:55&#10;of predictions as to what you think the likely scenarios are in America over the next&#10;34:00&#10;uh 2 3 years there's so many variables there's so many things bouncing up against one another it's like like if&#10;34:09&#10;you think about different historical moments like there are moments where more things are possible than usual so&#10;34:14&#10;like after the first world war what I'd like to think of as the the bandwidth of possibility was just much broader right&#10;34:21&#10;things like Linen and and and things like Hitler were possible then and they wouldn't have been possible at other times because you'd had this&#10;34:27&#10;globalization with its hopes and then with its collapse around a major war and now you know now we're in this other&#10;34:33&#10;globalization which is also facing its collapse um the major you know the war isn't as major the Russo Ukrainian war&#10;34:39&#10;is a horribly great is a horribly you huge war but it's not on the scale of the great war um but it's also facing&#10;34:45&#10;its collapse in the person of of somebody like Trump and so there's just things are possible now that weren't&#10;34:51&#10;possible before i I worry a great deal about an exogenous shock like the terror&#10;34:56&#10;attack that we were talking about earlier and what that would set off and I think it's it's we have to kind of&#10;35:02&#10;internalize that possibility because we have to recognize that in the scenarios we're talking about it's it's almost I&#10;35:08&#10;mean you can't be certain about anything historically but it's as certain as you can be that Trump Vance Musk would treat&#10;35:14&#10;such an exogenous event as a reason to try to finish off the republic um completely i I another thing I worry&#10;35:22&#10;about is that because the Trump people overestimate the power of bluster and&#10;35:27&#10;the power of the United States federal government in general because they don't really understand that institutions institutions don't work&#10;35:35&#10;just on the basis of like charisma and giving orders that they're going to get us to a situation where federal&#10;35:41&#10;institutions are going to break down or that federal institutions and state the institutions of the 50 states are going&#10;35:46&#10;to be in irreconcilable clashes i worry about that a great deal i think that's a scenario that has been understated that&#10;35:53&#10;that institutions of the federal government will just stop working and that states will then begin to wonder&#10;35:59&#10;what we're getting out of all of this and that there will be some kind of crisis within our own federal system&#10;36:05&#10;that's that's I guess the sec a second scenario that I worry about in addition in addition to like the obvious thing&#10;36:10&#10;that we've been talking about the whole time which is Trump Musk um that millia&#10;36:16&#10;seeking to somehow get around the rule of law and you know these and the things are married to each other you can get&#10;36:22&#10;around the rule of law you know you can you can change the nature of the federal government but what you can't do is then&#10;36:27&#10;predictably know what's going to come next and it isn't all internationally or nationally going to be in your favor you&#10;36:33&#10;can you know you can you can slam the door on democracy and you can you know you can break everything inside the&#10;36:38&#10;house of democracy but then when you walk out into that brave new world that you're created it's not like the weather&#10;36:44&#10;is always going to be beautiful and in your favor so I apologize for jumping around but you're one of the leading&#10;What is the future of the Russia-Ukraine war?&#10;36:49&#10;historians on Ukraine and I'd be remiss not to ask before you go the optimist looking at the glass&#10;36:55&#10;half empty is this an opportunity that sort of Uncle Sam is not only inconsistent but crazy and can no longer&#10;37:02&#10;be dependent upon and is this an opportunity for Europe to actually become a union $19 trillion collective&#10;37:08&#10;economy versus two trillion in Russia and provide Ukraine with the support such that they can continue to push back&#10;37:14&#10;on Russia or am I being naive that's the one rational hope and if you know&#10;37:21&#10;regardless of whether there's a ceasefire or whether there's a quote unquote peace deal I really hate the way&#10;37:26&#10;that the the noun deal is now being attached to everything as though you know deal making is the highest human&#10;37:33&#10;achievement but regardless of whether on paper there's you know some kind of accord the the threat of Russia and and&#10;37:41&#10;the the the possibility or the reality of Russia making war on Ukraine or other European countries is going to be very&#10;37:47&#10;real and eminent into the indefinite future at least until Putin loses power&#10;37:52&#10;which means that Europe Europe has to respond in some way if it wishes to exist because the attack on Ukraine was&#10;37:59&#10;also an attack on the broader principles of the existence of the European Union namely that there is a post-imperial way&#10;38:06&#10;of doing politics that one can share sovereignty rather than violate sovereignty that you can you you can&#10;38:12&#10;have bureaucratic uh boring ritualistic bureaucratic iterative relationships as&#10;38:18&#10;opposed to as opposed to marshall military destructive relationships and so on that and and the Russians are very&#10;38:24&#10;explicit about this the whole Russian the Russian doctrine of foreign policy is that the EU is an artificial creation&#10;38:29&#10;which has no right to exist because in fact the only thing that matters are empires and a multipolar world and so on&#10;38:36&#10;so if they want to exist they have to step up with respect to Ukraine i would add to that that I think the EU only&#10;38:43&#10;exists by enlarging that has to be part of its process as well and I realize it's complicated inside various&#10;38:49&#10;countries and so on but a European Union which had Great Britain and Ukraine as members would would be an even larger&#10;38:55&#10;more secure and more interestingly internally diverse economic unit than the current European Union so we only&#10;What are the biggest risks we’re not paying attention to? What gives you hope?&#10;39:02&#10;have you for a couple more minutes you've been very generous with your time just a kind of a lightning round here what are the biggest risks we're not&#10;39:08&#10;paying attention to and what are you most optimistic about i'm optimistic about American protests&#10;39:14&#10;i'm optimistic about people who haven't protested before who are protesting now i'm optimistic about or hopeful is a&#10;39:21&#10;better word about elected representatives who are actually talking about about the way the world actually&#10;39:27&#10;is um I'm I'm I'm I'm hopeful I'm hopeful about Europe i think this a set&#10;39:34&#10;of European leaders um mon starmer merits uh in Poland uh donatus that's&#10;39:42&#10;that's I mean I don't agree with all of them about everything of course but I think as a set of European leaders that's a pretty good quartet and a&#10;39:49&#10;better one than one has had for for quite a long time at least on the kinds of issues that we've been talking about&#10;39:54&#10;European security and and and dur and durability um I'm hopeful about I'm&#10;40:00&#10;hopeful because of the kinds of categorical or conceptual conversations that we've been having because I really believe that you can't you can't&#10;40:06&#10;organize and resist without conceptual work and um it it's it's hopeful to me&#10;40:12&#10;that the people who I know who are organizers are getting maybe closer to the people who I know who are who who are conceptualizers and that the&#10;40:18&#10;organizers are conceptualizing and some of the conceptualizing are organizing that that all gives me that all gives me&#10;40:24&#10;some that gives me some hope uh you you're obviously hugely successful so you have what appears to be just a a&#10;What advice would you give your 25-year-old self?&#10;40:30&#10;great job and have carved out a really nice piece of the world for yourself what advice would you give uh uh to your&#10;40:37&#10;25-year-old self and more generally advice to young men who want to someday be you know be be Timothy Snder and have&#10;40:44&#10;a really cool job i mean that's a funny question because the only I mean the only like I did gig work for six years&#10;40:51&#10;after after I got my doctorate um I stayed on I stayed on the market the entire time and I only got a job at Yale&#10;40:59&#10;basically because of luck i mean I may have had some qualifications for it but the job was only available because of&#10;41:04&#10;luck and so if I find it hard to like say &quot;Oh I've have some kind of like path&#10;41:09&#10;that other people can follow.&quot; In general you know I I learned to do a bunch of other things resilience&#10;41:15&#10;perseverance sounds you hung in there maybe i think I mean I think having different things that you're pretty good&#10;41:21&#10;at and not just one thing that you're very good at if you're going to be an academic be be international in in some&#10;41:27&#10;way because that allows you to I mean I wouldn't have been able to do the things I did even before I had a job without&#10;41:33&#10;being international in in some way and I think being willing like if you're going to be an academic think always about&#10;41:39&#10;what else you could do besides being besides having a tenure track job in in in universities yeah i mean I don't know&#10;41:46&#10;i always had female bosses i think that's you know that's I'm not sure if that's a piece of advice but it's been&#10;41:53&#10;it's been kind of helpful along the way i mean no getting along with different sort of folks and um but yeah I advice I&#10;42:01&#10;don't know man i feel like I've been I feel like I've been really lucky and um and and and it's and times were tough&#10;42:08&#10;when I was on the job market and they're they're a lot tougher now for all kinds of different reasons i don't think&#10;42:14&#10;people should get PhDs unless they really really love what they're doing because you're going to you have to you&#10;42:19&#10;have to take a lot of time to do it and then once you do it you have to love what you're doing enough to try to to to be aware that you might have to do it&#10;42:26&#10;somewhere else besides the academy so anyway I you caught me off guard with that one that's the best I could do&#10;42:31&#10;timothy Snyder is a leading historian of authoritarianism Ukraine and Eastern Europe he's the author of various books&#10;42:37&#10;including on freedom on tyranny the road to unfreedom and bloodlands after over&#10;42:43&#10;two decades at Yale he joined the University of Toronto's Monk School of Global Affairs who joins us from the&#10;42:48&#10;great city of Toronto i could do this for three hours really appreciate your time and an open invitation although I'm&#10;42:55&#10;inviting myself I want to come to Toronto i want to do a mini I Love Canada tour and I would love to&#10;43:00&#10;interview you on stage somewhere i think your I think your your work has never been more relevant i really appreciate&#10;43:05&#10;your time professor i would I'd love to see you in person so when you're in Canada you just drop a line and we'll do that 100% thanks again&#10;43:12&#10;[Music]&#10;43:24&#10;[Music]" />

          <attvalue for="4" value="0:00&#10;what will be Vladimir Putin's next move&#10;0:03&#10;will the Russian president really test&#10;0:06&#10;NATO i've spoken to Zuna Knight&#10;0:09&#10;Germany's leading military historian who&#10;0:13&#10;says that this coming summer may be the&#10;0:16&#10;last one in peace here in Europe so with&#10;0:19&#10;me is the military historian Zuna Nitel&#10;0:22&#10;mr&#10;0:23&#10;you've already become infamous here in&#10;0:25&#10;Germany for saying that you expect this&#10;0:27&#10;coming summer to be the last one in&#10;0:29&#10;peace are you serious and what exactly&#10;0:32&#10;do you mean by that well I am serious&#10;0:34&#10;but I didn't say that this is definitely&#10;0:36&#10;the last summer in peace i said this is&#10;0:38&#10;a possible scenario it's a worst case&#10;0:41&#10;scenario and because nobody um can can&#10;0:44&#10;really tell about the future this is&#10;0:46&#10;this is you know in fog nobody really&#10;0:49&#10;knows what Putin wants and does uh&#10;0:52&#10;nobody can can really foresee the future&#10;0:54&#10;not the intelligence services or the&#10;0:55&#10;heads of states nor I can do that but&#10;0:58&#10;there are possible scenarios and if you&#10;1:01&#10;look at Trump and how he's you know&#10;1:03&#10;developing this kind of destructive&#10;1:05&#10;power towards NATO uh and we have a lot&#10;1:08&#10;of countries also Germany would have&#10;1:10&#10;some domestic troubles uh and if you&#10;1:13&#10;have a was possibly a peace um treaty uh&#10;1:17&#10;a negative peace treaty in Ukraine which&#10;1:19&#10;frees Putin with these forces to do&#10;1:22&#10;other things so there and we have the&#10;1:24&#10;big maneuvers the zabat maneuvers coming&#10;1:26&#10;up in better Russia in autumn and I can&#10;1:30&#10;say and this is also background of this&#10;1:32&#10;you know um quote is that the my friends&#10;1:35&#10;in Lithuania and the Baltic states are&#10;1:36&#10;very very worried about this maneuver&#10;1:39&#10;because we we've seen that 2021&#10;1:42&#10;uh the pretext of the war of the full&#10;1:44&#10;invasion Ukraine was a maneuver so I'm&#10;1:47&#10;not saying this is definitely h going to&#10;1:49&#10;happen but I say this is a possible&#10;1:51&#10;scenario and we should speed up as as as&#10;1:55&#10;western states as NATO and as Germany in&#10;1:57&#10;particular that we are not looking back&#10;1:59&#10;and say uh um it took all the time so we&#10;2:03&#10;should speed up and all the debates&#10;2:05&#10;about Russia is maybe ready for an&#10;2:08&#10;attack against NATO in 2029 it's a bit&#10;2:11&#10;of an artificial debate so you can't&#10;2:13&#10;foresee that so and Putin if if he wants&#10;2:18&#10;if he has his plans possibly doesn't&#10;2:20&#10;wait until NATO is ready so we are not&#10;2:25&#10;living in peace and the NATO summit in&#10;2:28&#10;Madrid 2022 said the Euroatlantic area&#10;2:30&#10;is not at peace and especially in&#10;2:32&#10;Germany some people think well we are&#10;2:35&#10;still at peace uh and I say no we are&#10;2:38&#10;not we are not at war we are in an&#10;2:40&#10;intimate um state and I think we should&#10;2:43&#10;prepare and we should speed up there's a&#10;2:45&#10;lot to unpack there but first of all I&#10;2:47&#10;want to ask you have we in history in&#10;2:50&#10;European history seen a similar pattern&#10;2:53&#10;of threat yeah and if we go back to the&#10;2:56&#10;first world war and the outbreak of the&#10;2:58&#10;first world war I mean the upcoming&#10;3:00&#10;years to the first world war were full&#10;3:02&#10;of of um scares navy scares threats um&#10;3:08&#10;on the Germans against the Russians the&#10;3:09&#10;Russians against the Germans and there&#10;3:11&#10;was a lot of debate will there be a war&#10;3:13&#10;in the future and there was also a a a&#10;3:16&#10;feeling domestic feelings in great&#10;3:18&#10;powers of of um of uh we need more&#10;3:21&#10;reforms etc etc etc and and this kind of&#10;3:24&#10;thing so this is I mean history was&#10;3:27&#10;always different and different different&#10;3:29&#10;scenarios and and also I mean look look&#10;3:32&#10;at the the period before the second&#10;3:35&#10;world war um we had all these scandals&#10;3:37&#10;and scenarios these these you know&#10;3:39&#10;Hitler and Italy and in Japan being&#10;3:42&#10;revisionist powers um and and kicking&#10;3:45&#10;the international law and the big debate&#10;3:47&#10;was how should the west react on that so&#10;3:50&#10;we we find different different scenarios&#10;3:52&#10;in the past but the problem is that um&#10;3:56&#10;contemporary times are different so it's&#10;3:58&#10;not a copy of history we are not we&#10;4:00&#10;can't copy the year 38 or 39 neither can&#10;4:04&#10;we copy 1914 so we have to find our own&#10;4:07&#10;solution how much of a rationale do you&#10;4:10&#10;see um underpinning Putin's actions&#10;4:14&#10;right now&#10;4:15&#10;i mean some people say Putin is mad and&#10;4:18&#10;I think this is not not a category which&#10;4:19&#10;is very useful i think he has his own&#10;4:21&#10;rationale and that makes this for us so&#10;4:24&#10;difficult because we are following a&#10;4:27&#10;different grammar if you want so um&#10;4:29&#10;international law um um you can't&#10;4:31&#10;violate um um borders etc etc etc and&#10;4:35&#10;Putin has a different rationale and from&#10;4:37&#10;his viewpoint&#10;4:39&#10;um&#10;4:41&#10;obviously a country such as Ukraine&#10;4:43&#10;becoming uh more and more part of the&#10;4:46&#10;west you know developing democracy etc&#10;4:49&#10;is a danger for its internal order and&#10;4:53&#10;if we follow his speeches but also other&#10;4:55&#10;speeches from Borisin and others it's&#10;4:57&#10;always this kind of of idea we have to&#10;5:00&#10;kick the Americans out of Europe um and&#10;5:02&#10;Europe has to live under the domination&#10;5:04&#10;and inverted commerce of Russia not not&#10;5:07&#10;we don't want to annex the European&#10;5:09&#10;countries but it should be a Russian you&#10;5:11&#10;know somehow hegimony uh and we should&#10;5:14&#10;replace the American hegimony and this&#10;5:16&#10;is I think in my reading uh what the war&#10;5:19&#10;is about it's not only about the donas&#10;5:21&#10;or crane it's a clash of the west and&#10;5:24&#10;Russia and of course the white elephant&#10;5:26&#10;in the room is um is there any way to&#10;5:29&#10;stop that is um could the war have been&#10;5:32&#10;avoided and especially here in Germany&#10;5:34&#10;there's a a hard debate on that so is it&#10;5:37&#10;is it the guilt of NATO the&#10;5:39&#10;responsibility of NATO um and how should&#10;5:42&#10;we react so Germany is very much&#10;5:44&#10;splitted more so than France or Britain&#10;5:47&#10;at the same time we're seeing in real&#10;5:49&#10;time the threat of a fragmentation of&#10;5:51&#10;the west and a questioning of NATO so in&#10;5:55&#10;in this kind of setup what is the&#10;5:58&#10;rational action that Europe and&#10;6:00&#10;particularly the next German government&#10;6:01&#10;will have to take because we don't know&#10;6:04&#10;what future brings um I think the&#10;6:06&#10;rationale is we have to be capable so I&#10;6:09&#10;think after the um 24th of February 2022&#10;6:12&#10;the full invasion also after the 7th of&#10;6:15&#10;October we see um it's very difficult to&#10;6:18&#10;foresee these kind of steps but the&#10;6:21&#10;rationale the consequence I think is we&#10;6:24&#10;have to be capable to react to these&#10;6:26&#10;kind of of um events and so Europe is is&#10;6:31&#10;talking since 2014 since the uh invasion&#10;6:35&#10;of of the Crimea about strengthening its&#10;6:38&#10;defense it's endless talks talks talks&#10;6:41&#10;talks also the fun line and and others&#10;6:44&#10;and that Europe should be united blah&#10;6:46&#10;blah blah blah blah very little has&#10;6:48&#10;happened um and there's also um um on&#10;6:52&#10;the similar level debates in Germany&#10;6:54&#10;Germany had a new white book in 2016 etc&#10;6:57&#10;but very little happened and even after&#10;6:59&#10;2022 there were steps of reform and you&#10;7:03&#10;know the social budget of hundred&#10;7:04&#10;billion euros&#10;7:06&#10;but if we have the viewpoint Europe&#10;7:09&#10;should be able to defend itself should&#10;7:12&#10;be combat ready in a way and there's a&#10;7:15&#10;lot of to do and I think this has to be&#10;7:16&#10;the focus of the new government germany&#10;7:18&#10;is the biggest country the wealthiest&#10;7:20&#10;country if you want um on the continent&#10;7:23&#10;in Europe um and they have to be on the&#10;7:27&#10;forefront of the European NATO partners&#10;7:29&#10;and not in the middle or the rear now&#10;7:32&#10;you've just published a book on&#10;7:33&#10;essentially the history of the&#10;7:34&#10;Bundeslair Germany's modern-day army and&#10;7:36&#10;you list a lot of the deficits there and&#10;7:39&#10;what is required in terms of buildup&#10;7:41&#10;right now but I want to talk to you&#10;7:42&#10;about mindset particularly of the&#10;7:44&#10;civilian population what will this&#10;7:48&#10;require politically but also in terms of&#10;7:50&#10;a society for instance right now we have&#10;7:53&#10;the debate whether there should be more&#10;7:55&#10;preparedness whether kids in school&#10;7:57&#10;should be taught what to do in crisis&#10;7:59&#10;situations right for conscription&#10;8:02&#10;um the reintroduction of conscription&#10;8:04&#10;well there is a public perception that&#10;8:06&#10;the Germans are pacifists after the&#10;8:08&#10;second world war um and the Germans are&#10;8:10&#10;very reluctant towards the armed forces&#10;8:13&#10;this is in a way true but on the other&#10;8:15&#10;hand it's not true so if you um as a as&#10;8:18&#10;an academic as a researcher look at the&#10;8:20&#10;opinion polls you see at the moment the&#10;8:23&#10;all-time peak of the wmosphere so 85% of&#10;8:26&#10;the German population say they have a&#10;8:28&#10;very high uh or high opinion of the&#10;8:30&#10;German armed forces um but of course 85%&#10;8:35&#10;doesn't mean 100% of course you have&#10;8:37&#10;people who are critical about the&#10;8:38&#10;bundesphere who are critical about the&#10;8:41&#10;rearmament and we are politically very&#10;8:43&#10;much split so we have um on the left&#10;8:46&#10;hand side and the right hand side&#10;8:48&#10;extremists or radical parties in the&#10;8:51&#10;German bundle who have a different&#10;8:54&#10;rationale but my argument is that the&#10;8:56&#10;bulk of the the majority of the Germans&#10;8:59&#10;since 15 1955 what I'm going to describe&#10;9:02&#10;that in my book uh were always for the&#10;9:04&#10;bundere and for defense um however if&#10;9:07&#10;you're following public discourse before&#10;9:09&#10;2022 you have the impression okay the&#10;9:12&#10;Germans are pacifists but that's more&#10;9:14&#10;the cultural elite and at the moment you&#10;9:16&#10;can see how the cultural elite is about&#10;9:19&#10;to adapt and you can see that from a&#10;9:22&#10;foreign country if you look at the green&#10;9:24&#10;party the green party you know coming&#10;9:26&#10;from the peace movement pacifist very&#10;9:28&#10;much so have dramatically changed um so&#10;9:31&#10;I think um it's not the problem you know&#10;9:34&#10;kind of rearmorament it's not the&#10;9:36&#10;problem of the population it's more the&#10;9:38&#10;problem of of of politics because the&#10;9:41&#10;polit politicians perceive German&#10;9:43&#10;population as being anti-military&#10;9:46&#10;anti-bun but that's not the case so what&#10;9:49&#10;will have to be the first task for this&#10;9:52&#10;incoming government that is in the&#10;9:54&#10;making as we speak yeah so I I I make&#10;9:57&#10;the argument in my book that um um the&#10;10:01&#10;bundesere the German armed forces are&#10;10:03&#10;still dysfunctional because they're&#10;10:05&#10;coming from a long long peace history&#10;10:06&#10;very little combat experience and you&#10;10:08&#10;have to have reforms on its structures&#10;10:11&#10;on its personnel uh and on its mindset&#10;10:14&#10;and that's a political job and you can&#10;10:16&#10;only do that um if you have somehow&#10;10:20&#10;following the British example if you&#10;10:22&#10;have a cabinet subcommittee on defense&#10;10:25&#10;because the Minister of Defense on its&#10;10:28&#10;own can't push that through he's only&#10;10:30&#10;one of 16 or 15 on the cabinet table and&#10;10:34&#10;he needs um the support of the Minister&#10;10:36&#10;of Justice of the uh B minister and and&#10;10:39&#10;and and others so it's really a project&#10;10:42&#10;of the cabinet uh and of the chancellor&#10;10:46&#10;uh and what we have seen in the last um&#10;10:48&#10;decades where you know there are some&#10;10:51&#10;reform plans of the ministers of defense&#10;10:53&#10;but without support of the chancellor&#10;10:55&#10;and other ministers so that has to&#10;10:57&#10;change and if Fri is going to be elected&#10;11:01&#10;to become the new German chancellor on&#10;11:04&#10;7th of May or so he has to understand&#10;11:07&#10;okay it's my project and I have to push&#10;11:09&#10;my cabinet colleagues not only the&#10;11:11&#10;minister of defense into that direction&#10;11:13&#10;and what will be the leadership&#10;11:15&#10;requirement for Germany which is after&#10;11:17&#10;all Europe's strongest economy in these&#10;11:20&#10;months and years to come I think Germany&#10;11:23&#10;has to understand which role it has to&#10;11:26&#10;play uh in NATO and and in Europe and to&#10;11:29&#10;my understanding and to my knowledge um&#10;11:32&#10;the focus has to be in the woodsphere on&#10;11:34&#10;the land forces so that's you know we&#10;11:38&#10;are traditionally a land a land power um&#10;11:41&#10;and others the British the French um um&#10;11:44&#10;can contribute more of their air forces&#10;11:47&#10;and their navies and the nuclear powers&#10;11:49&#10;the special forces and all this stuff&#10;11:50&#10;but Germany really has to have a massive&#10;11:53&#10;contribution to the defense of the NATO&#10;11:55&#10;eastern flank and we need boots on the&#10;11:58&#10;ground we need troops so this I think um&#10;12:00&#10;has to be a focus and to make these&#10;12:04&#10;units who are assigned to NATO uh combat&#10;12:08&#10;ready in the foreseeing future and they&#10;12:10&#10;have another focus on air defense and&#10;12:12&#10;drones so the German bunes is is um very&#10;12:17&#10;much&#10;12:18&#10;so an armed force of um you know of the&#10;12:22&#10;early 2000s or of the you can even say&#10;12:25&#10;of the 20th century and we need to have&#10;12:27&#10;to invest into new technology how do you&#10;12:30&#10;see the dynamics of the lessons that are&#10;12:32&#10;being learned in real time in Ukraine at&#10;12:34&#10;the moment i mean there's a lot of talk&#10;12:37&#10;with among German in the bundesphere and&#10;12:40&#10;staff headquarters what has to be done&#10;12:42&#10;adaptation to drone warfare etc the&#10;12:44&#10;problem is in Germany it's it's an um an&#10;12:48&#10;awful bureaucracy and it's in the head&#10;12:50&#10;of a lot of generals and and sometimes&#10;12:52&#10;also politicians but it has to get from&#10;12:55&#10;the head and this idea to the troops and&#10;12:58&#10;this is this is the main problem um and&#10;13:01&#10;the bundesphere is not used to have&#10;13:04&#10;quick solutions so because um in the&#10;13:07&#10;time of out of air operations we had all&#10;13:09&#10;the time um so what has to be done is&#10;13:12&#10;really to reform the transfer process&#10;13:15&#10;from okay there is a problem really to&#10;13:18&#10;change uh among the divisions among the&#10;13:20&#10;brigades among the companies um that&#10;13:23&#10;really the the single soldier feels a&#10;13:25&#10;different that they get the drones that&#10;13:27&#10;they get trained with drones uh and that&#10;13:30&#10;they really adapt to a warfare of the&#10;13:32&#10;21st century that's really the biggest&#10;13:35&#10;challenge I think now that's what's&#10;13:37&#10;happening in theater in Ukraine right&#10;13:39&#10;now but I would like you to characterize&#10;13:41&#10;what we're seeing at the moment as we&#10;13:42&#10;stand here we're seeing markets&#10;13:45&#10;essentially on their way down because of&#10;13:48&#10;economic policies that are hugely&#10;13:50&#10;disruptive um we're seeing less reliance&#10;13:53&#10;on the United States within NATO nato&#10;13:56&#10;also being questioned article 5 itself&#10;14:00&#10;we're seeing Russia prepare um major&#10;14:03&#10;maneuvers in Barus and at the same time&#10;14:06&#10;we're seeing NATO bolstering its eastern&#10;14:08&#10;flank how do you describe this whole&#10;14:11&#10;landscape that we're seeing and what is&#10;14:14&#10;the scenario you expect to happen over&#10;14:16&#10;this coming year&#10;14:19&#10;i mean it's a a massive challenge um for&#10;14:22&#10;the west and for the Europeans because&#10;14:24&#10;we relied very much on on United States&#10;14:29&#10;for its own security and we have seen&#10;14:32&#10;now we are seeing we are you know&#10;14:34&#10;eyewitnesses of that change that we are&#10;14:37&#10;recalibrating&#10;14:38&#10;um the architecture of of western&#10;14:41&#10;defense and this takes some time because&#10;14:44&#10;it is a system of 75&#10;14:47&#10;is um and we don't know exactly what the&#10;14:50&#10;outcome will be we don't know if United&#10;14:53&#10;States really drops out of NATO uh we&#10;14:55&#10;don't know um to which degree Trump&#10;14:58&#10;really um stays behind article 5 or not&#10;15:02&#10;but we definitely see a recalibration a&#10;15:04&#10;reorientation of Western defense and and&#10;15:08&#10;um we don't see the end point yet so it&#10;15:10&#10;it can be a worst case scenario that we&#10;15:12&#10;end up in a war with Russia uh or we are&#10;15:15&#10;going are under pressure of Russia and&#10;15:18&#10;we are not willing to fight or we have a&#10;15:20&#10;best case scenario that will be will be&#10;15:22&#10;a peace in Ukraine uh the United States&#10;15:25&#10;stays in Europe um the Europeans rearm&#10;15:28&#10;and and and we have a decade of peace so&#10;15:32&#10;everything is possible um but we are&#10;15:35&#10;leaving stability uh and what is now&#10;15:38&#10;needed is leadership is leadership of&#10;15:41&#10;statesmen who are united as a Europeans&#10;15:44&#10;who we have seen some some signs of that&#10;15:49&#10;um um that they are united and they are&#10;15:52&#10;going as a Europeans the next step of&#10;15:54&#10;European integration and we have seen&#10;15:55&#10;other steps of European integration uh&#10;15:58&#10;the common currency etc the common&#10;16:00&#10;market um in the 1980s uh in the 1990s&#10;16:03&#10;there were also crisis so we have to&#10;16:05&#10;react and this is really the high moment&#10;16:08&#10;um of of statesmanship and I always as a&#10;16:11&#10;historian this reminds me to this famous&#10;16:13&#10;quote of Churchill the finest hour and&#10;16:16&#10;we have to act as um some days when&#10;16:20&#10;people look back to this to this moment&#10;16:21&#10;2025 they say this was their finest hour&#10;16:25&#10;so a crisis is always also a chance to&#10;16:28&#10;change things um and to bring things&#10;16:30&#10;forward and we Europeans not only have&#10;16:33&#10;to talk but we have to bring our our&#10;16:35&#10;defense forward is Donald Trump right to&#10;16:39&#10;point out that the Arctic is the new&#10;16:43&#10;spotlight where the new spotlight should&#10;16:45&#10;be yeah well there there's ample&#10;16:48&#10;discussions of of where's the next&#10;16:50&#10;spotlight and of course if you are uh a&#10;16:53&#10;diplomat or a general staff officer&#10;16:55&#10;dealing with the Arctic you of course&#10;16:57&#10;say &quot;Oh the Arctic is is the focus&#10;16:59&#10;point.&quot; If you're dealing with cyber you&#10;17:01&#10;would say &quot;Oh no it's it's the cyber&#10;17:02&#10;space.&quot; If you're dealing with the&#10;17:04&#10;Baltic state you would say &quot;Oh no&#10;17:05&#10;possibly it's the Baltic.&quot; And there are&#10;17:06&#10;there are other options so what we see&#10;17:09&#10;is that that Russia there's enormous&#10;17:11&#10;amount of possibilities to attack NATO&#10;17:14&#10;in a hybrid war or in a real war the&#10;17:16&#10;Arctic is one scenario definitely one&#10;17:19&#10;scenario so Spitzer is is one scenario&#10;17:22&#10;what do what does not NATO do&#10;17:24&#10;splitzbagen is part of of Norway but&#10;17:27&#10;what do we do if if the Russia is going&#10;17:29&#10;to deploy an air bomb brigade there and&#10;17:31&#10;say that's now Russian territory are we&#10;17:33&#10;are we going to kick them out or what is&#10;17:35&#10;what is the reaction this these kind of&#10;17:37&#10;scenarios are feared in NATO&#10;17:40&#10;headquarters as far as I'm I'm aware&#10;17:42&#10;that that that Russia is going to test&#10;17:45&#10;NATO so a lot of people um in in the&#10;17:49&#10;NATO in intelligence service say well&#10;17:50&#10;it's definitely clear Putin is going to&#10;17:52&#10;test us and it can be in the Arctic it&#10;17:54&#10;can be uh elsewhere and he definitely&#10;17:57&#10;wants to see um if article 5 is really&#10;18:00&#10;something we are we are into and of&#10;18:03&#10;course we the problem is um um then we&#10;18:06&#10;have the endless debates of what what&#10;18:08&#10;should we do are we really willing to&#10;18:10&#10;kick the Russians out so that's that's&#10;18:12&#10;the problem but it's I think totally&#10;18:15&#10;impossible to say well this will be the&#10;18:17&#10;next step of Putin i think he is very&#10;18:20&#10;opportunistic and it very much depends&#10;18:22&#10;on us on our messages we are going to&#10;18:25&#10;send what Putin will do i just want to&#10;18:28&#10;conclude by asking you because you're&#10;18:29&#10;saying this is the end of stability but&#10;18:31&#10;what are you for you the upcoming tests&#10;18:34&#10;where we will learn whether we're&#10;18:36&#10;heading back to more relative stability&#10;18:39&#10;or further towards escalation i think um&#10;18:42&#10;Putin is going to test us further in in&#10;18:45&#10;the hybrid war he's going you know we&#10;18:47&#10;have seen the destruction of sea cables&#10;18:48&#10;in in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere and&#10;18:51&#10;he's going to test that more he's going&#10;18:52&#10;to to drive the hybrid war more forward&#10;18:56&#10;um and if we're not reacting to that in&#10;18:58&#10;a in a fierce united reaction um he will&#10;19:02&#10;go on he will definitely go on he will&#10;19:04&#10;try to undermine our&#10;19:07&#10;societies um and um look at Germany look&#10;19:11&#10;at France and Slovakia Hungary and&#10;19:13&#10;elsewhere um and so there might be a&#10;19:17&#10;situation really this is again feared&#10;19:19&#10;that um possibly not this autumn but it&#10;19:22&#10;can be this autumn that um a Russian&#10;19:24&#10;brigade uh goes over the bridge in Nava&#10;19:27&#10;and Estonia and so well that's now&#10;19:28&#10;Russian territory what's then our&#10;19:30&#10;reaction i would say well no we're going&#10;19:32&#10;to kick you out and I think we have to&#10;19:35&#10;be very very clear as in the cold war if&#10;19:39&#10;you are crossing this line you are on&#10;19:41&#10;war with us and we have to to understand&#10;19:44&#10;that message that this this kind of&#10;19:47&#10;deterrence is in my in my view the best&#10;19:50&#10;way to prevent war and nobody wants war&#10;19:53&#10;but we have to make clear that we are&#10;19:55&#10;not willing to live under under Russian&#10;19:58&#10;hegemony and if he is going to put&#10;20:00&#10;pressure on us we have to stand fast and&#10;20:03&#10;then I think we will see no war and and&#10;20:06&#10;there will be peace in the future but&#10;20:08&#10;Europe has to recalibrate their their&#10;20:11&#10;idea of security it's not the Americans&#10;20:13&#10;are going to do this we have we are 500&#10;20:16&#10;million people right and and we have to&#10;20:18&#10;do this on our own and this you know is&#10;20:21&#10;only being achieved especially in&#10;20:23&#10;Germany if we change the culture this is&#10;20:25&#10;in a way a process culture can change&#10;20:28&#10;and but the problem is we don't have&#10;20:30&#10;time however I think we have seen a lot&#10;20:33&#10;of progress also in Germany so we&#10;20:36&#10;shouldn't be too frustrated and now&#10;20:38&#10;let's hope for the new government that&#10;20:39&#10;they push that forward uh Germany goes&#10;20:42&#10;together with Warsaw together with Paris&#10;20:44&#10;together with London together with Rome&#10;20:47&#10;to elite and we have in a few years&#10;20:49&#10;times a united Europe united in its&#10;20:52&#10;defense united in its in its in its in&#10;20:55&#10;its language uh towards Russia so good&#10;20:59&#10;Germany's most prominent military&#10;21:00&#10;historian thank you so much for talking&#10;21:02&#10;to DW my pleasure" />

COMING JUST TWO DAYS&#10;2:10&#10;AFTER MUSK CRITICIZED PRESIDENT&#10;2:12&#10;TRUMP'S SIGNATURE SPENDING BILL.&#10;2:14&#10;&gt;&gt; SO, YOU KNOW, I WAS, LIKE,&#10;2:17&#10;DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THE MASSIVE&#10;2:20&#10;SPENDING BILL.&#10;2:21&#10;&gt;&gt; MUSK NOW FACES A NEW&#10;2:22&#10;CHALLENGE TRYING TO REHABILITATE&#10;2:24&#10;HIS IMAGE AS A VISIONARY&#10;2:26&#10;ENTREPRENEUR. AFTER MONTHS OF&#10;2:28&#10;FIERCE POLITICAL SCRUTINY.&#10;2:30&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT WAS NBC'S PETER&#10;2:32&#10;ALEXANDER.&#10;2:32&#10;&gt;&gt; WITH THAT REPORT AND.&#10;2:33&#10;&gt;&gt; BEYOND THE.&#10;2:34&#10;&gt;&gt; APPEAL, THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE&#10;2:36&#10;REACTING WITH THINLY DISGUISED&#10;2:38&#10;FURY AS TO WHAT HAPPENED HERE.&#10;2:40&#10;STEPHEN MILLER CALLING IT A&#10;2:42&#10;JUDICIAL COUP. OTHERS SAYING&#10;2:43&#10;THAT THIS IS FURTHER EVIDENCE OF&#10;2:44&#10;THE DEEP STATE TRYING TO WORK&#10;2:47&#10;AGAINST AND SUBVERT TRUMP'S&#10;2:49&#10;AGENDA, RATCHETING UP THEIR&#10;2:50&#10;ATTACKS ON THE JUDICIARY.&#10;2:52&#10;&gt;&gt; SO JOINING.&#10;2:53&#10;&gt;&gt; US NOW, WE HAVE CO-ANCHOR OF&#10;2:54&#10;CNBC'S SQUAWK BOX AND A NEW YORK&#10;2:57&#10;TIMES COLUMNIST, ANDREW ROSS&#10;2:58&#10;SORKIN, NBC NEWS SENIOR BUSINESS&#10;3:01&#10;CORRESPONDENT CHRISTINE ROMANS,&#10;3:02&#10;CO-HOST OF MSNBC'S THE&#10;3:04&#10;WEEKNIGHTS.&#10;3:04&#10;&gt;&gt; SYMONE SANDERS TOWNSEND.&#10;3:06&#10;&gt;&gt; AS WELL. AS FORMER MSNBC HOST&#10;3:08&#10;CHRIS MATTHEWS. HIS NEW SUBSTACK&#10;3:11&#10;IS APTLY TITLED YOU'LL NEVER GET&#10;3:12&#10;IT HARDBALL WITH CHRIS MATTHEWS.&#10;3:14&#10;ALSO WITH US, FORMER. STATE&#10;3:16&#10;ATTORNEY FOR PALM BEACH COUNTY,&#10;3:18&#10;DAVE ARONBERG. IT'S A TERRIFIC&#10;3:20&#10;GROUP FOR A BUSY NEWS HOUR, JOE.&#10;3:22&#10;AND CERTAINLY THERE WAS RAGE&#10;3:24&#10;THIS MORNING AND LAST NIGHT FROM&#10;3:26&#10;THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT THIS&#10;3:28&#10;RULING. ALSO, REAL ANGER FROM&#10;3:29&#10;PRESIDENT TRUMP THERE. WHEN&#10;3:30&#10;CONFRONTED WITH THAT.&#10;3:31&#10;&gt;&gt; AS PETER ALEXANDER.&#10;3:33&#10;&gt;&gt; PUT IT, THAT THE TACO TRADE,&#10;3:34&#10;THE IDEA THAT HIM KICKING THE&#10;3:36&#10;OUT. BUT AS WE TALKED ABOUT&#10;3:38&#10;EARLIER THIS MORNING, YOU KNOW,&#10;3:38&#10;THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT YOU&#10;3:40&#10;WOULD SAY DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN&#10;3:42&#10;HAS BELIEVED IN FOR A LONG TIME&#10;3:43&#10;THAT HE'S BEEN CONSISTENT IN.&#10;3:45&#10;BUT RIGHT ON TOP OF THE LIST&#10;3:46&#10;TARIFFS, THOSE AREN'T GOING&#10;3:48&#10;ANYWHERE IF HE CAN.&#10;3:49&#10;&gt;&gt; HELP IT.&#10;3:50&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH. AND AGAIN AGAIN WALL&#10;3:51&#10;STREET JUST DOESN'T GET IT. I&#10;3:53&#10;MEAN PEOPLE THAT SUPPORTED&#10;3:54&#10;DONALD TRUMP, THAT THOUGHT HE&#10;3:56&#10;WAS JUST TALKING DURING THE&#10;3:58&#10;CAMPAIGN ABOUT TARIFFS BUT&#10;3:59&#10;DIDN'T MEAN IT. DON'T GET IT.&#10;4:01&#10;HE'S HE'S BEEN TALKING THIS WAY&#10;4:02&#10;SINCE THE 1980S. HE STILL&#10;4:05&#10;BELIEVES IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY HE'S&#10;4:07&#10;BACKING DOWN. ALL THEY'RE DOING&#10;4:08&#10;IS THEY'RE BASICALLY PUSHING HIM&#10;4:10&#10;TOWARDS MORE TARIFFS BECAUSE HE&#10;4:13&#10;BELIEVES IN THEM. HE BELIEVES&#10;4:16&#10;THAT TARIFFS ARE THE BEST WAY&#10;4:18&#10;FORWARD. AND IN REBUILDING&#10;4:20&#10;AMERICA'S MANUFACTURING BASE. OF&#10;4:22&#10;COURSE, MOST ECONOMISTS DISAGREE&#10;4:23&#10;WITH HIM. MOST OF HIS SUPPORTERS&#10;4:26&#10;ON WALL STREET DISAGREE WITH&#10;4:27&#10;HIM. HE DOESN'T CARE. SO THEY'RE&#10;4:30&#10;NOT GOING AWAY. DAVE ARONBERG, I&#10;4:32&#10;WANT TO START WITH YOU WITH THIS&#10;4:34&#10;FASCINATING RULING LAST NIGHT&#10;4:36&#10;FROM FROM THIS COURT, OF COURSE,&#10;4:38&#10;THE WHITE HOUSE. DEAD WRONG,&#10;4:40&#10;DEAD WRONG. AND ALSO, IT'S JUST&#10;4:42&#10;NOT HELPFUL WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT&#10;4:43&#10;JUDICIAL COUPS. IT'S NOT A&#10;4:46&#10;JUDICIAL COUP IF IT'S AN ARTICLE&#10;4:50&#10;THREE. AND IF THIS IS THE WAY&#10;4:52&#10;THAT JAMES MADISON AND ALEXANDER&#10;4:54&#10;HAMILTON PLANNED IT OUT 240&#10;4:57&#10;YEARS AGO, AND EVERY PRESIDENT&#10;4:58&#10;SINCE THEN HAS HAD TO DEAL WITH&#10;5:00&#10;IT, I, I DO WANT I DO WANT TO&#10;5:03&#10;SAY THIS, THOUGH, AND I'M JUST&#10;5:04&#10;CURIOUS AT FIRST BLUSH WHAT YOU&#10;5:06&#10;WHAT YOUR THOUGHT IS WHEN YOU&#10;5:07&#10;HAVE THIS COURT SAYING IT'S&#10;5:10&#10;CONGRESS'S POWER AND NOT THE&#10;5:12&#10;EXECUTIVE BRANCH'S POWER. SO&#10;5:13&#10;THEY'RE SAYING THIS IS AN&#10;5:15&#10;ARTICLE ONE POWER, NOT AN&#10;5:17&#10;ARTICLE TWO POWER. AND THAT'S&#10;5:18&#10;COMING FROM AN ARTICLE THREE&#10;5:21&#10;POWER. I DON'T THINK THAT'S&#10;5:23&#10;GOING TO HOLD UP WITH THE&#10;5:24&#10;SUPREME COURT. AND I DON'T THINK&#10;5:26&#10;IT'S GOING TO HOLD UP WITH THE&#10;5:28&#10;SUPREME COURT BECAUSE THEY'RE&#10;5:29&#10;GOING TO SAY, WELL, YES, IT'S&#10;5:30&#10;CONGRESS'S POWER. CONGRESS&#10;5:31&#10;DEFERRED THAT POWER TO THE&#10;5:33&#10;PRESIDENT IF THEY WANT TO, IF&#10;5:35&#10;THEY WANT TO FIGHT THAT AND SAY,&#10;5:36&#10;THIS IS AN ARTICLE ONE POWER,&#10;5:38&#10;AND THEY BRING THE LAWSUIT, THEN&#10;5:40&#10;THEY'LL HAVE STANDING TO GET&#10;5:42&#10;THAT LAW, THAT POWER BACK OR TO&#10;5:44&#10;PASS LEGISLATION DOING IT. I&#10;5:46&#10;JUST DON'T SEE A COURT DOING&#10;5:47&#10;THIS BY THEMSELVES. AGAIN, THEY&#10;5:50&#10;DO. THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE&#10;5:51&#10;THIS RULING. OF COURSE THEY DO&#10;5:53&#10;UNDER ARTICLE THREE. WILL IT&#10;5:55&#10;HOLD UP UNDER THE SUPREME COURT?&#10;5:57&#10;I'M VERY SKEPTICAL, AGAIN,&#10;6:00&#10;BECAUSE CONGRESS HAS DEFERRED&#10;6:02&#10;THAT POWER FOR NOW TO THE&#10;6:03&#10;PRESIDENT.&#10;6:04&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, JOE. THEY HAVEN'T&#10;6:06&#10;EXPLICITLY.&#10;6:06&#10;&gt;&gt; GIVEN UP THEIR POWER.&#10;6:08&#10;&gt;&gt; YES, THEY HAVE SELF&#10;6:09&#10;EMASCULATED.&#10;6:10&#10;&gt;&gt; IT'S EMBARRASSING.&#10;6:10&#10;&gt;&gt; AND IT'S UP TO THE JUDGES TO.&#10;6:12&#10;RESTORE SOME CHECKS AND&#10;6:13&#10;BALANCES. BUT THESE JUSTICES.&#10;6:14&#10;&gt;&gt; ON THE CONSERVATIVE.&#10;6:16&#10;&gt;&gt; SIDE ARE.&#10;6:16&#10;&gt;&gt; STRICT CONSTRUCTIONISTS.&#10;6:17&#10;&gt;&gt; AND THEY KNOW THAT.&#10;6:18&#10;&gt;&gt; CONGRESS HAS THE POWER OF.&#10;6:20&#10;&gt;&gt; THE PURSE.&#10;6:20&#10;&gt;&gt; AND IT'S.&#10;6:21&#10;&gt;&gt; CONGRESS THAT.&#10;6:22&#10;&gt;&gt; HAS THE.&#10;6:22&#10;&gt;&gt; POWER TO TARIFF.&#10;6:24&#10;&gt;&gt; AND THIS.&#10;6:24&#10;&gt;&gt; STATUTE HERE.&#10;6:25&#10;&gt;&gt; EPA PROVIDES SOME EXCEPTIONS.&#10;6:27&#10;WHEN THERE IS AN UNUSUAL.&#10;6:28&#10;&gt;&gt; AND EXTRAORDINARY.&#10;6:28&#10;&gt;&gt; THREAT TO THE NATIONAL.&#10;6:29&#10;&gt;&gt; SECURITY, FOREIGN.&#10;6:30&#10;&gt;&gt; POLICY OR ECONOMIC SECURITY&#10;6:32&#10;OF.&#10;6:32&#10;&gt;&gt; THE UNITED STATES.&#10;6:33&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT WHAT.&#10;6:33&#10;&gt;&gt; IS THAT UNUSUAL.&#10;6:35&#10;&gt;&gt; AND EXTRAORDINARY THREAT&#10;6:35&#10;HERE?&#10;6:36&#10;&gt;&gt; OUR LONGSTANDING TRADE.&#10;6:37&#10;&gt;&gt; IMBALANCES.&#10;6:38&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, EMERGENCY POWERS&#10;6:39&#10;EXIST. TO ENABLE THE PRESIDENT.&#10;6:41&#10;&gt;&gt; TO RESPOND QUICKLY.&#10;6:42&#10;&gt;&gt; TO.&#10;6:42&#10;&gt;&gt; A CRISIS.&#10;6:43&#10;&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT.&#10;6:44&#10;&gt;&gt; SUPPOSED TO.&#10;6:44&#10;&gt;&gt; BE USED.&#10;6:45&#10;&gt;&gt; TO DEAL WITH LONG STANDING&#10;6:47&#10;LAWS AND.&#10;6:48&#10;&gt;&gt; POLICIES YOU DISAGREE WITH.&#10;6:49&#10;&gt;&gt; IF YOU.&#10;6:50&#10;&gt;&gt; WANT.&#10;6:50&#10;&gt;&gt; TO CHANGE OUR LAWS.&#10;6:51&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU GO.&#10;6:52&#10;&gt;&gt; TO CONGRESS. BUT PRESIDENT&#10;6:54&#10;TRUMP DOESN'T. WANT TO DO THAT&#10;6:55&#10;BECAUSE.&#10;6:55&#10;&gt;&gt; HE. KNOWS HE CAN'T.&#10;6:56&#10;&gt;&gt; GET THESE.&#10;6:57&#10;&gt;&gt; UNPOPULAR TARIFFS THROUGH A&#10;6:58&#10;NARROWLY.&#10;6:59&#10;&gt;&gt; DIVIDED HOUSE AND THE&#10;7:00&#10;FILIBUSTER. IN THE SENATE.&#10;7:01&#10;&gt;&gt; SO HE.&#10;7:02&#10;&gt;&gt; RESORTS TO EXECUTIVE ORDERS.&#10;7:02&#10;AND THIS EPA.&#10;7:04&#10;&gt;&gt; STATUTE.&#10;7:04&#10;&gt;&gt; WHICH ONLY WORKS AS LONG.&#10;7:05&#10;&gt;&gt; AS.&#10;7:06&#10;&gt;&gt; THE.&#10;7:06&#10;&gt;&gt; COURTS SAY THAT IT WORKS. AND&#10;7:08&#10;YESTERDAY A COURT SHUT IT DOWN.&#10;7:10&#10;AND ONE OTHER THING.&#10;7:11&#10;&gt;&gt; JOE, THERE'S.&#10;7:11&#10;&gt;&gt; A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH.&#10;7:13&#10;&gt;&gt; TRUMP'S USE.&#10;7:14&#10;&gt;&gt; OF THIS STATUTE. AND THE&#10;7:15&#10;COURTS IDENTIFIED IT. IT DOESN'T&#10;7:16&#10;AUTHORIZE TARIFFS. THIS STATUTE&#10;7:17&#10;WAS ENACTED TO ENABLE A&#10;7:18&#10;PRESIDENT TO IMPOSE ECONOMIC&#10;7:20&#10;SANCTIONS.&#10;7:20&#10;&gt;&gt; ON HOSTILE.&#10;7:21&#10;&gt;&gt; FOREIGN COUNTRIES. NOT EVERY.&#10;7:22&#10;&gt;&gt; COUNTRY IN THE.&#10;7:22&#10;&gt;&gt; WORLD.&#10;7:23&#10;&gt;&gt; LIKE.&#10;7:24&#10;&gt;&gt; TRUMP DID, AND TARIFFS DO&#10;7:25&#10;NOT. APPEAR IN THE.&#10;7:26&#10;&gt;&gt; LIST OF.&#10;7:27&#10;&gt;&gt; POTENTIAL SANCTIONS.&#10;7:28&#10;&gt;&gt; IN THE LAW. IT'S NOT EVEN&#10;7:30&#10;MENTIONED IN THE ACT'S&#10;7:31&#10;LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, EITHER. AND&#10;7:32&#10;NO PRESIDENT IN HISTORY HAS EVER&#10;7:33&#10;USED THE LAW TO IMPOSE TARIFFS.&#10;7:36&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH.&#10;7:36&#10;&gt;&gt; ANDREW SORKIN THOUGH I WILL&#10;7:37&#10;SAY AGAIN, CONGRESS, YOU KNOW,&#10;7:39&#10;REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, THERE&#10;7:41&#10;WERE A FEW THAT WERE TRYING TO,&#10;7:43&#10;YOU KNOW, END THE EMERGENCY TO&#10;7:45&#10;RECLAIM THEIR POWER. AND THEY&#10;7:47&#10;THEY COULDN'T THEY COULDN'T GET&#10;7:48&#10;A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF VOTES. SO&#10;7:50&#10;CONGRESS HAS DEFERRED TO DONALD&#10;7:51&#10;TRUMP. AGAIN, PEOPLE MAY NOT&#10;7:53&#10;LIKE IT. IT'S JUST THE REALITY.&#10;7:55&#10;AND THAT'S HOW THE SUPREME&#10;7:56&#10;COURT, I THINK THIS SUPREME&#10;7:58&#10;COURT IS GOING TO LOOK AT IT. I&#10;8:00&#10;THINK IT'S HOW A LOT OF COURTS&#10;8:02&#10;WOULD LOOK AT IT. I ALSO WANT TO&#10;8:04&#10;JUST ADD THIS, ANDREW, BECAUSE&#10;8:06&#10;IT'S KIND OF LOST IN THE&#10;8:07&#10;DISCUSSION, EVEN FROM ALL OF THE&#10;8:08&#10;WEEPING AND GNASHING OF TEETH&#10;8:10&#10;THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE WHITE&#10;8:11&#10;HOUSE FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES&#10;8:13&#10;THIS MORNING, EVEN WITH THIS&#10;8:14&#10;RULING, THIS WAS THE NEW YORK&#10;8:15&#10;TIMES REPORTING ON TRUMP COULD&#10;8:17&#10;STILL TEMPORARILY LAUNCH IMPORT&#10;8:19&#10;TAXES OF 15% FOR 150 DAYS ON&#10;8:22&#10;NATIONS WITH WHICH THE U.S. RUNS&#10;8:24&#10;A SUBSTANTIAL TRADE DEFICIT. THE&#10;8:25&#10;RULING NOTES THAT A PRESIDENT&#10;8:27&#10;HAS THIS AUTHORITY UNDER SECTION&#10;8:29&#10;122 OF THE TRADE ACT OF 1974,&#10;8:31&#10;DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT STILL&#10;8:34&#10;HAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF&#10;8:35&#10;POWER, REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE&#10;8:37&#10;COURTS SAY ON TARIFFS. AND SO&#10;8:39&#10;ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ON WALL&#10;8:40&#10;STREET, YOU KNOW, JUMPING UP AND&#10;8:42&#10;DOWN, GOING HIP HIP HOORAY! AND&#10;8:43&#10;WE'RE SEEING A MARKET REBOUND&#10;8:45&#10;AGAIN. THESE PEOPLE KEEP HOPING&#10;8:46&#10;AGAINST HOPE THAT DONALD TRUMP&#10;8:48&#10;IS NOT A TARIFF PRESIDENT. HE&#10;8:51&#10;IS, ISN'T HE? WELL HE IS.&#10;8:53&#10;THERE'S TWO PIECES TO THIS. SO&#10;8:55&#10;YOU'RE 100% RIGHT THAT HE IS&#10;8:56&#10;GOING TO FIND AND CAN FIND OTHER&#10;8:59&#10;WAYS TO EFFECTUATE THESE TARIFFS&#10;9:01&#10;IF HE SO WANTS. I WAS TALKING TO&#10;9:03&#10;MICHAEL FROMAN, WHO USED TO BE&#10;9:04&#10;THE US TRADE REPRESENTATIVE, AND&#10;9:06&#10;HE SAID THERE ARE LOTS OF&#10;9:07&#10;DIFFERENT METHODS AND MECHANISMS&#10;9:08&#10;WITH WHICH HE COULD PURSUE THIS.&#10;9:10&#10;HAVING SAID THAT, IN TERMS OF&#10;9:12&#10;THE CONTEXT OF THE ART OF THE&#10;9:14&#10;DEAL, HOW YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE&#10;9:16&#10;DEALS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, THIS&#10;9:17&#10;CLEARLY, AT LEAST IN THE SHORT&#10;9:19&#10;TERM, IS GOING TO GIVE SOME NEW&#10;9:21&#10;NEGOTIATING LEVERAGE NOT TO THE&#10;9:22&#10;US, BUT TO OUR TRADING PARTNERS.&#10;9:24&#10;RIGHT. THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK AT&#10;9:26&#10;THIS AND SAY, OKAY, YOU WANT TO&#10;9:28&#10;DEAL FROM US? WELL, YOU HAVE&#10;9:30&#10;YOUR COURSE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO&#10;9:31&#10;HAVE TO FIGHT WITH FOR A WHILE.&#10;9:32&#10;WE'D LIKE A DIFFERENT KIND OF&#10;9:34&#10;DEAL. IN FACT, YOU KNOW, EUROPE&#10;9:36&#10;JUST 72 HOURS AGO SAID, DON'T&#10;9:37&#10;PUT THE TARIFFS ON US ON JUNE&#10;9:39&#10;1ST. WE'LL TRY TO GET THERE BY&#10;9:41&#10;JULY 9TH. WELL, THIS HAS JUST&#10;9:42&#10;BEEN A GIFT TO THE EU IN TERMS&#10;9:44&#10;OF HOW THAT NEGOTIATION COULD&#10;9:46&#10;GO. I'M SURE THERE ARE SOME&#10;9:48&#10;INSIDE THE UK THIS MORNING THAT&#10;9:49&#10;ARE SAYING TO THEMSELVES, WE&#10;9:51&#10;AGREED EARLY ON WE DO THIS 10%&#10;9:53&#10;TARIFF. MAYBE THAT WASN'T SUCH A&#10;9:54&#10;GREAT IDEA, IN FACT, BECAUSE THE&#10;9:56&#10;COURTS ARE GOING TO UPEND SOME&#10;9:58&#10;OF THESE THINGS. SO THERE'S NO&#10;9:59&#10;QUESTION THAT HE CAN PURSUE&#10;10:01&#10;THESE TARIFFS. AND HE MAY IT'S&#10;10:02&#10;JUST GOING TO DRAW ALL OF THIS&#10;10:04&#10;OUT, THOUGH IN A MUCH LONGER&#10;10:05&#10;WAY, MUCH LONGER THAN THE 90 DAY&#10;10:08&#10;PERIOD THAT WAS INITIALLY, YOU&#10;10:10&#10;KNOW, CONTEMPLATED. AND SO THAT&#10;10:13&#10;UNCERTAINTY UNTO ITSELF IS ALSO&#10;10:15&#10;GOING TO CREATE A SORT OF NEW&#10;10:17&#10;LEVEL OF PARALYSIS, I'M AFRAID&#10;10:19&#10;TO SAY, AS INVESTORS AND&#10;10:22&#10;BUSINESS L" />

          <attvalue for="1" value="Arno Michaelis is a former white nationalist skinhead, lead singer of the neo-Nazi metal band Centurion, and member of Hammerskin Nation, one of the most violent white supremacist gangs in the US.&#10;&#10;From 1987 to 1994, Michaelis played a central role in spreading neo-Nazi ideology through music, street violence, and recruitment efforts across the United States and beyond. His band sold over 20,000 copies of its white supremacist albums within six months.&#10;&#10;Michaelis provides a rare look inside the world of violent extremism, detailing how white nationalist groups recruit young men, fund their operations, and use propaganda to radicalize followers. He describes the brutality of life inside the movement, the constant state of fear and paranoia, and how his involvement led to addiction, crime, and self-destruction.&#10;&#10;After leaving the movement, Michaelis became an anti-hate activist, speaker, and author. He works with Parents for Peace to deradicalize extremists, exposing the tactics used by white nationalist groups and guiding individuals away from the influence of extremism through prevention. He is the author of &quot;My Life After Hate&quot; and &quot;The Gift of Our Wounds,&quot; which was cowritten with Pardeep Singh Kaleka, whose father was killed in the Oak Creek Sikh temple shooting.&#10;&#10;If you are concerned about someone’s extreme beliefs or behaviors, Parents for Peace has a free and confidential helpline at 844-49-PEACE (844-497-3223) or email at help@parents4peace.org.&#10;&#10;If you or someone you know is dealing with substance misuse or mental illness, call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's National Helpline (1-800-662-4357) for 24/7, free, confidential treatment referral and information.&#10;&#10;For more:&#10;Instagram: @ArnoMichaelis&#10;https://www.parents4peace.org/our-tea...&#10;&#10;MORE AUTHORIZED ACCOUNT:&#10;How Hacking Governments Actually Works (Anonymous) | Authorized Account | Insider&#10;   • How Hackers Actually Work (Anonymous) | Au...  &#10;How Sociopaths Actually Work | Authorized Account | Insider&#10;   • How Sociopaths Actually Work | Authorized ...  &#10;How Snipers Actually Work | Authorized Account | Insider&#10;   • How Snipers Actually Work | Authorized Acc...  &#10;&#10;00:00 - Introduction&#10;00:40 - The Ideology&#10;03:55 - The Symbols&#10;06:49 - The Structure&#10;10:49 - The Recruitment&#10;16:02 - The Violence&#10;21:49 - The Rallies&#10;25:16 - The Money&#10;29:42 - Neo-Nazi Music&#10;33:20 - The Departure&#10;39:34 - Mass Casualties&#10;42:07 - The Future&#10;46:00 - The Aftermath&#10;50:30 - Credits&#10;&#10;------------------------------------------------------&#10;#history #unitedstates #insider &#10;&#10;Insider's mission is to inform and inspire. &#10;&#10;Visit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com/&#10;Insider on Facebook:   / insider  &#10;Insider on Instagram:   / insider  &#10;Insider on Twitter:   / thisisinsider  &#10;Insider on Snapchat:   / 2708030621  &#10;Insider on TikTok:   / insider  &#10;&#10;How US Neo-Nazism Actually Works | Authorized Account | Insider" />

          <attvalue for="4" value="Introduction&#10;0:00&#10;My name is Arno Michaelis. I was a white nationalist skinhead, a lead singer in a neo-Nazi metal band.&#10;0:07&#10;This is everything I'm authorized to tell you.&#10;0:12&#10;The most formulative years of my life, I was just immersed in this hate and violence.&#10;0:17&#10;I was actually at a neo-Nazi rally in Michigan where about 50 of us brawled with, like, 500 antifascists,&#10;0:26&#10;and there were all too many times when we would jump people and just beat the h--- out of them.&#10;0:32&#10;I've done a lot of harm to innocent people and to society,&#10;0:37&#10;and I need to be accountable for that harm.&#10;The Ideology&#10;0:45&#10;What attracted me to neo-Nazi ideology initially was really the hero story.&#10;0:53&#10;I grew up being a big fan of fantasy and mythology.&#10;0:59&#10;I was really into Greek myths and Norse myths as a kid. The mythology of Nazi ideology&#10;1:06&#10;going back to Adolf Hitler was that, you know, we are these Aryan supermen, the brightest of all creation&#10;1:14&#10;that are under assault by these dark, evil hordes, and here we are fighting back against them,&#10;1:20&#10;against incredible odds, but with incredible strength. It was very much the same kind of mystique&#10;1:26&#10;that you would find in a &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; movie or a Conan book.&#10;1:32&#10;And for me, this was like my chance to actually be that hero on this noble quest.&#10;1:39&#10;And then as I got more into it and took in more and more of the ideology, a lot of the ideology was about, like,&#10;1:47&#10;&quot;Look how evil and horrible they are, and look how good and noble my people are.&#10;1:52&#10;Look at all these great things we have done despite all the challenges and despite being under assault by everybody else.&quot;&#10;1:59&#10;There was actually a music-distribution outfit in Chicago called Romantic Violence.&#10;2:04&#10;And those two words sum up the entire ideology better than anything I could say at length.&#10;2:11&#10;There's a romance to it. It makes you feel like you're a hero and you're doing something good for your people.&#10;2:18&#10;As you get further into the ideology, it's all about pseudoscience,&#10;2:24&#10;about how whites are superior to everybody else, all kinds of nonsense about the size of our brains and IQ.&#10;2:32&#10;And then, of course, all of this is deeply rooted in antisemitism.&#10;2:38&#10;The entire ideology is based on seeing Jews as the root of all evil on the planet Earth.&#10;2:46&#10;That's the core of the neo-Nazi belief, is that the white race is this — first of all, it exists.&#10;2:53&#10;You have to have some kind of idea of who's white and who's not. And again, that was never firmly established by anything.&#10;3:01&#10;I remember meeting Italian skinheads. There was one crew that their leader was an Armenian guy&#10;3:07&#10;who looked like he was, you know, straight out of Iraq or something. And I said, &quot;What are you, Italian?&quot;&#10;3:13&#10;He's like, &quot;Oh, I'm Armenian. Hitler had Armenian SS units.&quot; And I was like, &quot;All right.&#10;3:19&#10;Well, if it was good enough for Hitler, it's good enough for me.&quot; The most damaging aspect of the neo-Nazi ideology&#10;3:25&#10;is definitely the fear. Anybody who does look like you and doesn't think like you,&#10;3:31&#10;they're not only an enemy, they're the highest order of enemy. They're a race traitor. So it's this experience&#10;3:38&#10;of going through every waking moment of your day thinking that everyone else in the world&#10;3:44&#10;is not only out to kill you personally, but out to destroy everyone who looks like you.&#10;3:50&#10;And it's a miserable way to live that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.&#10;The Symbols&#10;4:00&#10;I tattooed a swastika on my own leg, which I've since had covered up. I had a swastika on my middle finger for a time,&#10;4:08&#10;cleverly, so I could show it to someone before I hit them. The other symbolism we used, there was a,&#10;4:14&#10;any kind of Norse rune. Just like Hitler did, we co-opted the Norse folk religion&#10;4:22&#10;and kind of made it into this white nationalist thing, which is, along with pretty much everything else&#10;4:29&#10;in the ideology, is incredibly historically inaccurate because the Vikings really,&#10;4:34&#10;they killed people who looked like them and they had peaceful trade and diplomatic relationships with North Africa and the Middle East.&#10;4:41&#10;There's a lot of lingo to neo-Nazi movement. The first one I learned was 88.&#10;4:49&#10;When I met the Chicago skinhead crew, a lot of them had sports jerseys on that had 88 as the number.&#10;4:56&#10;The eighth letter of the alphabet is H, so 88 means &quot;heil Hitler.&quot;&#10;5:01&#10;So it's code for &quot;heil Hitler.&quot; In the mid-'80s, there was a really dangerous&#10;5:06&#10;militant white nationalist terror group called The Order or the Bruder Schweigen,&#10;5:11&#10;and they assassinated a Jewish talk-show host. They were doing all kinds of things to fund a race war&#10;5:17&#10;before they were ultimately taken down. But one of the members of The Order who was in prison for life and unrepentant,&#10;5:25&#10;he decided we needed some sort of slogan, like some catchy mantra that the movement could use&#10;5:33&#10;to unite us and inspire us. So he came up with the 14 words, which are,&#10;5:40&#10;&quot;We must secure the existence of our race and a future for white children.&quot; So to this day, if you're looking at a social media handle,&#10;5:48&#10;if you see the numbers 14 and 88, that's a good indicator that it's a white nationalist account.&#10;5:55&#10;There were ways to identify as either a white power or an antiracist skinhead,&#10;6:01&#10;and it typically involved the color of the laces in your boots and/or the color of your braces that you wore.&#10;6:09&#10;If you were a neo-Nazi, you have red laces, red braces.&#10;6:14&#10;Antiracist skinheads would sometimes wear white laces, although some people would say white laces are white pride,&#10;6:21&#10;so they'd wear yellow laces or anything but the red laces. And then of course beyond that,&#10;6:28&#10;obviously if you see someone with a swastika patch. A white power skinhead's typically going to have&#10;6:35&#10;outright white supremacist symbols all over their body and tattoos and/or patches on a jacket,&#10;6:41&#10;whereas the antiracist skinheads would also have antifascist patches and things like that.&#10;The Structure&#10;6:53&#10;Hammerskin Nation began in the Southern United States, specifically Dallas, Texas.&#10;7:00&#10;There was a skinhead gang in Dallas who took the crossed hammers from Pink Floyd &quot;The Wall,&quot;&#10;7:07&#10;and they put them in front of a Confederate flag, and it looked really cool.&#10;7:13&#10;And they just called themselves, &quot;We're the Hammerskins.&quot; This was right about the same time&#10;7:18&#10;that my gang in Milwaukee was starting. In 1988, one of the lead members&#10;7:24&#10;of the Confederate Hammerskins in Dallas, Texas, came up to Milwaukee, and he pitched the idea to us&#10;7:29&#10;that we become Northern Hammerskinheads. And the Hammerskins were born. Despite the hypocrisy of using a symbol from a band&#10;7:38&#10;that considers themselves very antifascist, we had no problem appropriating that crossed hammer logo.&#10;7:45&#10;And in our case, we put it on a field of US flag blue with 13 stars around the hammers&#10;7:53&#10;to signify the Northern Hammerskins. And very shortly afterwards&#10;7:58&#10;there were Northern Hammer chapters in Chicago and St. Paul and Detroit and Ohio.&#10;8:04&#10;And while this was happening, there were more Confederate Hammerskin groups popping up all over the South.&#10;8:11&#10;Now, down South there was a lot of crossover between the Ku Klux Klan and the Hammerskins.&#10;8:17&#10;There was a lot of old-school Klansmen who were very happy to see this wellspring of youth&#10;8:22&#10;coming into their movement. And they were OK to stomach the tattoos and the punk rock music in the process.&#10;8:30&#10;So there were a number of Confederate Hammerskinheads who were also members of Ku Klux Klan groups at the time.&#10;8:38&#10;When I was involved in Hammerskin Nation, there was really no centralized command.&#10;8:43&#10;Every group operated individually. It was really just, &quot;Well, we use the same symbol.&#10;8:49&#10;We're all racist antisemites, we're all violent drunks. We all love this music.&quot;&#10;8:54&#10;And those were the real unifying factors behind it. As I was leaving, people started having titles&#10;9:01&#10;and there started to be an attempt at having some sort of structure about how the group was going to work,&#10;9:08&#10;and to varying degrees that was followed as Hammerskin Nation spread to Europe, to Australia,&#10;9:16&#10;to New Zealand, even to Argentina and South Africa. In our group in Milwaukee,&#10;9:21&#10;we didn't have any kind of official structure. We didn't have titles, we had just unofficial&#10;9:27&#10;kind of organic hierarchy, the same way a wolf pack would. There are certainly alphas and they certainly run things,&#10;9:34&#10;but they're not voted, they don't have titles, that's just how it is. I wasn't the sole alpha leader. I was one of a number.&#10;9:43&#10;We weren't really conscious of this, it was just kind of how it went. If we were going to make a decision about something,&#10;9:50&#10;it would be me and the other alphas talking about it. And once we decided on whatever that was,&#10;9:57&#10;that's how it was. And everybody else could follow along or they could get the hell out.&#10;10:03&#10;That was basically how things worked. I don't know that Hammerskin Nation is as much of a thing as it used to be.&#10;10:10&#10;There are groups like the Proud Boys. At their peak, the Proud Boys&#10;10:15&#10;were like the modern manifestation of Hammerskin Nation, even though there was very significant differences,&#10;10:21&#10;namely that the Proud Boys' official leader was a Latino man,&#10;10:26&#10;and that would've never happened in the Hammerskin Nation. But other than that, they were a street-brawling,&#10;10:33&#10;kind of street-fighter-oriented group. And I think a lot of Hammerskin Nation people,&#10;10:40&#10;if they didn't grow out of it, which most of them do, honestly,&#10;10:45&#10;they may have found themselves affiliated with groups like the Proud Boys.&#10;The Recruitment&#10;10:54&#10;Recruiting a neo-Nazi was two steps, basically.&#10;11:00&#10;The first step was to get this kid to identify as white. Typically if — I have an archetype&#10;11:06&#10;called Joe Pissed-off White Kid. If I'm talking to Joe Pissed-off White Kid, the first thing I have to do&#10;11:12&#10;is convince him that he's a white man and that's how he should identify himself.&#10;11:17&#10;In the late '80s, most people racialized as white didn't identify themselves as white.&#10;11:25&#10;If I asked Joe who he was, he would say, &quot;I'm American. My family's Catholic.&quot;&#10;11:32&#10;You know, &quot;We're Democrats or Republicans,&quot; whatever. There's going to be all sorts of ways that they identify themselves other than racially.&#10;11:40&#10;So I have to stop him in his tracks and be like, &quot;Listen, white man, whether you like it or not, the enemies of our people identify you as white.&#10;11:48&#10;You don't have a choice about that. And the white race is under attack. If you don't join us and fight back,&#10;11:55&#10;we're all going to be wiped out.&quot; I have to get that across to this kid and he has to buy into it&#10;12:01&#10;before I can proceed to step two, which is to make him feel persecuted because he's white.&#10;12:07&#10;In the late '80s, it was much more difficult to do that than it is today. In the late '80s, we didn't have all this talk&#10;12:16&#10;of white privilege and white fragility and open talk saying, &quot;Well, everything wrong&#10;12:22&#10;with the world is basically white people's fault.&quot; Back in the '80s, it was just much more amorphous. We're all human beings,&#10;12:28&#10;we have all these different ways of identifying ourselves. It wasn't codified into racial groups like it is today.&#10;12:34&#10;So I had to concoct things about how white people are oppressed. And once I could get him to buy into that,&#10;12:41&#10;that he is white and he's oppressed because of it, now he's a white nationalist. Now he's a neo-Nazi.&#10;12:48&#10;Now he's ready to come up to our drinking hall, get drunk with us, and get beat up. That was the recruitment process&#10;12:55&#10;that we went through back in the day. If you're a teenager who has a history&#10;13:00&#10;of trauma in your family, if you're living in poverty, whatever you have going wrong,&#10;13:06&#10;the more things wrong you have, the more openings there are for neo-Nazi ideology to take hold.&#10;13:14&#10;And so that was how we recruited these kids, was we blamed all their problems on Jews.&#10;13:21&#10;And then they said, &quot;If you join us, we're going to fight back against that. And we're going to take our country back&#10;13:27&#10;and take our lands back, and you'll have all sorts of women crawling all over you. You'll be a white warrior. It'll be great.&quot;&#10;13:33&#10;If you were a new guy in the crew, you needed to prove yourself and prove that you could hang with us.&#10;13:39&#10;And the first way to do that would be by wrestling with us in our,&#10;13:44&#10;wherever we're drinking. If you can't handle that, which many people couldn't,&#10;13:50&#10;there were a lot of guys who would be there for one night, they'd get the snot knocked out of them, they're like, &quot;OK, I'm done with this.&quot;&#10;13:56&#10;They wouldn't come back. But for the guys who did come back and they're like, &quot;Yeah, let's do that again. That was fun,&quot;&#10;14:02&#10;like, OK, now we know we got a, this is a viable candidate here. And again, this was very organic&#10;14:08&#10;and it was very, it just happened. It wasn't like a policy, it wasn't some, &quot;Oh, hey, congratulations for surviving,&#10;14:16&#10;getting your a-- kicked last night. You're in.&quot; It was more like, &quot;OK, if you like that,&#10;14:21&#10;then let's do more of it. If you don't like it, get the hell out.&quot; The bulk of our recruits were men.&#10;14:28&#10;It's interesting now because I work at Parents for Peace, and we address all sorts of violent extremism.&#10;14:35&#10;And there is a specific type of violent extremism called incel nowadays, which are people who, men,&#10;14:42&#10;who call themselves involuntarily celibate, and they're angry because they don't have girlfriends.&#10;14:48&#10;In my day, as in today, the typical No. 1 complaint for Joe Pissed-off White Kid is he doesn't have a girlfriend&#10;14:57&#10;and he's angry about it. The thing was, was that there were women in our movement, but it was at least seven or eight to one&#10;15:06&#10;as far as men-to-women ratio went. So there weren't a lot of women to go around.&#10;15:11&#10;And typically the few women that were involved in the movement were all with the alpha guys.&#10;15:17&#10;So the alpha guys all had hot girlfriends, and Joe Pissed-off White Kid sees this and he's not doing the math,&#10;15:23&#10;and he's like, &quot;Well, that's what I want, so I'm going to do what this guy says because then I'll get that too.&quot;&#10;15:28&#10;Never mind that there's not a whole lot of women out there. I actually had one guy in my crew who dipped his toes in and left.&#10;15:35&#10;When I was interviewing him for my book, I said, &quot;Well, you know, why did you leave?&quot; And he's like, &quot;Dude, it's really hard to get laid&#10;15:41&#10;when you're a neo-Nazi. Chicks aren't into that, man. That's not attractive.&quot;&#10;15:48&#10;That was his big motivator to leave. He's like, &quot;I wanted girls, man, and they're not into that.&quot;&#10;15:53&#10;So that dynamic was really front and center in our recruiting and really in everything&#10;15:59&#10;that happened in that group.&#10;The Violence&#10;16:06&#10;Milwaukee, where I was from, is the most segregated city in the United States&#10;16:12&#10;for many years running. And what that means for neo-Nazi groups is it's very easy&#10;16:17&#10;to point at these severely depressed inner-city areas and go, &quot;See, that's what happens. That's what they do.&#10;16:25&#10;Those people create these neighborhoods.&quot; That's completely ignorant of the truth,&#10;16:33&#10;that all the ghettos in the United States were created by government policy.&#10;16:38&#10;And because of being segregated and sequestered to these incredibly hypercompressed inner-city areas,&#10;16:46&#10;that's what created those ghettos. It wasn't the people who lived there, but of course, no white nationalist is going to admit that.&#10;16:54&#10;No neo-Nazi is going to look at the true driving factors of poverty and addiction and crime in our country.&#10;17:01&#10;Instead, they're going to make a leap of logic and say it's the color of the skin&#10;17:07&#10;of the people who live there that create these conditions, not the actual policies that did.&#10;17:12&#10;We were terrified to go to the inner city of Milwaukee. We knew if we went there looking for trouble,&#10;17:18&#10;we'd probably get shot. So instead we went to a more posh part of town&#10;17:23&#10;where frat boys would hang out, or we went there looking for antiracist skinheads&#10;17:29&#10;because that's typically where they would hang out. And if we found them, we'd chase them down and beat them up.&#10;17:36&#10;And in Milwaukee we couldn't get a proper fight with them, so quite often we'd pile into vans&#10;17:42&#10;and drive out to Minneapolis or we'd drive down to Chicago, where there was a lot more antiracist skinheads&#10;17:48&#10;and we could count on a good fight with them. A lot of times if it was late and there weren't a lot of people on the street&#10;17:55&#10;and we saw a lone target of opportunity, which would basically be anyone that we didn't like,&#10;18:01&#10;which was everyone but us, but if it was a person of color or if it was someone that we thought was gay&#10;18:08&#10;or Jewish or a punk rocker, like, that was all the better. And there were all too many times&#10;18:14&#10;when we would jump people in those circumstances and just beat the h--- out of them. We called it a boot party.&#10;18:22&#10;If it was, like, 10 of us booting one guy, that was a boot party. We'd &quot;throw him a boot party.&quot;&#10;18:28&#10;And my stomach turns when I think about that violence that I've engaged in.&#10;18:34&#10;But that happened quite often. Just as often, we'd run into larger groups.&#10;18:42&#10;A lot of times we would go to bars where there was just a few of us, and we'd piss off somebody at the bar&#10;18:47&#10;and end up fighting the whole bar. That happened a lot as well. Our main targets for violence and our main rivals&#10;18:55&#10;were self-proclaimed antiracist skinheads. It's important to understand&#10;19:01&#10;that when the skinhead counterculture arose back in the '60s in the UK,&#10;19:08&#10;it was working-class kids, typically football hooligans. They'd go to soccer matches, they'd brawl the opposing team,&#10;19:16&#10;but it wasn't racist from the get-go. There were immigrants from Pakistan and the West Indies&#10;19:24&#10;who were all among the original skinheads. It wasn't until the '70s when the National Front,&#10;19:31&#10;an outright fascist group in England, saw the potential amongst the white skinheads&#10;19:37&#10;that the offshoot of racist skinheads arose. In the mid to late '80s&#10;19:42&#10;when the white power skinhead movement was kind of sweeping the United States,&#10;19:48&#10;there were more traditional skinheads who stood up and said,&#10;19:54&#10;&quot;Hey, that's not what skinhead's about.&quot; What we now know as antifa started back then&#10;20:01&#10;with groups called SHARP. It was Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice. So SHARPs were our favorite target as well.&#10;20:08&#10;And then there was also another group called Anti-Racist Action. I was actually at a neo-Nazi rally in Michigan&#10;20:16&#10;where about 50 of us brawled with, like, 500 antifascists.&#10;20:22&#10;And that was a real formulative moment in my path from just being a drunken hooligan&#10;20:28&#10;to being a militant racist. There was a time where we were walking down a street&#10;20:33&#10;in a posh area very late at night, and we saw an Afro American kid on his own,&#10;20:39&#10;and somebody just walked up to him and said, &quot;Oh, look, a N-bomb.&quot; And we all just swarmed on him&#10;20:46&#10;and just started punting him. That will haunt me to my grave.&#10;20:52&#10;And it should. It was a horrible thing to do. But that happened fairly often.&#10;20:59&#10;Even though we were really out looking for the baldies, if we didn't find the baldies&#10;21:05&#10;and someone else was in the way, they were the ones who were going to get it.&#10;21:10&#10;At the same time, many of the people that I beat up were just random white dudes&#10;21:16&#10;just in the wrong place at the wrong time. And I had no idea who they were.&#10;21:22&#10;I would try to rationalize it afterwards, that he was a race traitor and that's why he got beat up.&#10;21:27&#10;But it was really just that I was addicted to that violence the same way as I'm addicted to the hate,&#10;21:34&#10;and I needed a fix. I felt bad while I was in the movement. I had this inner voice going, &quot;What the hell are you doing?&#10;21:40&#10;This guy didn't do anything to you. You don't even know who this guy is.&quot; I didn't have the courage to even acknowledge that voice,&#10;21:47&#10;much less answer those questions.&#10;The Rallies&#10;21:54&#10;Aside from the fights and my bands, my main activity in the group was I did a lot of networking&#10;22:02&#10;with other white nationalist groups. So we'd get road trips organized,&#10;22:08&#10;and quite often also it'd involve rallies. When you're having a white power rally, you obviously want as many people as you can get there.&#10;22:15&#10;Therefore that's when you flex that network, and you're in Detroit and you're reaching out to the guys in Milwaukee&#10;22:21&#10;and Chicago and St. Paul and Columbus and be like, &quot;Hey, guys, everybody come to Michigan.&#10;22:26&#10;We're going to have this rally,&quot; so you can go from 10 to 50 people instead of just being out there with 10 people.&#10;22:33&#10;My personal role in a lot of these rallies was making the contacts, and I was the means that my crew was invited through.&#10;22:41&#10;They would contact me, and I would get my crew together and bring them out there. Really, the most transformative event I was involved in&#10;22:50&#10;was that neo-Nazi rally in Ann Arbor, Michigan. There was a group in Ann Arbor called the SS Action Group.&#10;22:58&#10;They were dressed up like the SS, and actually we thought they were pretty comical,&#10;23:03&#10;but we just, we liked that they were Nazis and we liked that they were shocking people&#10;23:08&#10;and scaring people. So we were happy to travel there from Milwaukee and join in on that rally.&#10;23:15&#10;I remember we packed about 50 people into a big 26-foot U-Haul and left from the guy's house,&#10;23:22&#10;which was in a really depressed part of Detroit. And as we got there, I could see the grin on the face of the leader guy.&#10;23:28&#10;They had motorcycle helmets on too, and they handed out these big shields that were made from stolen stop signs.&#10;23:35&#10;In the truck, a guy was going around with a big sack full of used batteries, and he's going around with it.&#10;23:40&#10;I'm like, &quot;What's that for?&quot; He's like, &quot;You can throw them at the reds.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Oh, OK, cool.&quot; So I got a couple pockets full of these batteries.&#10;23:47&#10;As soon as we arrive, the truck's being pelted with bricks and it's just thundering all over the place.&#10;23:54&#10;The back door opens and we see this huge roaring crowd of 500 people that are, I just remember, bloodthirsty.&#10;24:01&#10;My ironic thought was, like, &quot;Wow, they really hate us. Look how much they hate us.&quot;&#10;24:09&#10;So there's all this glass raining down on us and bricks coming at us from the crowd, and we're whipping the batteries at them&#10;24:15&#10;from behind our shields and, like, holding up the shield to keep bricks from hitting us. When the truck first opened, I was terrified,&#10;24:23&#10;but as soon as I poured out, the adrenaline started pumping, and I was like, &quot;All right, let's go. This is it.&quot;&#10;24:29&#10;And I was ready to just wade into that crowd and fight for the life of me until it was over.&#10;24:35&#10;This went on probably five, 10 minutes before the cops were like, &quot;All right, you guys get the hell out of here.&quot; And driving back from that rally,&#10;24:43&#10;I was just, like, basking in my own righteousness&#10;24:49&#10;and in the importance of our cause. I was like, &quot;That's what we're up against.&quot;&#10;24:54&#10;And it was very important that I had this visceral mob to experience&#10;25:00&#10;to be like, &quot;Yeah, that's it.&quot; That was one of the things that, when I would have my own misgivings and go, &quot;Hey, this is messed up, what we're doing,&quot;&#10;25:07&#10;I would remember that rally and remember the antifa and say, &quot;No, that's why we're right.&#10;25:13&#10;That's why we have to keep doing what we're doing.&quot;&#10;The Money&#10;25:21&#10;All of us had menial low-paying jobs, and we were pissed off about it.&#10;25:27&#10;And that was certainly a driver of the violence we were committing. As far as my group was concerned,&#10;25:33&#10;we self-funded everything, and it wasn't easy.&#10;25:38&#10;We would have meetings every week. We'd call it our hall. That cost $500 a month or so.&#10;25:44&#10;About 40 of us chipped in for that. And so we'd all chip in to pay the rent on our place.&#10;25:50&#10;When we'd go on these road trips, we'd all chip in for gas. We became involved with a group called the Church of the Creator&#10;25:57&#10;that published a monthly newspaper called Racial Loyalty, and they had a bit of money behind them,&#10;26:04&#10;and they would basically send you as many of these Racial Loyalty papers as you could handle.&#10;26:09&#10;And so we would get boxes and boxes and boxes of this racist newspaper, and we decided we're going to go into white neighborhoods&#10;26:17&#10;and we're going to put this newspaper in every mailbox or on every door. And we would have meetings every Sunday.&#10;26:23&#10;This is when we were starting to become more organized, and at these Sunday meetings,&#10;26:29&#10;the Church of the Creator had a book called &quot;The White Man's Bible,&quot; and we'd read — and mind you, the Church of the Creator&#10;26:34&#10;was vehemently atheist. We despised Christianity. It was really only called a church so we wouldn't have to pay taxes.&#10;26:41&#10;But we would read a bible passage, and then at the end of that we would go around the group and we'd say, &quot;Arno, what have you done&#10;26:48&#10;for the white race this week?&quot; And I would have to tell, &quot;I distributed 600 Racial Loyalties,&quot;&#10;26:55&#10;or &quot;I brought in three new members to our group.&quot; And if you did something, everybody would go, &quot;Yay!&quot;&#10;27:01&#10;You'd get a big cheer. And if they came around to you and they said, &quot;Arno, what have you done for the white race this week?&quot;&#10;27:07&#10;And I'd be like, &quot;Um, I got drunk. I got in a fight.&quot; Everybody would go, &quot;Boo!&quot;&#10;27:14&#10;You'd be shunned and shamed and really motivated to go out there and hand out those newspapers the next week.&#10;27:22&#10;The name Church of the Creator, when it says creator, it doesn't mean some supernatural force.&#10;27:30&#10;It sees the white race as the creator of all noble things in human history.&#10;27:38&#10;Their founder was an old man who made a bunch of money with some kind of can-opener patent in the '40s,&#10;27:46&#10;and then he parlayed that into real estate. To us, anybody who was making over minimum wage was rich,&#10;27:52&#10;but this guy was rich to us and he had, I don't know if he was a millionaire, multimillionaire, whatever,&#10;27:58&#10;but he had enough money to fund all these magazines or the newspapers being printed and distributed.&#10;28:04&#10;So, but again, he was doing that out of his pocket. In Otto, North Carolina, is where the Church of the Creator compound was.&#10;28:12&#10;And there was an actual church. As far as groups being involved in drug trafficking,&#10;28:18&#10;I'd hear things from, you know, &quot;The crews out West sell crystal meth.&quot; And later on in my current work,&#10;28:26&#10;I know of Ku Klux Klan members who were involved in meth trafficking. It wasn't something they wanted people to know about,&#10;28:32&#10;but it was going on. I know there were groups out West that were involved in drug trafficking.&#10;28:38&#10;And then, like, my group is, while we lived and breathed alcohol every single day, we openly shunned every other drug on earth&#10;28:46&#10;and we would've never openly done them, much less trafficked them. And so when we heard that crews out West&#10;28:53&#10;were selling crystal meth to fund their groups, we're like, &quot;They're not Hammerskins.&quot; And issues like that caused fractions&#10;29:02&#10;that led to the entire thing kind of splintering. I knew a man who was on methamphetamine and in the Klan.&#10;29:10&#10;They were all dealing to each other and to other white people in their communities.&#10;29:15&#10;It's interesting because one of the reasons we cited to not get involved with drugs was that&#10;29:20&#10;doing so inevitably connected you with nonwhites. The entire existence of a neo-Nazi&#10;29:27&#10;is rationalizing hypocrisy. You're doing it every single day.&#10;29:33&#10;My exit from the movement had a lot to do with that, because it was exhausting to constantly try to&#10;29:40&#10;reconcile your own hypocrisy.&#10;Neo-Nazi Music&#10;29:47&#10;I was active in the neo-Nazi movement from 1987 to 1994.&#10;29:53&#10;I was drawn into it through neo-Nazi music. There were neo-Nazi skinhead bands from the UK&#10;30:00&#10;that had found their way to the United States through bootleg tapes and through people&#10;30:06&#10;importing the records, actually, from Europe. It excited me because it was so repulsive to civil society.&#10;30:14&#10;I got into punk because I loved to lash out. I loved to repulse people. I loved to shock people.&#10;30:20&#10;It's important to understand that punk is a big tent, and it was in the 1980s as well.&#10;30:25&#10;There are all sorts of different ideologies within the punk scene, and some of them are actually very progressive&#10;30:32&#10;and actually very leftist and activist-oriented. But in my case, I saw punk as just smashing things&#10;30:41&#10;and shocking people, and nothing repulses people like a swastika.&#10;30:47&#10;The band I was in, as well as the gang I was in, operated out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.&#10;30:54&#10;I don't have a lick of musical talent. I can't sing properly, but I could scream really loud back then&#10;30:59&#10;and I could get people crazy onstage. I connected with&#10;31:06&#10;some other neo-Nazis from Toronto, Canada, and formed Centurion,&#10;31:12&#10;and Centurion was far and away the most successful white power band I was involved with.&#10;31:17&#10;We had sold 20,000 CDs within six months or so of releasing it.&#10;31:25&#10;And I actually still get hate mail from Centurion fans&#10;31:30&#10;who are just crushed that I am now a race traitor. And they somehow reconcile it still&#10;31:36&#10;that they're, &quot;Well, I still love Centurion. It's still a great band.&quot; Our imagery was incredibly hyperviolent,&#10;31:44&#10;incredibly hyperantisemitic and racist. And the more shocking it could be,&#10;31:51&#10;the better we liked it. And we thought that was awesome. We were like, &quot;Our music is so hateful and so violent&#10;31:59&#10;that our own audience tears itself apart when they hear it.&quot; The goal of the band was to&#10;32:07&#10;spread the ideology through music. And if you can get a recording of it as you're driving around in your car&#10;32:13&#10;with a cassette tape or later CDs, you can practice the ideology&#10;32:20&#10;throughout the day as you're going about your business. It's important to understand&#10;32:25&#10;that there is a real element of practice here in that to be a neo-Nazi,&#10;32:32&#10;you have to be in a constant state of fear. You have to be in a constant state of anger.&#10;32:38&#10;Neo-Nazis aren't, like, the most contemplative, meditative people. They need some sort of device&#10;32:44&#10;in order to practice the hate. And that's what that music was.&#10;32:49&#10;The people who attended our concerts, later on especially, were typically other affiliated white nationalist skinheads,&#10;32:58&#10;people who were already parts of skinhead gangs who were very familiar with the whole process of white power music.&#10;33:05&#10;They listened to it all the time. We were one of many, many white power bands out there.&#10;33:10&#10;Typically, if there was a potential recruit, they would get brought along to one of these concerts.&#10;33:17&#10;And it was a really powerful thing for a recruit to see.&#10;The Departure&#10;33:26&#10;The exhaustion came from all sorts of directions. There were times as I was committing acts of violence&#10;33:32&#10;that I had this inner voice saying, &quot;Why are you doing this? This is wrong.&quot; And I had to expend a lot of energy&#10;33:38&#10;to suppress that voice for seven years. It was exhausting to cut myself off from pop culture&#10;33:45&#10;that I took for granted my entire life. I've always been a huge TV, movies,&#10;33:51&#10;music, sports geek. And when you're a neo-Nazi, all of those things are forbidden.&#10;33:58&#10;They're all seen as Jewish propaganda to corrupt the will of the white man&#10;34:04&#10;to make him easier to oppress, whether you're talking about the Green Bay Packers or you're talking about Hollywood movies or a sitcom on TV.&#10;34:12&#10;So I would sneak away to watch a Packer game on Sundays knowing that if my guys caught me doing this,&#10;34:18&#10;they'd see me as complicit in the destruction of the white race. We talked about hypocrisy.&#10;34:24&#10;This is one of the daily aspects of hypocrisy that I have to do mental gymnastics to navigate around.&#10;34:32&#10;That takes a lot of energy. It's exhausting. The hate itself is exhausting from an addiction standpoint.&#10;34:40&#10;I'm an alcoholic. I drank profusely from the time I was 14 until I was 34.&#10;34:45&#10;I'm 54 now. So I drank for 20 years straight.&#10;34:50&#10;And especially toward the end, there were days where I was like, &quot;I just, I can't do this anymore. I'm so tired of it.&quot;&#10;34:57&#10;Hate's the same way. When you're going through your life in constant fear of everyone who doesn't look like you&#10;35:03&#10;and everyone who doesn't think like you, you get sick and tired of it. What was most exhausting though&#10;35:08&#10;was when people I claimed to hate treated me with kindness. And I was very fortunate that time and time again&#10;35:15&#10;throughout the seven-year span that I was in neo-Nazi hate groups, there were people like a Jewish boss, a lesbian supervisor,&#10;35:23&#10;Afro American, Latino, and Asian coworkers who treated me with kindness when I least deserved it,&#10;35:30&#10;but when I needed it most. And in doing so, they demonstrated for me, first of all,&#10;35:36&#10;how a human being should treat another human being. And second of all, a glimpse of the life I could be leading&#10;35:44&#10;if I just set all this nonsense ideology aside. That was the final straw and the exhaustion&#10;35:51&#10;that led me to 1994, when I was literally looking for an excuse to get out. For seven years of my life,&#10;35:57&#10;and the most formulative years of my life, from the time I was 16 until I was 23,&#10;36:03&#10;when a normal person would be going to college and deciding on a career&#10;36:08&#10;and what, you know, motivates them and what they love, I was just immersed in this hate and violence.&#10;36:14&#10;And within the movement I had developed a bit of status. I was a street fighter. I was a lead singer in this band.&#10;36:23&#10;I had groupies. I was a reverend in a racial holy war. I was one of the founding members of Hammerskin Nation.&#10;36:30&#10;In real life, I'm an alcoholic high-school dropout&#10;36:35&#10;who's too much of a drunk to pay his bills, has to keep moving back to Mom and Dad's house. Like, that was real life.&#10;36:42&#10;And it was an intimidating prospect to give up all of this, albeit false, status&#10;36:49&#10;and face the cruel reality of the hole I had dug for myself. And I needed something drastic to happen&#10;36:57&#10;in order to kind of push me over those last couple steps. What happened was, was early in 1994,&#10;37:05&#10;the mother of my daughter and I broke up, go figure, but hate and violence and alcohol is not a recipe&#10;37:11&#10;for a healthy relationship between a man and a woman. And I found myself a single parent to our 18-month-old daughter.&#10;37:19&#10;A couple months after that, after a concert my band had played, a second friend of mine was shot and killed&#10;37:25&#10;in a street fight. And by that time, I had lost count on how many friends had been incarcerated. So it finally hit me that if I didn't change my ways,&#10;37:34&#10;death or prison was going to take me from my daughter. And that was the excuse I needed to walk away from the movement.&#10;37:41&#10;When I first left, I had this sense of elation and this sense of freedom.&#10;37:46&#10;&quot;I can hang out with whoever I want to hang out with now. I can watch the Packers. I can watch 'Seinfeld.'&#10;37:52&#10;I can go to the movies without feeling like a race traitor.&quot; Just all those things felt amazing.&#10;37:58&#10;There weren't a whole lot of immediate consequences when I first left because by the time I left,&#10;38:04&#10;what was once a pretty large group of people had splintered into all these separate groups&#10;38:11&#10;that were very disparate and not talking to each other. So really by the time I left, the only people I hung out with were the guys in my band&#10;38:18&#10;and a couple other older guys who we called the Inner Circle. There were other guys who did a complete 180 like me&#10;38:24&#10;and were very outspoken against the movement. There were other guys who were still kind of like, yeah, they had some of the ideas, but for the most,&#10;38:32&#10;you know, they worked with a diverse group and they liked their coworkers.&#10;38:38&#10;They were able to get along with the rest of the people in the world and function as adults.&#10;38:44&#10;And so because most of the other guys were as burnt out as I was,&#10;38:49&#10;there wasn't a lot of blowback when I left. In my case, my deradicalization process&#10;38:57&#10;was the Midwest rave scene. Within a year and a half of leaving the hate group,&#10;39:03&#10;I found myself on the South Side of Chicago, 4 in the morning on Sunday, shaking my a-- to house music&#10;39:09&#10;with 3,000 people of every possible ethnicity, socioeconomic background, gender identity,&#10;39:16&#10;sexual orientation, and loving every minute of it. And that very much took over&#10;39:22&#10;and filled those needs of identity, purpose, and belonging. In the rave scene of the '90s,&#10;39:28&#10;their mantra was &quot;peace, love, unity, and respect.&quot;&#10;Mass Casualties&#10;39:38&#10;The street violence we engaged in back in the '80s and '90s&#10;39:43&#10;has morphed into mass-casualty violence today. On August 5th of 2012,&#10;39:50&#10;a neo-Nazi skinhead who was part of the gang that I was involved with&#10;39:56&#10;attacked the Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, and he ended up murdering seven people.&#10;40:01&#10;At the time, that was the worst attack by an affiliated white nationalist&#10;40:08&#10;since the 1960s when the Ku Klux Klan killed four little girls&#10;40:14&#10;in Alabama with a bomb that was meant for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Tragically, since August 5th, 2012,&#10;40:22&#10;there have been almost too many other white nationalist attacks to count,&#10;40:28&#10;including the attack at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where nine people were killed&#10;40:36&#10;by a young man who was radicalized into white nationalism online.&#10;40:42&#10;Going from there, there were attacks in El Paso, in Pittsburgh at the Tree of Life synagogue.&#10;40:49&#10;There was a horrible attack in Buffalo at a supermarket, and on and on.&#10;40:55&#10;I'm ashamed to not remember every specific one, but there have been so many&#10;41:01&#10;that it's hard to even keep track of them without a reference source. And I do believe that the frequency&#10;41:10&#10;and the scale of these attacks feed upon each other. Another kind of milestone&#10;41:16&#10;amongst these white nationalist attacks were the attacks in Norway&#10;41:22&#10;where he set a bomb in Oslo at the Labour Party headquarters that killed eight people&#10;41:28&#10;and then he drove to a youth camp on Utoya Island&#10;41:33&#10;and murdered 69 more people with firearms, most of whom were teenagers.&#10;41:39&#10;Today, these attacks are typically perpetrated by a quote, unquote, &quot;lone-wolf attacker.&quot;&#10;41:48&#10;It's usually the wallflowers in these groups, the guys that don't stand out,&#10;41:54&#10;the guys that, even though they're a part of the group, people don't really take them seriously, people don't pay a lot of attention to them.&#10;42:01&#10;Those are the guys, the affiliated guys, who are going to commit these types of atrocities.&#10;The Future&#10;42:12&#10;Unfortunately, I think today's society is a very ripe breeding ground&#10;42:19&#10;for race-based hate because race is so at the forefront&#10;42:28&#10;of all of our social discourse. When Joe Pissed-off White Kid is being branded as white at his school&#10;42:36&#10;and then told he has all this oppressor colonizer privilege, that's steps one and two to creating a white nationalist.&#10;42:42&#10;There's no middle ground for that kid. There's no room for him to say, &quot;You know what? I'm a human being.&#10;42:49&#10;Yeah, I might be racialized as white, and of course there's all sorts of social issues we need to talk about as far as that goes,&#10;42:56&#10;but that's not who I am.&quot; Until there's middle ground, neo-Nazi groups are going to go to town with this.&#10;43:02&#10;And I'm happy to see that more and more people understand that and they understand that discussion&#10;43:07&#10;and creating that middle ground is really how we fight racism. There's no social media platform&#10;43:14&#10;that is proofed against hate happening on it. And obviously neo-Nazi groups are well aware&#10;43:20&#10;that a screen is an amazing tool for them to connect and to recruit. It's going to have the potential&#10;43:26&#10;to be extremely harmful and extremely toxic. Of the existing platforms today of consequence,&#10;43:34&#10;there's 4chan, 8chan, there's all sorts of obscure things where people meet and have these kinds of discussions&#10;43:41&#10;and these ideologies propagate. But of the big ones, I think X is obviously first and foremost.&#10;43:49&#10;It's a hotbed for people to be openly racist and openly hateful.&#10;43:54&#10;I happen to think the most dangerous ones are the ones that are linked to video gaming.&#10;44:00&#10;Discord, actual platforms that are meant for gaming and getting together to,&#10;44:06&#10;&quot;Oh, what 'Call of Duty' map are we going to play?&quot; These are places where white nationalists, neo-Nazis,&#10;44:13&#10;and all sorts of other violent extremist ideologies can propagate and recruit,&#10;44:19&#10;and it's something that parents need to be very aware of. I'm a big fan of a man named Jonathan Haidt,&#10;44:26&#10;who is kind of at the forefront of getting kids to get off of social media and get back to the real world.&#10;44:34&#10;And I think that that's really the answer, not only to diminish the power of neo-Nazi groups,&#10;44:41&#10;but to diminish the power of these screens entirely and the hold they have on us as human beings.&#10;44:48&#10;We certainly have the power and the capacity to completely diminish the power&#10;44:55&#10;and even the existence of neo-Nazi groups as a whole. In the United States, it's not illegal to hold neo-Nazi beliefs,&#10;45:02&#10;and I'm actually a strong proponent of the First Amendment.&#10;45:07&#10;I don't believe that anti-hate-speech laws are effective, and this knowledge is based&#10;45:13&#10;on my experience working internationally. So I do think that free speech&#10;45:19&#10;is very much a pressure valve and that restricting speech&#10;45:24&#10;is not a effective means of diminishing hate in our society. I've seen countermeasures against hate by governments&#10;45:33&#10;that can be very effective. I've done a lot of work in Scandinavia, namely Denmark and Norway,&#10;45:40&#10;I've been to Sweden once and did some of the work there, but they spend a lot of money&#10;45:45&#10;in providing things for young people to do, like healthy things for young people to get together and do.&#10;45:54&#10;And I think we in the States could do a better job of that.&#10;The Aftermath&#10;46:05&#10;I'm very mindful of the harm that I did as a white nationalist.&#10;46:11&#10;Every day I'm mindful of that harm. And my method of accountability is to actively work&#10;46:19&#10;to get kids out of these hate groups nowadays, as well as to put a message out there,&#10;46:24&#10;as I'm doing on your show here, that it's not only possible to change your life around,&#10;46:30&#10;it's awesome to change your life around. Life is so much better and so much happier&#10;46:36&#10;when you're not burdened by hate every waking moment of your day. So everything I can do to put that message out into society,&#10;46:44&#10;I'm going to do that, and I do that all motivated by the harm that I committed in those days.&#10;46:52&#10;Nowadays I work for a group called Parents for Peace, where we coach families who have a radicalized loved one&#10;46:59&#10;into any form of violent extremism, and we coach them on how to best deal with that loved one,&#10;47:05&#10;to guide them to a healthier place. We also work directly with the radicalized individuals&#10;47:10&#10;to try to get them on a healthier path. And the way we do that is, ironically, the same way&#10;47:18&#10;that I recruited Joe Pissed-off White Kid back in the day, which is to find that underlying pain point&#10;47:24&#10;that's driving their affinity for this hateful ideology,&#10;47:30&#10;if it is not having a girlfriend, or they don't have a good job, or whatever. It's typically they don't feel they matter.&#10;47:38&#10;They don't feel that they're important. We help them develop a healthy sense of self-worth.&#10;47:43&#10;That's how deradicalization works, is getting them out of the movement or out of whatever group they're in is obviously step one.&#10;47:52&#10;It's hard to proceed beyond that if you don't take that step. But once that step is taken,&#10;47:57&#10;that's when the real work begins to address, &quot;What are the issues that drove me to this in the first place?&quot;&#10;48:04&#10;At Parents for Peace, we see violent extremism as a public health issue.&#10;48:09&#10;Certainly not a political issue. The same way alcoholism is a public health issue,&#10;48:14&#10;the same way domestic violence is, the same way HIV/AIDS is a public health issue.&#10;48:20&#10;If you look at HIV when it first came about in the '80s, it was extremely stigmatized.&#10;48:27&#10;It was also extremely politicized. &quot;You only got AIDS if you did horrible, sinful things.&quot;&#10;48:33&#10;&quot;It only happened to people who deserved it.&quot; Nowadays, thank God, we see HIV as the public health issue that it is.&#10;48:41&#10;It's something we all need to be concerned about. It's something anybody can get. We have to see it as something that we all need to be active in treating&#10;48:49&#10;and healing in our society. When you look at violent extremism in that same lens,&#10;48:54&#10;anyone can become a violent extremist. Anyone can be a victim of violent extremism. It's not restricted to any certain demographic.&#10;49:02&#10;I've written two books. My first book's called &quot;My Life After Hate.&quot; I'm actually in the process&#10;49:07&#10;of a new version of &quot;My Life After Hate,&quot; which is like a memoir about my time in the movement,&#10;49:13&#10;but also everything I've done over the past 15 years. My second book was called &quot;The Gift of Our Wounds.&quot;&#10;49:19&#10;I wrote that with Pardeep Singh Kaleka and Robin Gaby Fisher. Pardeep's father, Satwant,&#10;49:24&#10;was killed in the Sikh temple shooting of August 5th, 2012. Pardeep reached out to me&#10;49:30&#10;a couple months after the shooting. Him and I sat down and had dinner and became very dear friends and brothers to this day.&#10;49:37&#10;We've done a lot of work together, and we'll continue to do a lot of work together, and the book is basically our two intersecting stories.&#10;49:44&#10;Every day, I'm grateful to not be who I was 30 years ago. Every day, I experience joy just walking down the street.&#10;49:54&#10;We're shooting this in New York City, which is one of my favorite places on earth because I can walk down a block&#10;49:59&#10;and hear five different languages and see people from all over the world. And it's never lost on me&#10;50:06&#10;that back in the day I would've been terrified to walk down that same block. All people want to be happy. All people want to be safe.&#10;50:15&#10;All people just want to live their lives. They want to experience love. And when we can get that through our heads,&#10;50:22&#10;it makes our own lives so much more of a rewarding process, and it also enriches the world around us.&#10;Credits&#10;50:31&#10;Hi, I'm a producer on &quot;Authorized Account.&quot; If you enjoyed this video, then please subscribe and comment with more topics&#10;50:37&#10;that you'd like us to cover in this series." />

          <attvalue for="0" value="5 Ways To Identify Ultra-Processed Foods with Chris van Tulleken" />
          <attvalue for="1" value="Chris van Tulleken believes understanding how to identify ultra-processed foods will improve our health and well-being. Here he breaks down 5 ways to identify ultra-processed foods, from reading the ingredients to learning how additives affect your health. &#10;Order your copy of his book Ultra-Processed People here: https://bit.ly/41qxMRS&#10;&#10;It's not you, it's the food.&#10;&#10;We have entered a new 'age of eating' where most of our calories come from an entirely novel set of substances called Ultra-Processed Food, food which is industrially processed and designed and marketed to be addictive. But do we really know what it's doing to our bodies?&#10;&#10;Join Chris in his travels through the world of food science and a UPF diet to discover what's really going on. Find out why exercise and willpower can't save us, and what UPF is really doing to our bodies, our health, our weight, and the planet (hint: nothing good).&#10;&#10;For too long we've been told we just need to make different choices, when really we're living in a food environment that makes it nigh-on impossible. So this is a book about our rights. The right to know what we eat and what it does to our bodies and the right to good, affordable food.&#10;&#10;-------------------------------------------------------------------------&#10;&#10;Subscribe to the Penguin channel: &#10;http://po.st/SubscribePenguinYouTube&#10; &#10;Follow us here:&#10;&#10;Twitter |   / penguinukbooks  &#10;Website | http://www.penguin.co.uk&#10;Instagram |   / penguinukbooks  &#10;Facebook |   / penguinbooks  " />

          <attvalue for="4" value="Intro&#10;0:00&#10;- Poor diet is now the leading cause&#10;0:02&#10;of early death on planet Earth for human beings.&#10;0:04&#10;The science is now really clear&#10;0:06&#10;that the more ultra processed food you eat,&#10;0:08&#10;the higher your risk of early death,&#10;0:10&#10;cancer, heart attacks, strokes,&#10;0:13&#10;inflammatory diseases like Crohn's disease,&#10;0:16&#10;metabolic disease like Type 2 diabetes,&#10;0:19&#10;mental health problems like anxiety and depression.&#10;0:22&#10;And finally, and perhaps most worryingly of all, dementia.&#10;0:25&#10;(gentle music)&#10;0:27&#10;Hi, I'm Chris van Tulleken,&#10;0:29&#10;and these are &quot;5 Ways To Identify Ultra Processed Foods.&quot;&#10;Read the ingredients&#10;0:32&#10;Step one, read the ingredients.&#10;0:36&#10;You know, until I started writing this book&#10;0:37&#10;and started studying ultra processed food as a scientist,&#10;0:41&#10;I'd never read an ingredients list&#10;0:42&#10;and almost none of my colleagues who are scientists&#10;0:45&#10;and doctors had either.&#10;0:46&#10;The really important thing&#10;0:47&#10;about reading the ingredients lists&#10;0:49&#10;is that's how you can tell if a food is ultra processed.&#10;0:52&#10;So there's a very long formal scientific definition&#10;0:55&#10;of ultra processed food.&#10;0:56&#10;It goes over several pages&#10;0:58&#10;because it has to encompass this huge range&#10;1:01&#10;of products and all the different industrial technologies&#10;1:04&#10;that we use to make everything from a diet drink&#10;1:07&#10;to a margarine or a cake.&#10;1:10&#10;So the kind of additives you are gonna be looking for&#10;1:13&#10;is this very wide range of molecules,&#10;1:15&#10;things like emulsifiers, humectants, stabilisers,&#10;1:19&#10;gums like xanthan gum, or guar gum, or locus bean gum.&#10;1:23&#10;But there's also things that sound a bit harmless&#10;1:25&#10;like fruit concentrates or natural flavourings&#10;1:29&#10;or natural low calorie sweetness.&#10;1:31&#10;All of those are still signs of ultra processing.&#10;1:34&#10;And the thing you are worrying about&#10;1:36&#10;is partly those additives themselves.&#10;1:38&#10;We know that some of them are harmful&#10;1:40&#10;but those are also signs of lots and lots&#10;1:43&#10;of other processing and design technologies&#10;1:45&#10;that have gone into the foods&#10;1:47&#10;that drive excess consumption and health problems.&#10;1:50&#10;So step one is read the ingredients lists.&#10;Keep eating&#10;1:53&#10;Step two, keep on eating ultra processed food.&#10;1:57&#10;Now this sounds a bit counterintuitive, I know&#10;1:59&#10;but it's actually really important.&#10;2:00&#10;So as you are reading my book&#10;2:02&#10;or as you are consuming any information&#10;2:03&#10;about ultra processed food&#10;2:04&#10;including reading those ingredients lists,&#10;2:07&#10;just keep eating it for a while.&#10;2:08&#10;You're gonna start to realise that so much&#10;2:11&#10;of what you eat that you thought was healthy&#10;2:13&#10;is in fact ultra processed.&#10;2:15&#10;You'll notice flavourings in your breakfast cereal.&#10;2:17&#10;You'll notice that your supermarket bread&#10;2:19&#10;contains things called tartaric acid,&#10;2:21&#10;esters of mono and diglycerides of fatty acids.&#10;2:24&#10;This is also known as DATEM.&#10;2:26&#10;It's an emulsifier and it makes bread smooth and spongy.&#10;2:29&#10;You're gonna notice flavourings and emulsifiers&#10;2:31&#10;in all your condiments,&#10;2:33&#10;and you're gonna start to worry about it,&#10;2:34&#10;but don't stop eating yet.&#10;2:36&#10;So this technique of consuming something harmful&#10;2:39&#10;while you learn about it is really powerful.&#10;2:41&#10;It works very well for smoking.&#10;2:43&#10;So there's lots of evidence that if people keep smoking&#10;2:46&#10;whilst they learn about how bad smoking is,&#10;2:49&#10;they find it much, much easier to quit.&#10;2:51&#10;They gradually become disgusted with the cigarettes,&#10;2:54&#10;and the same's gonna happen to you&#10;2:55&#10;and your consumption of ultra processed food.&#10;2:57&#10;You'll start wanting it and enjoying it much, much less&#10;3:01&#10;as you learn about it.&#10;3:02&#10;You're gonna see these themes emerge as you eat it,&#10;3:04&#10;as you read the ingredients list,&#10;3:06&#10;because lots of ultra processed food&#10;3:07&#10;is made in exactly the same way.&#10;3:09&#10;The point of ultra processed food, remember,&#10;3:11&#10;is not about nourishing you,&#10;3:13&#10;it's invented for profits.&#10;3:15&#10;And a lot of the time,&#10;3:16&#10;it's taking the cheapest possible materials,&#10;3:19&#10;almost waste products from the rest of the food industry&#10;3:22&#10;and repurposing them and trying to get them&#10;3:24&#10;into the human food chain where they become really valuable.&#10;3:27&#10;They can be turned into addictive ultra processed foods,&#10;3:30&#10;and that makes far more money from them.&#10;3:32&#10;So you'll see on the ingredients list,&#10;3:33&#10;you start with a staple crop.&#10;3:35&#10;It's often grown for animal feed,&#10;3:37&#10;things like corn and soya,&#10;3:39&#10;and that crop is disassembled into its molecular parts.&#10;3:43&#10;It'll be some starchy powders, some flour,&#10;3:45&#10;some protein isolates,&#10;3:47&#10;and then you read about fats and oils,&#10;3:49&#10;and most crops can be broken down into those three things.&#10;3:52&#10;Those three things then can be reassembled&#10;3:54&#10;to generate almost any texture and mouth feel that you want.&#10;3:58&#10;You then add colorings, flavourings,&#10;4:01&#10;emulsifiers to glue the whole thing together&#10;4:03&#10;with some stabilisers, and you create the illusion of food.&#10;4:07&#10;It might be a reformed meat product,&#10;4:08&#10;it might be a vegan sausage,&#10;4:10&#10;it might be a cake, it might be a pizza.&#10;4:12&#10;But they're all broadly made in the same way,&#10;4:14&#10;and they all have the same basic taste.&#10;4:17&#10;So you are gonna start to notice&#10;4:18&#10;that whether you're eating this pudding or a pizza&#10;4:20&#10;that actually there are themes emerging&#10;4:22&#10;that you can start to detect in your mouth.&#10;4:24&#10;You're gonna notice the strange gumminess&#10;4:27&#10;of xanthan gum that isn't quite like dairy fat should be.&#10;4:31&#10;You're gonna notice that modified starches&#10;4:33&#10;in your yoghourt taste a bit weird.&#10;4:35&#10;You're gonna start to sense the difference&#10;4:36&#10;between artificial sweetness,&#10;4:38&#10;and you're gonna notice the strange umami taste&#10;4:40&#10;of flavour enhancers that are out of context.&#10;4:43&#10;So as you eat, you're gonna read the labels,&#10;4:45&#10;keep eating, and you're gonna notice.&#10;4:47&#10;The first thing you're gonna notice&#10;4:49&#10;is that it all tastes more or less the same.&#10;Dont worry too much&#10;4:51&#10;Step three, don't worry too much about fat, salt, and sugar.&#10;4:56&#10;If you are eating real food,&#10;4:59&#10;your body will actually take care&#10;5:00&#10;of your intake of those molecules pretty well.&#10;5:03&#10;Now, obviously, if you are an amazing cook&#10;5:06&#10;and you make nothing but cakes,&#10;5:08&#10;and you fry your own chicken&#10;5:09&#10;and you eat incredibly fatty, sugary food at home,&#10;5:13&#10;it is possible to gain weight.&#10;5:14&#10;But the modern obesity pandemic, the reason that I live&#10;5:17&#10;with overweight and many of you listening will as well&#10;5:20&#10;is because of ultra processed food, almost exclusively.&#10;5:23&#10;And this food interrupts our body's ability&#10;5:26&#10;to regulate our nutritional intake.&#10;5:29&#10;So let's think about fat for a start.&#10;5:31&#10;We started worrying in the 1980s&#10;5:32&#10;that it was fat that was making us all fat.&#10;5:35&#10;And so food companies started to replace the fat&#10;5:37&#10;in lots of their pre-packaged ultra processed products&#10;5:40&#10;with things like gums and starches.&#10;5:42&#10;They feel fatty in the mouth.&#10;5:44&#10;They don't deliver so many calories into the body.&#10;5:46&#10;What happened was we all kept gaining weight.&#10;5:48&#10;In fact, we started gaining weight faster.&#10;5:50&#10;In around 2000, we started worrying about sugars,&#10;5:53&#10;and so we started to replace lots of the sugars&#10;5:56&#10;in our food with artificial sweetness.&#10;5:58&#10;And this has happened now&#10;5:58&#10;on a very, very wide scale in the UK.&#10;6:01&#10;What's happened? Absolutely nothing.&#10;6:03&#10;Our weight hasn't fallen.&#10;6:04&#10;And in fact there's very little evidence&#10;6:06&#10;that replacing the sugar in our food&#10;6:08&#10;with artificial sweeteners really drives&#10;6:11&#10;a lot of weight loss.&#10;6:12&#10;And this is really weird.&#10;6:14&#10;It should be telling us that we don't understand something&#10;6:17&#10;about how the body works, that when we replace sugar&#10;6:20&#10;which is around 400 calories per hundred grammes&#10;6:23&#10;with something with zero calories,&#10;6:24&#10;it doesn't support weight loss.&#10;6:26&#10;This is a big clue that we fail to understand something&#10;6:29&#10;about the way our body takes in food.&#10;6:31&#10;When we experience a taste in our mouth,&#10;6:34&#10;it signals to our gut&#10;6:35&#10;that particular nutrition is on its way.&#10;6:38&#10;So umami tastes from the molecules like glutamate signal&#10;6:42&#10;that fermented, easily digestible protein and amino acids&#10;6:46&#10;are on their way into our body.&#10;6:48&#10;When we have sweet taste, it signals sugars on the way.&#10;6:50&#10;When we have fatty taste, it signals fat is on the way.&#10;6:53&#10;When we replace the sugar, the protein,&#10;6:56&#10;and the fat with synthetic molecules,&#10;6:58&#10;we create this mismatch where what we experience&#10;7:02&#10;in the mouth doesn't signal nutrition&#10;7:04&#10;that arrives, and that may be part&#10;7:06&#10;of the reason that we can't stop eating&#10;7:08&#10;because of this internal confusion where our body&#10;7:10&#10;is expecting nutrition to arrive, but it never comes.&#10;7:14&#10;When you eat homemade food that's cooked by yourself,&#10;7:16&#10;that food interacts very differently with the body.&#10;7:18&#10;It will make you feel full, and it won't be full&#10;7:21&#10;of those confusing taste sensations&#10;7:24&#10;that give a false signal to the body.&#10;7:26&#10;If you put Parmesan cheese in your homemade lasagna,&#10;7:29&#10;there's lots and lots of glutamate in that Parmesan cheese&#10;7:32&#10;but it's not telling your body a lie.&#10;7:34&#10;So when the glutamate is tasted as umami in the mouth,&#10;7:38&#10;protein arrives in the gut.&#10;7:39&#10;There's no mismatch.&#10;7:40&#10;When you put glutamate on a potato crisp,&#10;7:43&#10;there is a mismatch&#10;7:44&#10;and that's what drives excess consumption.&#10;7:46&#10;When we think of junk food,&#10;7:47&#10;we have this sort of list of ice cream, pizza,&#10;7:51&#10;fried chicken, cake that those things are junk&#10;7:55&#10;but actually pizza's a traditional food.&#10;7:58&#10;If you eat a sourdough pizza covered&#10;8:00&#10;in mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce&#10;8:01&#10;with a bit of basil, even a bit of meat on it,&#10;8:04&#10;it's a perfectly healthy meal.&#10;8:05&#10;It's nothing bad for you in it.&#10;8:07&#10;It's the frozen ultra processed fake pizza&#10;8:10&#10;that will drive weight gain.&#10;Learn how additives affect your health&#10;8:12&#10;Step four, start to learn how&#10;8:13&#10;the additives affect your health.&#10;8:15&#10;Loss of the physical&#10;8:17&#10;and chemical processing techniques&#10;8:19&#10;end up creating these foods that are very hard&#10;8:22&#10;to stop eating that do us harm.&#10;8:24&#10;But there's also the question of all these additives.&#10;8:26&#10;Now, in Europe and the UK,&#10;8:28&#10;most of the additives that we eat,&#10;8:29&#10;or all the additives we eat, pretty tightly regulated.&#10;8:32&#10;So they're all non-toxic.&#10;8:33&#10;They don't do us any harm at the moment we eat them.&#10;8:36&#10;But what we have not studied&#10;8:38&#10;in any detail at all is the effects of these additives&#10;8:41&#10;on the bugs that live inside us that keep us alive,&#10;8:44&#10;and the long-term effects on our metabolic health,&#10;8:47&#10;on our risk of obesity and our risk of Type 2 diabetes.&#10;8:51&#10;And we simply don't measure these things&#10;8:52&#10;because they're really, really hard to study.&#10;8:54&#10;We also don't study what happens when we combine lots&#10;8:57&#10;of additives together.&#10;8:58&#10;The science is still emerging then,&#10;9:01&#10;but it's pretty clear that the emulsifiers&#10;9:03&#10;that are nearly ubiquitous in so many different products,&#10;9:07&#10;from your soft drinks to the cakes, to the pizzas,&#10;9:10&#10;to the bread, that those emulsifiers act&#10;9:12&#10;a bit like detergents.&#10;9:14&#10;So emulsifier are chemicals that bind fat to water.&#10;9:18&#10;So you're washing up liquid is an emulsifier,&#10;9:20&#10;and it helps you scrub the fat,&#10;9:22&#10;the butter, that grease off your plates.&#10;9:24&#10;Emulsifiers in food do a similar thing,&#10;9:26&#10;and we think that they scrub out your gut,&#10;9:29&#10;cleaning out those friendly bacteria&#10;9:31&#10;that live there, cleaning out the vital mucus&#10;9:34&#10;that protects the delicate lining of the gut.&#10;9:36&#10;They promote and allow the growth&#10;9:39&#10;of bacteria that drive inflammation,&#10;9:41&#10;and they start making your gut leak.&#10;9:43&#10;So when your gut leaks bacteria,&#10;9:45&#10;the blood from your gut flows&#10;9:47&#10;from your gut carrying all the food that you've eaten,&#10;9:49&#10;the nutrients to your liver to be processed.&#10;9:52&#10;And if that blood contains bacteria as well,&#10;9:54&#10;those bacteria then cause liver inflammation.&#10;9:57&#10;We're pretty sure the ultra processed food&#10;9:58&#10;is linked to liver cancer and fatty liver disease,&#10;10:02&#10;and that may be because of the leaky gut&#10;10:04&#10;that those emulsifiers are causing.&#10;10:05&#10;The peculiar thing about emulsifiers&#10;10:07&#10;is there were lots of natural emulsifiers.&#10;10:09&#10;If you make a salad dressing, use mustard&#10;10:11&#10;as an emulsifier and it binds the oil to the vinegar.&#10;10:14&#10;You could also add egg yolk, it does the same thing.&#10;10:16&#10;Lots of the lesser thins are naturally occurring.&#10;10:18&#10;There is something about the emulsifiers&#10;10:20&#10;when they're extracted from natural sources&#10;10:23&#10;whether it's soya or egg&#10;10:25&#10;or whether they're synthetically made.&#10;10:27&#10;Something about the amount we're eating,&#10;10:29&#10;and the exact chemical composition changes&#10;10:31&#10;the way they interact with our body,&#10;10:33&#10;and the studies that show they affect&#10;10:35&#10;our health are published in really good journals&#10;10:37&#10;by very expert scientific teams.&#10;10:39&#10;There is a whole theory&#10;10:41&#10;of ultra processed food that almost all&#10;10:44&#10;of the harms are driven by emulsifiers.&#10;10:46&#10;So the emulsifiers do all these different things&#10;10:48&#10;but they're about creating an illusion of stability.&#10;10:53&#10;They create smoothness in the mouth,&#10;10:54&#10;and they bind ingredients together.&#10;What can you do about it&#10;10:57&#10;Step five, what can you do about it?&#10;11:00&#10;When it comes to what you personally can do,&#10;11:03&#10;I think there are two types of people.&#10;11:06&#10;There are people who are basically healthy&#10;11:08&#10;and just wanna cut down their intake.&#10;11:10&#10;And there's lots of things you can do&#10;11:12&#10;if you just wanna reduce the amount you eat.&#10;11:14&#10;So you can change, breakfast is a great place to start.&#10;11:17&#10;Most of us are in control of our breakfast.&#10;11:19&#10;You can just buy all the whole food equivalence&#10;11:22&#10;of all the ultra processed stuff you probably have&#10;11:24&#10;at the moment.&#10;11:24&#10;So you can replace your chocolate spreads with honey,&#10;11:26&#10;your ultra processed bread with real bread.&#10;11:28&#10;You can even bake your own bread,&#10;11:30&#10;replace your breakfast cereal&#10;11:31&#10;with homemade muesli or with porridge.&#10;11:33&#10;Lunch is trickier because almost all the food&#10;11:36&#10;that's around us is ultra processed.&#10;11:37&#10;Where I work, all the restaurants, the canteen,&#10;11:40&#10;it's all ultra processed.&#10;11:41&#10;So for my lunch, either I go out&#10;11:43&#10;and I can usually find some nuts&#10;11:45&#10;and a banana or an apple to eat for lunch,&#10;11:47&#10;or I try and prepare my own lunch.&#10;11:49&#10;I'm pretty badly organised.&#10;11:51&#10;I don't always manage it, and sometimes I go hungry&#10;11:53&#10;because I've decided that abstinence&#10;11:55&#10;from ultra processed food is the easiest thing for me.&#10;11:58&#10;It's an important kind of caveat here&#10;12:00&#10;which is that for many, many people in the UK&#10;12:03&#10;and around the world, ultra processed food&#10;12:05&#10;is the only available, affordable food.&#10;12:08&#10;And so we have to think about it really clearly&#10;12:10&#10;when we are thinking about policies,&#10;12:12&#10;and how we talk to other people.&#10;12:14&#10;We don't wanna stigmatise anyone for eating this food.&#10;12:16&#10;It's marketed to us very often as healthy.&#10;12:19&#10;It's all that's available as we move through the world,&#10;12:22&#10;and we don't want to increase anyone's stress&#10;12:25&#10;around the fact that lots of people have to eat it.&#10;12:28&#10;Eating real food is incredibly expensive,&#10;12:30&#10;not just in terms of buying it,&#10;12:32&#10;but you need equipment to cook it.&#10;12:34&#10;You need to pay for an energy bill to run that equipment.&#10;12:37&#10;You need freezer space to store it.&#10;12:38&#10;You need skills, you need knives, you need chopping boards.&#10;12:41&#10;So it's really, really much more expensive&#10;12:44&#10;to eat whole food.&#10;12:45&#10;If it's a choice you can make,&#10;12:46&#10;then that's what I suggest you do.&#10;12:48&#10;You shift your diet as much as possible to home cooking.&#10;12:52&#10;If people only take one thing away from my book&#10;12:54&#10;is to understand that particularly obesity&#10;12:57&#10;but all the diseases we associate with diet,&#10;13:00&#10;they're caused by predatory, transnational food corporations&#10;13:04&#10;turning our ill health into money.&#10;13:07&#10;The obesity is not caused by lack of willpower,&#10;13:09&#10;by failure of personal responsibility, by misunderstandings.&#10;13:13&#10;It's caused very deliberately&#10;13:15&#10;by companies who engineer food for us to overeat.&#10;13:18&#10;So we should stop shaming people who live&#10;13:20&#10;with obesity, who live with overweight,&#10;13:22&#10;and we should look to our government and our doctors&#10;13:24&#10;and our scientists to stop colluding&#10;13:27&#10;with the industry that is driving ill health.&#10;13:30&#10;There's a really close parallel&#10;13:32&#10;between the food industry and the tobacco industry.&#10;13:34&#10;Both of them make harmful addictive products.&#10;13:37&#10;The addictive products made by the food industry&#10;13:39&#10;are now the leading cause of death on planet Earth,&#10;13:42&#10;and the food industry needs regulation.&#10;13:44&#10;The final point is the food industry&#10;13:46&#10;are gonna say they want to change.&#10;13:47&#10;They want to make healthy foods,&#10;13:48&#10;that they're already making healthy foods.&#10;13:50&#10;They've reformulated foods.&#10;13:51&#10;They're gonna take sugar, and calories,&#10;13:52&#10;and salt and fat out,&#10;13:54&#10;all the food will still be ultra processed.&#10;13:56&#10;The only way they can stop making ultra processed food&#10;13:59&#10;is if they're forced to by governments.&#10;14:02&#10;If you can afford to cut down&#10;14:04&#10;or be abstinent from ultra processed food,&#10;14:06&#10;I really hope this advice has helped you.&#10;14:09&#10;If you can't, frankly your only choice&#10;14:11&#10;is to vote for change.&#10;14:13&#10;Thanks very much for watching.&#10;14:14&#10;You can buy my book, &quot;Ultra Processed People&quot;&#10;14:17&#10;in Hardback, ebook, or audiobook form&#10;14:19&#10;by clicking

democracy&#10;0:24&#10;across the world&#10;Welcome&#10;0:26&#10;thanks bianna professor jason stanley&#10;0:28&#10;thank you so much for joining us once&#10;0:30&#10;again&#10;0:31&#10;thank you so much for having me on well&#10;This is a pivotal moment&#10;0:33&#10;one of the reasons we called you&#10;0:35&#10;is that you have issued in recent weeks&#10;0:37&#10;a rather dire warning you are saying&#10;0:40&#10;that this is a pivotal moment in the&#10;0:42&#10;life of this country why do you say that&#10;0:45&#10;it's a pivotal moment because right now&#10;0:48&#10;we're seeing the legal mechanisms to&#10;0:51&#10;steal an election being formalized we're&#10;0:54&#10;seeing a system put in place that will&#10;0:57&#10;enable permanent minority rule&#10;1:00&#10;you you said that this is we are now in&#10;Voter integrity measures&#10;1:02&#10;the legal phase and you see historical&#10;1:05&#10;you see historical precedence for this&#10;1:07&#10;and you say it's almost like a a&#10;1:09&#10;conversation that has gone on for a&#10;1:11&#10;century between the you know americans&#10;1:15&#10;who have you know fascist solutions to&#10;1:18&#10;national problems and kind of the&#10;1:20&#10;european experience and you're saying&#10;1:22&#10;now this sort of two-way conversation&#10;1:24&#10;has resurgent is resurgent in the united&#10;1:26&#10;states through legal means many&#10;1:28&#10;conservatives many of the most prominent&#10;1:30&#10;conservatives sort of scoff at the&#10;1:32&#10;criticism of these what they call voter&#10;1:34&#10;integrity measures they say that some of&#10;1:37&#10;these measures that are being enacted in&#10;1:39&#10;may in the southern states and also&#10;1:41&#10;really in states around the country that&#10;1:43&#10;they're just trying to uh&#10;1:44&#10;implement voter integrity they're just&#10;1:46&#10;trying to give people confidence in our&#10;1:48&#10;election systems how do you respond to&#10;1:50&#10;that&#10;1:51&#10;always call&#10;1:53&#10;say about your opponent what you are&#10;1:55&#10;yourself doing that's what we're seeing&#10;1:57&#10;we're seeing massive projection we're&#10;2:00&#10;even seeing the fascist label being&#10;2:02&#10;thrown at uh at democrats right so&#10;2:06&#10;projection is a standard propaganda tool&#10;2:10&#10;it was one that uh goebbels and hitler&#10;2:12&#10;both explicitly recommend but it's not&#10;2:14&#10;just fascists who who engage in it but&#10;2:17&#10;we're seeing this massive projection&#10;2:19&#10;it's almost like you can tell what the&#10;2:22&#10;republicans are doing by what they say&#10;2:24&#10;the democrats are doing well we have to&#10;2:26&#10;interrogate this uh electoral integrity&#10;2:29&#10;what does that mean here well you have&#10;2:31&#10;to filter it through a kind of fascist&#10;2:34&#10;loyalist lens which means only the real&#10;2:37&#10;people of the country should get to&#10;2:39&#10;determine who the leaders are and so&#10;2:42&#10;it's not a really fair election if&#10;2:45&#10;everyone gets to vote and we're seeing&#10;2:48&#10;this again and again we're seeing&#10;2:49&#10;republicans including uh former&#10;2:51&#10;president trump say this if we don't&#10;2:53&#10;pass these laws everyone will vote we'll&#10;2:55&#10;see them we're seeing them being very&#10;2:57&#10;explicit uh so the idea is that a real&#10;3:00&#10;election is one where only you know the&#10;3:02&#10;real americans vote and this goes back&#10;3:05&#10;to uh this idea which is unfortunately&#10;3:10&#10;unless things radically change going to&#10;3:11&#10;be a reality of a uh permanent minority&#10;3:16&#10;running this country who in the eyes of&#10;3:18&#10;that minority are the real americans&#10;The appeal of racism&#10;3:22&#10;we already see this with the supreme&#10;3:23&#10;court&#10;3:24&#10;i mean the reality of the united states&#10;3:26&#10;supreme court is dominated by people&#10;3:28&#10;whose political ideologies do not match&#10;3:31&#10;those of the majority of the country in&#10;3:34&#10;any way um the question i have for you&#10;3:36&#10;though is what's appealing about this&#10;3:39&#10;to so many americans i mean you've made&#10;3:41&#10;the point like other other scholars have&#10;3:43&#10;made the point that the former president&#10;3:46&#10;and the people who have embraced him&#10;3:48&#10;even though he's no longer in office um&#10;3:51&#10;are sort of beset with this kind of&#10;3:53&#10;racial anxiety but what about these&#10;3:55&#10;other people what about these extremely&#10;3:57&#10;wealthy business people who presumably&#10;3:59&#10;have everything they could ever want&#10;4:01&#10;have massive influence in our society&#10;4:03&#10;whose companies are&#10;4:05&#10;fueled in in large part by the labor&#10;4:10&#10;and creativity of&#10;4:12&#10;many diverse people so what what's the&#10;4:15&#10;appeal&#10;4:16&#10;to some of these folks&#10;4:18&#10;power&#10;4:19&#10;simply put we can't forget that you know&#10;4:22&#10;people aren't racist by their nature uh&#10;4:24&#10;racism is something that the powerful&#10;4:26&#10;use to split the powerless uh this is&#10;4:30&#10;something an analysis that dates back to&#10;4:32&#10;w.e.b du bois's masterwork black&#10;4:34&#10;reconstruction which is still the best&#10;4:36&#10;work about uh the american ideology the&#10;4:40&#10;wealthy elite&#10;4:41&#10;faced a labor movement poor whites poor&#10;4:44&#10;blacks joining together in a labor&#10;4:46&#10;movement so racism was used to split&#10;4:48&#10;them apart racism is a mechanism of&#10;4:51&#10;power which is why you see many people&#10;4:53&#10;who aren't personally racist at all who&#10;4:55&#10;are simply want their taxes cut don't&#10;4:58&#10;want government regulation&#10;5:00&#10;exploiting any means they can supporting&#10;5:03&#10;any kind of mass panic be it a racial&#10;5:06&#10;panic be it a panic about covid to push&#10;5:10&#10;people to vote for an extremist uh an&#10;5:14&#10;extremist movement that's going to&#10;5:18&#10;pad their pockets and this is also&#10;5:20&#10;consonant with the past it's constant&#10;5:22&#10;with the past and fascist movements&#10;5:24&#10;across the world right now like in&#10;5:25&#10;hungary uh many business elites many for&#10;5:28&#10;particularly in the hydrocarbon business&#10;5:31&#10;uh&#10;5:32&#10;they recognize that their work is&#10;5:35&#10;against the public good&#10;5:37&#10;so they need to&#10;5:39&#10;they need to support a movement that&#10;5:41&#10;will split apart the public and and&#10;5:44&#10;result in a system that they can control&#10;5:47&#10;one of the points is that you just made&#10;5:48&#10;is that the contemporary american&#10;5:50&#10;fascist movement as you describe it is&#10;5:51&#10;led by oligarchical interests for whom&#10;5:54&#10;the public good is an impediment&#10;5:56&#10;such as those in the hydrocarbon&#10;5:58&#10;business as well as social political and&#10;6:00&#10;religious movements with roots in the in&#10;6:02&#10;the confederacy but the point the other&#10;6:04&#10;point you made is that you know this is&#10;6:05&#10;something we hear a lot of journalists&#10;6:08&#10;in washington dc say all the time is&#10;6:10&#10;that oh these guys in congress believe&#10;6:11&#10;these people in congress they know that&#10;6:13&#10;this is all you know made up so what's&#10;6:16&#10;in it for them like why&#10;6:17&#10;continue to maintain this mythology&#10;6:20&#10;especially when the person who advances&#10;6:22&#10;mythologies&#10;6:23&#10;the former president is no longer in&#10;6:25&#10;office&#10;6:26&#10;again power uh so let's look at the&#10;6:29&#10;people who are sort of&#10;6:31&#10;leading this charge this charge against&#10;6:33&#10;democracy uh&#10;6:35&#10;you know&#10;6:36&#10;ted cruz went to princeton and harvard&#10;6:39&#10;law uh josh hawley went to yale law jd&#10;6:43&#10;vance yale law these are the elites of&#10;6:45&#10;the elites these are not just the elites&#10;6:47&#10;they're the elites of the elites and&#10;6:49&#10;they know exactly what they're doing&#10;6:51&#10;when they foment conspiracy theories&#10;6:54&#10;about the election when they when they&#10;6:57&#10;talk about you know a totalitarian&#10;6:59&#10;government restricting our freedoms uh&#10;7:01&#10;with uh with covet policy um they know&#10;7:04&#10;exactly what they're doing what are they&#10;7:05&#10;doing they're trying to create the idea&#10;7:08&#10;that uh that the government the&#10;7:10&#10;concurrent government is authoritarian&#10;7:13&#10;uh that it's uh that it's corrupt that&#10;7:15&#10;it's destroying our children it's a&#10;7:17&#10;threat to our children this is what the&#10;7:18&#10;critical race theory stuff panic is&#10;7:20&#10;about uh and that you need a strong man&#10;7:23&#10;to protect the nation and your children&#10;7:25&#10;from this terrible threat look as long&#10;7:27&#10;as covid keeps raging you can keep the&#10;7:30&#10;politics of fear and panic alive and you&#10;7:33&#10;keep the politics of fear and panic&#10;7:35&#10;alive people will set aside democracy&#10;7:38&#10;people will say i just want to be&#10;7:40&#10;protected from this they're not going to&#10;7:42&#10;be able to think reasonably and&#10;7:43&#10;rationally you need to present your&#10;7:45&#10;enemy your internal enemy so fascist&#10;7:47&#10;politics works by saying there's a&#10;7:49&#10;nefarious internal enemy who's working&#10;7:52&#10;in tandem with the minorities to&#10;7:54&#10;overthrow the government and control&#10;7:56&#10;your children and so what you do is you&#10;7:59&#10;you you you&#10;8:01&#10;make society complete you you put people&#10;8:04&#10;in an incredibly anxious and fearful&#10;8:07&#10;state where they're looking for some&#10;8:08&#10;kind of simple explanation and a&#10;8:10&#10;conspiracy theory is a kind of very&#10;8:13&#10;simple explanation that people can grab&#10;8:15&#10;onto uh they're controlling the schools&#10;8:17&#10;we're hearing a lot about the schools&#10;8:19&#10;and there are very real worries here i&#10;8:21&#10;mean we all want our children back in&#10;8:23&#10;school and we want that dealt with but&#10;8:26&#10;you know the the way to do with that to&#10;8:28&#10;deal with that is to address the covet&#10;8:30&#10;crisis but no instead many republicans&#10;8:34&#10;are leaning into the covet crisis&#10;8:36&#10;because&#10;8:37&#10;they want to make it worse they want to&#10;8:38&#10;say you know just like q and on it's an&#10;8:41&#10;extension of q anon you want to say the&#10;8:43&#10;vaccines are out to poison you you know&#10;8:46&#10;all of these things by hypocrites who&#10;8:48&#10;themselves are getting vaccinated and&#10;8:50&#10;boosted so&#10;8:52&#10;so this kind of&#10;8:53&#10;constant conspiracy thinking the&#10;8:55&#10;internal enemy&#10;8:56&#10;wink wink is there they're trying to&#10;8:59&#10;manipulate you deviously uh this enables&#10;9:03&#10;people to to say you need a&#10;9:06&#10;non-democratic solution so you've talked&#10;9:08&#10;about&#10;9:09&#10;the&#10;9:11&#10;the&#10;9:12&#10;you've talked about sort of how&#10;9:13&#10;restricting voter access plays into&#10;9:16&#10;these kind of fascist techniques that&#10;9:18&#10;you have described but one of the things&#10;9:20&#10;that we're also seeing is this kind of&#10;9:22&#10;hyper-masculine&#10;9:24&#10;uh rhetoric&#10;9:25&#10;uh and what seems to kind of go along&#10;9:28&#10;with that is as a call toward female&#10;9:30&#10;submissiveness even though you know some&#10;9:32&#10;of the prime figures are women in this&#10;9:36&#10;movement it's just sort of a kind of a&#10;9:37&#10;call to kind of a 1950s&#10;9:40&#10;family style um&#10;9:42&#10;how do you do you see what i'm saying&#10;9:44&#10;and how do you understand that let's&#10;9:46&#10;begin with the attack on abortion right&#10;9:47&#10;now the uh which is the majority of&#10;9:50&#10;americans uh do reject the repeal of roe&#10;9:53&#10;versus wade they want to keep roe vs&#10;9:55&#10;wade but we are facing a future in which&#10;9:58&#10;abortion rights are going to be severe&#10;10:00&#10;severely curtailed and let's be clear&#10;10:02&#10;there are plenty of social conservatives&#10;10:03&#10;who are not fascists at all we're not&#10;10:05&#10;authoritarians or autocrats who want to&#10;10:08&#10;participate in the democratic process&#10;10:10&#10;who are against abortion&#10;10:12&#10;but&#10;10:12&#10;what we find here is a kind of classic&#10;10:15&#10;macho strutting&#10;10:17&#10;autocrat in the in the figure of trump&#10;10:19&#10;who obviously has no social conservative&#10;10:23&#10;history or morals but he's appealing to&#10;10:25&#10;social conservatives he's saying i'm&#10;10:27&#10;going to be your man now&#10;10:29&#10;that's going to draw social&#10;10:31&#10;conservatives to him&#10;10:33&#10;but it also feeds into a general macho&#10;10:37&#10;masculinist ideology where the men&#10;10:39&#10;control the women&#10;10:40&#10;so&#10;10:41&#10;it both appeals to social conservatives&#10;10:44&#10;because of overlap of interests even&#10;10:46&#10;though many social conservatives would&#10;10:48&#10;vastly prefer this to be a democratic&#10;10:50&#10;process and it also feeds into the idea&#10;10:54&#10;that men are around to protect women and&#10;10:57&#10;women need to rely on meth&#10;The racial panic idea&#10;11:00&#10;and what about the racial panic idea&#10;11:02&#10;because you know we're seeing this kind&#10;11:03&#10;of play out as a debate within the&#10;11:06&#10;democratic party for example um&#10;11:08&#10;they want to move forward with the&#10;11:11&#10;programs and the policies for which they&#10;11:13&#10;were elected and at the same time you're&#10;11:14&#10;seeing this kind of furious backlash not&#10;11:17&#10;just from&#10;11:18&#10;you know conservative opponents who are&#10;11:20&#10;attracted to the ideologies that we're&#10;11:23&#10;talking about but you're also seeing it&#10;11:24&#10;within the the party itself the&#10;11:26&#10;democratic party for people say we know&#10;11:28&#10;that this is stimulating a backlash so&#10;11:29&#10;the best thing to do is to tamp it down&#10;11:32&#10;not continue to stoke these racial&#10;11:34&#10;anxieties you know back off in essence i&#10;11:36&#10;mean so what's your take on how that&#10;11:39&#10;kind of tension is to be addressed so we&#10;11:42&#10;have enormous racial disparities in our&#10;11:44&#10;country i don't need to tell this&#10;11:45&#10;audience uh enormous and persistent&#10;11:48&#10;racial disparities uh the uh racial&#10;11:51&#10;wealth crap is massive uh and continues&#10;11:54&#10;to be and what we have as a result and&#10;11:57&#10;we have a massive police system we put&#10;11:59&#10;our money i'm not advocating to defend&#10;12:01&#10;the police i'm just stating facts we put&#10;12:04&#10;an enormous amount of money into&#10;12:06&#10;militarized police to police very poor&#10;12:09&#10;populations uh both white and black and&#10;12:12&#10;to uh to address social problems that&#10;12:15&#10;way what will result repeatedly is uh&#10;12:18&#10;uprisings against that and those&#10;12:20&#10;uprisings will be then used to to&#10;12:25&#10;to justify a fascist law and order&#10;12:28&#10;crackdown and this is analogous to what&#10;12:30&#10;happened in germany when there was mass&#10;12:32&#10;left-wing violence on the street and&#10;12:34&#10;this was used to justify a fascist&#10;12:37&#10;crackdown&#10;12:38&#10;um so uh so what's to be done with this&#10;12:41&#10;i think americans i think americans uh&#10;12:44&#10;get that there's uh that there are many&#10;12:48&#10;people who are impoverished white and&#10;12:50&#10;black and they get that the government&#10;12:53&#10;should be doing something about that&#10;12:54&#10;it's it's not just a racial issue but if&#10;12:57&#10;we focus on the elites who are&#10;13:00&#10;preventing us from achieving a kind of&#10;13:02&#10;economic equality and a kind of fairness&#10;13:05&#10;in our justice system and fairness in&#10;13:07&#10;our educational system that will cost&#10;13:09&#10;money to do if we focus on the fact that&#10;13:12&#10;it's elites who are trying to&#10;13:14&#10;split us apart maybe we can make some&#10;13:16&#10;traction here i i want to loot back to&#10;13:19&#10;where we started this conversation which&#10;13:20&#10;is you think this is a&#10;13:23&#10;an extremely critical moment so the&#10;13:26&#10;question is what is to be done&#10;13:29&#10;well i'm not i'm better at analysis than&#10;13:32&#10;i haven't solutions unfortunately but&#10;13:34&#10;here's what i think democracies come and&#10;13:37&#10;go&#10;13:38&#10;american democracy&#10;13:39&#10;uh&#10;13:40&#10;it was fragile to begin with because&#10;13:42&#10;we're a racial democracy we have the&#10;13:44&#10;world's highest incarceration rate uh&#10;13:47&#10;and you know a country with the world's&#10;13:49&#10;highest incarceration rate well you got&#10;13:51&#10;to wonder how much that's a democracy&#10;13:53&#10;already&#10;13:54&#10;but we there's a principle of democracy&#10;13:56&#10;one person one vote that principle&#10;14:00&#10;should be bipartisan uh even though we&#10;14:02&#10;are flawed structurally and&#10;14:04&#10;ideologically and historically we've&#10;14:06&#10;also been a model for that principle the&#10;14:08&#10;civil rights movement is held up as a&#10;14:10&#10;model all across the world a model of&#10;14:13&#10;democratic bravery uh when if american&#10;14:16&#10;democracy falls and american democracy&#10;14:18&#10;might well fall i mean you know it's&#10;14:20&#10;never been it's always been flawed uh&#10;14:23&#10;but we might take an enormous step back&#10;14:25&#10;like like post reconstruction might take&#10;14:28&#10;many decades to recover from we might&#10;14:30&#10;become an autocratic authoritarian&#10;14:32&#10;one-party state but if we do democracy&#10;14:36&#10;across the world is in peril we have a&#10;14:38&#10;responsibility not to invade other&#10;14:40&#10;countries and make them democratic&#10;14:42&#10;that's not a way to do it&#10;14:44&#10;our responsibility is to represent the&#10;14:48&#10;push towards democracy and i was&#10;14:50&#10;speaking on polish media on monday&#10;14:53&#10;and the the broadcaster said to me in a&#10;14:55&#10;very worried tone trump's not going to&#10;14:57&#10;win again is he because if he wins&#10;15:00&#10;polish democracy the hope that we can&#10;15:03&#10;retain polish democracy is simply gone&#10;15:05&#10;that's not just in poland that's all&#10;15:07&#10;over the world um let's stop with the&#10;15:10&#10;stupid wars trump was right about that&#10;15:12&#10;let's not invade countries but let's by&#10;15:15&#10;example represent the striving for one&#10;15:18&#10;person one vote and you know if we can&#10;15:21&#10;align across that along that principle&#10;15:24&#10;and what we represent for the world and&#10;15:26&#10;what makes us great which is the&#10;15:27&#10;striving for that&#10;15:29&#10;maybe we can fight this&#10;The mob attack on the Capitol&#10;15:31&#10;so if we let you go we are speaking on&#10;15:33&#10;the one year anniversary of the mob&#10;15:35&#10;attack on the capitol&#10;15:37&#10;um there are a number of strains coming&#10;15:41&#10;together today i mean on the one hand&#10;15:42&#10;there are efforts to commemorate this in&#10;15:44&#10;a very serious and solemn fashion on the&#10;15:46&#10;other hand that there are people who are&#10;15:47&#10;making a determined effort to ignore&#10;15:49&#10;this and to act like it never happened&#10;15:52&#10;or to say that the country should move&#10;15:53&#10;on that even these efforts to&#10;15:55&#10;acknowledge it are divisive as we&#10;15:57&#10;reflect on this moment&#10;16:00&#10;what do you see do you see&#10;16:02&#10;any sense that&#10;16:04&#10;others share your alarm&#10;16:06&#10;at the current moment that this that&#10;16:08&#10;this slide toward authoritarianism&#10;16:10&#10;toward fascism is being addressed what&#10;16:12&#10;what do you see&#10;16:15&#10;so so you've left a crucial third party&#10;16:17&#10;out and that's the many many republican&#10;16:20&#10;politicians who are trying and media&#10;16:22&#10;personalities who are trying not neither&#10;16:24&#10;to ignore or to seek accountability but&#10;16:26&#10;to glorify we have a political elite&#10;16:29&#10;that's openly pushing&#10;16:31&#10;for for people to arm themselves&#10;16:34&#10;to steal an election to arm themselves&#10;16:38&#10;to&#10;16:39&#10;to prove to protect a minority a&#10;16:42&#10;permanent one-party state uh for any&#10;16:45&#10;scholar so my basic area is philosophy&#10;16:48&#10;of language and the study of violent&#10;16:50&#10;rhetoric what we are seeing is we are&#10;16:52&#10;seeing uh&#10;16:55&#10;justifications&#10;16:56&#10;for violence uh 24 7. where kyle&#10;17:00&#10;rittenhouse&#10;17:01&#10;was paraded in front of multiple&#10;17:04&#10;republican audiences at the turning&#10;17:06&#10;points usa conference they had a song&#10;17:08&#10;about him he came out they chanted kyle&#10;17:10&#10;kyle kyle what is this saying to 17 year&#10;17:13&#10;olds across the country it's it's&#10;17:15&#10;challenging their masculinity it's&#10;17:17&#10;saying a real man goes into the capital&#10;17:20&#10;a real man gets a gun a real man uh&#10;17:24&#10;stands and fights for his leader donald&#10;17:27&#10;trump it's challenging people's&#10;17:28&#10;masculinity what we are seeing is a&#10;17:30&#10;glorification of january 6th and a&#10;17:34&#10;glorification of kyle rittenhouse&#10;17:36&#10;they're stoking a large-scale violent&#10;17:40&#10;militia movement of&#10;17:42&#10;not just organized militias but&#10;17:44&#10;individual actors like kyle rittenhouse&#10;17:46&#10;and they're challenging them via their&#10;17:48&#10;masculinity um so&#10;17:50&#10;that's what the legacy of january 6th is&#10;17:53&#10;they're being transformed into heroes&#10;17:55&#10;and we need to stop that process as soon&#10;17:57&#10;as possible and every republican&#10;17:59&#10;politician needs to disassociate&#10;18:01&#10;themselves from the mass attempt to&#10;18:04&#10;create&#10;18:05&#10;and stoke eventual political violence&#10;18:08&#10;professor jason stanley thank you so&#10;18:10&#10;much for talking with us thank you so&#10;18:12&#10;much&#10;18:16&#10;[Music]&#10;18:23&#10;[Music]&#10;18:27&#10;you" />

Nearly every religion has ancient stories of sibling rivalries. Unfortunately, we humans seem to delight in seeing others fail.&#10;&#10;But according to Luke Burgis, envy often leads to misery. &#10;&#10;The strange mystery of desire is that we look to others to figure out what it is that we want, and then we adopt another’s desires as our own. Occasionally, though, rivalries can produce good outcomes, like the rivalry between Enzo Ferrari and Ferruccio Lamborghini. &#10;&#10;Read the video transcript: https://bigthink.com/videos/rivalries/&#10;&#10;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &#10;&#10;About Luke Burgis:&#10;&#10;Luke Burgis has co-created and led four companies in wellness, consumer products, and technology.

          <attvalue for="4" value="0:00&#10;- We're more rivalrous than we like to believe.&#10;0:03&#10;(violin music begins)&#10;0:04&#10;Human beings tend towards rivalry.&#10;0:09&#10;There's a reason why there's five stories of sibling rivalry&#10;0:12&#10;in the book of Genesis alone,&#10;0:16&#10;and almost every other culture in the world&#10;0:18&#10;also has stories of sibling rivalry.&#10;0:23&#10;It seems that there is some principle of rivalry&#10;0:26&#10;that has been with us since the beginning of time.&#10;0:29&#10;- You broke my heart.&#10;0:31&#10;- We take delight in seeing somebody else fail.&#10;0:36&#10;- Long live the king.&#10;0:38&#10;- And that's something I think&#10;0:39&#10;we should all be hyper aware of,&#10;0:43&#10;because envy always leads to misery.&#10;0:48&#10;I'm Luke Burgis, founder of Fourth Wall Ventures&#10;0:51&#10;and author of the book&#10;0:52&#10;&quot;Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life.&quot;&#10;1:02&#10;So in my mid twenties, I noticed this strange paradox,&#10;1:07&#10;if nobody else wanted the thing that I wanted,&#10;1:12&#10;I began to question whether that thing&#10;1:14&#10;was &quot;wantable&quot; or not,&#10;1:15&#10;whether it was desirable.&#10;1:19&#10;I noticed it in dating,&#10;1:22&#10;in business,&#10;1:24&#10;even in the choices of food&#10;1:26&#10;that I would order in restaurants.&#10;1:28&#10;There was this strange mystery of desire&#10;1:31&#10;that I hadn't put my finger on.&#10;1:35&#10;So I spent some time reading and reflecting&#10;1:38&#10;and stumbled on the ideas&#10;1:40&#10;of the great French thinker, René Girard.&#10;1:44&#10;Girard said that man is the creature&#10;1:47&#10;that doesn't know what to desire.&#10;1:51&#10;So we look to models,&#10;1:53&#10;people that help show us what is worth wanting.&#10;1:59&#10;In other words, desire is mimetic.&#10;2:03&#10;Mimetic desire means that we're adopting&#10;2:05&#10;another person's desire as our own.&#10;2:08&#10;Usually without even realizing that we're doing it.&#10;2:12&#10;That creates real problems because&#10;2:15&#10;we're now inherently competing for the same thing.&#10;2:21&#10;So we have a scarcity mindset,&#10;2:24&#10;and mimetic desire leads quite naturally&#10;2:27&#10;to viewing the person that's modeling&#10;2:30&#10;the desire for that object as a rival&#10;2:33&#10;or as an obstacle to us getting what we want.&#10;2:39&#10;But when I speak of rivalry,&#10;2:41&#10;I don't always mean in the negative sense,&#10;2:43&#10;and neither did Girard.&#10;2:45&#10;Rivalries can be a very positive thing.&#10;2:48&#10;- We had been rivals, we hated each other.&#10;2:51&#10;And so, Larry Bird made me a better player,&#10;2:53&#10;and I think I made him a better player&#10;2:55&#10;and together we made the NBA better.&#10;2:58&#10;- They can get the best out of us&#10;2:59&#10;when we have professional rivalries.&#10;3:03&#10;This might be a time for me to tell the story&#10;3:05&#10;of Lamborghini and Ferrari.&#10;3:06&#10;I'm not sure if we have time for that or not.&#10;3:09&#10;(piano music fades out)&#10;3:12&#10;Ferruccio Lamborghini was a very successful&#10;3:15&#10;tractor manufacturer in Italy.&#10;3:18&#10;He owned a Ferrari and the clutch kept breaking&#10;3:22&#10;and he went to Enzo Ferrari to complain about the clutch&#10;3:28&#10;and eventually got into the car business&#10;3:30&#10;because of a rivalry with Enzo Ferrari,&#10;3:35&#10;and ended up making a beautiful, powerful sports car.&#10;3:39&#10;And their sales are better than they've ever been.&#10;3:42&#10;So rivalry can push us to do things&#10;3:44&#10;that we may have not done to innovate, to create things,&#10;3:50&#10;but rivalry can also turn negative&#10;3:53&#10;when we cross a certain boundary.&#10;3:58&#10;The problem with mimetic rivalry&#10;4:00&#10;is that we begin to see others as enemies.&#10;4:06&#10;If this other person is in my way,&#10;4:10&#10;if they're a constant thorn in my side,&#10;4:13&#10;the other solution is to eliminate them in some way.&#10;4:17&#10;That could mean they're fired.&#10;4:20&#10;It could mean canceling them.&#10;4:23&#10;That could mean physical violence.&#10;4:26&#10;When people are locked in a mimetic rivalry,&#10;4:29&#10;it's an infinite game.&#10;4:31&#10;There's no way to resolve the one-upping.&#10;4:36&#10;And that's because there's very little awareness in society&#10;4:39&#10;of the mimetic mechanism.&#10;4:42&#10;So the first step to breaking out of a rivalry&#10;4:44&#10;is simply to be aware that you're in one.&#10;4:48&#10;If we're not aware that we're rivalrous,&#10;4:50&#10;that this is a zero sum game that isn't going to end well,&#10;4:54&#10;there's really no hope of breaking out of it,&#10;4:56&#10;except for some kind of outside intervention.&#10;5:01&#10;Lamborghini realized that that rivalry with Ferrari&#10;5:04&#10;could take him to places he didn't want to go.&#10;5:08&#10;Everybody at the company wanted him&#10;5:10&#10;to enter the racing business.&#10;5:13&#10;He could spend the rest of his days&#10;5:14&#10;consumed with constantly one upping&#10;5:18&#10;this Titan of auto manufacturing.&#10;5:22&#10;He took a step back and he saw that he didn't want&#10;5:26&#10;the rivalry to last.&#10;5:29&#10;He wanted to be his own person&#10;5:31&#10;and not constantly be tethering his ideas of success&#10;5:35&#10;to Enzo Ferrari.&#10;5:37&#10;So when we realize that our desires don't originate&#10;5:41&#10;with us, it frees us up.&#10;5:45&#10;As humans, we have agency,&#10;5:49&#10;we have freedom to rise above that base mimetic nature,&#10;5:54&#10;and to choose the way that we're going to respond.&#10;5:58&#10;At some level,&#10;6:00&#10;people have to do the hard work of renunciation.&#10;6:03&#10;That's not a word that we use very often these days,&#10;6:07&#10;but it's renouncing and overriding our mimetic impulse&#10;6:11&#10;to constantly hit back, to constantly seek that next thing.&#10;6:17&#10;Ferruccio Lamborghini decided to renounce the temptation&#10;6:21&#10;to enter the racing business,&#10;6:23&#10;and to extract himself for what could have been&#10;6:27&#10;a game of obsession and never-ending rivalry&#10;6:30&#10;with Ferrari until the end of his life.&#10;6:33&#10;It's not that he didn't care about making beautiful cars&#10;6:37&#10;or didn't care about his company anymore.&#10;6:40&#10;It's that he knew that a time had come for a pivot.&#10;6:45&#10;And the pivot for Lamborghini,&#10;6:47&#10;allowed him to live a very fulfilling life.&#10;6:51&#10;And his company continued,&#10;6:53&#10;without his personal animosity towards Enzo Ferrari&#10;6:58&#10;coloring his entire company for the next 50 years.&#10;7:05&#10;Forgiveness is also a very anti-mimetic action to take.&#10;7:11&#10;Kind of goes against every fiber in our being,&#10;7:15&#10;because we're highly mimetic when it comes to conflict,&#10;7:18&#10;when it comes to violence.&#10;7:20&#10;Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.&#10;7:23&#10;We have to break the cycle of logic&#10;7:26&#10;through this supernatural act.&#10;7:31&#10;Forgiveness goes beyond the rational.&#10;7:35&#10;It's getting at this great power&#10;7:38&#10;that we have as human beings,&#10;7:40&#10;to choose not the instinctual reaction.&#10;7:45&#10;Getting out of that transactional mindset,&#10;7:49&#10;incorporating things like empathy and forgiveness&#10;7:52&#10;is really important.&#10;7:55&#10;When we listen to another person with empathy,&#10;7:58&#10;we can quickly break through a negative mimetic cycle,&#10;8:03&#10;because people want to imitate&#10;8:04&#10;the empathy that they received.&#10;8:08&#10;One tactic I recommend to my students&#10;8:10&#10;is to actually write a letter of gratitude&#10;8:12&#10;to somebody that might be a rival to them.&#10;8:15&#10;That's a great way to kill it right away, in most cases.&#10;8:19&#10;Not always,&#10;8:20&#10;not everybody responds positively to that kind of a thing.&#10;8:24&#10;But to be able to step back and to make a gesture of empathy&#10;8:28&#10;can change a negative mimetic cycle into a positive one,&#10;8:32&#10;almost instantaneously.&#10;8:36&#10;The question is,&#10;8:37&#10;will we actually be the one to take the first step?&#10;8:43&#10;- Get smarter, faster,&#10;8:44&#10;with videos from the world's biggest thinkers.&#10;8:47&#10;And to learn even more from the world's biggest

          <attvalue for="1" value="Sure, IQ is important, but is it as impactful as emotional intelligence? Renowned psychologist and author Daniel Goleman explains. &#10;&#10;Subscribe to Big Think on YouTube ►    / @bigthink  &#10;Up next, How emotions work ►    • How emotions work | Neuroscientist Lisa Fe...  &#10;&#10;The concept of emotional intelligence (EQ) can be traced back to ancient philosophies, but it was Goleman’s bestseller ‘Emotional Intelligence’ that popularized the term in 1995. According to Goleman, while IQ and smarts can get you good grades and jumpstart your career, it's EQ (what the psychologist often refers to as EI) that sets apart the top performers and leaders in their careers.&#10;&#10;Unlike IQ, which remains relatively static throughout life, emotional intelligence can be developed and refined at any age. Goleman emphasizes that enhancing our EQ can make our communities more compassionate, improve how we parent, and help us take better care of the environment.&#10;&#10;This knowledge - especially the fact that EQ can be enhanced over time - gives us a powerful tool for personal growth. Understanding and improving our emotional intelligence can directly lead us to better relationships, and can shape our lives with more fulfillment and, eventually, success. &#10;&#10;Timestamps:&#10;0:00 - IQ &#10;1:28 - EQ&#10;3:20 - The 4 domains&#10;5:16 - Habit change lesson&#10;7:11 - Emotional (un)intelligence&#10;9:33 - The bus driver&#10;&#10;Read the video transcript ► https://bigthink.com/series/legends/d...&#10;&#10;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &#10;&#10;Go Deeper with Big Think:&#10;&#10;►Become a Big Think Member&#10;Get exclusive access to full interviews, early access to new releases, Big Think merch and more. https://members.bigthink.com/?utm_sou...&#10; &#10;►Get Big Think+ for Business&#10;Guide, inspire and accelerate leaders at all levels of your company with the biggest minds in business. https://bigthink.com/plus/great-leade...&#10;&#10;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &#10;&#10;About Daniel Goleman:&#10;&#10;Daniel Goleman is a former science journalist for the New York Times and co-founder of the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning at the Yale University Child Studies Center (now at the University of Illinois, at Chicago). His 1995 book, Emotional Intelligence (Bantam Books) was on The New York Times bestseller list for a year and a half.&#10;&#10;Goleman is also the author of Ecological Intelligence: How Knowing the Hidden Impacts of What We Buy Can Change Everything. The book argues that new information technologies will create “radical transparency,” allowing us to know the environmental, health, and social consequences of what we buy. As shoppers use point-of-purchase ecological comparisons to guide their purchases, market share will shift to support steady, incremental upgrades in how products are made – changing every thing for the better.&#10;&#10;His other books include Optimal and Altered Traits." />

          <attvalue for="4" value="IQ&#10;0:07&#10;You know, in the future, I think emotional  intelligence will be one of several abilities  &#10;0:13&#10;that we need. Another, of course, is cognitive  ability, IQ, and maybe AI will take over more  &#10;0:20&#10;and more of that. However, emotional intelligence  is a human ability and will always remain so. IQ  &#10;0:28&#10;predicts how well you’ll do in your school  years and how much salary you can make over  &#10;0:33&#10;the course of a career because it says what job  you can get into, like being a business executive  &#10;0:39&#10;or a doctor or a lawyer. But once you’re in those  professions, everybody else is about as smart as  &#10;0:46&#10;you are. That’s where emotional intelligence kicks  in. People who emerge as outstanding performers or  &#10;0:52&#10;the best leaders have high emotional intelligence,  and their IQ is not that relevant at that point.  &#10;1:00&#10;I’m Daniel Goleman. I’ve written many  books, mostly on emotional intelligence.  &#10;1:04&#10;That’s really my favorite topic. The book Emotional Intelligence,  &#10;1:08&#10;many years ago, was an international bestseller.  I’ve written now five books on the topic. My most  &#10;1:14&#10;recent is Optimal: How to Sustain Personal and  Organizational Excellence Every Day. Emotional  &#10;EQ&#10;1:29&#10;intelligence is a set of personal skills  that we learn in life. It’s a combination  &#10;1:34&#10;of self-awareness, managing your emotions  well, empathy, tuning into other people,  &#10;1:41&#10;and putting that all together to have  harmonious or effective relationships.  &#10;1:45&#10;Emotional intelligence has been talked about for  centuries. Philosophers were talking about know  &#10;1:50&#10;thyself. That’s self-awareness. But when I wrote  the Emotional Intelligence book in ‘ninety-five,  &#10;1:57&#10;it was the first time that, for a popular  audience, emotional intelligence had become  &#10;2:03&#10;well known. I was a science journalist at  The New York Times back then, and I’d been  &#10;2:08&#10;covering a decade of research on the brain and  emotion. And in doing so, I came across a very  &#10;2:15&#10;obscure article called Emotional Intelligence,  and I loved the title. It was by Peter Salovey,  &#10;2:21&#10;who was just stepping down as the president of  Yale University, and his then graduate student,  &#10;2:26&#10;John Mayer. And I thought, Wow, what a great  phrase. It seems like an oxymoron. You don’t  &#10;2:32&#10;put emotions together with intelligence. But  actually, it’s being intelligent about emotions.  &#10;2:40&#10;When I wrote Emotional Intelligence, I was  actually thinking of bringing it to schools.  &#10;2:44&#10;It seemed to me that kids should learn  from the get-go how to manage themselves,  &#10;2:50&#10;how to tune into themselves, how to tune  into other people, how to get along, how  &#10;2:54&#10;to behave well, and so on. I was a big advocate  of what’s now called social-emotional learning.  &#10;3:00&#10;And from early on, my view of emotional  intelligence hasn’t really changed much,  &#10;3:06&#10;but I integrated it with findings from research  on outstanding performers. And I saw that  &#10;3:13&#10;different abilities of high performers,  like being able to manage your emotions,  &#10;3:17&#10;fit well in the model. And now I talk about  four domains of emotional intelligence and then  &#10;The 4 domains&#10;3:25&#10;twelve particular competencies of people  who are high in emotional intelligence.  &#10;3:33&#10;Self-awareness means you know what you’re feeling,  you know how it shapes your perceptions and your  &#10;3:38&#10;thoughts and your impulse to act. We find in  our research that people low in self-awareness  &#10;3:44&#10;are unable to develop strengths very well in  other parts of emotional intelligence. People  &#10;3:49&#10;who are high in self-awareness, however, are  able to develop excellence across the board.  &#10;3:57&#10;Self-management means when you’re upset,  when you’re angry, when you’re anxious,  &#10;4:03&#10;can you manage your emotions? Can you keep them  from disrupting your focus on what you have to  &#10;4:09&#10;do right now? We’re having more instances of road  rage, of shootings, of people blowing up at other  &#10;4:17&#10;people. There’s a growing need for people  in general to get better at this ability.  &#10;4:25&#10;The third part is social awareness,  which, in one sense, means practicing  &#10;4:29&#10;empathy. You not only know how the person thinks  and how they feel, you care about them. This is  &#10;4:36&#10;what you want in your parents. This is what you  want in your spouse. This is what you want in your  &#10;4:40&#10;lover. This is what you want in your friends. And  this is what you want in your teachers, doctors,  &#10;4:47&#10;leaders of any kind, people who have influence. The fourth part of emotional intelligence is  &#10;4:54&#10;relationship management. Can you handle  conflicts well? Can you keep yourself  &#10;5:00&#10;calm and listen to the other person? Are you  being an effective communicator? Full rapport  &#10;5:07&#10;means that you feel close, you feel you can  work with this person, you can trust them.  &#10;Habit change lesson&#10;5:16&#10;Unlike IQ, which barely budges over the course  of our life, emotional intelligence can change.  &#10;5:22&#10;It’s learned and learnable. And it’s learned  and learnable at any point in life. Emotional  &#10;5:29&#10;intelligence is not one thing. It’s like going to  a doctor for a physical. You get your lipids and  &#10;5:35&#10;your good cholesterol, bad cholesterol. You get  fifteen data points. Emotional intelligence is a  &#10;5:41&#10;set of abilities, and each of us has strengths and  limitations across that spectrum. So if you want  &#10;5:48&#10;to improve your emotional intelligence,  see where you need to improve first.  &#10;5:52&#10;One of the common colds of emotional intelligence  is poor listening. You know, we think about what  &#10;6:00&#10;we want to say and we don’t really listen to the  other person. We cut them off. We interrupt. Let’s  &#10;6:04&#10;say you wanted to change that. This is a basic of  empathy, listening well. So if you want to learn  &#10;6:10&#10;to be better at empathy, you might say, &quot;My habit  is cutting people off and interrupting. I’m going  &#10;6:19&#10;to make the effort to do it differently.  I’m going to listen to the person out,  &#10;6:23&#10;say what I think they mean, and then say what I  think.&quot; That is a different behavioral sequence.  &#10;6:29&#10;And it comes down to the basics of what we call  neuroplasticity, how the brain changes with  &#10;6:34&#10;repeated experience, and that’s what underlies  habit change. It’s a little like crossing your  &#10;6:42&#10;arms in a new way. Cross your arms in the old  way, please. Now cross them with the other arm  &#10;6:47&#10;on top. That feels uncomfortable. That’s what  it’s like to change a habit. So with listening,  &#10;6:55&#10;you have to, at first, make an intentional effort.  It might feel uncomfortable. But as you persist,  &#10;7:00&#10;it gets more and more comfortable until  finally, it’s an automatic habit that  &#10;7:06&#10;will stay with you for years. You know, I’ve gone around the  &#10;Emotional (un)intelligence&#10;7:12&#10;world talking to different audiences,  and one of the things I love to ask is,  &#10;7:17&#10;tell me about a leader you’ve loved and a  leader you hate, and tell me one quality that  &#10;7:23&#10;makes a leader so good or so bad. Basically, the  leader you hate is low in emotional intelligence.  &#10;7:31&#10;They don’t manage their emotions very well. They  blow up at people, don’t empathize, they don’t  &#10;7:36&#10;tune in, they don’t understand how clueless they  are. The leader you love is high in it. Having  &#10;7:43&#10;a boss with high emotional intelligence means  you feel not only inspired, not only motivated,  &#10;7:50&#10;you feel supported, you feel guided, you feel you  have clarity about what’s expected from you. You  &#10;7:56&#10;give your best in your best state, in the optimal  state, not in a desperate, stressed-out state.  &#10;8:03&#10;Research at the Yale School of Management  has found that emotions are contagious,  &#10;8:09&#10;and they’re most contagious from the leader  outward. The leader is most often the center of  &#10;8:15&#10;strong emotions, either negative or positive.  And this very research by Sigal Barsade has  &#10;8:22&#10;shown that if the leader is in a negative mood,  very anxious, for example, people on that team  &#10;8:29&#10;will catch that mood and performance goes  down. If the leader is in a very positive mood,  &#10;8:35&#10;I feel really good, I feel enthusiastic, then  people catch that positive mood, and their  &#10;8:42&#10;performance as a team or as a group goes up. So the leader's state is actually much more  &#10;8:48&#10;important on the ability of people to do good  work than many people realize, particularly many  &#10;8:54&#10;leaders, actually. But if you have a leader that  you hate, for example, and sadly, too many people  &#10;9:02&#10;do, then you really don’t give your best. In fact,  you’re more likely to leave as soon as you can,  &#10;9:08&#10;particularly if you’re talented. So a leader  with low emotional intelligence is actually  &#10;9:15&#10;draining the organization in the long term. They  may get results for the quarter by driving people,  &#10;9:22&#10;by stressing them out, but they’re burning  them out and they’re going to lose good  &#10;9:26&#10;people. So in the short term, they may look  good. In the long term, it’s a disaster.  &#10;The bus driver&#10;9:34&#10;I once took a bus up Madison Avenue in New York  City on a very hot, humid day. People had a kind  &#10;9:41&#10;of bubble around them, like, don’t touch me,  don’t talk to me, and I had the bubble too. I  &#10;9:46&#10;got on the bus, and the bus driver shocked me.  He looked at me and very warmly said, &quot;Welcome  &#10;9:51&#10;to the bus. How’s your day going?&quot; And then I  realized sitting on the bus that he was carrying  &#10;9:57&#10;on a conversation with everyone on the bus. &quot;You’re looking for suits, are you? Well,  &#10;10:01&#10;there’s a great sale up here on the  right at this department store.&quot;  &#10;10:04&#10;&quot;Did you see the exhibit in  the museum on the left?&quot;  &#10;10:06&#10;On and on and on. Then people would get off that  bus, and they’d been transformed from kind of  &#10;10:12&#10;grumpy to pretty upbeat. It was kind of magical.  And years later, I saw an article in the New York  &#10;10:19&#10;Times about that bus driver. His name, it turned  out, was Govan Brown. He had fans. People would  &#10;10:25&#10;wait for his bus. He got three thousand letters  saying what a great bus driver he was, not one  &#10;10:31&#10;complaint. And he, it turned out, was the pastor  of a church, and he saw the people on his bus as  &#10;10:39&#10;part of his flock. He was tending to his flock.  He had a purpose that was far greater than that of  &#10;10:47&#10;the New York Transit Authority, which is something  like getting as many people to where they want to  &#10;10:52&#10;go on time as we can. He had a splendid sense  of what he was doing. It gave a greater meaning  &#10;10:59&#10;to what he did, and he did it superbly. I’ve always felt that the more emotional  &#10;11:06&#10;intelligence in society, the better. I think  we would have parents who are more effective  &#10;11:13&#10;in raising kids, who are kinder. We’d have more  compassion for each other in our interactions with  &#10;11:20&#10;friends and loved ones as well as with strangers.  I think we would care more about the environment,  &#10;11:26&#10;which is why I’ve been happy to be a kind  of evangelist for emotional intelligence,  &#10;11:32&#10;if you will. I’m not the originator of the  phrase. I think I made it more famous.  &#10;11:38&#10;I just think it would make a better world." />

          <attvalue for="4" value="Introduction&#10;0:00&#10;The Mona Lisa might not be the  most famous painting in the world&#10;0:03&#10;had Leonardo da Vinci not mastered human anatomy.&#10;0:07&#10;To capture the mysterious smile of the  Mona Lisa, Leonardo dissected human bodies,&#10;0:12&#10;peeling back the layers of the face to uncover  every nerve that made the muscles move.&#10;0:17&#10;He took the advice of Renaissance polymath  Leon Battista Alberti that an artist should&#10;0:21&#10;see the human body from the inside  out - first imagining the skeleton,&#10;0:26&#10;then the muscles and skin,  and finally the clothing.&#10;0:29&#10;Leonardo’s science informed his art so deeply  that when he wrote to the ruler of Milan seeking&#10;0:34&#10;employment, he touted his engineering expertise  in designing bridges, cannons, and tanks.&#10;0:39&#10;Almost as an afterthought, he  mentioned that he could paint.&#10;0:43&#10;Leonardo was an artist, a scientist, an engineer.&#10;0:46&#10;Most of all, he was curious.&#10;0:49&#10;So curious that in his thousands of  pages of notes, he wrote things like:&#10;0:53&#10;“Describe the tongue of the woodpecker…”&#10;0:56&#10;That relentless curiosity drove him to create,&#10;0:59&#10;explore, and innovate in ways no  one had done before–or has since.&#10;Early life and education&#10;1:04&#10;Leonardo was born on April 15, 1452, in  Anchiano, a village near Vinci, Italy,&#10;1:09&#10;to Ser Piero and a local peasant girl, Caterina.&#10;1:13&#10;Walter Isaacson notes in his biography of Leonardo&#10;1:16&#10;that he “…had the good luck  to be born out of wedlock.”&#10;1:19&#10;Otherwise, he might have been expected to  follow in his father's footsteps as a notary,&#10;1:23&#10;which would not have suited his creative mind.&#10;1:26&#10;He spent his early years with  his mother and then paternal&#10;1:29&#10;grandparents while his father worked in Florence.&#10;1:31&#10;After his stepmother died, Leonardo  moved to Florence at the age of 12&#10;1:35&#10;to live with his father - a city  at the heart of the art world.&#10;1:38&#10;Because he was born illegitimate, Leonardo  wasn’t sent to a formal Latin school.&#10;1:43&#10;Instead, he attended an &quot;abacus&quot; school, where he  learned practical mathematics for use in commerce.&#10;1:48&#10;He struggled with Latin his entire  life and wrote primarily in Italian,&#10;1:52&#10;often from right to left, to avoid  smudging the ink as he was left-handed.&#10;1:56&#10;He also had the habit of  writing each letter backward.&#10;1:59&#10;When others mocked him for his  lack of formal classical education,&#10;2:03&#10;Leonardo dismissed them as “Foolish folk!&#10;2:06&#10;Though I cannot quote from authors as they do,&#10;2:08&#10;I shall rely on a far more  worthy thing—on experience.”&#10;Apprenticeship under Verrocchio&#10;2:13&#10;At the age of 14, Leonardo began an  apprenticeship his father arranged&#10;2:17&#10;with one of his clients, renowned  artist Andrea del Verrocchio.&#10;2:20&#10;In Verrocchio’s workshop, Leonardo  studied his sculpture of David,&#10;2:24&#10;particularly the lifelike veins and  muscles that conveyed subtle motion.&#10;2:29&#10;He later mastered the art of motion in The  Last Supper, where the apostles react to Jesus’&#10;2:34&#10;announcement that one of them would betray him. Clustered in groups of three, each figure moves&#10;2:39&#10;with emotion—gesturing and turning—while  Judas, cloaked in shadow and clutching&#10;2:44&#10;a bag of silver he was given to betray  Jesus, leans away, revealing his guilt.&#10;2:50&#10;Leonardo began to shine in Verrochio’s workshop.&#10;2:53&#10;It’s believed Leonardo painted the  gleaming fish in Tobias and the Angel,&#10;2:56&#10;which stands in stark contrast to Antonio del  Pollaiuolo’s duller depiction, while Leonardo’s&#10;3:02&#10;prancing dog at the bottom left is much more  animated than Pollaiuolo’s stiffer portrayal.&#10;3:08&#10;He also began to surpass his  master; in The Baptism of Christ,&#10;3:12&#10;Leonardo’s angel on the left is more  dynamic than Verrocchio’s on the right.&#10;3:17&#10;Using the sfumato technique, he softly  blended tones around the angel's jawline,&#10;3:22&#10;in contrast to Verrocchio's  sharper, more defined edges.&#10;3:25&#10;He eventually opened his own workshop in 1477.&#10;3:29&#10;But commissions were few,&#10;3:31&#10;and several of his projects were left  unfinished - which became a habit.&#10;3:35&#10;Many handsome young men lived and worked under  his roof, including Gian Giacomo Caprotti,&#10;3:40&#10;known as Salai, meaning 'little  devil' for his mischievous streak.&#10;3:44&#10;It’s widely believed Leonardo had  a romantic relationship with Salai.&#10;3:48&#10;After five frustrating years with  little to show, Lorenzo de’ Medici,&#10;Milan and the Vitruvian Man&#10;3:53&#10;the ruler of Florence, sent Leonardo on  a diplomatic mission to present a lyre,&#10;3:57&#10;a musical instrument that Leonardo had  mastered, to Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan.&#10;4:03&#10;Leonardo seized the opportunity to offer his&#10;4:05&#10;engineering services in his  famous letter to the Duke.&#10;4:08&#10;The duke accepted, and Leonardo spent the next  17 years in Milan under Ludovico’s patronage.&#10;4:14&#10;He was invited to advise on various  architectural projects, including the&#10;4:18&#10;central dome of the Milan Cathedral, one of  the largest Gothic cathedrals in Europe.&#10;4:23&#10;Though his design was not ultimately chosen,  Leonardo applied his deep understanding of&#10;4:27&#10;proportion and symmetry - principles  he immortalized in his Vitruvian Man.&#10;4:33&#10;Leonardo believed the proportions  of the human body could serve as&#10;4:37&#10;a blueprint for architectural design.&#10;4:39&#10;He drew inspiration from the 1st  century BC Roman architect Vitruvius,&#10;4:43&#10;who described proportions like: “The length of  the foot is one sixth of the height of the body…”&#10;4:49&#10;Vitruvius also explained that the man’s  navel is the central point of the body&#10;4:53&#10;and with arms and legs outstretched,  a circle can be drawn around the body,&#10;4:57&#10;while the height and arm span  together form a perfect square.&#10;5:00&#10;Although other artists have drawn  versions of the Vitruvian Man,&#10;5:04&#10;Leonardo’s stands out for its perfect balance  of artistic beauty and scientific accuracy.&#10;5:09&#10;Leonardo was fascinated with the male body - most&#10;Anatomical studies and dissections&#10;5:12&#10;of his anatomical studies and  drawings focus on the male form.&#10;5:16&#10;He even made observations like: “When a man sits  down, the distance from his seat to the top part&#10;5:21&#10;of his head will be half of his height plus  the thickness and length of the testicles.”&#10;5:27&#10;Leonardo dissected around 30 corpses,&#10;5:30&#10;producing scientifically accurate and  detailed renderings of the human form.&#10;5:34&#10;In his skull drawing, Leonardo illustrated the  internal structure by showing the left half sawed&#10;5:39&#10;off, marking the first accurate depiction  of the frontal sinus behind the eyebrows.&#10;5:44&#10;This was significant, as the understanding  of human anatomy was limited at the time.&#10;5:49&#10;His greatest achievements in studying  the human body are related to the heart.&#10;5:53&#10;He showed that the heart is a muscle,  suggested that arteries harden with age,&#10;5:58&#10;and discovered how swirling currents of blood  in the aorta help heart valves close properly.&#10;Engineering, flying machines, and military contributions&#10;6:03&#10;This fascination with swirling motions  extended to his studies of water.&#10;6:08&#10;He was especially captivated by&#10;6:09&#10;water's destructive nature. Deluge  drawings depict apocalyptic scenes&#10;6:11&#10;To Leonardo, water was a force to  be reckoned with - and controlled.&#10;6:16&#10;He explored diverting water from the  Arno River to cut off Florence’s enemy,&#10;6:20&#10;Pisa, from the sea by constructing dams.&#10;6:22&#10;Leonardo designed a machine capable  of moving 1 million tons of earth&#10;6:26&#10;to redirect the water into a ditch. He also sought to conquer the skies.&#10;6:31&#10;He spent decades studying how birds fly,  making extraordinarily detailed observations,&#10;6:36&#10;such as: “There are some birds that move  their wings more swiftly when they lower&#10;6:40&#10;them than when they raise them…” As Walter Isaacson noted, “...we&#10;6:44&#10;never make the effort, in our daily lives,  to observe ordinary phenomena so closely.”&#10;6:50&#10;Leonardo's ornithopter was a conceptual  aircraft designed to fly by flapping its wings,&#10;6:55&#10;demonstrating how humans might achieve flight. He also sketched the aerial screw,&#10;6:59&#10;an early design for a helicopter, with a spiral  rotor intended to lift the machine off the ground.&#10;7:05&#10;But 15th-century technology was not advanced  enough to make his designs feasible.&#10;7:10&#10;In other areas, though, particularly in map  making, his innovations had an immediate impact.&#10;7:16&#10;In 1502, while in his 50s, he became  the chief military architect and&#10;7:20&#10;engineer to the ruthless Cesare  Borgia, son of Pope Alexander VI.&#10;7:25&#10;Leonardo’s most significant  contribution to warfare was&#10;7:28&#10;creating a highly accurate map of Imola,  a key city in Borgia’s military campaign.&#10;7:33&#10;Maps at the time were largely  symbolic and inaccurate.&#10;7:37&#10;By using a magnetic compass, he ensured his  map was scientifically precise and practical,&#10;7:42&#10;allowing Borgia to plan attacks, identify  weak points, and position troops effectively.&#10;7:47&#10;This marked the beginning of modern cartography.&#10;7:50&#10;Before working for Borgia, Leonardo's talents  as a military engineer were often overlooked.&#10;The Last Supper’s linear perspective&#10;7:55&#10;The Duke of Milan primarily appreciated  him for his artistic talent,&#10;7:59&#10;which shined through in one  of his most iconic works.&#10;8:03&#10;In 1495, Leonardo began painting The Last Supper&#10;8:06&#10;on the wall of a small church and  monastery in the heart of Milan.&#10;8:10&#10;Some days, he worked from dawn until  dusk without eating or drinking,&#10;8:14&#10;while on other days, he  wouldn’t touch his paintbrush.&#10;8:17&#10;One of the most remarkable aspects of The Last  Supper is Leonardo’s use of linear perspective.&#10;8:22&#10;All the architectural lines converge at a single  vanishing point located at Jesus’ forehead,&#10;8:28&#10;cleverly drawing the viewer’s eye directly to  Christ, emphasizing his central role in the scene.&#10;8:33&#10;To create this perfect perspective,  Leonardo hammered a small nail into&#10;8:37&#10;the center of the wall by Jesus’ head and  cut thin incisions to guide the lines.&#10;8:42&#10;Here’s something fascinating... if you  stand on the left side of the room,&#10;8:46&#10;it almost feels like the painting spills out into  the real space, like you’re part of the scene.&#10;8:51&#10;Beyond the visual effects, Leonardo infused The  Last Supper with incredible emotional depth.&#10;8:56&#10;The painting captures the moment Christ announces,&#10;8:59&#10;“He that dippeth his hand with me in  the dish, the same shall betray me.”&#10;9:16&#10;The viewer is able to easily interpret  each apostles’ thoughts and feelings&#10;9:16&#10;through their gestures and expressions.&#10;9:16&#10;As Leonardo said, “A picture of human figures  ought to be done in such a way that the viewer&#10;9:16&#10;may easily recognize, by means of their  attitudes, the intentions of their minds.”&#10;Bronze horse monument and move to France&#10;9:20&#10;It required a different kind  of ambition to mold and cast&#10;9:23&#10;a massive bronze horse, 7 meters or 23 feet high.&#10;9:27&#10;Leonardo spent years designing  the monument commissioned by&#10;9:30&#10;the Duke of Milan in honor of his late father.&#10;9:33&#10;He studied horses in detail and  constructed a massive clay model.&#10;9:37&#10;However, in 1494, the bronze intended for casting&#10;9:40&#10;the statue was redirected to make cannons  to defend against invading French forces.&#10;9:45&#10;French troops destroyed the clay  model by using it for target practice.&#10;9:49&#10;Ironically, it would later be the French who  became some of Leonardo’s greatest supporters.&#10;9:54&#10;After the Duke of Milan was overthrown  in 1499, Leonardo spent over a decade&#10;9:59&#10;wandering across Italy until he found  the support of the French crown.&#10;10:04&#10;In 1516, King Francis I invited Leonardo to  his court, appreciating his beautiful mind.&#10;10:10&#10;Leonardo spent the rest of his  life in a red brick manor next&#10;10:14&#10;to the king’s castle in the Loire Valley,  obsessively refining his most famous work.&#10;The Mona Lisa&#10;10:20&#10;The Mona Lisa is widely believed  to depict Lisa Gherardini,&#10;10:24&#10;the wife of a wealthy Florentine silk merchant.&#10;10:26&#10;Leonardo's knowledge as both a scientist  and an artist culminated in the Mona Lisa.&#10;10:32&#10;His mastery of sfumato, the technique of  blending tones to create soft transitions&#10;10:36&#10;without harsh edges, gave the  painting its lifelike quality.&#10;10:40&#10;His deep understanding of light and shadow,  especially how it interacts with curved surfaces,&#10;10:46&#10;allowed him to craft subtle, realistic details  like the play of light across her face.&#10;10:51&#10;The illusion that her eyes follow the viewer is&#10;10:53&#10;a result of Leonardo’s precise use  of linear perspective and shading.&#10;10:58&#10;He carefully modeled the shadows around  her eyes, giving them depth and expression.&#10;11:03&#10;As Leonardo once said, “The eye, which is said to&#10;11:05&#10;be the window of the soul…” was key  to his approach in capturing emotion.&#10;11:10&#10;By painting her eyes to look directly at  the viewer, and since perspective in a&#10;11:13&#10;two-dimensional painting doesn’t change,  they seem to follow you wherever you go.&#10;11:18&#10;The most fascinating feature of  the painting, her enigmatic smile,&#10;11:22&#10;changes depending on where you focus, reflecting  Leonardo’s understanding of visual perception.&#10;11:27&#10;When viewed directly, the fine details and subtle&#10;11:30&#10;shading around her mouth make  her smile seem less pronounced.&#10;11:33&#10;But when seen in your peripheral vision,&#10;11:35&#10;broader shapes and contrasts come into play,  making her smile appear more pronounced.&#10;11:41&#10;The artistic and scientific mastery in the  Mona Lisa becomes even more apparent when&#10;11:45&#10;compared to one of Leonardo’s earlier works,  Ginevra de’ Benci, which, while impressive,&#10;11:50&#10;lacks the same emotional depth  and technical sophistication.&#10;11:54&#10;The Mona Lisa was in his studio when he died.&#10;Death and mortality&#10;11:57&#10;In the final years of his life, Leonardo became  captivated by the destructive power of water.&#10;12:03&#10;His Deluge drawings show apocalyptic visions&#10;12:06&#10;of nature’s overwhelming force  as he faced his own mortality.&#10;12:11&#10;Leonardo da Vinci passed away on May 2, 1519,  at the age of 67, possibly due to a stroke.&#10;12:20&#10;Though he was not known to be religious,  in his will, Leonardo wrote: “And first he&#10;12:25&#10;commends his soul to our Lord, Almighty  God, and to the glorious Virgin Mary”.&#10;12:30&#10;“And first he commends his soul to our Lord,  Almighty God, and to the Glorious Virgin Mary…”&#10;12:30&#10;Leonardo da Vinci’s life and work represent  the perfect balance between art and science.&#10;12:35&#10;Science informed his art, and his art brought  the beauty and complexity of science to life.&#10;Today’s sponsor: Brilliant&#10;12:42&#10;What’s remarkable is that  he was largely self-taught.&#10;12:44&#10;His boundless curiosity and intense  observation of the world around him&#10;12:48&#10;gave him an education that he  didn’t get from a classroom.&#10;12:52&#10;If you’re

          <attvalue for="4" value="Intro&#10;0:00&#10;The nineteenth century was the time of great inventors and great inventions.&#10;0:06&#10;Along the way, Thomas Edison became one of the best-known and most admired inventors&#10;0:10&#10;in history.&#10;0:11&#10;Nikola Tesla is arguably less well-known.&#10;0:14&#10;Only recently has he attracted renewed attention thanks in part to the electric car company&#10;0:18&#10;that bears his name.&#10;Tesla vs Edison&#10;0:20&#10;In 1884, when Tesla was 28 years old, he sailed for New York with only four cents in his pocket.&#10;0:27&#10;His money and some of his luggage were stolen on the way over.&#10;0:32&#10;Like other immigrants, Tesla came to America for work.&#10;0:35&#10;He had been hired as an engineer at Edison Machine Works in Manhattan.&#10;0:39&#10;Tesla admired Edison, recalling: &quot;One of the great events in my life was my first meeting&#10;0:43&#10;with Edison.&#10;0:44&#10;This wonderful man, who had received no scientific training, yet had accomplished so much, filled&#10;0:49&#10;me with amazement.”&#10;0:51&#10;Edison was also impressed with the young engineer, remarking to an assistant: “...this is a&#10;0:55&#10;damn good man!”&#10;0:56&#10;It didn’t take long, however, for things to turn sour as the two men disagreed over&#10;1:00&#10;how electricity should be delivered to the masses.&#10;1:04&#10;In 1879, Edison created the first practical incandescent lightbulb and then built a system&#10;1:09&#10;to carry electricity so people could use his new invention.&#10;1:12&#10;He opened up his first power plant in New York in 1882 supported by his Direct Current&#10;1:17&#10;electrical system known as DC.&#10;1:20&#10;A network of underground cables would carry electricity from a generator to homes and&#10;1:24&#10;businesses.&#10;1:25&#10;But his DC generators kept failing.&#10;1:27&#10;So he hired the young Serbian engineer to improve them.&#10;1:31&#10;Tesla saw the weaknesses of direct current which travels through a power line in one&#10;1:35&#10;direction at a constant voltage.&#10;1:37&#10;But there’s a critical flaw: it can only go up to a mile before losing power.&#10;1:42&#10;Tesla felt he had come up with a better solution: alternating current.&#10;1:45&#10;AC periodically changes direction and can also vary its voltage.&#10;1:50&#10;The crucial advantage is that it can travel hundreds of miles without losing power.&#10;1:55&#10;Yet when Tesla tried to convince Edison of the advantages of AC, his boss wasn’t having&#10;1:59&#10;any of it.&#10;2:00&#10;Edison didn’t want to lose the royalties he earned from his DC patents.&#10;2:04&#10;Tesla claimed Edison promised him $50,000 if he could improve on his DC generators and&#10;2:09&#10;when he did, Edison refused to pay up and is said to have responded: “Tesla, you don’t&#10;2:14&#10;understand our American humor”.&#10;2:16&#10;So Tesla quit after just a few months on the job, writing in his diary:&#10;2:19&#10;“Good by to the Edison Machine Works”.&#10;2:22&#10;Tesla set out on his own hoping to find investors interested in his concept for an AC motor&#10;2:27&#10;that he had patented.&#10;2:28&#10;Yet he struggled.&#10;2:30&#10;Alternating current was a totally new technology.&#10;2:33&#10;Not something anyone had ever seen before.&#10;2:34&#10;He even briefly had to resort to digging ditches just to survive.&#10;2:39&#10;But there was one person who took a chance on him.&#10;2:41&#10;Entrepreneur George Westinghouse saw the potential of AC.&#10;2:45&#10;He believed AC was THE missing link in long-distance power transmission.&#10;2:49&#10;So he purchased Tesla’s AC patents for $60,000 and offered Tesla stock and royalties of $2.50&#10;2:56&#10;for each horsepower of electricity sold.&#10;2:58&#10;All of this is worth millions today.&#10;3:00&#10;Edison tried to do everything he could to discredit Tesla’s AC system so that DC would&#10;3:05&#10;be the preferred choice to power homes.&#10;3:08&#10;He found an ally in J.P. Morgan, at the time the most powerful banker in America.&#10;3:13&#10;This would lead to the birth of General Electric.&#10;3:15&#10;The battle against Tesla and Westinghouse is now known as the War of the Currents.&#10;3:19&#10;And in many ways, it was a propaganda war launched by Edison to try to convince the&#10;3:24&#10;public that AC was dangerous.&#10;3:26&#10;He zeroed in on the fact that alternating current operated at much higher voltages than&#10;3:30&#10;direct current.&#10;3:32&#10;When the state of New York commissioned an electricity salesman named Harold Brown to&#10;3:36&#10;build the electric chair, Edison paid him behind the scenes to use his rival’s AC&#10;3:40&#10;generators secured through a second-hand dealer.&#10;3:43&#10;Brown also used AC to electrocute dogs at Edison’s laboratory in New Jersey, which&#10;3:47&#10;Edison recalled in articles he published, writing: “I have myself seen a large healthy&#10;3:52&#10;dog killed instantly by the alternating current.”&#10;3:55&#10;Other animals were not immune to his schemes.&#10;3:58&#10;Edison’s company electrocuted a circus elephant named Topsy using AC and produced a film about&#10;4:04&#10;it.&#10;4:05&#10;His anti-AC crusade may or may not have also come from a genuine concern about safety.&#10;4:09&#10;He wrote a letter warning the president of his electric light company of the danger of&#10;4:13&#10;AC, declaring: &quot;Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six&#10;4:18&#10;months after he puts in a system of any size.&quot;&#10;4:21&#10;Sure enough, there were several accidental deaths due to the high voltages of AC in the&#10;4:25&#10;late 1880s in New York and several other cities.&#10;4:29&#10;In one incident, telegraph lineman John Feeks’ body was left hanging in tangled wires in&#10;4:34&#10;front of a horrified crowd.&#10;4:36&#10;His death led to laws to move AC lines underground in New York City.&#10;4:40&#10;Tesla felt that the only way to show AC was safe was to demonstrate it on himself.&#10;4:45&#10;In a dramatic display at Columbia University, he grasped a brass ball in each hand and touched&#10;4:50&#10;the terminals of a high-voltage, high-frequency transformer now known as a Tesla coil.&#10;4:56&#10;250,000 volts raced across the surface of his body.&#10;5:00&#10;A newspaper reported that he was surrounded by “...tongues of electric flame.”&#10;5:04&#10;In 1893, Tesla and Westinghouse scored a big win when they beat out Edison to light up&#10;Teslas Legacy&#10;5:12&#10;the Chicago World Fair using alternating current.&#10;5:15&#10;The first all-electric fair in history.&#10;5:18&#10;Three years later, Tesla lit up the city of Buffalo using AC motors powered by the waters&#10;5:23&#10;of Niagara Falls.&#10;5:25&#10;This was Tesla’s childhood dream.&#10;5:27&#10;As a kid, he saw an image of the Falls and told his uncle that one day, he’d go to&#10;5:31&#10;America and capture the energy of Niagara.&#10;5:34&#10;The first hydroelectric power plant at Niagara Falls would mark the beginning of the electrification&#10;5:39&#10;of the world.&#10;5:41&#10;When he gave a speech at the opening ceremony, Tesla said: “It is a monument worthy of&#10;5:45&#10;our scientific age...”&#10;5:47&#10;“It signifies the subjugation of natural forces to the service of man, the discontinuance&#10;5:52&#10;of barbarous methods, the relieving of millions from want and suffering.&quot;&#10;5:56&#10;Today, almost every home in the world is powered by AC whereas DC powers smaller items, anything&#10;6:03&#10;that uses batteries: from your electric toothbrush to the clock on the wall.&#10;6:07&#10;Despite the success of AC, Tesla never went on to the fame and fortune that Edison enjoyed.&#10;6:13&#10;Because Edison was not only an inventor.&#10;6:15&#10;He was a businessman, honing his craft at the age of 13 when he started selling candy,&#10;6:20&#10;newspapers, and vegetables on trains and turned an amazing profit of $50 a week in his day&#10;6:25&#10;- about $1,600 today.&#10;6:27&#10;Edison would likely have made a different choice when confronted with the challenging&#10;6:31&#10;situation that Tesla faced next.&#10;6:35&#10;The war of the currents took a financial toll on Westinghouse whose company racked up millions&#10;6:40&#10;of dollars in debt.&#10;6:41&#10;When Westinghouse begged Tesla to lower his royalty rate in order to save the company,&#10;6:46&#10;Tesla did more than that.&#10;6:48&#10;He tore up his contract - relinquishing his royalties altogether.&#10;6:52&#10;It’s estimated that Tesla willingly walked away from $12 million in royalties in his&#10;6:57&#10;day which today would be worth well over $300 million.&#10;7:01&#10;Those royalties were so valuable they would have accrued over time to turn Tesla into&#10;7:06&#10;the world’s first billionaire.&#10;7:08&#10;In return, Westinghouse paid him a lump sum of $216,000 for the right to use his AC patents&#10;7:16&#10;forever which is roughly $5 million today.&#10;7:19&#10;Tesla’s decision would hurt him dearly because he ended up short of cash to fund his other&#10;7:24&#10;grand ideas.&#10;7:25&#10;He had discovered that his powerful coil made it possible to send and receive radio signals.&#10;7:30&#10;But in 1895, a fire broke out at the building housing his New York lab as he was about to&#10;7:35&#10;transmit a signal 50 miles to West Point, New York.&#10;7:38&#10;The blaze destroyed everything: his models, designs, notes, and tools.&#10;7:43&#10;The timing was terrible because Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi was also developing radio&#10;7:48&#10;in England, sending Morse-code-based signals.&#10;7:51&#10;Tesla still managed to beat Marconi to the punch by filing American patents for the radio&#10;7:55&#10;first, in 1897.&#10;7:58&#10;When Marconi tried to do the same a few years later, the U.S. Patent Office turned him down&#10;8:02&#10;because his were too similar to Tesla’s.&#10;8:04&#10;Repeated applications were rejected.&#10;8:06&#10;But Marconi did attract the attention of none other than Edison who invested in him and&#10;8:11&#10;became a consulting engineer at Marconi’s company.&#10;8:14&#10;The Italian’s greatest achievement came in 1901 when he received the first radio signal&#10;8:19&#10;sent across the Atlantic from a transmitter in southwest England to St John’s Newfoundland&#10;8:24&#10;in Eastern Canada.&#10;8:26&#10;This won Marconi international fame.&#10;8:28&#10;And he had to use Tesla’s patents to achieve it.&#10;8:31&#10;But Tesla didn’t mind.&#10;8:33&#10;When one of his engineers said: &quot;Looks as if Marconi got the jump on you.&quot;&#10;8:37&#10;Tesla replied: &quot;Marconi is a good fellow.&#10;8:39&#10;Let him continue.&#10;8:40&#10;He is using seventeen of my patents.”&#10;8:42&#10;Unfortunately, no patent is truly safe.&#10;8:45&#10;In 1904, the Patent Office decided inexplicably to rewrite history by awarding Marconi a patent&#10;8:52&#10;for the invention of the radio, reversing its earlier decisions.&#10;8:56&#10;It gave no reason.&#10;8:58&#10;But it didn’t hurt that Marconi had the financial backing of Edison and other influential&#10;9:02&#10;people.&#10;9:03&#10;In 1909, Marconi won the Nobel Prize in physics for the invention of the radio.&#10;9:08&#10;Tesla was furious.&#10;9:10&#10;And sued the Marconi Company for infringement.&#10;9:13&#10;The radio incident led Tesla to lose business opportunities.&#10;9:17&#10;For example, Tesla had a grand vision for wireless electricity.&#10;9:20&#10;His proposal initially caught the attention of J.P. Morgan who put up $150,000 to build&#10;9:26&#10;a giant transmission tower in 1901.&#10;9:29&#10;Tesla believed the 187-foot, 57-meter tall Wardenclyffe Tower in Long Island, New York&#10;9:35&#10;was the start of a system that could deliver electricity without wires around the globe.&#10;9:39&#10;And anyone with the right equipment could tap into it.&#10;9:42&#10;He imagined a scenario where “...it will be possible for a businessman in New York&#10;9:46&#10;to dictate instructions, and have them instantly appear in type at his office in London or&#10;9:50&#10;elsewhere.”&#10;9:52&#10;It was incredibly prescient to envision telecommunications infrastructure much like today’s Internet&#10;9:56&#10;more than a century ago.&#10;9:58&#10;But Tesla’s vision would never bear fruit.&#10;10:01&#10;Electricity can indeed be transmitted through the air but it’s impractical because of&#10;10:05&#10;the amount of power needed to make it happen.&#10;10:07&#10;So, Tesla appealed to Morgan for more money.&#10;10:10&#10;It was all for naught.&#10;10:11&#10;Morgan was throwing money in the other direction toward Marconi.&#10;10:15&#10;Wardenclyffe Tower was never completed and would eventually be demolished, along with&#10;10:20&#10;Tesla’s vision.&#10;10:21&#10;Tesla was devastated and had a breakdown, lamenting: ”It is not a dream.&#10;10:26&#10;It is a simple feat of scientific electrical engineering, only expensive—blind, faint-hearted,&#10;10:32&#10;doubting world!”&#10;10:34&#10;Tesla began to withdraw from that world.&#10;10:37&#10;He showed signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder which compelled him to do things in threes,&#10;10:42&#10;including living in a hotel room that was divisible by the number three.&#10;10:46&#10;He spent the last decade of his life living out of a hotel paid for by the Westinghouse&#10;10:50&#10;Corporation which kept him on as a consultant.&#10;10:53&#10;He was broke.&#10;10:54&#10;And befriended pigeons.&#10;10:56&#10;Edison on the other hand continued to reap immense rewards.&#10;11:00&#10;Businesses and partnerships filled his life.&#10;11:02&#10;By the time he died in 1931, he patented a record 1,093 inventions.&#10;11:08&#10;There was the lightbulb, of course, but also the motion picture camera, and the early record&#10;11:12&#10;player called a phonograph.&#10;11:14&#10;Today - he is considered one of the world’s greatest inventors.&#10;11:18&#10;It was only after Tesla’s death that he got a modicum of justice for all that he had&#10;Tesla vs Marconi&#10;11:24&#10;lost.&#10;11:25&#10;When Tesla sued Marconi, the case dragged on in court for years.&#10;11:29&#10;Six months after his passing in 1943, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Marconi’s radio&#10;11:34&#10;patents were invalid and awarded the patents for the radio to Tesla.&#10;11:38&#10;But it had a selfish reason for doing so.&#10;11:41&#10;Marconi’s company had sued the U.S. government for patent infringement during World War I.&#10;11:45&#10;So to avoid the lawsuit altogether, the Supreme Court deemed Tesla the inventor of the radio.&#10;11:51&#10;Today, at the site where Tesla’s Wardenclyffe Tower once stood, is a science museum dedicated&#10;11:56&#10;to the man whose dreams were not to be.&#10;11:59&#10;The Tesla Science Center was made possible thanks to the financial support of thousands&#10;12:03&#10;of Tesla fans, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk.&#10;12:07&#10;Tesla’s prediction of transmitting data without wires came true in the early nineties.&#10;12:12&#10;The internet has changed our lives yet at the same time, it’s important to stay protected&#10;12:17&#10;online.&#10;12:18&#10;If you've been following me for a while, you know that I only endorse products that I personally&#10;12:21&#10;use which is why I'm really excited this video is sponsored by Private Internet Access.&#10;12:27&#10;Private Internet Access hides my IP address so that my Internet Service Provider can’t&#10;12:31&#10;see the websites I visit.&#10;12:33&#10;Changing your IP address is a great way to convince anyone that you’re in a different&#10;12:36&#10;location than where you currently are.&#10;12:38&#10;Besides the security aspect, a VPN is super handy to access content on YouTube or Netflix&#10;12:43&#10;that’s otherwise not available in your region.&#10;12:46&#10;What I really like about Private Internet Access is that they don’t log any data.&#10;12:50&#10;This means they’ll have no idea when I’m using the VPN, for how long, or even what&#10;12:53&#10;sites I’ve been visiting.&#10;12:55&#10;If you go to my link to support my channel, you’ll get an 83% discount so that the price&#10;12:59&#10;of complete digital privacy is just $2.08 a month + you’ll get 2 extra months for&#10;13:05&#10;free with a 30-day money-back guarantee.&#10;13:08&#10;You can use the same subscription to protect up to 10 devices at the same time on any platform.&#10;13:14&#10;Simply head to www.privateinternetaccess.com/newsthink to get the promotion.&#10;13:18&#10;The link is in my description.&#10;13:20&#10;I hope you enjoyed the video and if you did, don’t forget to give it a like.&#10;13:23&#10;And if there’s a story idea you’d like to see, feel free to leave a comment below.&#10;13:27&#10;Thanks so much for watching.&#10;13:28&#10;For Newsthink, I’m Cindy Pom." />

          <attvalue for="1" value="How Xi Jinping became China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong&#10;&#10;Help keep Vox free for everybody: http://www.vox.com/give-now &#10;&#10;Subscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO&#10;&#10;Xi Jinping, president of China and general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party since 2012, is one of the most powerful political figures in the world. By initiating an unprecedented third term as China’s leader in October, 2022, Xi has signaled that he may plan to remain in power for life – making him the first Chinese leader since Mao Zedong to hold unchecked power over the People’s Republic of China. &#10;&#10;But Xi’s connection to Mao goes deeper than a shared outlook that emphasizes unifying the party around a single leader. When Xi was just a young boy, his family – who had held elite party status thanks to his father’s pivotal role in Mao's “Long March” in 1935 – was denounced during Mao’s Cultural Revolution, a chaotic decade of purges and persecution that saw even Mao’s closest allies removed from power. During this time, a teenaged Xi was forced to work hard labor in the countryside outside of Beijing, and his father was imprisoned. &#10;&#10;Xi’s subsequent rise after Mao died in 1976 was a methodical process in using his restored elite status as leverage to gain prominent party positions in rural provinces around China, culminating in his promotion to the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in 2007.&#10;&#10;From there, Xi pulled from Mao’s playbook: purging his political rivals and promoting those with whom he shared close personal ties. This process undid the work of Mao’s successor, Deng Xiaoping, to prevent the consolidation of power around a single leader in China. &#10;&#10;By the time his third term began in October 2022, Xi had reshaped the party and Chinese military leadership to be fully packed with Xi loyalists. And even in the face of social upheaval surrounding his failed Zero Covid policy, Xi has shown no sign of giving up any of the power he has consolidated since taking over as leader of the country. &#10;&#10;&#10;Further reading: &#10;&#10;These books and podcasts below helped us understand Xi Jinping’s rise, Xi’s similarities to Mao, how politics changed in the PRC since its founding, and the structure and culture of the CCP:&#10;&#10;Coalitions of the Weak by Victor Shih (Associate Professor in China and Pacific Relations at the University of California, San Diego)&#10;https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/... &#10;&#10;Chinese Politics in the Xi Jinping Era by Cheng Li (scholar and expert in Chinese elite politics) &#10;https://www.brookings.edu/books/chine... &#10;&#10;Party of One by Chun Han Wong (Reporter at the Wall Street Journal) &#10;https://www.simonandschuster.com/book...&#10;&#10;Wealth and Power: China’s Long March to the Twenty-first Century by Orville Schell and John Delury &#10;https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/bo...&#10;&#10;The Prince by Sue-Lin Wong (Correspondent at The Economist) &#10;https://www.economist.com/audio/podca...&#10;&#10;These databases and papers were also helpful in gaining a better understanding of Xi Jinping’s alliances and the CCP structure under his terms: &#10;&#10;Decoding Chinese Politics interactive by Asia Society Policy Institute &#10;https://asiasociety.org/policy-instit...&#10;&#10;CCP Elite Database by UCSD/Victor Shih&#10;https://chinadatalab.ucsd.edu/elites/&#10;&#10;China’s Political System in Charts: A Snapshot Before the 20th Party Congress by Susan V.

          <attvalue for="4" value="0:00&#10;[audience applause]&#10;0:03&#10;These are the 7 most powerful men in China.&#10;0:06&#10;They represent the top leadership positions of the ruling party...&#10;0:09&#10;and their identities are revealed every five years...&#10;0:11&#10;at a carefully choreographed political event&#10;0:14&#10;called the National Congress.&#10;0:16&#10;“China's Communist Party unveiled its new leadership&#10;0:18&#10;over the next five years.”&#10;0:20&#10;The order of appearance is symbolic.&#10;0:22&#10;The first person to emerge&#10;0:23&#10;is the head of the party for the next five years.&#10;0:26&#10;At the most recent event in October 2022...&#10;0:29&#10;that person was Xi Jinping&#10;0:31&#10;China's president for the last ten years...&#10;0:33&#10;who walked out in the top spot a historic third time&#10;0:36&#10;after getting rid of China's presidential term limit&#10;0:38&#10;that restricted all his predecessors to two terms.&#10;0:41&#10;A signal that he may be planning to stay in power for life.&#10;0:45&#10;The world hasn't seen a Chinese leader like this&#10;0:48&#10;since Mao Zedong...&#10;0:49&#10;the revolutionary founder of the People's Republic of China...&#10;0:52&#10;whose ruthless dictatorship&#10;0:54&#10;scarred the Chinese people for generations.&#10;0:57&#10;Xi has been compared to Mao a lot.&#10;0:59&#10;And he clearly draws from Mao's playbook.&#10;1:02&#10;But there's something else that connects these two.&#10;1:05&#10;When Xi was just a young boy...&#10;1:07&#10;Mao ruined his life.&#10;1:09&#10;Generations apart, their paths crossed unexpectedly&#10;1:12&#10;and a teenage Xi from an elite family in Beijing...&#10;1:16&#10;ended up in exile.&#10;1:17&#10;Condemned to hard labor in the countryside.&#10;1:20&#10;50 years later&#10;1:21&#10;Xi is one of the most powerful political figures in the world&#10;1:24&#10;and the only leader since Mao&#10;1:26&#10;to have unchecked power over China.&#10;1:29&#10;So how did he go from being banished in his country...&#10;1:32&#10;to taking complete control of it?&#10;1:35&#10;[sinister, electronic music]&#10;1:39&#10;[music fades]&#10;1:41&#10;Xi Jinping's connection to Mao formed&#10;1:43&#10;long before Xi was even born.&#10;1:45&#10;[dark, pensive music]&#10;1:48&#10;It goes back to when a bloody civil war was raging in China.&#10;1:52&#10;A group of radical communist revolutionaries, including Mao&#10;1:56&#10;gained influence over large swaths of mainland China...&#10;1:59&#10;and controlled a communist military called the Red Army...&#10;2:02&#10;that fought the Nationalist Party&#10;2:04&#10;ruling the Republic of China at the time.&#10;2:07&#10;At this point, the Communists were losing bad.&#10;2:10&#10;The bulk of their army was pinned down here...&#10;2:12&#10;in a communist controlled region originally established by Mao...&#10;2:16&#10;now surrounded by Nationalist forces.&#10;2:18&#10;And they were running low on food.&#10;2:20&#10;So the Red Army decided to launch a bold attack...&#10;2:23&#10;to break through the Nationalist forces and evacuate the roughly&#10;2:27&#10;130,000 communist soldiers and civilians stuck here.&#10;2:32&#10;On October 16th, 1934, they made their move...&#10;2:35&#10;and attacked a weaker part of the enemy line.&#10;2:38&#10;They broke through.&#10;2:39&#10;And even though their numbers quickly dropped&#10;2:41&#10;with thousands dying and thousands more&#10;2:43&#10;fleeing to the countryside...&#10;2:45&#10;around 86,000 stuck together and pushed on.&#10;2:49&#10;This was the beginning of a year-long&#10;2:51&#10;historic retreat called the Long March.&#10;2:54&#10;The journey to establish a new communist base...&#10;2:56&#10;far from the Nationalist forces.&#10;3:01&#10;Mao, who used to be a military leader&#10;3:03&#10;wasn't in charge at this time.&#10;3:05&#10;He'd insisted on using guerrilla tactics&#10;3:07&#10;which had heavily influenced the Red Army earlier in the war.&#10;3:10&#10;But that approach had fallen out of favor and he was demoted.&#10;3:14&#10;The Long March changed that.&#10;3:16&#10;After escaping the siege here&#10;3:17&#10;the Red Army continued to suffer relentless attacks&#10;3:20&#10;by the pursuing Nationalist army.&#10;3:22&#10;The military leaders of the march&#10;3:23&#10;had pushed for a more traditional wartime strategy&#10;3:25&#10;of direct confrontation...&#10;3:27&#10;rather than Mao's guerrilla tactics.&#10;3:29&#10;And the result was catastrophic for the Red Army.&#10;3:32&#10;Less than half of the original escape group&#10;3:34&#10;survived the first three months alone.&#10;3:36&#10;So it was at this first stopping point&#10;3:38&#10;where Communist Party leader Zhou Enlai...&#10;3:40&#10;handed military leadership back to Mao.&#10;3:43&#10;And Mao picked an end point for the march... here.&#10;3:47&#10;800 miles away in rural northern China.&#10;3:50&#10;But they didn't go straight for it.&#10;3:52&#10;Mao led the Red Army deep into the mountains&#10;3:54&#10;where he predicted lighter resistance.&#10;3:57&#10;And he was right.&#10;3:58&#10;But the journey was still brutal.&#10;4:01&#10;It was nine more months of nonstop marching&#10;4:03&#10;and fighting along this several thousand mile route...&#10;4:06&#10;before they ultimately arrived in northern China...&#10;4:09&#10;where a guerrilla base led by a communist revolutaionary&#10;4:12&#10;named Xi Zhongxun, offered Mao's army refuge...&#10;4:15&#10;bringing the Long March to an end.&#10;4:19&#10;That man was Xi Jinping's father.&#10;4:24&#10;In the end, fewer than 8,000 of the original marchers survived.&#10;4:29&#10;Even though thousands died on the Long March&#10;4:31&#10;from starvation and fighting and disease...&#10;4:34&#10;Mao's leadership was credited&#10;4:35&#10;with saving the Red Army from total annihilation.&#10;4:38&#10;And he became the de facto head of the party&#10;4:40&#10;as well as the military...&#10;4:42&#10;entrusted with rebuilding the army&#10;4:43&#10;to take on the Nationalist forces for total control of China.&#10;4:47&#10;“Wherever and however...&#10;4:50&#10;the Red Troops move into battle...&#10;4:52&#10;they spread the glory of Mao Zedong.”&#10;4:56&#10;This is a good stopping point in the story to talk about how&#10;4:58&#10;power in the Chinese Communist Party or CCP works.&#10;5:02&#10;Officially, the highest level of authority&#10;5:04&#10;is a group called the Central Committee&#10;5:06&#10;and is responsible for all of the party's major policy decisions.&#10;5:10&#10;Within the Central Committee is a select group of officials&#10;5:13&#10;called the Political Bureau or Politburo.&#10;5:16&#10;In most Communist parties, like that of the former Soviet Union...&#10;5:20&#10;the Politburo represents the most powerful members of the party&#10;5:23&#10;besides the General Secretary.&#10;5:25&#10;But the Chinese Communist Party has a key distinction&#10;5:27&#10;that makes it unique.&#10;5:29&#10;It has one more even smaller selection&#10;5:31&#10;of top officials who ultimately have the final say.&#10;5:34&#10;An elite class of Politburo members called the Politburo Standing Committee.&#10;5:38&#10;This group, which includes the General Secretary&#10;5:41&#10;holds supreme control over the Central Committee&#10;5:43&#10;dictates the will of the party and is in full control&#10;5:46&#10;of the Central Military Commission&#10;5:48&#10;which oversees China's defense.&#10;5:51&#10;Mao's promotion during the Long March landed him here&#10;5:54&#10;in the highest position of the military&#10;5:56&#10;and the Politburo Standing Committee.&#10;5:58&#10;Even though he was considered the de facto head of the party&#10;6:00&#10;when the Long March ended in 1935...&#10;6:03&#10;he officially became head of the party in 1943.&#10;6:07&#10;With both the party and the military under his control...&#10;6:09&#10;Mao began to exploit the system to ensure&#10;6:12&#10;he remained at the top for the rest of his life.&#10;6:17&#10;At Mao's first National Congress&#10;6:18&#10;as the official party leader in 1945...&#10;6:21&#10;the party introduced a resolution that brought his influence&#10;6:24&#10;to a whole new level.&#10;6:27&#10;They unified the party around a single understanding of its history...&#10;6:30&#10;and declared Mao's political ideology&#10;6:33&#10;later called Mao Tse-Tung Thought or Maoism...&#10;6:35&#10;as the unquestioned guiding principle&#10;6:37&#10;of the Chinese Communist Party.&#10;6:39&#10;Basically, Mao's ideas or policy decisions&#10;6:42&#10;could no longer be challenged by anyone.&#10;6:45&#10;It was here he unveiled his equivalent at the time&#10;6:47&#10;of the Politburo Standing Committee.&#10;6:49&#10;The four other top party leaders...&#10;6:51&#10;all long marchers deeply loyal to Mao.&#10;6:54&#10;Like Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai...&#10;6:57&#10;who would go on to hold some of the most powerful positions&#10;6:59&#10;in the future government.&#10;7:01&#10;Four years later, Mao declared final victory for the Communists&#10;7:04&#10;in a decades long Chinese civil war&#10;7:06&#10;and established a new country:&#10;7:08&#10;The People's Republic of China, or PRC.&#10;7:11&#10;“Mao Tse-tung, once a lowly party worker...&#10;7:14&#10;now assumed the stature of a dominant figure&#10;7:17&#10;in all of Eastern Asia.”&#10;7:20&#10;But winning a revolution isn't the same as running a country.&#10;7:24&#10;Because now that you're running a country&#10;7:25&#10;there's all these other things you have to do&#10;7:27&#10;like deliver the mail and like build a dam and stuff like that.&#10;7:31&#10;You can't possibly have the party do all these things.&#10;7:35&#10;So the party set up a government that would take&#10;7:37&#10;the policy decisions made by the Politburo Standing Committee&#10;7:40&#10;and figure out a way to make them a reality.&#10;7:42&#10;And so it evolved to a system where...&#10;7:45&#10;the party would make all the important decisions...&#10;7:48&#10;and especially the Politburo Standing Committee.&#10;7:52&#10;Then, as it is today...&#10;7:54&#10;many of these decisions would go to the State Council.&#10;7:57&#10;So the State Council was the highest decision-making body&#10;8:00&#10;on the state side, led by the Premier of China.&#10;8:04&#10;The Premier of China, by the way, is almost always&#10;8:07&#10;a member of the Politburo Standing Committee.&#10;8:10&#10;One way Mao kept a tight grip on power over the years&#10;8:13&#10;was by promoting those loyal to him to top positions&#10;8:15&#10;in the party in government.&#10;8:17&#10;Whether they had government experience or not.&#10;8:20&#10;For example, Zhou Enlai...&#10;8:22&#10;the former party leader&#10;8:23&#10;who helped Mao rise to power during the Long March...&#10;8:26&#10;became China's first premier.&#10;8:29&#10;The advantage of that is that they could never challenge him.&#10;8:31&#10;The disadvantage of that is&#10;8:33&#10;they didn't know what they were doing&#10;8:34&#10;and so administration suffered...&#10;8:37&#10;policy outcomes suffered.&#10;8:41&#10;Long March survivors often became party elites under Mao.&#10;8:44&#10;Xi Jinping's father, for example, was appointed&#10;8:47&#10;Secretary General of the State Council...&#10;8:49&#10;and as the son of a Long Marcher&#10;8:51&#10;young Xi was given the informal title of Princeling.&#10;8:55&#10;Mao succeeded in never giving up his power during his lifetime.&#10;8:58&#10;His unchecked policies resulted in massive famines&#10;9:01&#10;and widespread persecution&#10;9:03&#10;that cost between 40 and 80 million lives over a span of decades...&#10;9:07&#10;and culminated in the disastrous Cultural Revolution.&#10;9:10&#10;A violent final attempt from Mao to consolidate his power&#10;9:13&#10;and force loyalty to the practice of Maoism.&#10;9:17&#10;The idea was to make himself and his ideas eternal.&#10;9:21&#10;The way he viewed communist figureheads&#10;9:22&#10;like Lenin and Marx before him.&#10;9:25&#10;Anyone that didn't fall in line with Mao’s ideology&#10;9:27&#10;was publicly humiliated...&#10;9:29&#10;impoverished...&#10;9:30&#10;excluded from society, and, in many cases&#10;9:32&#10;executed.&#10;9:34&#10;Either at the hands of the army...&#10;9:36&#10;or by a militant youth group obsessed with enforcing Maoism:&#10;9:39&#10;The Red Guards.&#10;9:41&#10;[cheering]&#10;9:51&#10;Even those closest to the dictator&#10;9:53&#10;weren’t safe from his purges during the Cultural Revolution.&#10;9:57&#10;High level officials&#10;9:58&#10;including members of the Politburo Standing Committee&#10;10:00&#10;and Long Marchers...&#10;10:01&#10;were removed from their positions.&#10;10:03&#10;Liu Shaoqi was denounced as a traitor and died&#10;10:06&#10;while imprisoned under harsh conditions.&#10;10:08&#10;Mao also removed the Chief of Staff of the Army&#10;10:11&#10;and replaced him with a Maoist...&#10;10:13&#10;leaving no one left to oppose him in the military.&#10;10:15&#10;Mao's handpicked successor&#10;10:17&#10;who always appeared loyally by his side&#10;10:19&#10;in photos and propaganda posters&#10;10:21&#10;died under mysterious circumstances&#10;10:23&#10;when his plane crashed as he was fleeing to the Soviet Union.&#10;10:27&#10;Mao later denounced him as a traitor.&#10;10:29&#10;He denounced Xi's father, too.&#10;10:31&#10;This is a photo of Xi senior&#10;10:33&#10;being restrained and publicly criticized&#10;10:35&#10;by the Red Guards at the height of the Cultural Revolution.&#10;10:38&#10;He would remain a prisoner in Beijing for 8 years following this.&#10;10:43&#10;With his father purged...&#10;10:44&#10;Xi Jinping, 15 at the time&#10;10:46&#10;was expelled from his elite school in Beijing&#10;10:48&#10;and sent to work in the countryside.&#10;10:51&#10;He had to live in a cave and do hard manual labor.&#10;10:55&#10;His food was barely enough for&#10;10:58&#10;a growing young person.&#10;11:01&#10;And Chairman Mao was responsible for all of it.&#10;11:05&#10;But then... Mao died.&#10;11:08&#10;The Cultural Revolution ended.&#10;11:10&#10;His successor was Deng Xiaoping...&#10;11:12&#10;one of the Politburo Standing Committee members&#10;11:14&#10;who was removed from power during the Cultural Revolution.&#10;11:17&#10;Who just before Mao died...&#10;11:19&#10;started making a promise to fellow exiled party veterans.&#10;11:23&#10;Deng Xiaoping signaled credibly...&#10;11:26&#10;to all the surviving Long Marchers&#10;11:28&#10;that he wanted to rehabilitate people.&#10;11:31&#10;So when Mao died, they all supported the rehabilitation of Deng.&#10;11:34&#10;And as soon as Deng was rehabilitated&#10;11:36&#10;he went ahead and rehabilitated all these people.&#10;11:39&#10;With experienced leadership back in place&#10;11:41&#10;the party needed to figure out&#10;11:43&#10;how to prevent something like this...&#10;11:49&#10;from ever happening again.&#10;11:51&#10;In order to undo Mao's cult of personality...&#10;11:54&#10;the party introduced a second historical resolution in 1981.&#10;11:58&#10;It condemned periods of Mao's rule...&#10;12:00&#10;and emphasized a renewed commitment to collective leadership...&#10;12:04&#10;vowing to oppose the consolidation of power&#10;12:06&#10;around one person moving forward.&#10;12:08&#10;The successors to Mao didn't want a dictatorship.&#10;12:12&#10;So they divided up these positions&#10;12:15&#10;and put them in the hands of different people.&#10;12:18&#10;Like Mao, Deng kept tight control&#10;12:20&#10;over the Central Military Commission as its chairman...&#10;12:23&#10;and held a leadership position in the government.&#10;12:25&#10;But was never head of state.&#10;12:27&#10;He never held the highest position in the party either.&#10;12:29&#10;Instead, he set up a new advisory commission&#10;12:32&#10;and served as its chairman...&#10;12:33&#10;which allowed him to influence the party's direction...&#10;12:36&#10;without positioning himself directly on top of it.&#10;12:39&#10;This allowed a power sharing structure&#10;12:40&#10;while still making Deng the de facto leader of China&#10;12:43&#10;until he stepped down in 1989...&#10;12:45&#10;following the Army's massacre of students protesting in Tiananmen Square.&#10;12:49&#10;“A protester suddenly ran into the middle of the street&#10;12:53&#10;and in front of the oncoming tanks.”&#10;12:55&#10;“Anger at Deng Xiaoping, the entire Chinese government...&#10;12:58&#10;it had the real feeling of rebellion in the streets of Beijing.”&#10;13:03&#10;“People want to fight the military out of their city.”&#10;13:08&#10;Deng and his ideology&#10;13:09&#10;which moved away from Maoism, set a precedent of sharing power.&#10;13:13&#10;He opened up China and established economic ties&#10;13:16&#10;with these countries...&#10;13:17&#10;and was the first PRC leader to visit the US in 1979.&#10;13:21&#10;“Today, we take another step in the historic...&#10;13:24&#10;normalization of relations&#10;13:26&#10;which we have begun this year.”&#10;13:29&#10;Deng’s reforms became the foundation&#10;13:31&#10;for decades of economic prosperity&#10;13:33&#10;that led China to having the world's second largest economy over time...&#10;13:36&#10;and being on the verge of becoming the world's next superpower.&#10;13:40&#10;“Communism is creating a consumer society.”&#10;13:42&#10;“Also reminds you that the standard of living in China is going up.”&#10;13:46&#10;“Here... capitalism rules.”&#10;13:49&#10;One thing power sharing did lead to...&#10;13:53&#10;was a lot of policy innovation&#10;13:56&#10;and then some degree of decentralization.&#10;13:59&#10;And both of these things helped China's economy enormously.&#10;14:05&#10;Which is why this period of economic growth and reform&#10;14:08&#10;stretching over roughly 30 years is known as the Deng era.&#10;14:11&#10;Whether he wanted to or not, Deng kept his word...&#10;14:13&#10;and never tried to consolidate absolute power around himself.&#10;14:17&#10;He did end up sharing power.&#10;14:19&#10;And that set the stage for power sharing in the party...&#10;14:24&#10;until the rise of Xi Jinping.&#10;14:27&#10;So what was Xi doing all this time?&#10;14:29&#10;[contemplative music]&#10;14:31&#10;When Mao died in 1976&#10;14:33&#10;Xi was back in Beijing studying communist philosophy...&#10;14:37&#10;even though the Chinese Communist Party had ruined Xi's family...&#10;14:40&#10;He had joined it.&#10;14:41&#10;Just as the Cultural Revolution was winding down.&#10;14:44&#10;But why?&#10;14:45&#10;Personally, he might begrudge Chairman Mao&#10;14:48&#10;for doing all this terrible things to his family...&#10;14:51&#10;but I think at this time he also recognized that in the system&#10;14:55&#10;of the Chinese Communist Party power is everything.&#10;14:59&#10;Without power, you're nothing.&#10;15:01&#10;But in order to get that power...&#10;15:03&#10;Xi did something unexpected.&#10;15:05&#10;He left Beijing.&#10;15:06&#10;As his competitors were fiercely competing&#10;15:09&#10;with each other in the 1980s and 1990s.&#10;15:12&#10;He sort of got out of their way...&#10;15:14&#10;and went to the provinces.&#10;15:17&#10;He took positions in party leadership&#10;15:18&#10;in rural, poor provinces all around China...&#10;15:21&#10;where there were no other princelings to compete with.&#10;15:24&#10;First, in Hebei, a poor rural province outside of Beijing...&#10;15:28&#10;where he easily reached the top spot as party secretary.&#10;15:31&#10;Then in Fujian, a heavily militarized region&#10;15:34&#10;where top members of the army were stationed.&#10;15:36&#10;He moved up the ranks to party secretary here, too.&#10;15:38&#10;Before becoming the governor of the province a few years later.&#10;15:42&#10;After making powerful friends in the military...&#10;15:44&#10;Xi went here... where he once again&#10;15:46&#10;assumes the office of party secretary...&#10;15:48&#10;and grew his support on the civilian side.&#10;15:52&#10;This strategy of moving around&#10;15:53&#10;didn't just give Xi a leg up in areas&#10;15:55&#10;where competition was slim.&#10;15:57&#10;It also gave him credibility...&#10;15:59&#10;as a humble, hard working party leader...&#10;16:01&#10;and he cultivated a growing group of supporters&#10;16:04&#10;who would come back into play years down the line.&#10;16:08&#10;It was his last stop and his shortest one&#10;16:11&#10;that ultimately got him back to Beijing.&#10;16:14&#10;A brief stint in the top party spot in Shanghai in 2007...&#10;16:17&#10;where he rehabilitated the city's image&#10;16:19&#10;following a high-level corruption scandal.&#10;16:22&#10;Xi developed a reputation here&#10;16:23&#10;as a prudent leader who toed the party line.&#10;16:26&#10;Just 7 months later, he finally returned to Beijing...&#10;16:29&#10;having been promoted to the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee.&#10;16:33&#10;Basically, the people who were deciding on top leadership at the time&#10;16:38&#10;they wanted a Princeling.&#10;16:39&#10;But they didn't want a princeling&#10;16:41&#10;who was too ambitious or too strong.&#10;16:44&#10;So Xi Jinping&#10;16:45&#10;he was seen as less ambitious&#10;16:48&#10;because he was willing to go to the countryside&#10;16:50&#10;and work in lower-level positions.&#10;16:54&#10;When Xi emerged as the 2007&#10;16:55&#10;National Congress and leadership unveiling...&#10;16:57&#10;he was one of the 9 most powerful men in the country.&#10;17:01&#10;It was at this moment that his strategic climb...&#10;17:03&#10;over 17 long years in the countryside paid off.&#10;17:07&#10;Big time.&#10;17:09&#10;When the General Secretary stepped down in 2012...&#10;17:12&#10;Xi emerged at the top spot in the party as China's leader.&#10;17:15&#10;Now the elite son of a former revolutionary&#10;17:19&#10;turned exiled peasant...&#10;17:20&#10;turned party darling...&#10;17:22&#10;was poised to seize control of everything.&#10;17:28&#10;Like Mao, Xi Jinping believes that rallying around&#10;17:31&#10;a single figure is crucial to the party's survival.&#10;17:34&#10;Rather than the collective leadership&#10;17:36&#10;Deng’s reforms had normalized.&#10;17:37&#10;So pretty much as soon as Xi Jinping came to power.&#10;17:40&#10;He started getting rid of people.&#10;17:43&#10;“The news... four top officials removed for taking bribes&#10;17:48&#10;was announced on state TV.”&#10;17:49&#10;“Xi Jinping has just sacked his foreign minister.”&#10;17:52&#10;“Just sacked his defense minister.”&#10;17:54&#10;“He sacked a whole lot of other people at the top&#10;17:56&#10;of the military establishment.”&#10;17:58&#10;“The former security czar&#10;17:59&#10;has not been seen in public for more than a year.”&#10;18:01&#10;“The nvestigation against Zhou allows the Chinese president&#10;18:04&#10;to remove those opposed to his reforms.”&#10;18:07&#10;He launched a major anti-corruption campaign...&#10;18:10&#10;as soon as he took power in late 2012, early ‘13...&#10;18:15&#10;which led to the arrests of hundreds of senior-level officials&#10;18:19&#10;as well as military officers.&#10;18:22&#10;These purges targeted Xi's rivals in the party...&#10;18:25&#10;whose vacant positions he filled with his own supporters.&#10;18:28&#10;After this massive purge...&#10;18:30&#10;Xi Jinping was in very tight control over&#10;18:35&#10;both the party and also the Chinese military...&#10;18:39&#10;thereby making him the most powerful leader&#10;18:43&#10;of the Chinese Communist Party since the death of Mao.&#10;18:46&#10;That pattern continued in the second term&#10;18:48&#10;where he unveiled 5 new faces of the Politburo Standing Committee...&#10;18:52&#10;three of them with close personal ties to Xi.&#10;18:55&#10;In 2021, Xi pulled off one of his most dramatic acts yet...&#10;19:00&#10;to enforce his influence over the Chinese Communist Party.&#10;19:04&#10;He introduced a third historic resolution&#10;19:06&#10;that unified the party's ideology&#10;19:08&#10;around one clear line of thinking:&#10;19:10&#10;Xi Jinping Thought.&#10;19:13&#10;Xi's personal political ideology...&#10;19:15&#10;would now be the core in the party's thinking...&#10;19:17&#10;political stance and action.&#10;19:20&#10;Basically, Xi Jinping's ideas could no longer be challenged.&#10;19:24&#10;And they weren't for many years.&#10;19:27&#10;During Xi's first 10 years in power&#10;19:29&#10;the size of China's economy more than doubled.&#10;19:32&#10;So did average individual income.&#10;19:34&#10;So did military spending.&#10;19:36&#10;Under his leadership...&#10;19:37&#10;China's presence on the world stage has grown too.&#10;19:40&#10;Positioning the rising superpower&#10;19:41&#10;to take on the role of an aggressor, externally.&#10;19:44&#10;Reasserting claims over parts of the South China Sea&#10;19:47&#10;Intimidating Taiwan and Tibet&#10;19:48&#10;and stripping democratic process in Hong Kong.&#10;19:51&#10;Inside its own borders&#10;19:53&#10;strict Internet censorship and surveillance are widespread...&#10;19:56&#10;and oppression of Uyghurs...&#10;19:58&#10;a mostly minority Muslim ethnic group...&#10;20:00&#10;is marked by human rights abuses.&#10;20:03&#10;But it wasn't until Covid that Xi saw&#10;20:05&#10;the first real challenge to his authority.&#10;20:07&#10;“Anger in China is growing.”&#10;20:10&#10;“Video showing protester is in Xinjiang...&#10;20:12&#10;fed up with China's zero Covid rules.”&#10;20:17&#10;“The boldest public challenge yet for leader Xi Jinping.”&#10;20:21&#10;With these protests all around the country...&#10;20:23&#10;and the party's reputation in peril.&#10;20:26&#10;Xi reversed the failed policy.&#10;20:28&#10;But is now faced with a shaky economy...&#10;20:31&#10;and cracks in his unchecked authority.&#10;20:39&#10;It was just weeks before the widespread protests&#10;20:41&#10;at the 20th National Congress in 2022...&#10;20:45&#10;that Xi walked out in the leading position a third time.&#10;20:48&#10;He had already locked in the presidency for another five years...&#10;20:52&#10;and unveiled a Politburo Standing Committee&#10;20:54&#10;completely packed with those loyal to him.&#10;20:56&#10;After removing the final senior members of the party&#10;20:59&#10;that had ties to his predecessor.&#10;21:01&#10;Now there is no one left in party&#10;21:03&#10;or military leadership whose ideology differs from Xi.&#10;21:07&#10;I don't think anyone can push him out at this point.&#10;21:11&#10;I think Xi will be the most powerful leader in China...&#10;21:16&#10;as long as he's alive and conscious.&#10;21:21&#10;Thanks so much for watching this episode of Atlas.&#10;21:23&#10;So many teammates worked on this piece.&#10;21:25&#10;A small army of editors,

          <attvalue for="1" value="In his new book, political scientist Brian Klaas asks whether every move we make could potentially produce a domino effect. With reference to the mathematical concept of chaos theory, Klaas draws attention to the fact that small, seemingly trivial events can have far-reaching consequences.

and&#10;0:08&#10;professor at University College London&#10;0:10&#10;is the author of the new book fluke&#10;0:13&#10;chance chaos and why everything we do&#10;0:16&#10;matters Walter Isaacson speaks with him&#10;0:19&#10;on what chaos theory can teach us about&#10;0:21&#10;the way the world really&#10;0:24&#10;works thank you Chris Johan and Brian&#10;0:26&#10;Claus welcome to the show thanks for&#10;0:29&#10;having here your new book is called&#10;0:32&#10;fluke uh the subtitle is Chance chaos&#10;0:35&#10;and why everything we do matters let's&#10;0:38&#10;start by just explaining what is a&#10;0:41&#10;fluke a fluke is a highly consequential&#10;What is a fluke&#10;0:44&#10;event that happens by chance or is&#10;0:47&#10;arbitrary or random and so I argue in&#10;0:50&#10;the book that our world is shaped by&#10;0:52&#10;these and our lives are shaped by these&#10;0:53&#10;much more than we imagine but we just&#10;0:55&#10;pretend otherwise because it's much&#10;0:57&#10;nicer to imagine that we have neat and&#10;0:58&#10;tidy stories to make sense of our world&#10;1:01&#10;and our own lives well one example I&#10;1:03&#10;think you use is the Arab Spring a&#10;1:05&#10;Tunisian uh uh vendor explain how that&#10;1:09&#10;does that yeah so you've got a sort of&#10;1:12&#10;moment in the Middle East in late 2010&#10;1:15&#10;where there's a lot of people who are&#10;1:16&#10;pretty angry at their dictatorships and&#10;1:18&#10;all of a sudden one of those angry&#10;1:20&#10;people decides to light himself on fire&#10;1:22&#10;in central Tunisia Muhammad buzi and&#10;1:24&#10;this spark creates a confguration that&#10;1:27&#10;basically consumes the entire East leads&#10;1:31&#10;to several regimes collapsing and then&#10;1:33&#10;also the Syrian Civil War which hundreds&#10;1:35&#10;of thousands of people died in and so&#10;1:37&#10;when you think about this you think&#10;1:38&#10;about you know would this have happened&#10;1:40&#10;but for this trigger in Tunisia and I&#10;1:42&#10;think this is the sort of way that our&#10;1:44&#10;world works it's partly between order&#10;1:45&#10;and disorder where you have these Trends&#10;1:47&#10;and these sort of aspects where you get&#10;1:49&#10;towards what's called The Tipping Point&#10;1:51&#10;or the edge of chaos and then a single&#10;1:53&#10;thing can tip you over that edge and&#10;1:56&#10;create an extremely consequential event&#10;1:58&#10;that shifts how the world works&#10;2:00&#10;well let me push back on talk about&#10;2:02&#10;things what you address in the book&#10;2:04&#10;which is and let's take the Arab Spring&#10;2:07&#10;uh the world seemed ready for that as&#10;2:10&#10;you said it was all the kindling was&#10;2:12&#10;there for it had that one Tunisian event&#10;2:15&#10;not have happened isn't it likely that&#10;2:18&#10;there still would have been an Arab&#10;2:20&#10;Spring and that these random events&#10;2:22&#10;actually don't cause things they just&#10;2:24&#10;like the tiny spark and there'd be other&#10;2:26&#10;Sparks well I don't I don't think so and&#10;Sand pile model&#10;2:29&#10;I think the nature of spark matters as&#10;2:30&#10;well right so the visceral nature of&#10;2:32&#10;this protest did create protest&#10;2:34&#10;movements in Tunisia and then those&#10;2:36&#10;spread further right now what you are&#10;2:38&#10;right about and this is something I do&#10;2:39&#10;explain in fluke is that there's this&#10;2:41&#10;thing called self-organized criticality&#10;2:43&#10;or the sand pile model which I'm&#10;2:45&#10;borrowing from physics which helps make&#10;2:46&#10;sense of how these triggers or&#10;2:48&#10;Avalanches can be produced so if you&#10;2:50&#10;imagine sort of adding a grain of sand&#10;2:52&#10;to a pile over and over and over&#10;2:54&#10;eventually that pile of sand gets so&#10;2:56&#10;tall that a single grain can cause an&#10;2:59&#10;avalanche and what I'm arguing is that&#10;3:01&#10;in the Arab Spring case for example the&#10;3:02&#10;grain of sand the sand pile was really&#10;3:05&#10;really tall so it just took that one&#10;3:07&#10;extra person to cause the collapse now I&#10;3:10&#10;think there's a problem here because I&#10;3:12&#10;think that we have designed a world that&#10;3:13&#10;is particularly prone to these&#10;3:15&#10;Avalanches because the sand pile is&#10;3:17&#10;extremely high by Design and what I mean&#10;3:20&#10;by that is that you have this sort of&#10;3:21&#10;system that operates with optimization&#10;3:24&#10;and efficiency as its main priorities&#10;3:27&#10;and this means that we have no slack in&#10;3:28&#10;the system so you a couple years ago a&#10;3:31&#10;gust of wind hit a boat in the Suez&#10;3:33&#10;Canal and twisted it sideways and it&#10;3:35&#10;caused over $50 billion of economic&#10;3:37&#10;damage which was never possible for one&#10;3:39&#10;boat to do in the past and so you know I&#10;3:42&#10;think what we're doing is we're&#10;3:43&#10;basically creating a world in which&#10;3:45&#10;those Avalanches those Sparks as I put&#10;3:48&#10;them before are more consequential and&#10;3:50&#10;more likely to upend our social lives so&#10;3:53&#10;is the problem of the sand piles that&#10;3:56&#10;have become precarious or is the problem&#10;3:58&#10;the one grain of that happens to come in&#10;World War I&#10;4:01&#10;so it's both and they couldn't exist&#10;4:03&#10;without each other because you know if&#10;4:04&#10;you have somebody like themselves on&#10;4:05&#10;fire in Norway tomorrow it's not going&#10;4:07&#10;to cause a revolution because the system&#10;4:09&#10;has slack and people are happy right now&#10;4:12&#10;in in the Middle East there were people&#10;4:13&#10;who were unhappy with their&#10;4:14&#10;dictatorships for a very long time and&#10;4:16&#10;there weren't Mass protests and there&#10;4:17&#10;weren't large scale Civil Wars and then&#10;4:19&#10;all of a sudden they happened all at&#10;4:21&#10;once I I go through an example in the&#10;4:23&#10;book of something similar to explain&#10;4:25&#10;this Dynamic of the onset of World War I&#10;4:27&#10;which many historians have debated and I&#10;4:30&#10;talk about the sort of you know the&#10;4:32&#10;standard story is the assassination of&#10;4:33&#10;arch Duke France Ferdinand where he&#10;4:35&#10;sputters to a stop right next to his&#10;4:37&#10;assassin and that's the fluke that&#10;4:39&#10;triggers the war now of course you had&#10;4:40&#10;to have all sorts of other things in&#10;4:42&#10;place for that to actually happen this&#10;4:44&#10;series of alliances that made it more&#10;4:46&#10;likely that a single death could&#10;4:48&#10;actually create a world conflict but I&#10;4:50&#10;also talk about in the book how he&#10;4:52&#10;almost died in a hunting accident many&#10;4:54&#10;months before that when he was in&#10;4:56&#10;England and if that had happened I don't&#10;4:58&#10;know if World War I would have started&#10;5:00&#10;but I certainly know that it would not&#10;5:01&#10;have happened in the same way and I&#10;5:03&#10;think what we often do is we have these&#10;5:04&#10;sort of binary categories the war starts&#10;5:07&#10;or it doesn't and actually what I'm&#10;5:08&#10;arguing through chaos theory is that the&#10;5:10&#10;way the war starts is also important so&#10;5:13&#10;if it's triggered by an assassination or&#10;5:15&#10;if the guy gets killed in an accident in&#10;5:16&#10;a hunting accident that will affect&#10;5:18&#10;world history and I think instead what&#10;5:20&#10;we try to do is impose these really you&#10;5:22&#10;know sort of storybook narratives on how&#10;5:24&#10;the world works and they write out this&#10;5:27&#10;noise that I actually think is highly&#10;5:28&#10;consequential how the world works one of&#10;5:31&#10;the other examples you use is Donald&#10;5:33&#10;Trump being at the White House&#10;5:35&#10;correspondence dinner and being the&#10;5:37&#10;subject of a Barack Obama scathing comic&#10;5:40&#10;routine and so he decides to run for&#10;5:43&#10;president using that type of okay that&#10;5:45&#10;was a fluke that had lots of&#10;5:47&#10;consequences doesn't that have a bit of&#10;5:50&#10;a danger of people like me who was&#10;5:52&#10;covering things at the time we missed&#10;5:54&#10;something big in this country which was&#10;5:56&#10;a deep resentment that was going to lead&#10;5:59&#10;to somebody like Donald Trump and for&#10;6:01&#10;that matter Donald Trump was somehow or&#10;6:04&#10;another going to get in his race one way&#10;6:05&#10;or the other don't we miss the&#10;6:07&#10;importance of the big forces when we&#10;6:09&#10;look for the flukes yeah so I I agree&#10;How high the sand pile is&#10;6:12&#10;with you're highlighting there because I&#10;6:14&#10;think that one of the things that we do&#10;6:15&#10;need to be aware of is how high the sand&#10;6:17&#10;pile is to to go back to the previous&#10;6:18&#10;analogy right so we have an obligation&#10;6:20&#10;to explain our world with with what I&#10;6:22&#10;think are two things one is that&#10;6:24&#10;sometimes there is much more arbitrary&#10;6:26&#10;and accidental forces that do matter&#10;6:28&#10;right and we're on we're constantly told&#10;6:30&#10;to focus on the signal and ignore the&#10;6:32&#10;noise and the argument I'm making is&#10;6:33&#10;that the noise actually has some pretty&#10;6:35&#10;profound consequences for the way the&#10;6:37&#10;world works but it's also thinking about&#10;6:39&#10;why are we more prone to flukes than we&#10;6:42&#10;are in the past right I think we've&#10;6:43&#10;upended the way the situation in in sort&#10;6:46&#10;of global Affairs has used to work&#10;6:48&#10;compared to how it works today so for&#10;6:50&#10;example when you think about like the&#10;6:51&#10;vast stretch of human history most&#10;6:53&#10;people dealt with uncertainty in their&#10;6:55&#10;daily life they had to deal with the&#10;6:56&#10;question of you know how you find food&#10;6:59&#10;or whether you're going to be eaten by a&#10;7:01&#10;saber-tooth tiger but the world didn't&#10;7:02&#10;change that much year toe and what we&#10;7:05&#10;have now is we have a world where you&#10;7:06&#10;know Starbucks is always the same but&#10;7:08&#10;democracies are collapsing and rivers&#10;7:10&#10;are drying up and I think that to your&#10;7:12&#10;point to your question is suggesting&#10;7:14&#10;that we've created a world with less&#10;7:16&#10;slack so that you have these long-term&#10;7:18&#10;trends that create worlds in which&#10;7:20&#10;flukes can actually have high high&#10;7:22&#10;consequences so if we had dealt with the&#10;7:24&#10;problem of the lingering resentment in&#10;7:26&#10;the American public then Trump might&#10;7:28&#10;have had a joke told about him he might&#10;7:29&#10;have run for office and he would have&#10;7:31&#10;gotten 0% of the vote so I think that&#10;7:33&#10;the combination of order and disorder or&#10;7:35&#10;flukes in these long-term trends they're&#10;7:37&#10;the way that the world actually works&#10;7:39&#10;and I think what we do instead is we&#10;7:41&#10;tend to focus on the sort of big&#10;7:43&#10;explanations the long-term explanations&#10;7:45&#10;for social change and I think these&#10;7:47&#10;pivot Points that can start with a joke&#10;7:50&#10;do actually uh change the world you'd&#10;7:52&#10;say that one of the mistakes we make in&#10;7:54&#10;looking at history or looking at our&#10;7:56&#10;times is that we impose I'm not sure you&#10;7:58&#10;use the word oppos but we have a&#10;8:00&#10;narrative Arc that we tend to believe in&#10;8:02&#10;and that leads us to believe in&#10;8:04&#10;conspiracy theories explain that to me&#10;Humans are pattern detection machines&#10;8:07&#10;yeah so humans are basically pattern&#10;8:09&#10;detection machines right we we've&#10;8:11&#10;evolved to have brains that latch onto&#10;8:13&#10;patterns and that's because having a&#10;8:15&#10;false positive where you think there&#10;8:17&#10;might be a saber-tooth tiger lurking in&#10;8:19&#10;the grass when you see it you know&#10;8:21&#10;rustling that's not going to lead to&#10;8:23&#10;your death but if you have a false&#10;8:24&#10;negative where there is a pattern and&#10;8:26&#10;you don't detect it so you see rustling&#10;8:28&#10;in the grass and you don't think there's&#10;8:29&#10;a tiger there you will die so Evolution&#10;8:32&#10;has basically over engineered our brains&#10;8:34&#10;to be sensitive to patterns now this&#10;8:36&#10;relates to conspiracy theories because&#10;8:38&#10;sometimes random events happen and also&#10;8:40&#10;sometimes small changes can have really&#10;8:42&#10;big impacts and our brains are basically&#10;8:44&#10;allergic to that line of thinking so&#10;8:46&#10;when you look at something like Princess&#10;8:48&#10;Diana's death which was a a big moment&#10;8:50&#10;in British history there is this sort of&#10;8:52&#10;resistance the idea that you have you&#10;8:55&#10;know a small banal car accident causing&#10;8:58&#10;this major event events in in in&#10;9:00&#10;geopolitics or in in world affairs and&#10;9:02&#10;the same is true for Kon when you think&#10;9:04&#10;about you know conspiracy theories like&#10;9:06&#10;like Kon it's a story that makes sense&#10;9:08&#10;of this sort of hidden truth of a hidden&#10;9:10&#10;pattern that you can be inducted into&#10;9:13&#10;and the debunkers the people who tell&#10;9:14&#10;you facts about the conspiracy theory&#10;9:16&#10;they're telling you there is no story&#10;9:19&#10;right and so our brains are much more&#10;9:21&#10;likely to gravitate towards not just a&#10;9:22&#10;story but a really good story I mean the&#10;9:24&#10;story is a thriller if it were&#10;9:26&#10;fictionalized and so I think this is the&#10;9:28&#10;danger about conspiracy theories is that&#10;9:30&#10;we tend to make sense of these sort of&#10;9:33&#10;seemingly unrelated data points with a&#10;9:36&#10;stitching together that ends up being a&#10;9:38&#10;really seductive conspiracy theory and&#10;9:39&#10;it's one of the reasons why they're so&#10;9:40&#10;sticky I mean one of the problems we&#10;9:42&#10;have is so hard to debunk them because&#10;9:45&#10;you're telling the storytelling animal&#10;9:46&#10;which is what humans are ignore the&#10;9:49&#10;story there is no story and I think&#10;9:50&#10;that's one of the ways that is uh most&#10;9:52&#10;useful to think about the the&#10;9:54&#10;Persistence of these theories that sway&#10;9:56&#10;our politics and unfortunately create a&#10;9:58&#10;real world action based on the LIE when&#10;10:00&#10;it comes to the reach of conspiracy&#10;10:02&#10;theories how does the US compare to the&#10;10:04&#10;rest of the world the US has more of a&#10;How does the US compare to other countries&#10;10:06&#10;problem with conspiracy theories than&#10;10:07&#10;other peer countries uh and and that's&#10;10:09&#10;because politicians have popularized&#10;10:12&#10;them more than in other peer countries&#10;10:14&#10;so I live in the UK I I I'm from the US&#10;10:17&#10;and you see a mainstreaming of&#10;10:19&#10;conspiracy theories within political&#10;10:21&#10;parties more in the United States um&#10;10:24&#10;than than in the rest of Europe and so&#10;10:25&#10;on and so I think this is a danger that&#10;10:27&#10;does exacerbate the problem when Elites&#10;10:29&#10;or people who are in politics start to&#10;10:32&#10;Pedal conspiracy theories as a way to&#10;10:34&#10;win votes and that is a uniquely&#10;10:35&#10;American phenomenon not that is that's a&#10;10:38&#10;phenomenon that's much more prominent in&#10;10:39&#10;the United States than in other pure&#10;10:40&#10;democracies and has it gotten worse in&#10;10:43&#10;terms of conspiracy theories or is it no&#10;10:46&#10;worse than it was during the Salem Witch&#10;The role of the internet&#10;10:48&#10;Trials so we've always been pattern&#10;10:50&#10;detection machines the difference is how&#10;10:51&#10;we get information so when you think&#10;10:53&#10;about the internet I think there's a&#10;10:54&#10;really profound shift that the internet&#10;10:56&#10;has produced which has never happened&#10;10:58&#10;before so every other form of&#10;11:00&#10;technological revolution around&#10;11:01&#10;information has expanded the number of&#10;11:03&#10;people who can consume information right&#10;11:05&#10;so the printing press the radio the&#10;11:08&#10;television Etc all of that created a&#10;11:10&#10;larger audience but the people who could&#10;11:12&#10;produce information and theories about&#10;11:14&#10;the way the world Works was still pretty&#10;11:16&#10;small and you had to actually seek out&#10;11:18&#10;conspiracism in you know in the distant&#10;11:20&#10;past it was harder to get whereas now&#10;11:23&#10;because anyone can produce information&#10;11:25&#10;and it can spread really really fast on&#10;11:26&#10;the internet you have the proliferation&#10;11:29&#10;of conspiracy theories that were exposed&#10;11:30&#10;to more often and algorithms that often&#10;11:33&#10;amplify them so a person who would not&#10;11:35&#10;have sought out a conspiracy theory in&#10;11:37&#10;the past is now being shown one by&#10;11:40&#10;Design from you know Tech algorithms and&#10;11:42&#10;so on and so I don't think it's that&#10;11:44&#10;we've changed I think it's the way that&#10;11:45&#10;our information pipelines operate has&#10;11:47&#10;shifted and that's made them more&#10;11:49&#10;influential in in modern politics one of&#10;11:52&#10;the ways people think about how history&#10;11:55&#10;changes is partly Grand forces it's&#10;11:58&#10;partly the role of people it's partly as&#10;12:00&#10;you do in this book the role of flukes&#10;12:02&#10;but there's also as you've described in&#10;12:04&#10;the book the role of technology that&#10;12:07&#10;suddenly movable type printing comes&#10;12:10&#10;along and you can have a Reformation&#10;12:13&#10;where uh in Europe uh tell me how your&#10;12:17&#10;book fits into the role of what&#10;12:19&#10;technology is doing to change our lives&#10;Timing of technology&#10;12:23&#10;yeah so so technology is a huge driver&#10;12:25&#10;of change in the human experience but I&#10;12:27&#10;think that one of the things that we&#10;12:28&#10;don't appreciate is how timing of&#10;12:30&#10;Technology also matters right so I I do&#10;12:32&#10;use this example in the book where I&#10;12:34&#10;talk about the printing press and how it&#10;12:35&#10;locked in the English language at this&#10;12:37&#10;specific snapshot in time and the&#10;12:39&#10;language has changed a lot less since&#10;12:41&#10;then because the technology solidified&#10;12:43&#10;how the written word had to be printed&#10;12:45&#10;right it became standardized now I think&#10;12:48&#10;about this a little bit with the&#10;12:49&#10;pandemic right now right so let's&#10;12:50&#10;imagine that the exact same virus&#10;12:52&#10;mutated in Wuhan in&#10;12:55&#10;1985 the economy would have been&#10;12:58&#10;radically different compared to how it&#10;13:00&#10;unfolded in the 2020 pandemic because&#10;13:03&#10;working from home on Zoom was impossible&#10;13:06&#10;in 1985 right so technology is one of&#10;13:08&#10;these things that has these Grand forces&#10;13:10&#10;and yes there's going to be Innovation&#10;13:11&#10;some of them are going to happen&#10;13:13&#10;regardless because it's just going to&#10;13:14&#10;work I think that you know some&#10;13:16&#10;Innovations are inevitable fire was&#10;13:18&#10;always going to be discovered by humans&#10;13:20&#10;the timing might have been a little bit&#10;13:21&#10;different but the moment of the&#10;13:23&#10;discovery I think is really important as&#10;13:24&#10;is the person who discovers it and I&#10;13:27&#10;think for example smartphones would have&#10;13:28&#10;unfolded a little bit differently if&#10;13:30&#10;Steve Jobs had not been one of the&#10;13:32&#10;people who was behind their Innovation&#10;13:34&#10;and popularization popularization so you&#10;13:36&#10;know I think there's there's a a sort of&#10;13:38&#10;interplay between these Grand forces&#10;13:40&#10;these individuals these accidents and&#10;13:43&#10;the moments or the eras in which the&#10;13:44&#10;technology emerges and all of them&#10;13:46&#10;matter I think if you just hold one of&#10;13:48&#10;them constant you don't actually have&#10;13:50&#10;the exact same world unfold one of the&#10;13:53&#10;great technological forces that's about&#10;13:55&#10;to hit us or has already hit us is&#10;13:57&#10;artificial intellig Ence especially&#10;13:59&#10;personal AI where uh everything can be&#10;14:02&#10;personalized I can use chat Bots and&#10;14:05&#10;news organizations can or people who are&#10;14:07&#10;trying to run political campaigns can&#10;14:10&#10;how is that going to fit into your&#10;14:12&#10;theory yeah so I think it's I think it's&#10;Dangers of AI&#10;14:14&#10;a danger and the reason I think it's a&#10;14:16&#10;danger is you know you go back to the&#10;14:17&#10;philosopher David Hume several hundred&#10;14:19&#10;years ago he basically raised this&#10;14:20&#10;problem of how can you know that the&#10;14:23&#10;past uh the patterns of the past are&#10;14:25&#10;going to be predictive of the patterns&#10;14:27&#10;of the future and that was already&#10;14:28&#10;something people were worried about with&#10;14:30&#10;reason in the past now I think they have&#10;14:32&#10;even more reason to be worried about it&#10;14:34&#10;because our world is changing so quickly&#10;14:36&#10;and yet AI is still trained on past&#10;14:38&#10;patterns right I mean this is the kind&#10;14:39&#10;of stuff where machine learning is&#10;14:41&#10;derived from training data and it says&#10;14:44&#10;this is how the world works the problem&#10;14:46&#10;is you can start to get into trouble a&#10;14:48&#10;if you think that you have certainty in&#10;14:49&#10;an uncertain World which I think we do&#10;14:51&#10;and AI doesn't solve that problem and B&#10;14:54&#10;if you think that the past patterns will&#10;14:55&#10;be predictive of the future and then the&#10;14:57&#10;world shifts right all of us understand&#10;14:59&#10;this idea intuitively because you know&#10;15:01&#10;meteorologists will tell us oh there was&#10;15:03&#10;a 100-year flood and we say okay why is&#10;15:06&#10;there 100-year flood every three years&#10;15:08&#10;now it's because the underlying cause&#10;15:09&#10;and effect patterns have shifted and so&#10;15:11&#10;if AI you know development is not&#10;15:13&#10;careful to this problem I think we can&#10;15:15&#10;engineer a world of false certainty of&#10;15:17&#10;huis around these new tools that gets us&#10;15:20&#10;into serious danger that's avoidable so&#10;15:23&#10;I think AI is going to be exceptionally&#10;15:24&#10;good at solving problems in what I call&#10;15:26&#10;closed systems you know Medical diagnos&#10;15:28&#10;for example but it might have some&#10;15:31&#10;dangers embedded in it with open systems&#10;15:33&#10;where the past and the future are not&#10;15:35&#10;aligned and the training data of the&#10;15:36&#10;past is actually very misaligned with&#10;15:39&#10;the underlying cause and effect Dynamics&#10;15:40&#10;in a different world that's unfolding as&#10;15:42&#10;we speak how can an understanding of the&#10;15:45&#10;role of flukes lead us to have a more&#10;15:49&#10;resilient society and let me even add a&#10;15:52&#10;more resilient personal life yeah I I&#10;Lessons from Chaos Theory&#10;15:55&#10;like this question because you know I I&#10;15:57&#10;think differently about the world and my&#10;15:59&#10;own life having written this book I I&#10;16:01&#10;was not the same person three years ago&#10;16:03&#10;and the reason for that is because I&#10;16:05&#10;think I you know I grew up in the US&#10;16:07&#10;where I was sort of told you have to&#10;16:09&#10;sort of just make your own path the sort&#10;16:11&#10;of individualist mindset the American&#10;16:13&#10;dream and so on and it's it's a culture&#10;16:15&#10;that is extremely focused on control&#10;16:17&#10;right and I describe in the book how I&#10;16:19&#10;was living you know what I describe as a&#10;16:21&#10;checklist existence and I think I think&#10;16:23&#10;when you start to think about the role&#10;16:25&#10;of these forces that are sometimes&#10;16:26&#10;arbitrary accidental and random and also&#10;16:28&#10;the chaos theory the Ripple effects of&#10;16:30&#10;our decisions it starts to liberate you&#10;16:32&#10;a little bit right it starts to make you&#10;16:34&#10;feel like you know what it's it's maybe&#10;16:36&#10;okay if I don't have so much top- down&#10;16:38&#10;control and and that's what I've&#10;16:39&#10;internalized as a lesson from the book&#10;16:41&#10;in terms of society I think the the main&#10;16:43&#10;lesson is resilience I think that we&#10;16:46&#10;have the tools to give us the illusion&#10;16:48&#10;of control more than ever before because&#10;16:50&#10;we have so much predictability and&#10;16:52&#10;stability in our daily lives that we&#10;16:54&#10;start to think that our world is also&#10;16:55&#10;stable and in fact it's the opposite the&#10;16:57&#10;stability in our daily lives is&#10;16:59&#10;happening at the same time as the world&#10;17:01&#10;is changing faster and more profoundly&#10;17:02&#10;than ever before in human history so in&#10;17:05&#10;my view this is something where&#10;17:07&#10;politicians economists Etc need to&#10;17:10&#10;understand that they are creating a&#10;17:11&#10;world without slack and the flukes are&#10;17:14&#10;always going to be there so instead of&#10;17:16&#10;imagining that we can have this top-&#10;17:18&#10;down control I think we have to have a&#10;17:19&#10;little bit less hubris and also accept&#10;17:21&#10;the limits of what what humans can and&#10;17:23&#10;cannot control and I think that's true&#10;17:25&#10;for ordinary citizens uh as well as for&#10;17:27&#10;politicians who are called in the shots&#10;17:29&#10;Brian Claus thank you so much thanks for&#10;17:32&#10;having me on

          <attvalue for="1" value="Steve Bannon famously talked about using “muzzle velocity” as a strategy: doing so much so quickly that you overwhelm the ability of the media to cover it. I think what the Trump family is doing with crypto is muzzle velocity for corruption.&#10;&#10;What they’re doing isn’t necessarily illegal. It would be if these were official campaign donations; the sums involved are so large, and the buyers include foreign nationals. But the Trump family is making this money personally. And they’re doing it across so many different crypto ventures, it’s almost impossible to keep track.&#10;&#10;So that’s what I wanted to do with this episode: try to track at least some of it.&#10;&#10;The person I’ve enlisted to help me out is Zeke Faux. He’s the author of the fantastic book “Number Go Up: Inside Crypto’s Wild Rise and Staggering Fall” and an investigative reporter at Bloomberg, where he’s been covering many of these strange Trump family crypto schemes.&#10;&#10;This episode contains strong language.&#10;&#10;Read the full transcript here: https://nytimes.com/2025/05/28/opinio...&#10;&#10;0:00 Introduction&#10;2:27 Crypto in Trump 1.0&#10;11:24 How Trump learned to love crypto&#10;21:32 World Liberty Financial and its connections&#10;37:18 Memecoins and $Trump&#10;48:32 Stablecoins and USD1&#10;54:37 The big picture&#10;1:03:29 Book recommendations&#10;&#10;Watch more on @EzraKleinShow&#10;&#10;Thoughts?

          <attvalue for="4" value="Introduction&#10;0:00&#10;last week the Trump administration formally accepted a Boeing 747 luxury&#10;0:06&#10;jet from the government of [Music] Qatar even if this is legal it is&#10;0:12&#10;incredibly corrupt looking at the very least but here's the thing they're giving us a free jet corruption is meant&#10;0:20&#10;to come with a cover up i could say &quot;No no no don't give us I want to pay you a billion or 400 million or whatever it&#10;0:27&#10;is.&quot; or I can say thank you very much people are supposed to be hiding what they're doing when it happens just out&#10;0:33&#10;in the open like this i think it becomes hard for a political system even for the media to know what to do with it but the&#10;0:40&#10;biggest area of corruption for the Trump family right now the soft underbelly I think of this administration is not&#10;0:48&#10;airplanes it's crypto president Trump and his family's growing crypto empire&#10;0:53&#10;trump is a stakeholder in something he also is a chief regulator of and the Trump family is indeed cashing in&#10;0:59&#10;chinese billionaire Justin Sun publicly disclosed a $75 million investment from a $2 billion deal with a foreign&#10;1:06&#10;government got Pakistan becoming the latest to partner with the World Liberty Financial world Liberty Financial world&#10;1:13&#10;Li Liberty Financial the Donald Trump meme coin which now has a value of about&#10;1:18&#10;$2.5 billion a high power dinner for a price a pay-to-play scheme looking to&#10;1:24&#10;become the country's largest Bitcoin miner its own dollar peg stable coin USD1 this is unprecedented and I think&#10;1:32&#10;it's going to change our modern financial system forever thank you steve Bannon famously talked&#10;1:39&#10;about using muzzle velocity as a strategy doing so much so quickly you&#10;1:44&#10;overwhelm the ability of the media to cover it we got to start with muzzle velocity so it's got to start and it's&#10;1:50&#10;got a hammer muzzle velocity what the Trump family is doing with crypto is muzzle velocity for&#10;1:56&#10;corruption it is almost impossible to keep track so that's what I want to do&#10;2:01&#10;with this episode try to track at least some of it and the person who's going to help me out is Zeke Fox he's an&#10;2:07&#10;investigative reporter at Bloomberg the author of the fantastic book Number Go Up: Inside Crypto's Wild Rise and&#10;2:14&#10;Staggering Fall and he's been closely covering the Trump family's mounting&#10;2:20&#10;crypto operations as always my email Ezra Kleinshow@ny&#10;2:25&#10;[Music] Times.com zeke Fox welcome to the show&#10;Crypto in Trump 1.0&#10;2:32&#10;thanks Ezra so let's start back in July 2019 this is late in the first term and&#10;2:38&#10;you have Donald Trump tweeting as president I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which are not&#10;2:45&#10;money and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air so tell me about&#10;2:51&#10;the Trump administration's first term in terms of its relationship with crypto&#10;2:58&#10;yeah that was pretty much his attitude um whenever he was asked about crypto it&#10;3:04&#10;hadn't yet entered the mainstream the crypto Super Bowl when we saw when we&#10;3:10&#10;saw all these ads for uh Sam Begman Freed's FTX where we had LeBron James&#10;3:15&#10;endorsing crypto that was 2022 um so it&#10;3:21&#10;seemed like kind of a fringy thing for nerds there's another time that he called Bitcoin a scam against the dollar&#10;3:30&#10;um and during you view the whole second Trump administration as a scam against&#10;3:35&#10;the dollar but that's a different situation maybe um and he staffed his&#10;3:40&#10;first administration with a lot of mainstream Wall Street people who viewed&#10;3:46&#10;crypto as this kind of unregulated threat to the financial system so at&#10;3:54&#10;that time the Securities and Exchange Commission under Trump initiated some&#10;4:00&#10;lawsuits against big crypto companies some of the same ones that they were still fighting and angry about years&#10;4:06&#10;later yeah he was no friend to crypto um you meant you mentioned 2022&#10;4:14&#10;and this big cultural boom we have in in in that era and this is the moment of&#10;4:19&#10;NFTTS are everywhere and you have Matt Damon doing these ads and Larry David&#10;4:24&#10;telling you not to miss out and this is when something begins to change for Donald Trump he's out of office um&#10;4:30&#10;there's some reporting that his cash flow situation is not what he would like it to be and he releases a series of&#10;4:37&#10;Trump digital trading cards what are Trump digital trading cards yeah so the&#10;4:44&#10;technical term for these are NFTTS or nonfgeable tokens um you might remember&#10;4:53&#10;if you remember any of these the board ape yacht club these were like really&#10;4:58&#10;ugly cartoons of monkeys that sold for you know three or $400,000 for a couple&#10;5:05&#10;months there and kind of on the after NFTs had pretty much crashed Trump came&#10;5:12&#10;in out with his own series and these are digital pictures of Trump that looking&#10;5:19&#10;uh super jacked maybe he's in some he's an astronaut and others he's a he's a&#10;5:24&#10;hunter um and this was an idea that uh so funny yes um can you imagine&#10;5:31&#10;releasing a series of commemorative cards about yourself that are not just pictures of you but pictures of you&#10;5:37&#10;looking tougher and more heroic and more jacked like I'm going to I'm going to&#10;5:42&#10;make this worse now um so this was an idea pitched to him by Bill Zanker who&#10;5:47&#10;used to run the Learning Annex and co-authored Think Big and Kick Ass with Trump so they go way back and Bill&#10;5:54&#10;Zanker had actually been working with Sylvester Stallone on a NFT collection&#10;6:00&#10;that was going to be called Planet Sly it didn't happen and it looks like they reused the Planet Sly art for the Trump&#10;6:08&#10;NFTs so you got Trump you know uh in all these like Stallone poses it cost $99 to&#10;6:16&#10;own one and when you buy an NFT you don't own the picture in the sense that&#10;6:21&#10;like no one else can use it no one else can look at it you just have registered&#10;6:26&#10;your ownership of this card on the blockchain you can prove that you are&#10;6:32&#10;the one who paid $99 to buy this image of Trump looking really jacked and then&#10;6:37&#10;you could to go sell it to someone else and they would then be registered as the owner on the blockchain that's what&#10;6:43&#10;makes it crypto and they released about 200,000 of them and Trump and his&#10;6:49&#10;partners made an estimated 20 million bucks 20 million bucks is not nothing&#10;6:56&#10;for an incredibly cheap project yes and he's endorsing a lot of stuff at this&#10;7:03&#10;time right he went on to do I think Bibles uh yeah so Trump Bibles sneakers&#10;7:09&#10;um Trump commemorative coins yes but this is a little bit benign this is not a currency it's it is what it says it is&#10;7:18&#10;you can buy these Trump digital images and you have proof of of ownership it's&#10;7:25&#10;just a a money-making scheme yeah and he held a couple events at Mara Lago to&#10;7:33&#10;celebrate this collection and he invited people who had bought a certain number of the cards and at these events you&#10;7:44&#10;know he sounded a little bit more more friendly to crypto what what kinds of people are coming to these events so are&#10;7:49&#10;the people buying enough of these cards cryptomagnets who recognize they can get&#10;7:55&#10;an audience of Donald Trump or are these just rando MAGA&#10;8:00&#10;dieards who want uh like a cheesecake calendar of their hero i think it was&#10;8:08&#10;more randos but there were a few crypto guys who either thought that this was&#10;8:14&#10;funny and that it would be cool to go to Mara Lago it didn't cost that much to&#10;8:19&#10;buy enough to get in it was maybe $10,000 worth of cards so and so what&#10;8:25&#10;happened at this dinner there's lots of questions about crypto people are taping this so the stuff he said came out later&#10;8:32&#10;and it's clear that Trump he's sounding more positive but it's clear that he doesn't entirely have the subject down&#10;8:40&#10;yet for example someone asks him about central bank digital currencies this is&#10;8:46&#10;something that crypto guys hate they don't want the government to get into the crypto business and compete with&#10;8:52&#10;them and Trump says &quot;Oh that could be interesting.&quot; When like the right answer would be &quot;Oh I hate it that's that's a&#10;8:58&#10;Democrat thing it's I'm going to ban those.&quot; But he says generally about crypto he says more and more I'm for it&#10;9:06&#10;and there's something else going on at the same time joe Biden is president gary Gendler is his SEC chair gendzer is&#10;9:14&#10;a huge skeptic of crypto he wants crypto regulated as securities for the most part which crypto people&#10;9:21&#10;hate what What is the relationship at this point between the crypto world and&#10;9:27&#10;the Biden administration so I think it's helpful to take a step&#10;9:32&#10;back and think for a minute about what is happening in crypto and because if you've never really thought about it too&#10;9:38&#10;much you might think about crypto as some sort of alternative to the dollar like a currency we're going to use to&#10;9:44&#10;buy our coffee or uh pay for our house or whatever and you Bitcoin's now been&#10;9:50&#10;around for 15 years it's as old as Uber or WhatsApp things that we use every day&#10;9:56&#10;that hasn't happened what has happened is that people have made thousands maybe&#10;10:02&#10;even millions of random coins that do all sorts of different things that&#10;10:07&#10;people can gamble on and tons and tons of these coins have turned out to be&#10;10:14&#10;scams so the Biden administration as this insane bubble&#10;10:21&#10;inflated didn't really take a lot of action once the bubble popped and people&#10;10:27&#10;started losing a lot of money Gendler's SEC sued&#10;10:33&#10;basically many of the biggest players in crypto and said &quot;Hey the thing that you've been doing out in the open for&#10;10:40&#10;the last couple years letting people gamble on all these coins it's illegal&#10;10:45&#10;these are securities they should be registered with us they should be regulated like we regulate stocks.&quot; and&#10;10:52&#10;by allowing people to trade them you've broken the law and he's saying you basically have to stop now they didn't&#10;11:00&#10;stop they were fighting the lawsuits and they were uh but Gendler became you know&#10;11:06&#10;the industry's big enemy and some in the&#10;11:12&#10;industry realized that maybe they needed to get more involved in politics that&#10;11:17&#10;maybe some uh lobbying could help their cause and these are people now with a&#10;How Trump learned to love crypto&#10;11:25&#10;lot of money one thing that always fascinates me about the crypto folks is&#10;11:31&#10;that their money went from in many cases pretty modest to billions so fast that&#10;11:38&#10;they treat it like play money because to them it really does have this abstracted&#10;11:44&#10;quality and you know in politics it's a big deal if a donor comes in with a&#10;11:50&#10;million $10 million $20 million $30 million is a whale right if there's a a donor in industry willing to do $30&#10;11:57&#10;million politicians fall over themselves to get in front of that tell me a bit&#10;12:02&#10;about the the financial artillery that the crypto titans begin bringing to bear here so Sam Bankman Freed he he once&#10;12:10&#10;said you know people say there's too much money in politics i'm actually surprised by how little there is i mean&#10;12:16&#10;these politicians control huge sums of money it's worth spending what he views&#10;12:22&#10;as a little bit to try to influence them so some other guys get this idea and I think the one who I think is the most&#10;12:30&#10;influential and kind of underappreciated is David Bailey he's the chief executive&#10;12:36&#10;officer of Bitcoin magazine this is like a glossy publication for people who&#10;12:41&#10;really like Bitcoin and he got together with a couple friends and they started&#10;12:47&#10;to strategize how can we get Bitcoiners in front of the president how can we get&#10;12:53&#10;the president on our team and the real goal is how do we get Trump to come to&#10;13:00&#10;our Bitcoin conference which they have every year and it's like a big rally where tens of thousands of Bitcoiners&#10;13:07&#10;come in now Bitcoiners are a little different from crypto at large these guys think that Bitcoin is the one true&#10;13:14&#10;coin they might even think most of the other ones are scams and they think that Bitcoin's price is going to go to a&#10;13:20&#10;million it's going to solve all the world's problems um and make us all&#10;13:25&#10;really rich so it turns out that one of David&#10;13:31&#10;Bailey's friends has a connection to Paul Maniffort&#10;13:37&#10;uh who had been Trump's campaign manager they consult with him they come up with&#10;13:44&#10;a plan um and David Bailey actually described some of his&#10;13:51&#10;lobbying on a podcast called Galaxy Brains and this is what he said about&#10;13:58&#10;approaching the Trump campaign you know Donald Trump is it's it's not about left&#10;14:04&#10;versus right politics you know um as somebody at my company said the other day it's it's like orange versus green&#10;14:10&#10;politics and and Donald Trump is a is a vessel um for you know us to uh let the&#10;14:18&#10;you know game theory of Bitcoin play out and um uh you know it has already&#10;14:26&#10;generated a dividends and it is going to generate&#10;14:31&#10;uh dividends that are hard to even you know comprehend or calculate over the&#10;14:37&#10;next four years and what he decided was that he get a few Bitcoiners and they&#10;14:43&#10;would all max out and the most you can give to Trump and then I guess a bunch of campaign committees totals&#10;14:52&#10;$844,600 and what Bailey said that he realized is that even like 10 people who&#10;14:57&#10;gave that much could have a huge impact&#10;15:03&#10;and he described in this podcast his goals which sounded to me to be totally&#10;15:08&#10;insane he said that he wanted the US government to start buying Bitcoin which&#10;15:13&#10;would start an international race to acquire Bitcoin and drive the price up to a million dollars per Bitcoin if we&#10;15:20&#10;if we acting together in unison the price of Bitcoin is going to the [ __ ] moon i mean this is the type of when&#10;15:25&#10;people say &quot;What's going to send Bitcoin to a million dollars of Bitcoin?&quot; This is what sends it to a million dollars of Bitcoin he said this all before Trump&#10;15:32&#10;came to the uh conference which he did so before I get to the conference I want&#10;15:38&#10;to note that goal for a second there's an as you mentioned uh older more&#10;15:43&#10;idealistic view of crypto that it's going to be new untraceable trustless&#10;15:49&#10;currencies that will replace the the things we use like dollars and yen to&#10;15:54&#10;buy things now I think that concept has sort of fallen by the wayside your great book which I love and recommend to&#10;16:00&#10;people number go up is all about the embrace of the idea that the point here is more people buy in and then the&#10;16:07&#10;number go up yes but for that to keep happening you need more people to keep buying in&#10;16:12&#10;one way you could do that is masscale advertising you're paying people like Matt Damon and and Larry David and uh&#10;16:19&#10;you know supermodels and Tom Brady to advertise your crypto platforms to to&#10;16:25&#10;kind of get dumb money in but the biggest money is government money and if you could put government money and a lot&#10;16:32&#10;of government monies into a scarce financial product by definition you have&#10;16:37&#10;driven up the the price of that product by everybody owning it beforehand by a lot in some ways it's a completely&#10;16:45&#10;insane place for the original anti-government Bitcoin idealist to end up but if all you want to do is make&#10;16:52&#10;number go up it'd be pretty sweet right i mean&#10;16:57&#10;it's helpful to like picture a pyramid you know you've maybe at the top are the&#10;17:04&#10;early adopters the nerds the anarchists the ones who wanted untraceable money um but like by the time by this time the&#10;17:09&#10;pyramid's getting pretty big you've brought in the dumb money you've got uh Bitcoin ETFs that let people invest in&#10;17:17&#10;Bitcoin through their IAS how this py How are we going to keep making number&#10;17:22&#10;go up the base of the pyramid is really wide we need giant pools of money&#10;17:27&#10;governments to buy Bitcoin all right so they do get Donald Trump to come to the&#10;17:32&#10;2024 Bitcoin conference you're at this conference right yes what's the vibe&#10;17:39&#10;first off I thought okay maybe he'll do it by video he'll say &quot;Hey Bitcoiners you know nice you know have fun great&#10;17:46&#10;conference whatever.&quot; I thought maybe he'd then it became clear he was coming i thought he'd just run through the&#10;17:52&#10;greatest hits we get a speech about crooked Hillary maybe he mentions Bitcoin once no when he took the stage&#10;17:59&#10;at the end of the conference he ran through everything that David Bailey had&#10;18:06&#10;said he was going to do said if Bitcoin is going to the moon as we say is going to the moon i want America to be the&#10;18:13&#10;nation that leads the way and that's what's going to happen he said that he did not want China to get the crypto&#10;18:21&#10;because if we don't do it China's going to be doing others are going to be doing it let's do it and do it right which is&#10;18:27&#10;kind of funny china has banned crypto but David Bailey had suggested that a good way to get Trump on board would be&#10;18:35&#10;to suggest that there was some sort of competition with China he said he would fire Gary Gendler and end the war on&#10;18:42&#10;crypto on day one I will fire Gary Gunsler and appoint a new SEC chairman&#10;18:49&#10;and the applause was so loud they said it again let me say it&#10;18:54&#10;again on day one I will fire Gary Gestler&#10;19:00&#10;whoa there's a funny dynamic to his speech in some ways this is one of those&#10;19:06&#10;Trump speeches that I think even people who don't like him enjoy watching&#10;19:11&#10;because he's doing this thing where he's reading words on a page or on a teleprompter that it feels like he has&#10;19:18&#10;never read or thought about but he's offering his own color commentary along the way i want to play a clip from it in&#10;19:25&#10;just 15 years Bitcoin has gone from merely an idea posted anonymously on an&#10;19:31&#10;internet message board to being the ninth most valuable asset anywhere in&#10;19:36&#10;the world can you believe that is that right that's a big&#10;19:43&#10;deal think of that it's already bigger than Exxon Mobile soon it will be&#10;19:48&#10;surpassing the entire market cap of silver it's not bad how about gold how&#10;19:54&#10;about gold let's go gold so when I hear&#10;20:00&#10;this I don't hear a lot of conviction in Donald Trump what I hear&#10;20:07&#10;is somebody who is figuring out who's been told what an audience wants him to say he is himself a little bit surprised&#10;20:12&#10;by what he's saying and he's here in the crowd i noticed there was another part&#10;20:18&#10;that I noticed that he seemed to be kind of freestyling which came at the end&#10;20:24&#10;with your help we will save our nation we will restore our republic and we will make America and Bitcoin bigger better&#10;20:31&#10;stronger richer freer and greater than ever before thank you all have a good&#10;20:38&#10;time with your Bitcoin and your crypto and everything else that you're playing&#10;20:43&#10;with and we're going to make that one of the greatest industries on earth good luck and God bless you all thank you god&#10;20:51&#10;bless you thank you this is a very famous final moment what did the room make of that ending the speech that way&#10;20:59&#10;made it kind of clear that he didn't view this as a serious thing because&#10;21:05&#10;this Bitcoin conference audience you cannot overstate how obsessed with Bitcoin they are and it's not it's not&#10;21:13&#10;something to joke about uh for them they were not thrilled they But that's just&#10;21:18&#10;because they're totally insane they wanted him to say like the dollar will be illegal it will be only it will be&#10;21:25&#10;only bitcoins now um you know any they're they're a tough crowd to please&#10;21:31&#10;so I think right now we're tracking a pretty normal political story there's this industry it's got a bunch of money&#10;World Liberty Financial and its connections&#10;21:38&#10;it's willing to give a bunch of money to candidates if those candidates support its goals the candidates want money in&#10;21:44&#10;order to be able to run their political operations and it's a pretty normal&#10;21:49&#10;story but then in September 2024 now we're just 2 months out from the&#10;21:55&#10;election the Trump family announces something new that they're going to be starting something or they're heavily&#10;22:01&#10;involved in something called World Liberty Financial what at that point did they&#10;22:08&#10;say World Liberty Financial was so the Trump sons first started tweeting about&#10;22:14&#10;it saying this was the future of finance and Trump himself said &quot;We're embracing&#10;22:21&#10;the future with crypto and leaving the slow and outdated big banks behind.&quot; And&#10;22:27&#10;reading between the lines it seemed like they were saying they were going to release some sort of platform for&#10;22:36&#10;borrowing and lending crypto there's a million of these um there's really not some unmet need in&#10;22:44&#10;the market and the crypto people some of the same&#10;22:50&#10;ones who had been really excited about Trump's embrace of the&#10;22:55&#10;industry were pretty mad not everyone but a lot of people told me &quot;This looks&#10;23:00&#10;like a cash grab this isn't what crypto is about some sort of copycat project.&quot; Um and I I thought this was pretty funny&#10;23:08&#10;because um to me it seemed like Trump was kind of catching on to how how crypto really&#10;23:16&#10;works and because in crypto buying other people's coins is kind of for suckers by the time&#10;23:24&#10;you hear about the coin the insiders have already taken their positions at low prices you're you know what they&#10;23:32&#10;call exit liquidity they're going to sell it to you at a high price that's how they make money liquidity is such a&#10;23:38&#10;great name for that the the real way to make money in crypto is to make up your&#10;23:43&#10;own coins and sell them to other people for real money so to me I'm like okay it seems like like Trump's catching on so&#10;23:50&#10;So tell me who's behind this though there there's some involvement of the kids there's I guess the son of Steve&#10;23:57&#10;Wickoff who later becomes the Middle East envoy tell me who is actually running World Liberty&#10;24:03&#10;Financial and how does how do the Trumps make money off of&#10;24:08&#10;it it seemed like there were these two kind of longtime online hustlers who&#10;24:14&#10;were the real movers behind the project one of them his name is Chase Hero&#10;24:21&#10;and dig into his resume it's a spotty one he has bragged about&#10;24:29&#10;dealing weed he used to sell weight loss colon cleanses online he had a $149 a&#10;24:37&#10;month get-richqu program um I watched him on Logan Paul's podcast where he&#10;24:44&#10;promoted a cryptocoin that later went down 96% and he's an pretty much an unknown&#10;24:50&#10;in crypto he'd only ever done one cryptocurrency project that I could find&#10;24:56&#10;it attracted a few million dollars and then suffered a big hack um so I mean at&#10;25:02&#10;this point like this perfect just excellent excellent choice of business partner here yeah and then I found I&#10;25:10&#10;spent a long time watching all of his YouTube videos of which there were many and in one he called himself the dirt&#10;25:17&#10;bag of the internet and said that regulators should quote kick [ __ ]&#10;25:23&#10;like me out then he said a quote about crypto that honestly I kind of agree with uh but makes him kind of an odd&#10;25:30&#10;business partner he said he was in this video he's streaming while he drives his&#10;25:36&#10;Rolls-Royce and he says you can literally sell [ __ ] in a can wrapped in&#10;25:43&#10;piss covered in human skin for a billion dollars if the story is right because&#10;25:48&#10;people will buy it and that is what is going on in the crypto space and like I said in my other video I'm not going to question the the right and wrong of all&#10;25:55&#10;that his business partner who's also uh helping run World Liberty Zachary&#10;26:03&#10;Folkman he used to run a service called Date Hotter Girls where he taught&#10;26:10&#10;seminars about how to pick up women take her home try like tell her tell her&#10;26:15&#10;about the awesome margaritas that you're going to make at your place tell her about the really sweet balcony you have&#10;26:21&#10;at your place tell her about you know your you know some video that you saw on YouTube that you have to show her and&#10;26:27&#10;you know get her home but the fact of the matter is is like this is a very very succinct way to go out and get&#10;26:34&#10;consistent results now the fact of the matter is is this you know flashy no not&#10;26:40&#10;at all but I mean how many guys came here to learn how to be&#10;26:46&#10;flashy okay how many guys came here to learn how to take girls home and bang them&#10;26:53&#10;um so these are the Trump's crypto uh business partners and I started um&#10;26:59&#10;looking into how this came to be and it seems like what happened is that Chase&#10;27:05&#10;Herro and Zack Folkman met Steve Wickoff's sons steve Wickoff is a real&#10;27:11&#10;estate developer who golfs with Trump longtime Trump friend and Steve Wickoff had&#10;27:17&#10;introduced them to the Trump Sons and and Trump Senior and they'd uh pitched&#10;27:23&#10;him on this World Liberty plan and Trump is listed on World Liberty's website as&#10;27:30&#10;chief crypto advocate and Eric Don Jr and Baron are web 3 ambassadors&#10;27:40&#10;world Liberty this is also part for the course in crypto world Liberty they're not really quite saying exactly what it&#10;27:47&#10;is but they're going to sell some coins and the coins the World Liberty coins&#10;27:52&#10;were even by crypto standards a really unappealing investment um so if you buy&#10;28:00&#10;World Liberty crypto coins you do not receive a share of any money world&#10;28:07&#10;liberty makes you cannot resell them unless the rules change in the future&#10;28:13&#10;you can't resell them no they can't be resold how do you make money off of them presumably they're going to change those&#10;28:18&#10;rules um but you're trusting that they do but so I buy a world liberty coin it&#10;28:24&#10;costs me just notionally whatever 30 bucks 300 bucks there's no liquidity in that&#10;28:32&#10;literally impossible to resell maybe you could do it over the counter to your&#10;28:38&#10;friend with like a handshake deal but you can't so I'm actually shocked yes um&#10;28:43&#10;so and the first $30 million of the proceeds after this initial 30 million&#10;28:49&#10;75% of all the money world liberty makes both from operations of whatever they will do in the future and from the token&#10;28:56&#10;sale 75% is going to be paid to the Trumps as a fee okay okay but initially&#10;29:02&#10;it doesn't make that much money yeah so Trump's not president yet and this&#10;29:09&#10;offering is kind of uh rejected by the crypto industry at first they'd only&#10;29:16&#10;sold a couple million of the coins i mean still not bad you tweet a couple times you sell a couple million of coins&#10;29:23&#10;that can't be resold but it hadn't hit that payout level oh true then comes&#10;29:28&#10;Justin Sun who is Justin Sun so Justin Sun is&#10;29:36&#10;a controversial cryptobillionaire he was&#10;29:41&#10;uh born in China he started a blockchain called Tron and he's best known for his&#10;29:52&#10;love of publicity stunts he bought lunch with Warren Buffett to&#10;30:00&#10;try to pitch him about crypto he bought a seat on Jeff Bezos's one of his spaceships which I&#10;30:07&#10;don't think he ever used and most recently he bought a piece of conceptual&#10;30:13&#10;art a banana taped to a wall for $6 million so Justin Sun is facing a&#10;30:23&#10;lawsuit filed by the SEC under Gary Gendler and he comes in right after the&#10;30:32&#10;election and buys $30 million of these&#10;30:38&#10;unresellable World Liberty tokens which pushes them over the line so that the Trumps would in fact receive a payout&#10;30:47&#10;and son says at the time to my colleague that he just liked the project he was&#10;30:55&#10;not expecting anything from it um but he's immediately named an adviser to&#10;31:00&#10;World Liberty one of maybe 10 people in the industry who are so now he's in business with the Trumps too and he says&#10;31:08&#10;publicly that he's triggered this payout to them is that accurate he makes a lot of noise about the purchase um and the&#10;31:16&#10;rules of the game are clear to everyone uh and in case the Trumps did not know about this just a few weeks later he&#10;31:24&#10;goes to a crypto conference in Abu Dhabi this is also hosted by Bitcoin&#10;31:31&#10;Magazine's David Bailey and it's a small world yes uh at that conference he is&#10;31:38&#10;photographed with Steve Wickoff steve Wickoff the envoy who also plays a big&#10;31:45&#10;role at World Liberty he's now said he divested um but Justin Sun gets in front&#10;31:50&#10;of him there and we don't know what was said but after that maybe a few weeks&#10;31:55&#10;later Justin Sun buys another $45 million of World Liberty's token which&#10;32:02&#10;at this point is now just doing a 75% payout to the Trumps correct yeah so of&#10;32:08&#10;Justin Sun his purchase of World Liberty coins meant that the Trumps were going&#10;32:14&#10;to get uh something like 56 million in a payout based on just what he bought we&#10;32:21&#10;should say Justin's son um in the a after a few weeks after he&#10;32:27&#10;finished buying his $75 million of World Liberty tokens his SEC case was put on&#10;32:34&#10;hold and no explanation was given the SEC did put a lot of other crypto cases&#10;32:41&#10;on hold but this is like a very favorable outcome for him and one that&#10;32:48&#10;is really valuable okay so let's back up&#10;32:53&#10;for a minute you've got a crypto figure but let's not call it a&#10;32:58&#10;crypto figure you've got a someone in the finance industry they are under SEC&#10;33:04&#10;investigation for fraud and what they have done is they have&#10;33:10&#10;found a way to put $56&#10;33:15&#10;million publicly and legally in the pocket of the&#10;33:22&#10;family that is about to or just has won the election and will&#10;33:29&#10;direct SEC afterwards i think somebody listening to this might&#10;33:36&#10;say &quot;Isn't that usually illegal wouldn't that be understood under normal law as a a bribe?&quot; Could&#10;33:44&#10;Could Justin I guess the question I'm asking you is could Justin's son have just walked up to Eric Trump with a&#10;33:49&#10;check could he have just gone to him and said &quot;Hey I think you guys are great i'm into the whole Trump project i like the&#10;33:55&#10;branding i like the aesthetic i like the vibes i'm not saying I want anything from you here's $56 million of walking&#10;34:02&#10;around money would that be legal you know maybe it would be do I'm not I'm&#10;34:08&#10;not entirely sure um I mean I think that the imalments clause only applies to&#10;34:16&#10;payments from foreign governments i think um but I'm not an expert on this&#10;34:22&#10;to me it seems like this is just not a situation that was uh ever contemplated&#10;34:30&#10;by the people who made laws about what presidents could and couldn't do what's&#10;34:35&#10;funny is you couldn't do it for the campaign you mentioned earlier that the max you could donate to the campaign directly into some some associated&#10;34:43&#10;official party organs is fairly limited if you wanted to say put $56 million&#10;34:49&#10;into Trump's official campaign account you couldn't but you can put it into his&#10;34:55&#10;cryptocoin which triggers direct payments into his family's bank accounts&#10;35:01&#10;yes and I mean remember first first time around there was a lot of controversy&#10;35:07&#10;over people spending money at the Trump hotel in DC i mean that looks quaint&#10;35:14&#10;people that was a couple hundred thousand dollars you know now people are sending millions to buy you know Trump's&#10;35:22&#10;coins tens of millions the thing about the crypto play here is it's so much more scalable the the numbers the number&#10;35:29&#10;go the number go up it's functionally infinite and they ended up selling out they sold all the tokens that they had&#10;35:35&#10;offered total of $550 million worth so that meant $400 million to the Trumps&#10;35:43&#10;based on the terms of the offering as I read them eric Trump has said quote&#10;35:48&#10;&quot;It's one of the more successful things we've ever done.&quot; Do we know who bought this $550 million of World Liberty coins&#10;35:57&#10;so the way crypto works you can hold&#10;36:03&#10;your cryptocurrency in an anonymous wallet you're only identified by a string of&#10;36:10&#10;random letters and numbers so we can go on the blockchain we can see which&#10;36:18&#10;anonymous wallets have sent money to buy World Liberty tokens but we don't know&#10;36:24&#10;who those people are unless there's other clues or if the people announce it publicly so Justin's son was a little&#10;36:30&#10;bit unusual here in that he went and made his purchase very public but in&#10;36:35&#10;theory there could be somebody else some financeier in Saudi Arabia&#10;36:44&#10;some Latin American influence peddler who buys 50 million or 20&#10;36:50&#10;million or whatever it is does not say anything publicly but sends a signal message to somebody who knows the Trumps&#10;36:58&#10;saying &quot;Hey could you let them know I did this that that I'm on their side i believe in what they're doing i I want&#10;37:03&#10;to help out for sure and I mean you're giving me an&#10;37:08&#10;idea you could save 20 million bucks just tell them you did it you're like &quot;This is my&#10;37:13&#10;wallet.&quot; Fair enough all right so let's&#10;Memecoins and $Trump&#10;37:18&#10;go to a different moment here trump wins the election now it's January&#10;37:24&#10;17th 3 days before Trump will be inaugurated as president for the second time and the Trump family I guess&#10;37:34&#10;announces releases a memecoin what's a memecoin and what is Trump's memecoin&#10;37:41&#10;how does his work so crypto totally collapsed in 2022 but has since really&#10;37:49&#10;recovered and you might think that maybe it's recovered because they finally came up with a good use for crypto and now uh&#10;37:58&#10;it's actually going to revolutionize finance no the thing that's really been&#10;38:04&#10;popular in the last couple years in crypto is memecoins and what that means&#10;38:09&#10;are coins that do not claim to ever do anything so like Dogecoin is kind of the&#10;38:16&#10;original memecoin it's just a picture of a dog and you're going to buy it because&#10;38:22&#10;you think other people will buy it and it might go up pure number go up technology exactly pure gambling yes&#10;38:29&#10;it's kind of It's a new kind of gambling game it's kind of like the GameStop&#10;38:35&#10;bubble on the stock market but everyone the people involved know what they're doing it's like a pump and dump&#10;38:42&#10;scheme but it's consensual we're all going to pump up this coin and we all think we're the ones who are going to&#10;38:48&#10;get out at the top before it inevitably collapses um and the only person who's&#10;38:55&#10;really guaranteed to make money is the person who created the coin it costs&#10;39:01&#10;them nothing and then anyone that they told about it who got&#10;39:07&#10;uh who's able to get in you know in the first minutes when the when the price is&#10;39:12&#10;low so before Trump this was mainly something that kind of like sealist&#10;39:19&#10;celebrities did um Caitlyn Jenner Iggy Aelia&#10;39:25&#10;um Haley Welch who was famous from that Hawkua video they would release meme&#10;39:31&#10;coins and when you buy a meme coin you're kind of gambling on how much attention is this going to get um often&#10;39:39&#10;they only last for like hours or a day or two before people start to get cold&#10;39:45&#10;feet and the coin uh coin collapses so he announces Trumpcoin by far I mean he's&#10;39:52&#10;about to be president by far the biggest celebrity to to ever do a memecoin there&#10;39:58&#10;price promptly soarses up to $72 a coin&#10;40:03&#10;from under 10 uh from from nothing um I cannot&#10;40:09&#10;describe I I just I need to take a second here i cannot describe how crazy it is that he did this how bold one of&#10;40:17&#10;his superpowers is that some of the way that you protect against corruption we were talking about what is and isn't&#10;40:22&#10;legal before is that there are things you don't do not because it's illegal&#10;40:28&#10;but because the assumption is it would be so unfathomably politically lethal to&#10;40:34&#10;engage in corruption of that scale and of that order that at least I think in the way the framers set up this&#10;40:40&#10;government the idea is you'd be impeached immediately and certainly in in the modern era the press would be all&#10;40:45&#10;over you and it would be just a huge scandal and you would begin your administration caught up in one of the&#10;40:51&#10;biggest financial corruption scandals in and self-deing scandals in history and&#10;40:56&#10;this guy with his bizarre genius for shamelessness by just doing it all so&#10;41:04&#10;unbelievably directly the the coin is called Trump he's just promoting it himself it's all for him he's about to&#10;41:12&#10;become president he has control of the Republican party so they're not going to do anything to him and they control&#10;41:17&#10;Congress it's like he sort of overwhelms the system's capacity to know what to do&#10;41:24&#10;about him because it never had any defense for something so over the line&#10;41:33&#10;that just the administration refuses to treat as a problem i mean the thing that&#10;41:39&#10;is supposed to happen in in government is somebody says &quot;Hey you're taking a bribe you're trying to make yourself rich off of this.&quot; And guys say &quot;Oh of&#10;41:46&#10;course I'm not i would never do how dare you impugn my integrity?&quot; And with Trump&#10;41:52&#10;it's like &quot;You're trying to make yourself rich off of this.&quot; And he's like &quot;Yeah I mean wouldn't you?&quot; And&#10;41:57&#10;you're like &quot;Oh it I to me it's like it's like imagine&#10;42:03&#10;if he leading up to his inauguration lined the National Mall&#10;42:09&#10;with Trump slots and these slots had like a terrible payout compared to regular slots&#10;42:15&#10;like it's it's ridiculous.&quot; But you could also put a $100 million into the one one&#10;42:21&#10;of the machines and let him know you did it so how does he make money off of this how does a family make money off of the Trump coin&#10;42:27&#10;basically at the beginning of the game he has 1 billion coins they cost him&#10;42:33&#10;nothing to make and he's selling them to people at various prices it's kind of complicated but he sold 20 I think 200&#10;42:43&#10;million coins were sold to the public and they netted around $300 million at this point&#10;42:51&#10;Trump still has 80% of the coins the price is around $12 so Trump is sitting&#10;42:57&#10;on about $10 billion worth of his memecoin now if he starts to sell the&#10;43:05&#10;price would likely collapse he's also uh the way that it's set up he's not&#10;43:12&#10;allowed to sell for a few months so something weird just happened around this coin there's a company&#10;43:18&#10;called Freight Technologies and they announced openly&#10;43:23&#10;that they were buying up $20 million of Trump's memecoin and they said it was quote an&#10;43:32&#10;effective way to advocate for fair balanced and free trade between Mexico&#10;43:38&#10;and the US now most of the time when people buy meme coins they don't think it's an effective way to advocate&#10;43:45&#10;for trade between Mexico and the US so what is a company like that that is&#10;43:51&#10;publicly announcing a multi-million dollar investment in the Trump memecoin&#10;43:57&#10;doing what are they saying this memecoin investment is buying them i mean it seems like those&#10;44:05&#10;guys are talking about using it to buy access but actually there's something&#10;44:12&#10;there's like a second weird thing that's happening that's almost a derivative of&#10;44:17&#10;this memecoin boom this crypto this new crypto boom where companies on the stock market are&#10;44:25&#10;realizing that if they start talking about crypto or start saying that&#10;44:31&#10;they're buying crypto They can investors who are excited by this&#10;44:36&#10;will drive up their stock price so but crypto and Trumpcoin are different&#10;44:44&#10;yes buying Trumpcoin is not the same as saying I'm investing in Bitcoin or Ether i mean if I was going to meet the&#10;44:50&#10;president I'd want to pull out my crypto wallet and show him that I had some Trump coin in it yeah i mean it seems&#10;44:56&#10;like a obvious way to get in good with him and in case he&#10;45:03&#10;misses the message he's having dinner with all these guys yeah tell me about this dinner how do you get in&#10;45:10&#10;so over the last few weeks the Trump memecoin announced kind of a contest and&#10;45:17&#10;whoever held the most would get to go to the special dinner at Trump's golf club&#10;45:25&#10;uh outside DC and the top 25 got like a&#10;45:31&#10;more private audience the way that it worked out it ended up being that it was&#10;45:37&#10;going to cost you about $2 million to get in the top 25 and then the top 220&#10;45:43&#10;get in the door for this bigger event and the cuto off ended up being about&#10;45:49&#10;$50,000 of Trump memecoin to get in the door so I mean&#10;45:55&#10;he's auctioning access to the president and I&#10;46:00&#10;guess you could say is that really any different don't they do this with bundlers and other kinds of campaign&#10;46:06&#10;finance donors all the time he has had I mean I think he's been having other&#10;46:11&#10;dinners with donors where it's cost a million dollars to get into the dinner things like that and right other&#10;46:17&#10;presidents have done things like that too and the funny thing with the memecoin is&#10;46:23&#10;that he these recent purchases don't even necessarily directly benefit him&#10;46:30&#10;because like his profits came from the the vast majority of his profits came from the initial sale so does it matter&#10;46:38&#10;to them if the price of the memecoin goes up and down i mean in theory because if the price is higher when they&#10;46:44&#10;sell further tanches they make more money yeah so Trump holds 80% of the&#10;46:50&#10;coins if he starts selling he could easily collapse the price and so if you&#10;46:58&#10;go buy the Trump memecoin now and you push the price up a little bit that is&#10;47:04&#10;helping Trump when he goes to sell his coins but you're not benefit he's not&#10;47:11&#10;getting the money that you pay for the meme coin now at the moment he's already sold his first Trunch and the rest he's&#10;47:18&#10;sitting on it doesn't seem obvious to me that in a world where he wants to sell at some point $100 million more of his&#10;47:24&#10;own meme coin cuz he's got 800 million of them or whatever it is that yes that would push the market&#10;47:31&#10;down but if he is this lever that nobody else has to push the market back up or&#10;47:36&#10;to push it up right before he sells or to make it clear to anybody that if they buy in at a big level they might get to&#10;47:42&#10;go to the next dinner this actually does seem like it benefits him i mean he chooses the moment at&#10;47:48&#10;which it benefits him but you you have the mass of assets in an asset class&#10;47:56&#10;where the worth of that asset changes depending on how much people believe&#10;48:01&#10;buying it will give them access and influence with you and you put out a big sign saying &quot;Look how much access and&#10;48:08&#10;influence buying a bunch of these will give you with me.&quot; That seems good for the future price of your asset if and&#10;48:15&#10;when you decide to sell more of it if he wants to unload all10 billion dollars of Trump memecoin though it's gonna take a&#10;48:20&#10;lot of dinners sure but you could do it a hundred million bucks at a time and that's not nothing true like I'd like to&#10;48:25&#10;sell a hundred billion dollars of a memecoin you probably could i'd be stoked um so then in March&#10;Stablecoins and USD1&#10;48:32&#10;2025 the Trump family through the World Liberty Financial Vehicle announces a&#10;48:37&#10;new stable coin called USD 1 what is that coin and how do they make money off&#10;48:43&#10;of it so a stable coin is a form of cryptocurrency that's backed one to one&#10;48:51&#10;with real US dollars so a stable coin is&#10;48:56&#10;always going to be worth a dollar because in theory you could take that stable coin to its issuer and exchange&#10;49:03&#10;it for a real dollar there's another stable coin called Tether and it's so&#10;49:11&#10;popular that there's now 150 billion dollars of Tether out there&#10;49:18&#10;and that company is extremely profitable&#10;49:24&#10;the reason this is profitable is because the stable coins generally don't pay interest so if I create 150 billion&#10;49:34&#10;stable coins I then am sitting on 150 billion real dollars i can go stick&#10;49:40&#10;those in interestbearing investments and keep that money for myself you can sort&#10;49:46&#10;of think of a stable coin as like uh like a bank so if the Trumps are&#10;49:51&#10;creating their own stable coin USD1 it's like they've created the Bank of Trump&#10;49:58&#10;it issues Trump bucks and if you buy you&#10;50:04&#10;if you use USD1 if you buy USD1 it's like you're making a big&#10;50:10&#10;deposit at the bank of Trump and you're not receiving any interest the own the&#10;50:16&#10;creators of the stable coin are the ones that are going to make money on that so they create this stable coin and then a&#10;50:22&#10;few weeks ago in Dubai it is announced by Steve Wikov's son that a fund backed&#10;50:28&#10;by Abu Dhabi was going to buy $2 billion worth of the Trump stable coin $2&#10;50:34&#10;billion and use it to make an investment in the crypto platform Binance and Zach Woodoff says quote &quot;We&#10;50:44&#10;thank MGX which is the name of the fund backed by Abu Dhabi and Binance for their trust in us this is only the&#10;50:51&#10;beginning.&quot; So how would you describe to me why a&#10;50:57&#10;fund backed by Abu Dhabi would want to use the Trump stable coin as its currency for making this&#10;51:04&#10;investment i wouldn't actually look at them as the main uh player here what&#10;51:10&#10;happened was that uh CZ Changpang Xho the owner of Binance&#10;51:16&#10;which is the biggest crypto company in the world was selling part of his company to this Abu Dhabi backed fund&#10;51:25&#10;let me tell you a little bit about CZ yes because CZ his situation is&#10;51:30&#10;not straightforward yeah so he's the most successful guy in crypto he his&#10;51:36&#10;company is worth something like who knows a hundred billion dollars um but&#10;51:41&#10;he was just released from a halfway house in September he pleaded guilty to&#10;51:49&#10;failing to take required measures to prevent terrorists child&#10;51:54&#10;abusers entities and sanctioned nations criminal groups from using his&#10;52:01&#10;exchange binance was fined $4 billion and&#10;52:07&#10;CZ served uh a short sentence in in&#10;52:12&#10;prison in prison in what country here in the in the US so this so this is a guy&#10;52:18&#10;he's still running Binance he still owns it he as part of the settlement he stepped down okay&#10;52:25&#10;so he's a very central crypto figure he has just been in jail he's been in a lot&#10;52:31&#10;of other I mean there's been a lot of other legal stuff swirling around and the sense that he's a pretty shady character seems pretty widespread to me&#10;52:38&#10;he's also being sued by the SEC for running for illegally running a crypto&#10;52:43&#10;exchange in the US one of the leaked messages that came out in this case was&#10;52:48&#10;bro we are running an illegal crypto exchange in the US something like that&#10;52:53&#10;um I mean it look it looks really bad so um&#10;53:00&#10;CZ if we go back to December right after Trump's win CZ was also at that&#10;53:09&#10;Bitcoin conference in Abu Dhabi hosted with David Bailey and I've reported that&#10;53:17&#10;he met with Steve Witoff there Trump's envoy who played an important role at&#10;53:23&#10;World Liberty and that after that meeting World Liberty and&#10;53:29&#10;Binance began talking about some sort of business deal we don't know the&#10;53:37&#10;details cz afterwards tweeted that it was fake news um CZ has also been&#10;53:45&#10;pushing for a presidential pardon so the fund was going to give CZ $2&#10;53:51&#10;billion this Abu Dhabi backed fund now CZ can do anything with that $2 billion&#10;53:57&#10;that he wants and what this announcement is saying is that CZ is going to put that $2&#10;54:03&#10;billion in USD1 in the Bank of Trump and that's enough that world liberty&#10;54:11&#10;could quite easily earn uh $50 million a year in&#10;54:17&#10;interest and as we know the terms of world liberty dictate that the Trumps&#10;54:23&#10;are going to get whatever they do earn the Trumps will get three quarters so as long as CZ keeps his&#10;54:31&#10;money in USD1 the Trumps are are earning interest on this it's like muzzle velocity for political corruption here&#10;The big picture&#10;54:38&#10;there are so many stories that on their own seem like they should be erading political&#10;54:45&#10;scandals but the big picture that that I see emerging when I track this story&#10;54:51&#10;from Trump trading cards where he looks like a firefighter or whatever all the&#10;54:56&#10;way to you know the Trump stable coin uh you know Trump media launching&#10;55:02&#10;ETFs is that the Trump family has been groping its way evolving&#10;55:10&#10;learning how to open up a lot of avenues to let people invest in various&#10;55:17&#10;crypto schemes of theirs in order to buy influence or think they're buying influence that they have found a use for&#10;55:23&#10;crypto which is that use is political corruption for a long time we've known crypto is used for drug deals we've&#10;55:29&#10;known it's used on the black markets we've known it's used for things that you don't want to see regulated and they&#10;55:34&#10;seem to me to have figured out another very obvious use case which is that you&#10;55:40&#10;can do forms of payoffs that would be regulated if you tried to do them with the Trump campaign but you can do them&#10;55:45&#10;with crypto and you can have all kinds of foreign figures do it right it's very very very wild west compared to other&#10;55:52&#10;things in the in the US financial system and they're just making hundreds of millions of dollars maybe over time&#10;55:58&#10;billions of dollars from this it all looks astonishingly corrupt to&#10;56:07&#10;me am I wrong am I missing can you give me an exculpatory version of&#10;56:13&#10;this i mean I think what the Trumps have said about it is that you know we can't&#10;56:19&#10;be bought these people might be they can't deny that people are giving them&#10;56:24&#10;money but their claim is that they are still acting in what they believe to be&#10;56:31&#10;the US's uh best interest but&#10;56:36&#10;uh the conflicts of interest are so obvious i mean we talk about um right&#10;56:43&#10;now Congress is debating stable coin regulation&#10;56:50&#10;are is it going to be favorable to the to the president's coin like would&#10;56:55&#10;people in his party want to pass rules that would make the would be bad for the&#10;57:01&#10;president's coin i mean it seems it seems unlikely or meme coins since they really took off recently the rules&#10;57:08&#10;around them were were not clear and was Trump's SEC going to pass a rule saying &quot;Oh actually you&#10;57:15&#10;know this is an illegal offering you can't do that i mean it would be pretty&#10;57:21&#10;hard for them to do that with the president having just done a big memecoin offering and in fact once&#10;57:27&#10;Trump's appointees took over at the SEC they announced that meme coins were&#10;57:32&#10;collectibles like Beanie Babies and that the rules did not apply so there's a I&#10;57:37&#10;think one way you could look at this is you could say this is maybe a little bit more bald-faced but this is just the kind of&#10;57:44&#10;political corruption we see all the time you have Hunter Biden serving on Ukrainian energy boards and getting&#10;57:50&#10;payouts and this is a an old thing where the family members of the president seem&#10;57:56&#10;to get sweetheart deals and seem to sell things at inflated prices but this feels different to me&#10;58:04&#10;both because of the sums involved i I think that the scale is so different that it's a different thing yeah like&#10;58:11&#10;it's a different not you know Hunter Biden should not be taking advantage of&#10;58:18&#10;his rel of his being the president's son to sell his terrible art to mystery&#10;58:25&#10;buyers for hundreds of thousands of dollars but how much juice with Joe&#10;58:30&#10;Biden is that going to buy you you know this is like Trump himself making&#10;58:37&#10;hundreds of millions of dollars it's hard to believe that so big and&#10;58:43&#10;then there's this other dynamic here which is that they are this the regulation around industry is completely&#10;58:48&#10;unformed so this is not like other industries where we have structured regulations&#10;58:54&#10;around the energy industry around most of the financial industry if you want to get into equities we have a a structured&#10;59:00&#10;regulatory um architecture for that here it's all wild west the crypto industry has been&#10;59:07&#10;trying to win over the Trump administration and now it's not just that the Trump administration is getting campaign donations from the crypto&#10;59:14&#10;industry it's that they have directly invested themselves their family their&#10;59:20&#10;revenue streams as Eric Trump said one of the most successful things that the Trump family has ever done now&#10;59:26&#10;depends on this extremely lax regulatory architecture continuing and by the way&#10;59:32&#10;also depends on very lax political corruption laws around this in a way that don't exist for other forms of&#10;59:38&#10;potential payouts i'll give you an example that to me I think is pretty significant um in&#10;59:46&#10;number go up I was investigating the use of stable coins and I found that this&#10;59:54&#10;was pre Trump's coin but that stable coins were fueling this epidemic of&#10;1:00:01&#10;scams where Americans were u being you&#10;1:00:06&#10;know catfished by spam messages tricked into sending money for uh cryptocurrency&#10;1:00:14&#10;investing schemes and then sending huge amounts of money through stable coins&#10;1:00:20&#10;overseas where it would never be seen again&#10;1:00:25&#10;and what and on the other end of that that in Southeast Asia there's huge&#10;1:00:33&#10;compounds where tens of thousands of people are forced to work as scammers and under threat of torture or worse and&#10;1:00:42&#10;are spending all day like sending these spam messages and trying to trick people stable coins enables this this is stuff&#10;1:00:47&#10;where you get the message and it's like hey didn't we have plans to go dinner tonight right and&#10;1:00:58&#10;I went to Cambodia to investigate this and there's stores all over the place where you you can walk in you can&#10;1:01:07&#10;anonymously transfer your stable coins and walk out with a brick of cash and so&#10;1:01:14&#10;like if the scammers were using Visa or Mastercard or Bank Wires um this would&#10;1:01:20&#10;be much harder it would never reach the the scale that it has um estimates are that like Americans are losing tens of&#10;1:01:28&#10;billions of dollars to these types of crypto scams you could imagine a stable&#10;1:01:34&#10;coin regulation that uh would require more of the same kind of know your&#10;1:01:42&#10;customer anti-moneyaundering rules that apply to PayPal Visa Mastercard and&#10;1:01:48&#10;but is that going to happen when it would disadvantage&#10;1:01:54&#10;the president's you know world liberty startup um so these are like real things&#10;1:02:01&#10;that that are being debated right now how do all the crypto idealists feel about where this is going&#10;1:02:08&#10;the people who thought we'd have this leaderless decentralized&#10;1:02:15&#10;borderless world where money worked completely differently where&#10;1:02:21&#10;the returns to being powerful and influential and connected began to&#10;1:02:27&#10;dissolve there there was a real utopian strain in all this for a very long time when they see it going in this&#10;1:02:37&#10;direction is is there are there people who are sad about it those people by and large are long&#10;1:02:46&#10;gone and the industry now sure there's some people who are criticizing Trump's&#10;1:02:51&#10;crypto ventures but mostly they're just really psyched that the industry is being deregulated and number go up&#10;1:03:00&#10;do you have a ballpark estimate at this point on how much the Trump family seems to have made off of crypto&#10;1:03:07&#10;at least $700 million oh that's not small it's a lot of money yeah i mean&#10;1:03:14&#10;how much is Trump's maybe worth four or five billion what are the what do people&#10;1:03:19&#10;think now people have argued about this for a long time yeah who however rich he is it's not nothing&#10;1:03:27&#10;i think that is a good place to end so as our final question what are three books you recommend to the audience&#10;Book recommendations&#10;1:03:33&#10;so one book I've been reading recently that I really love is called uh a&#10;1:03:39&#10;distant mirror the calamitous 14th century by Barbara Tukman it's about&#10;1:03:45&#10;France in the 14th century but during the like hundred years war after the black plague but what really stands out&#10;1:03:52&#10;to me is it really makes history weird like you realize these people's lives&#10;1:03:58&#10;were not like our liv like ordinary people's lives were were very different&#10;1:04:04&#10;and they saw the world in a totally different way than we did and they just&#10;1:04:11&#10;seen you know humanity almost wiped out by a plague that they didn't&#10;1:04:17&#10;understand another one I've liked recently was uh Nixon Land by Rick&#10;1:04:22&#10;Pearlstein um it's sort of like reading the newspaper every day but during the&#10;1:04:29&#10;ris the Nixon years and you have the benefit of hindsight and all sorts of&#10;1:04:34&#10;Oval Office tapes he's got a great eye for detail then a novel I really liked&#10;1:04:40&#10;recently is called Gretle and the Great War is by Adam Saxs it's a collection of&#10;1:04:49&#10;interconnected fables set in early 20th century Vienna it's kind of like a&#10;1:04:54&#10;literary puzzle it's really inventive it's very original but also a portrait&#10;1:05:00&#10;of Jewish Europe before the rise of Nazism it was really funny um full&#10;1:05:07&#10;disclosure I've admired his writing since we were children and I kind of owe&#10;1:05:14&#10;him one for talking him into doing something really dumb in high school there you go Zeke Fox thank you very&#10;1:05:20&#10;much thanks Ezra&#10;1:05:26&#10;[Music]&#10;1:05:36&#10;[Music]" />

          <attvalue for="4" value="Intro&#10;0:00&#10;[Music]&#10;0:04&#10;welcome to Raging Moderates i'm Scott&#10;0:05&#10;Galloway and I'm Jessica Tarles so Jess&#10;0:08&#10;today we're joined by one of the&#10;0:09&#10;sharpest minds in American politics&#10;0:11&#10;Larry Sabato he's a professor at the&#10;0:14&#10;University of Virginia and founder of&#10;0:15&#10;our Center for Politics where he spent&#10;0:16&#10;decades studying the pattern shifts and&#10;0:19&#10;surprises in US elections you've&#10;0:21&#10;probably seen his team's crystal ball&#10;0:24&#10;election forecasts are some of the most&#10;0:25&#10;cited in the country and Larry himself&#10;0:28&#10;doesn't shy away from calling out&#10;0:29&#10;threats to democracy whether it's&#10;0:31&#10;Trumpism rising voter apathy or the&#10;0:34&#10;nationalization of local races in recent&#10;0:36&#10;months he warned that we're in a&#10;0:38&#10;dangerous moment one defined more by&#10;0:40&#10;emotion than ideology where outrage is&#10;0:42&#10;fueling turnout and independence are&#10;0:45&#10;swinging fast larry welcome to the show&#10;0:47&#10;thank you so much for having me looking&#10;0:49&#10;forward to it so let's jump right in&#10;0:51&#10;we're just a few months into Trump's&#10;0:52&#10;second term you spent your career&#10;0:54&#10;studying how political eras take shape&#10;0:56&#10;how would you describe the one we're in&#10;0:58&#10;right now frightening and uh it could&#10;1:02&#10;get a lot worse before it gets better&#10;What’s the one aspect of Trump’s second term that disturbs you most?&#10;1:04&#10;and a lot of the damage being done to&#10;1:06&#10;the governmental structure which we&#10;1:08&#10;spent decades as a people putting&#10;1:11&#10;together will take a generation or more&#10;1:14&#10;to repair i don't think anyone doubts&#10;1:16&#10;that a lot of it will have to be&#10;1:18&#10;repaired because it's not working out&#10;1:19&#10;and it won't work out and what really&#10;1:21&#10;worries me and I think worries everybody&#10;1:23&#10;is as we move closer to elections maybe&#10;1:27&#10;it's 2026 I think it's much more likely&#10;1:29&#10;to be&#10;1:30&#10;2028 things we've taken for granted we&#10;1:33&#10;can't take for granted anymore&#10;1:36&#10;it's entirely possible that uh Trump is&#10;1:39&#10;going to find ways and means either of&#10;1:42&#10;staying in power himself if not&#10;1:45&#10;guaranteeing then assisting whether it's&#10;1:47&#10;Vance or I don't think it would be Rubio&#10;1:50&#10;might be Rubio or one of his sons to&#10;1:53&#10;succeed him i hope that that won't&#10;1:55&#10;happen i hope we're better than that i&#10;1:57&#10;hope there are enough checks and&#10;1:59&#10;balances left to make sure it doesn't&#10;2:01&#10;happen but we can't assume these things&#10;2:04&#10;anymore if you were going to zero in on&#10;2:06&#10;one thing that you find most distressing&#10;2:08&#10;I mean part of the problem here is sort&#10;2:10&#10;of this flood the zone of all these&#10;2:11&#10;different things that seem outrageous&#10;2:13&#10;that I think a lot of us feel flatfooted&#10;2:15&#10;in terms of what to focus on what is the&#10;2:17&#10;one thing that has you most disturbed&#10;2:19&#10;well democracy it's fundamental to&#10;2:21&#10;everything that we have done as a people&#10;How would you define Trump’s second term as it takes shape?&#10;2:23&#10;and will do as a people I hope look I&#10;2:26&#10;can get as upset as anybody about&#10;2:28&#10;renaming the Gulf of Mexico or the&#10;2:31&#10;possibility of invading Greenland what&#10;2:33&#10;I'm really worried about is that we'll&#10;2:36&#10;no longer have a society that can work&#10;2:38&#10;together on at least some big issues and&#10;2:42&#10;we are just deeply deeply divided and&#10;2:45&#10;I've been around I'm getting ready to&#10;2:46&#10;turn 73 i remember the 60s when we had a&#10;2:50&#10;lot of polarization and division but&#10;2:52&#10;this is much worse this this goes right&#10;2:55&#10;to the fundamentals and people don't&#10;2:57&#10;agree on the fundamentals anymore or&#10;2:59&#10;they're willing to follow a cult leader&#10;3:03&#10;and when the cult leader says these&#10;3:05&#10;rules don't apply to me they applaud so&#10;3:08&#10;yes that is what bothers me more than&#10;3:10&#10;anything else though I would dispute a&#10;3:12&#10;lot of the things that Trump and Musk&#10;3:14&#10;have done just if I may I agree with you&#10;3:17&#10;i I don't think sort of at least to date&#10;3:19&#10;I'm not sure that the valid upset about&#10;3:22&#10;the attack on democracy is working i'm&#10;3:24&#10;not saying that narrative isn't right i&#10;3:26&#10;just don't know if it's effective and&#10;3:28&#10;what I'm asking is what specifically do&#10;3:30&#10;you think presents the greatest threat&#10;3:32&#10;so far to democracy is it the illegal&#10;3:34&#10;usurp of congressional power for the&#10;3:36&#10;purse is it tearing up 80-year old&#10;3:39&#10;alliances siding with dictators or&#10;3:42&#10;autocrats over our allies is it the&#10;3:45&#10;weaponization of the DOJ what&#10;3:47&#10;specifically if we were to try and focus&#10;3:49&#10;in on specific things rather than this&#10;3:51&#10;call that democracy is under attack&#10;3:53&#10;which a lot of us agree with what&#10;3:56&#10;specifically do you think is the most&#10;3:59&#10;disturbing specific act of the Trump&#10;4:02&#10;administration so far the uh&#10;Besides democracy, what about Trump’s second term disturbs you most?&#10;4:04&#10;accumulation of power in the Oval Office&#10;4:07&#10;and a tiny group of aids around him some&#10;4:11&#10;of whom are even more extreme than Trump&#10;4:14&#10;i don't think Trump is extreme in the&#10;4:16&#10;old sense of the word uh he's just all&#10;4:19&#10;for himself his personal pronouns are me&#10;4:21&#10;myself and I but the people around him&#10;4:24&#10;clearly want to amass as much power as&#10;4:28&#10;possible as early as possible and head&#10;4:30&#10;off all of the checks and balances so&#10;4:32&#10;what am I most concerned about i would&#10;4:34&#10;say the potential for ignoring court&#10;4:38&#10;decisions which which is very real&#10;4:41&#10;they're they're trying to eat at the&#10;4:44&#10;edges of this with some of the moves&#10;4:46&#10;they've already made but that would&#10;4:48&#10;worry me more than anything else but I'm&#10;4:51&#10;concerned about everything you mentioned&#10;4:53&#10;we all ought to be concerned about all&#10;4:54&#10;of that because it all fits together&#10;4:57&#10;it's all roads lead to the Oval Office&#10;4:59&#10;except that's not what the founders&#10;5:01&#10;wanted and it's not how we practice&#10;5:03&#10;politics uh for all of these years you&#10;5:06&#10;can maybe argue that Franklin Roosevelt&#10;5:08&#10;for the first 18 months or even two&#10;5:11&#10;years had that kind of power because of&#10;5:14&#10;the effect of the Great Depression in in&#10;5:17&#10;times like this it's unprecedented and&#10;5:20&#10;it's also unprecedented for such a large&#10;5:23&#10;segment of the public to obey every word&#10;5:27&#10;of the dear leader anything he says goes&#10;5:30&#10;even when it's contradicted by all the&#10;5:32&#10;available facts facts what are facts he&#10;5:35&#10;really does have his own set of facts&#10;5:37&#10;and they buy his facts rather than the&#10;5:39&#10;real facts it's almost as if no one is&#10;5:42&#10;thinking about to happen in the&#10;5:43&#10;postTrump era whatever that may look&#10;5:46&#10;like or wherever we may get that and&#10;5:48&#10;you're totally right that it's just by&#10;5:51&#10;the book if Trump says jump we say how&#10;5:53&#10;high we're seeing that with the&#10;5:54&#10;reconciliation bill mike Johnson has&#10;5:56&#10;come out and said &quot;Oh well when Biden&#10;5:59&#10;did it he was trying to hide this what's&#10;6:00&#10;great about the Trump family is they're&#10;6:02&#10;just doing it in front of us.&quot; So this&#10;6:03&#10;naked corruption uh all well and good&#10;6:06&#10;because we can see it my question as&#10;6:08&#10;someone who's immersed in data&#10;6:11&#10;constantly is how do you take these very&#10;6:14&#10;real concerns that all of us certainly&#10;6:16&#10;on this podcast and millions of&#10;6:18&#10;Americans have about the threat to&#10;6:21&#10;democracy about the consolidation of&#10;6:22&#10;executive power about a Supreme Court&#10;6:25&#10;that doesn't seem to have a problem with&#10;6:27&#10;this kind of consolidation of executive&#10;6:29&#10;power and translate that into election&#10;6:32&#10;results because I thought we had a&#10;6:34&#10;pretty strong case in November granted&#10;6:37&#10;We can talk about this more you know&#10;6:38&#10;Kamla coming in for Biden it was&#10;6:40&#10;complicated but post January 6 you see&#10;6:43&#10;someone who doesn't respect the rule of&#10;6:44&#10;law right or someone who doesn't think&#10;6:45&#10;that your vote should count and voters&#10;6:48&#10;turned up and they elected him reelected&#10;6:51&#10;him and they knew all of this about him&#10;6:53&#10;so how do you think we can get that to&#10;6:55&#10;stick or do you think it's just always&#10;6:57&#10;going to be the economy and we have to&#10;6:59&#10;hope and pray for a recession so people&#10;Why do voters re-elect someone who threatens democracy despite widespread concerns?&#10;7:02&#10;vote for Democrats well at base it's&#10;7:04&#10;civic education which is what my center&#10;7:06&#10;for politics is dedicated to and is&#10;7:09&#10;trying to do something about at the&#10;7:11&#10;lowest possible levels meaning starting&#10;7:13&#10;in kindergarten and going through at&#10;7:15&#10;least high school and maybe uh junior&#10;7:18&#10;colleges as well you have to teach&#10;7:20&#10;people how to interpret the system and&#10;7:23&#10;they have to be willing to pay attention&#10;7:25&#10;they have to be willing to remember that&#10;7:27&#10;citizenship in America doesn't require&#10;7:30&#10;very much anymore used to require a lot&#10;7:32&#10;it requires that citizens pay attention&#10;7:35&#10;to big events uh and they don't i think&#10;7:38&#10;it was I think the New York Times uh had&#10;7:41&#10;a um had a piece of a poll uh over the&#10;7:45&#10;weekend where they uh separated&#10;7:48&#10;Americans into people who follow the&#10;7:50&#10;news carefully and people who don't and&#10;7:53&#10;the people who followed the news&#10;7:54&#10;carefully were much more critical of&#10;7:56&#10;Trump and much more concerned about what&#10;7:58&#10;he was doing and the people who didn't&#10;8:00&#10;follow what was happening in the news&#10;8:02&#10;thought everything Trump was doing not&#10;8:04&#10;everything but a lot of what Trump was&#10;8:06&#10;doing was just fine they were much more&#10;8:08&#10;inclined to support him and that is&#10;8:11&#10;potentially fatal to a system like ours&#10;8:15&#10;we've got to work on it everybody's got&#10;8:17&#10;to work on it uh most universities have&#10;8:19&#10;a center like mine we we all ought to be&#10;8:22&#10;working together on it high school and&#10;8:24&#10;elementary school teachers have to work&#10;8:26&#10;together on it we're having problems we&#10;8:28&#10;we started this 25 years ago and we were&#10;8:31&#10;able to get in the schools fairly easily&#10;8:34&#10;in fact the superintendent and&#10;8:36&#10;principles welcomed us because we were&#10;8:38&#10;providing all the information they&#10;8:40&#10;needed uh for free they paid for nothing&#10;8:44&#10;they used what they wanted to use now we&#10;8:47&#10;can't even get our foot in the door&#10;8:49&#10;because it's political they're worried&#10;8:51&#10;about offending their Republican&#10;8:53&#10;governors or their Republican&#10;8:54&#10;legislators or goodness knows the Trump&#10;8:57&#10;administration in Washington and I've&#10;8:59&#10;seen it everywhere i've seen it here uh&#10;9:01&#10;people people hunker down they don't&#10;9:03&#10;want to challenge things uh they feel&#10;9:06&#10;strongly about something but they won't&#10;9:08&#10;speak out about it that has never been a&#10;9:11&#10;part of university life around the&#10;9:13&#10;country it is now fear is everywhere&#10;9:16&#10;which is exactly what the Trump&#10;9:18&#10;administration has been trying to do and&#10;Ad Break&#10;9:21&#10;they are succeeding&#10;9:23&#10;uh Larry so one of the things that&#10;9:26&#10;frustrates me as a Democrat and it&#10;9:28&#10;sounds like we share concern over what's&#10;9:30&#10;taking place is that I I feel like the&#10;9:33&#10;best ally of this autotocracy is an&#10;9:35&#10;incredibly weak Democratic party and&#10;9:37&#10;that if the election my understanding is&#10;9:38&#10;the election happened a few days ago&#10;9:40&#10;despite everything that's gone on that&#10;9:42&#10;the president still would win yes and I&#10;9:46&#10;see leadership that is feckless i see an&#10;9:50&#10;inability to message correctly and meet&#10;9:53&#10;people where they get their news now and&#10;9:56&#10;I I couldn't even name if someone said&#10;9:58&#10;&quot;Who's the Democratic leader?&quot; I&#10;9:59&#10;wouldn't be able to give you a name i&#10;10:01&#10;don't I don't know if it's AOC or Senate&#10;10:03&#10;Minority Leader Schumer you studied&#10;10:05&#10;politics and election cycles if you were&#10;10:07&#10;advising the Democratic Party here on&#10;10:10&#10;how to effectively punch back what&#10;10:13&#10;points in history would you look to&#10;10:15&#10;either in this nation or abroad such&#10;10:17&#10;that we could rally what is a more&#10;10:19&#10;effective resistance let's start by&#10;What moment in history or example from another country best illustrates building an effective resistance?&#10;10:21&#10;remembering Democrats don't control the&#10;10:24&#10;House even if it's five votes we're&#10;10:26&#10;we're so partisan today the five votes&#10;10:28&#10;is enough to govern as I think they'll&#10;10:30&#10;prove again with that big beautiful bill&#10;10:32&#10;they don't control the Senate they do&#10;10:35&#10;have some influence there when 60 votes&#10;10:37&#10;are required but they don't control it&#10;10:39&#10;they don't control the White House they&#10;10:41&#10;don't control even federal agencies that&#10;10:43&#10;are supposed to be independent much less&#10;10:45&#10;the rest of the bureaucracy uh they&#10;10:47&#10;don't control half of the states a&#10;10:50&#10;little more than half of the states and&#10;10:52&#10;the legislatures they don't control the&#10;10:54&#10;Supreme Court which is still tilted&#10;10:56&#10;Republican even if occasionally one or&#10;10:59&#10;two of them will break uh with the Trump&#10;11:01&#10;preferences so they control nothing and&#10;11:04&#10;in a situation like that you have to&#10;11:07&#10;control your forum first because you&#10;11:10&#10;don't have anything else you have to&#10;11:13&#10;spend a lot of time and energy and&#10;11:14&#10;effort uh looking toward the next&#10;11:16&#10;election which they should be doing more&#10;11:18&#10;of rather than less of that's their&#10;11:21&#10;chance to regain the House it would take&#10;11:23&#10;a massive landslide wave against Trump&#10;11:27&#10;to to take control of the Senate given&#10;11:29&#10;the seats that are up but they can at&#10;11:30&#10;least focus on the House and I think a&#10;11:33&#10;10 15 20 seat majority is entirely&#10;11:36&#10;possible uh the way they're going&#10;11:39&#10;they'll be lucky to have the five seat&#10;11:41&#10;majority that Republicans have right now&#10;11:44&#10;but uh the House is a real possibility&#10;11:46&#10;and once you have some piece of the&#10;11:49&#10;government that you control you control&#10;11:52&#10;the schedule you control a lot of how&#10;11:53&#10;you structure the committee hearings and&#10;11:56&#10;all the rest of it you can have a&#10;11:58&#10;greater impact but for right now other&#10;12:01&#10;than focusing on the elections which to&#10;12:02&#10;me is the most important thing by far uh&#10;12:06&#10;you want to find ways uh to attract&#10;12:10&#10;media attention and therefore the&#10;12:12&#10;public's attention at least those who&#10;12:13&#10;will pay minimal attention to what the&#10;12:16&#10;media are covering and you do that by uh&#10;12:19&#10;clever actions by protests that are yes&#10;12:23&#10;intense maybe involving civil&#10;12:25&#10;disobedience nonviolent&#10;12:27&#10;nonvi's going to write me and say &quot;Oh&#10;12:29&#10;he's pushing violence.&quot; Of course not&#10;12:31&#10;nonviolence uh is a part of our history&#10;12:34&#10;nonviolent uh civil disobedience has had&#10;12:37&#10;a major impact on American history there&#10;12:39&#10;should be some of that there needs to be&#10;12:41&#10;some of that it's tough to say i can&#10;12:43&#10;tell you what it's easier to say what&#10;12:45&#10;they shouldn't be doing i I I can't stop&#10;12:48&#10;laughing about Chuck Schumer's tough&#10;12:51&#10;letter five or six paragraphs of it&#10;12:55&#10;really tough tough language to the to&#10;12:58&#10;President Trump as though he reads&#10;13:00&#10;anything uh but that's what they think&#10;13:03&#10;opposition is and I don't mean just to&#10;13:06&#10;criticize Schumer because it's really a&#10;13:09&#10;partywide problem and the leadership is&#10;13:13&#10;and I'm saying this as a guy getting&#10;13:15&#10;ready to turn 73 so I'm a senior it's&#10;13:18&#10;way too old the democratic structure is&#10;13:21&#10;way too old they need a lot more younger&#10;13:24&#10;people who won't take no for an answer&#10;13:26&#10;and yes uh a good number of people who&#10;13:29&#10;who do what we used to do in the 60s and&#10;13:31&#10;70s issue a list of non-negotiable&#10;13:34&#10;demands all of which you will negotiate&#10;13:36&#10;in time but you have a list of&#10;13:38&#10;non-negotiable demands and you organize&#10;13:41&#10;around it and you get people energized&#10;13:43&#10;about it and activated about it because&#10;13:45&#10;the Democratic Party and the Democratic&#10;13:48&#10;constituency is half dead and I'm being&#10;13:51&#10;kind you spent your life at an institute&#10;13:53&#10;of higher education&#10;13:55&#10;how would you describe&#10;13:57&#10;anti-discrimination or efforts to root&#10;14:00&#10;out anti-semitism of the Trump&#10;14:02&#10;administration by cutting funding to&#10;14:04&#10;higher education institutions what is&#10;14:06&#10;your viewpoint there and can you point&#10;14:08&#10;to any similar situations throughout&#10;14:10&#10;history and how that informs what's&#10;What is your view on the Trump administration’s cuts to funding for universities nationwide?&#10;14:12&#10;going on here you want to start by&#10;14:13&#10;saying any anti-semitism is wrong and we&#10;14:16&#10;had a little bit of it here it was it&#10;14:18&#10;was relatively minor compared to other&#10;14:21&#10;universities while it's a legitimate&#10;14:24&#10;concern and it's worse in some places i&#10;14:26&#10;think some of the Ivy League schools do&#10;14:28&#10;have a problem uh with it and and it&#10;14:30&#10;deserves a lot of focus and it's getting&#10;14:33&#10;it as far as I can see it's also a cover&#10;14:36&#10;story for the Trump administration&#10;14:38&#10;they're using that which is strongly&#10;14:41&#10;supported uh by I hope most or all&#10;14:44&#10;Americans or at least most Americans and&#10;14:46&#10;certainly by a vast majority of the&#10;14:48&#10;Republican party constituency that is&#10;14:51&#10;not a reason to limit what universities&#10;14:54&#10;can investigate or to withdraw grants&#10;14:58&#10;that are in looking into uh terrible&#10;15:01&#10;diseases people will die because of all&#10;15:04&#10;of this withdrawn money it's not wasted&#10;15:06&#10;money in fact if you want money well&#10;15:09&#10;spent you generally go to to the health&#10;15:11&#10;side of a university uh and it has more&#10;15:13&#10;impact so it's a cover story uh to some&#10;15:17&#10;degree we've seen some of it here but&#10;15:20&#10;not nearly as much of it i tell you what&#10;15:22&#10;people should focus on more it's not&#10;15:25&#10;just Trump it's where he's reinforced by&#10;15:28&#10;Republican governors andor Republican&#10;15:31&#10;legislators in most of the states the uh&#10;15:34&#10;governors appoint most or all of the&#10;15:38&#10;board of trustees or we call it a board&#10;15:40&#10;of visitors here for public institutions&#10;15:42&#10;private institutions do it a different&#10;15:44&#10;way but uh they appoint people who are&#10;15:48&#10;going to push their agenda and today the&#10;15:51&#10;Republican party agenda is Donald Trump&#10;15:53&#10;and whatever he stands for i mean&#10;15:55&#10;there's so few Republicans who will&#10;15:57&#10;stand up i should say there are so few&#10;15:59&#10;ex Republicans who will stand up to&#10;16:01&#10;Trump because if they weren't&#10;16:02&#10;ex-Republicans at the beginning they'll&#10;16:04&#10;be ex-Republicans once MAGA takes care&#10;16:07&#10;of them uh and that's the real problem&#10;16:10&#10;because you have the states reinforcing&#10;16:12&#10;what the Trump administration is doing&#10;16:14&#10;in the slight majority of the states&#10;16:16&#10;where they uh control the appointments&#10;16:19&#10;so it's it's tough again elections&#10;16:21&#10;matter and most of the focus has to be&#10;16:24&#10;on winning the next election not just&#10;16:26&#10;for the House and the Senate and in&#10;16:28&#10;Washington but also for the state&#10;16:30&#10;legislatores and the governorships that&#10;16:32&#10;are up and most of them are up in 2026&#10;16:35&#10;as a as an off-year election can you&#10;16:37&#10;talk a bit as well about the role of&#10;16:39&#10;independence because I I I go to your&#10;16:41&#10;commentary for a whole host of reasons u&#10;16:44&#10;but most predominantly for your vantage&#10;16:46&#10;point on independence and what actually&#10;16:48&#10;sways them in elections of course&#10;How do independents influence elections, and what factors most sway their votes?&#10;16:50&#10;independents have turned pretty strongly&#10;16:53&#10;against Trump that's why his ratings&#10;16:55&#10;have been falling and they'll fall more&#10;16:58&#10;once the independents who are not paying&#10;17:00&#10;attention uh figure out what's going on&#10;17:03&#10;but they they're the the group of voters&#10;17:06&#10;that will switch without much push or&#10;17:09&#10;pressure uh depending on the&#10;17:12&#10;circumstances of their lives like the&#10;17:14&#10;economy but not just the economy what&#10;17:17&#10;influences them is what helps them in&#10;17:19&#10;their daily lives they're heavily&#10;17:21&#10;concentrated now they used to be&#10;17:22&#10;concentrated in high education u part of&#10;17:26&#10;the electorate the highly educated part&#10;17:28&#10;of the elected high income part of the&#10;17:30&#10;electorate now it's more uh middle class&#10;17:33&#10;and uh lower middle class that comprise&#10;17:36&#10;the independents and those independents&#10;17:38&#10;as I say are busy earning a living or&#10;17:40&#10;busy living their lives they don't have&#10;17:42&#10;a lot of extra time they certainly don't&#10;17:43&#10;pay attention to public affairs as much&#10;17:45&#10;as they as they should look so you&#10;17:48&#10;you're in the business of making or you&#10;17:50&#10;know you've you have a kind of branded&#10;17:53&#10;crystal ball given that we're still a&#10;17:55&#10;ways out it can't come soon enough what&#10;17:58&#10;are we 18 months out what what are your&#10;18:01&#10;predictions so far what do you see&#10;What are your predictions for the 2026 elections?&#10;18:02&#10;regarding the House in 26 and any Senate&#10;18:06&#10;races my motto it's there's a bit of a&#10;18:09&#10;satirical element to Crystal Ball uh our&#10;18:11&#10;slogan is he who lives by the crystal&#10;18:13&#10;ball ends up eating ground glass and&#10;18:15&#10;we've had plenty of ground glass like&#10;18:16&#10;every other analyst so I don't want to&#10;18:18&#10;pretend that we've always been right uh&#10;18:21&#10;although we have a better record than&#10;18:23&#10;some others but I don't want to get into&#10;18:24&#10;that because it's so nasty um anyway&#10;18:28&#10;what are we predicting so far it would&#10;18:30&#10;be nearly impossible to predict that&#10;18:33&#10;Republicans would hold the House&#10;18:35&#10;although we've just published an&#10;18:37&#10;analysis in the crystal ball from some&#10;18:38&#10;distinguished political scientists who&#10;18:41&#10;uh have used another measure measure&#10;18:43&#10;that has been ignored for the most part&#10;18:45&#10;what does the public think will happen&#10;18:47&#10;which party do they believe will hold on&#10;18:50&#10;well it's early but even the early&#10;18:52&#10;predictions often have been right from&#10;18:54&#10;the public and they seem to think&#10;18:56&#10;Republicans will hang on to both the&#10;18:57&#10;House and Senate i don't buy it uh some&#10;19:01&#10;of my colleagues do i think the the odds&#10;19:04&#10;are substantial that Democrats will&#10;19:06&#10;carry the House we don't know the margin&#10;19:08&#10;we can't even guesstimate the margin as&#10;19:11&#10;I say I think it could go up to around&#10;19:13&#10;20 seats uh if if it's a anti-Trump&#10;19:16&#10;landslide obviously higher than that&#10;19:18&#10;more than that as it was in 2018 another&#10;19:21&#10;anti-Trump landslide but the Senate um&#10;19:24&#10;there's a tiny chance Democrats could&#10;19:26&#10;take control but look at the map you&#10;19:29&#10;know the normal balance in the Senate if&#10;19:31&#10;you look at the map according to the red&#10;19:34&#10;and blue divisions that exist in America&#10;19:37&#10;today is about 53 Republicans and 47&#10;19:40&#10;Democrats so Democrats really do have to&#10;19:43&#10;be riding something of a wave probably&#10;19:46&#10;in two elections to take control of the&#10;19:49&#10;Senate again because the normal majority&#10;19:51&#10;is about what they have right now 5347&#10;19:54&#10;for the Republicans that's because of&#10;19:58&#10;the system this founder set up which I I&#10;20:01&#10;published a book a more perfect&#10;20:02&#10;constitution 23 changes to the&#10;20:04&#10;constitution uh not one of them has&#10;20:07&#10;happened since I published a book in&#10;20:08&#10;2007 and it's been very hurtful to me&#10;20:10&#10;personally that none of them have been&#10;20:13&#10;ratified but I I don't think the Senate&#10;20:15&#10;should be structured the way it is and&#10;20:18&#10;when you have four senators from two&#10;20:20&#10;Dakotas and I've spent some time in both&#10;20:23&#10;Dakotas and you can't tell them apart&#10;20:24&#10;i'm sorry uh there's no reason why they&#10;20:27&#10;should have four senators but with&#10;20:29&#10;enough red states small rural states the&#10;20:32&#10;Republicans have to try to lose the&#10;20:34&#10;Senate and then then you have the&#10;20:35&#10;presidential veto which would eliminate&#10;20:38&#10;virtually everything that the Congress&#10;20:40&#10;could do other than appointments and and&#10;20:42&#10;treaties in the Senate well I wonder if&#10;20:44&#10;we'll ever have another treaty because&#10;20:45&#10;of the voting requirement uh needed&#10;20:48&#10;there to ratify uh so anyway that's what&#10;20:51&#10;we see now&#10;20:52&#10;gubanatorilially there is a real chance&#10;20:55&#10;for for Democratic breakthrough but they&#10;20:57&#10;also have to hold um states close states&#10;21:00&#10;competitive states that they have like&#10;21:02&#10;Michigan and Arizona and so on uh but&#10;21:05&#10;they they could score some surprising&#10;21:07&#10;victories there as off-year elections&#10;21:09&#10;when people are just as I think they&#10;21:11&#10;will be dead sick of Trump and the Trump&#10;21:15&#10;appeasers or Trump acolytes or Trump&#10;21:18&#10;minions that are in office what's one&#10;21:20&#10;issue that makes you rage and what's one&#10;21:22&#10;issue that you think we should all calm&#10;What's one issue that makes you rage and one issue we should all calm down about?&#10;21:24&#10;down about god I rage about a lot of&#10;21:26&#10;things but mainly it's my age um I I&#10;21:30&#10;probably because I I watch more TV news&#10;21:32&#10;than I ever have before and u it does as&#10;21:35&#10;someone who is on cable news I apologize&#10;21:38&#10;to the entire world uh for what we&#10;21:40&#10;export it's okay it's really social&#10;21:42&#10;media more than it is TV tv funnels&#10;21:46&#10;what's selling on social media I think&#10;21:48&#10;more than the reverse uh but that makes&#10;21:51&#10;me rage there's nothing we can do about&#10;21:53&#10;social media i wish we could i The one&#10;21:56&#10;thing I've been waiting for that I was&#10;21:58&#10;promised as a young person was a time&#10;22:00&#10;machine i gave up on flying cars but we&#10;22:03&#10;were promised a time machine and we&#10;22:05&#10;still don't have one cuz I'd like to go&#10;22:07&#10;back and make it impossible to create&#10;22:09&#10;social media i don't know how I do it&#10;22:10&#10;but I would I would try to do that in&#10;22:13&#10;addition to preventing assassinations&#10;22:14&#10;and lots of other terrible things and we&#10;22:17&#10;can't survive for the long term the way&#10;22:20&#10;we are now we really can't and I wish&#10;22:23&#10;people would focus on that i I know it's&#10;22:25&#10;hard scott was saying earlier it's very&#10;22:28&#10;difficult to get people to care about&#10;22:30&#10;democracy enough to make it uh an issue&#10;22:32&#10;or the issue in an election i I&#10;22:34&#10;completely agree that that is true for&#10;22:37&#10;now uh it ought not to be true after&#10;22:39&#10;January 6th maybe the Democratic Party&#10;22:42&#10;would would do better just rerunning the&#10;22:44&#10;films of January 6th instead of the crap&#10;22:47&#10;they put out there on TV ads the clever&#10;22:50&#10;TV ads that pay the consultants enormous&#10;22:53&#10;fees just remind people what was at&#10;22:56&#10;stake and what could have happened we we&#10;22:58&#10;would not have had a Democratic election&#10;23:01&#10;in uh in 2020 if Trump had had his way&#10;23:04&#10;and in the recesses of his mind you're&#10;23:07&#10;not going to tell me that he isn't&#10;23:09&#10;thinking of ways to continue his regime&#10;23:12&#10;either with him or with somebody that he&#10;23:14&#10;trusts a member of his family or maybe&#10;23:17&#10;JD Vance I don't know uh in in four&#10;23:20&#10;years and I'm even worried about 2026&#10;23:23&#10;what what can his SIZA do the the&#10;23:26&#10;organization in in uh DHS that Chris&#10;23:30&#10;Krebs headed up that looks at cyber&#10;23:32&#10;security and they know how the system&#10;23:34&#10;works and uh if you have an honest head&#10;23:37&#10;of SIZA they make it work better and&#10;23:40&#10;they make sure that uh that uh foreign&#10;23:42&#10;influences are not guiding our elections&#10;23:45&#10;but if you have someone who has bad&#10;23:48&#10;motives and who is listening to the&#10;23:51&#10;devils in the Oval Office then it is&#10;23:54&#10;possible to screw up and to to tilt even&#10;23:57&#10;a midterm election we all need to watch&#10;24:00&#10;everything carefully we have to it's a&#10;24:03&#10;matter of our survival as a as a&#10;24:06&#10;republic that was a long answer i got

to discuss how&#10;0:18&#10;new teaching guidelines are stoking a&#10;0:20&#10;culture of fear and why he's taking&#10;0:22&#10;drastic measures as a result&#10;0:26&#10;thanks Christian professor Jason Staley&#10;0:28&#10;thanks so much for talking with us once&#10;0:29&#10;again thank you Michelle it's great to&#10;0:32&#10;be in conversation in this existential&#10;0:34&#10;time so so you've been thinking about&#10;0:36&#10;and writing about authoritarianism for&#10;0:38&#10;quite a while you recently wrote a piece&#10;0:41&#10;for the Guardian in which you said that&#10;0:43&#10;President Trump is leading the country&#10;0:45&#10;down the path of educational&#10;0:48&#10;authoritarianism what does that mean&#10;0:51&#10;that means that he's creating a culture&#10;0:54&#10;of fear in universities they already&#10;0:57&#10;have done this in states like Florida uh&#10;1:00&#10;creating a culture of fear in K through2&#10;1:03&#10;education but authoritarianism&#10;1:06&#10;uh requires a culture of fear it&#10;1:08&#10;requires uh feeling like the state is&#10;1:11&#10;always looking o over your shoulder&#10;1:14&#10;feeling like there are vague rules that&#10;1:17&#10;you can be punished for and your fellow&#10;1:20&#10;citizens have been empowered to report&#10;1:23&#10;you that's the first thing it means the&#10;1:26&#10;second thing it means is that there's an&#10;1:28&#10;official state ideology and if you&#10;1:30&#10;violate the official state ideology you&#10;1:33&#10;get in trouble&#10;1:35&#10;what sparked your latest piece uh for&#10;1:38&#10;the Guardian was this dear colleague&#10;1:40&#10;letter that the Department of Education&#10;1:43&#10;issued the Office of Civil Rights issued&#10;1:45&#10;on February 14th it was a letter to&#10;1:47&#10;American educational institutions and it&#10;1:49&#10;essentially&#10;1:51&#10;reinterpreted federal civil rights law&#10;1:53&#10;let me just read a little bit of it it&#10;1:55&#10;said that educational institutions have&#10;1:57&#10;toxically indoctrinated students with&#10;1:59&#10;the false premise that the United States&#10;2:02&#10;is built upon systemic and structural&#10;2:04&#10;racism and advanced discriminatory&#10;2:06&#10;policies and practices and that&#10;2:08&#10;proponents of these discriminatory&#10;2:10&#10;practices have attempted to further&#10;2:11&#10;justify them particularly during the&#10;2:13&#10;last four years under the banner of&#10;2:15&#10;diversity equity and inclusion you know&#10;2:17&#10;DEI smuggling racial stereotypes and&#10;2:20&#10;explicit race consciousness into&#10;2:22&#10;everyday training programming and&#10;2:24&#10;discipline so first of all your reaction&#10;2:26&#10;to this and and tell us why you were so&#10;2:29&#10;concerned about this that you you said&#10;2:30&#10;that this is what is the is the sign&#10;2:33&#10;that that is the intention of the&#10;2:35&#10;administration to move toward this path&#10;2:38&#10;well the the dear colleague letter&#10;2:41&#10;announces that it's the intention uh of&#10;2:43&#10;the administration to move towards this&#10;2:45&#10;path and in Linda McMahon's uh final&#10;2:48&#10;mission statement of the Department of&#10;2:50&#10;Education she mentions patriotic&#10;2:52&#10;education as uh as sort of the goal here&#10;2:56&#10;of uh to impose on K through 12 uh and&#10;3:00&#10;universities uh so the problem here is&#10;3:03&#10;that the United States is founded and&#10;3:06&#10;built upon systemat systematic racism&#10;3:09&#10;and inclusion it's part of our founding&#10;3:12&#10;documents that uh that we wanted to take&#10;3:15&#10;more indigenous land uh so slavery the&#10;3:19&#10;United States is built on slavery&#10;3:21&#10;there's no factual argument about that&#10;3:24&#10;so when you begin by saying that&#10;3:26&#10;universities and K through2 schools are&#10;3:29&#10;not allowed to teach facts then you're&#10;3:32&#10;already on a very problematic uh playing&#10;3:35&#10;field and part of the point of these&#10;3:38&#10;guidelines is to be vague because it&#10;3:40&#10;allows wide latitude to target&#10;3:43&#10;professors and to encourage students to&#10;3:47&#10;report professors for anything that&#10;3:50&#10;might suggest that the United States was&#10;3:52&#10;not always the greatest nation on earth&#10;3:55&#10;and was essentially free from sin is is&#10;3:58&#10;is part of the issue here because I mean&#10;4:00&#10;because to take it from the other&#10;4:02&#10;direction I mean conservatives would say&#10;4:04&#10;that that progressives or&#10;4:07&#10;non-conservatives whatever you want to&#10;4:09&#10;say are are are just mad because they're&#10;4:12&#10;offering an alternative ideology that&#10;4:14&#10;they're just they're replacing one&#10;4:16&#10;ideology with another and that you know&#10;4:19&#10;I think their argument is elections have&#10;4:20&#10;consequences and they get to do that&#10;4:22&#10;like what do you say to that&#10;4:24&#10;there's no such thing i mean in a&#10;4:26&#10;democracy the state cannot impose uh a&#10;4:30&#10;required uh patriotic ideology uh I mean&#10;4:35&#10;universities are not there in a&#10;4:38&#10;democracy to uh to uh as to stoke&#10;4:43&#10;egos of the citizens of a country just&#10;4:47&#10;imagine what uh your cartoon vision of&#10;4:52&#10;an authoritarian country it's where the&#10;4:54&#10;purpose of schools is to tell students&#10;4:56&#10;to love their country and not question&#10;4:59&#10;it in a democracy universities are there&#10;5:02&#10;to teach the facts they're not there to&#10;5:05&#10;to breed&#10;5:07&#10;patriotism these documents explicitly&#10;5:10&#10;tell us the purpose of schools and&#10;5:12&#10;universities is to create patriotic&#10;5:15&#10;citizens that is not the purpose of&#10;5:17&#10;univer that's nationalist education that&#10;5:20&#10;is not democratic education what they've&#10;5:23&#10;been doing by banning critical race&#10;5:25&#10;theory which is essentially banning&#10;5:27&#10;black history because you're banning the&#10;5:30&#10;study of institutions that developed&#10;5:32&#10;under slavery and Jim Crow that have&#10;5:34&#10;repercussions today so you're banning&#10;5:37&#10;that with these vague guidelines you&#10;5:39&#10;know they say we're not banning that but&#10;5:41&#10;the guidelines are so vague that you&#10;5:43&#10;would be you know you would be foolish&#10;5:46&#10;to test whether or not it's really&#10;5:48&#10;banning that so what what's your&#10;5:51&#10;evidence of that though what's your&#10;5:52&#10;evidence that that is the case because I&#10;5:54&#10;think other people might look at that&#10;5:55&#10;and say &quot;Well they're vague that means&#10;5:56&#10;that there's room for interpretation.&quot;&#10;5:58&#10;So why do you say that the vagueness is&#10;6:00&#10;itself a problem well the uh a&#10;6:03&#10;conservative intellectual in a New York&#10;6:06&#10;Times uh uh article uh where I was also&#10;6:10&#10;quoted said you know terms like DEI are&#10;6:14&#10;vague so they allow us wide latitude to&#10;6:17&#10;target people uh because they leave they&#10;6:19&#10;leave it open to interpretation and&#10;6:21&#10;that's the point so we can basically&#10;6:23&#10;target anything we want by calling it&#10;6:26&#10;DEI and that's what Christopher Rufo one&#10;6:30&#10;of the main political activists behind&#10;6:32&#10;this strategy said he said uh early on&#10;6:35&#10;we're going to call the federal&#10;6:37&#10;bureaucracy critical race theory and&#10;6:39&#10;then people will want to take it on take&#10;6:41&#10;it down this is evocative of the&#10;6:44&#10;Republican southern strategy of calling&#10;6:46&#10;anything they don't like welfare and&#10;6:49&#10;then that would create negative&#10;6:51&#10;attitudes towards it and now this does&#10;6:54&#10;the vagueness does leave room for&#10;6:56&#10;contestation but would you like to go in&#10;6:59&#10;front of a school board would you like&#10;7:01&#10;to go in in front of a title six office&#10;7:04&#10;with a lawyer to defend that con uh that&#10;7:06&#10;that in the interpretation that it does&#10;7:09&#10;not that your teaching about slavery or&#10;7:11&#10;Jim Crow or mortgage redlinining uh does&#10;7:15&#10;not fit uh does not fall under these&#10;7:18&#10;prohibited guidelines uh that's really a&#10;7:21&#10;distraction from your work legal fees&#10;7:24&#10;are very expensive uh most teachers and&#10;7:27&#10;professors if not all teachers and&#10;7:29&#10;professors would like to avoid that&#10;7:32&#10;american universities have been engines&#10;7:36&#10;of tremendous wealth tremendous&#10;7:38&#10;innovation there's a reason why people&#10;7:40&#10;want to come from all over the world to&#10;7:42&#10;study at these universities including&#10;7:44&#10;people like Peter Teal and Elon Musk&#10;7:48&#10;um because of because of their role in&#10;7:52&#10;creating private wealth through the&#10;7:54&#10;accumulation of knowledge so why is it&#10;7:57&#10;that they in in your estimation that&#10;7:59&#10;these activists are so and this&#10;8:02&#10;administration is&#10;8:04&#10;so sort of hellbent on bringing&#10;8:06&#10;universities to heal can I be frank&#10;8:09&#10;Michelle i hope so&#10;8:11&#10;uh they are destroying my country they&#10;8:14&#10;are intentionally destroying my country&#10;8:17&#10;vlad they're saying Vladimir Putin is an&#10;8:19&#10;ally they're taking down the federal&#10;8:22&#10;bureaucracy they're taking down the&#10;8:24&#10;schools and universities to enrich the&#10;8:27&#10;the billionaire class and then they're&#10;8:29&#10;throwing scapegoats to the American&#10;8:32&#10;people to the working people trans women&#10;8:36&#10;black Americans uh it's about uh juicing&#10;8:40&#10;up dominant group victimhood it's about&#10;8:43&#10;telling white Americans you're the real&#10;8:45&#10;victims and once we target all the&#10;8:49&#10;people who made you feel like you&#10;8:51&#10;weren't the real victims all the people&#10;8:53&#10;who are making you feel guilty for&#10;8:56&#10;inheriting your house from your parents&#10;8:58&#10;when they didn't have a couldn't inherit&#10;9:00&#10;a house from your parents once we do&#10;9:02&#10;that then everything's good for you and&#10;9:05&#10;we can dismantle the country uh that's&#10;9:08&#10;what's going on and starting out with&#10;9:10&#10;the universities uh is vital you take&#10;9:12&#10;down the universities you tell people&#10;9:14&#10;universities are just for job skills&#10;9:16&#10;they're not for they're not democratic&#10;9:19&#10;institutions anymore uh and then so you&#10;9:22&#10;encourage people not to go and uh you&#10;9:24&#10;encourage people not to go to&#10;9:25&#10;universities you make student loans more&#10;9:28&#10;difficult more expensive privatize them&#10;9:31&#10;uh and you and then you delegitimize the&#10;9:33&#10;university one of the things that you&#10;9:35&#10;talked about is the fact&#10;9:37&#10;that Columbia University is the source&#10;9:39&#10;of particular eye to this administration&#10;9:42&#10;and also to let's say members of&#10;9:44&#10;Congress who made a point of making a&#10;9:46&#10;pilgrimage to the university to um you&#10;9:49&#10;know to express their outrage at what&#10;9:51&#10;they consider to be&#10;9:53&#10;anti-semitic demonstrations that started&#10;9:55&#10;in the wake of Israel's war on Gaza&#10;9:58&#10;colombia agreed to a list of Trump&#10;10:00&#10;demands in order to re reinstate some&#10;10:02&#10;$400 million in federal funding that the&#10;10:07&#10;administration revoked as they said for&#10;10:10&#10;punishment for Colombia's failure to&#10;10:12&#10;protect uh its Jewish&#10;10:15&#10;students so let me ask you about this&#10;10:17&#10;because the reality of it is there are a&#10;10:19&#10;lot of Jewish students at Colombia who&#10;10:20&#10;did feel threatened and demeaned by&#10;10:24&#10;these by these demonstrations so some&#10;10:27&#10;people are looking at this and they say&#10;10:28&#10;that this is kind of an outrageous&#10;10:29&#10;capitulation on Colombia's part but&#10;10:32&#10;other people are saying well you know&#10;10:34&#10;maybe this was just a pragmatic step to&#10;10:37&#10;try&#10;10:38&#10;to survive this era what do you think&#10;10:42&#10;there were a tremendous number of Arab&#10;10:44&#10;students who felt incredibly threatened&#10;10:47&#10;at Colombia what about them their people&#10;10:50&#10;too first&#10;10:52&#10;secondly at Yale and I'm sure this is&#10;10:54&#10;true of Colombia there were a very large&#10;10:57&#10;number of Jewish students in those&#10;10:59&#10;protests because who on campus cares the&#10;11:02&#10;most about the behavior of Israel well&#10;11:06&#10;one group are Jewish students but the&#10;11:09&#10;way the administration is using the term&#10;11:11&#10;anti-semitism is synonymous with leftism&#10;11:14&#10;which is ironic because the large&#10;11:16&#10;majority of Jewish Americans voted for&#10;11:19&#10;Kla Harris uh you know comparable to&#10;11:23&#10;black Americans so but the&#10;11:25&#10;administration is using the term&#10;11:27&#10;anti-semitism as short for leftism so&#10;11:30&#10;Jewish Americans like me who are highly&#10;11:32&#10;critical of Israel uh I mean I don't&#10;11:34&#10;know what the phrase right to exist&#10;11:37&#10;means but you know I'm not you know I&#10;11:41&#10;don't want to take down the state of&#10;11:42&#10;Israel i'm some kind of Zionist however&#10;11:45&#10;I'm very critical of the behavior of the&#10;11:48&#10;state of Israel and there were plenty of&#10;11:51&#10;students it was it was you know tied for&#10;11:54&#10;the largest identity group in the&#10;11:56&#10;protests so why don't they count as&#10;11:58&#10;Jewish well the administration is saying&#10;12:00&#10;there are good Jews and bad Jews and&#10;12:03&#10;good Jews are the ones who uh support&#10;12:07&#10;Israel's actions in Gaza and bad Jews&#10;12:10&#10;are the people like me uh who uh who are&#10;12:13&#10;highly critical of what is happening and&#10;12:16&#10;push for Palestinian rights uh because&#10;12:19&#10;Palestinians deserve every bit of&#10;12:22&#10;political equality uh that Jews Jewish&#10;12:25&#10;people deserve so this Yeah you you&#10;12:28&#10;argue that the Trump administration is&#10;12:30&#10;using the pretext of Jewish safety to&#10;12:32&#10;justify crackdowns on disscent and&#10;12:35&#10;critical scholarship and you actually&#10;12:38&#10;have said that you think this actually&#10;12:40&#10;reinforces anti-semitic tropes so can&#10;12:44&#10;you say can you say more about that this&#10;12:46&#10;is reinforcing anti-semitic tropes all&#10;12:48&#10;across the political spectrum what is&#10;12:51&#10;the the most what are the most toxic&#10;12:53&#10;anti-semitic tropes well Jews control&#10;12:56&#10;the institutions this is absolutely&#10;12:59&#10;reinforcing this any young American is&#10;13:01&#10;going to think remember what happened&#10;13:02&#10;when they took down the world's greatest&#10;13:05&#10;university system uh on behalf of Jewish&#10;13:09&#10;safety uh and uh this will go down in&#10;13:12&#10;history books the history of this era&#10;13:16&#10;will say that that Jewish people were&#10;13:20&#10;the sledgehammer for fascism so if we&#10;13:23&#10;don't speak out if we American Jews do&#10;13:26&#10;not speak out against this this will be&#10;13:29&#10;a grim history chapter in our history as&#10;13:33&#10;Americans the first time in my life uh&#10;13:36&#10;as an American that I have been fearful&#10;13:39&#10;of our status as equal Americans not&#10;13:42&#10;because of the protests on campus which&#10;13:46&#10;as I said were uh had a lot of Jewish&#10;13:49&#10;students in them but because we are&#10;13:52&#10;suddenly at the center of politics of US&#10;13:55&#10;politics it's never good to be in the&#10;13:57&#10;crosshairs for us and we are being used&#10;14:01&#10;to destroy democracy the history books&#10;14:05&#10;are going to be harsh unless we Jewish&#10;14:08&#10;Americans can say this should not be&#10;14:10&#10;done in our name and finally by focusing&#10;14:15&#10;on us they're erasing the atrocities and&#10;14:18&#10;horrors that are happening in Gaza and&#10;14:21&#10;they're shifting the true victims here&#10;14:25&#10;uh not just Palestinians who are here&#10;14:28&#10;but the victims in Gaza uh and the West&#10;14:32&#10;Bank uh of the Israeli government's&#10;14:35&#10;policies well then um well I have two&#10;14:38&#10;questions here that first of all why do&#10;14:40&#10;you think that Colombia has agreed to&#10;14:43&#10;these these terms including you know&#10;14:46&#10;banning face masks and empowering campus&#10;14:49&#10;police officers to remove people from&#10;14:51&#10;campus or arrest them if needed why why&#10;14:53&#10;would Colombia which is not&#10;14:55&#10;a a poor institution agree to these&#10;14:58&#10;terms&#10;15:00&#10;two reasons first of all uh there are&#10;15:03&#10;people within the Colombia structure who&#10;15:06&#10;are essentially betraying Colombia they&#10;15:09&#10;agree with this ideological attack uh I&#10;15:12&#10;think uh that is really problematic&#10;15:15&#10;they're not seeing it they're in fact&#10;15:16&#10;traitors to their own institutions uh so&#10;15:19&#10;that's one point uh the this the second&#10;15:23&#10;point is uh that um you know this&#10;15:29&#10;Colombia is completely bending to an&#10;15:33&#10;authoritarian regime and what we're&#10;15:36&#10;seeing across universities Michelle is&#10;15:39&#10;we're seeing this culture of fear this&#10;15:41&#10;idea that if we just do what they say&#10;15:44&#10;everything will be okay but I'm seeing&#10;15:48&#10;this everywhere and it's one reason that&#10;15:51&#10;uh I am probably leaving the United&#10;15:53&#10;States to the University of Toronto&#10;15:56&#10;is that is that is that I was going to&#10;15:59&#10;ask what what are your thoughts about&#10;16:01&#10;your own course here so you you feel&#10;16:05&#10;strongly enough about this that you are&#10;16:07&#10;going to leave the country&#10;16:10&#10;yes uh because what I would not do this&#10;16:13&#10;if I saw all of our universities banding&#10;16:17&#10;together but it's not just the&#10;16:18&#10;universities Michelle it's the law firms&#10;16:21&#10;it's all of our American institutions uh&#10;16:24&#10;when uh when Paul Weiss Paul and Weiss&#10;16:28&#10;uh uh&#10;16:31&#10;capitulated the part of the reason they&#10;16:32&#10;capitulated is other law firms instead&#10;16:34&#10;of defending them were going after their&#10;16:37&#10;clients now we see universities saying&#10;16:40&#10;things including my university like&#10;16:42&#10;&quot;We're going to keep our head down so&#10;16:44&#10;we're not targeted.&quot; As soon as I heard&#10;16:46&#10;that vocabulary I knew sort of you know&#10;16:49&#10;it might be that game the game is over&#10;16:52&#10;because you're not banding together if&#10;16:55&#10;you say we're going to keep our head&#10;16:57&#10;down so So so I want to get back to you&#10;16:59&#10;though you you are you're leaving um any&#10;17:02&#10;any regrets about that do you you feel&#10;17:05&#10;in a way you're abandoning the fight or&#10;17:06&#10;how do you see it i think Canada is very&#10;17:10&#10;centrally in the fight right now so uh&#10;17:13&#10;you know I uh I would return to the&#10;17:16&#10;United States my home uh in a heartbeat&#10;17:19&#10;and I hope you know and that's why I'm&#10;17:20&#10;saying I'm probably moving to Canada&#10;17:22&#10;because I might return to Yale uh if so&#10;17:25&#10;uh if the they essentially allow me with&#10;17:28&#10;with leave structures i'm leaving&#10;17:30&#10;because the political climate for the&#10;17:32&#10;universities and the political climate&#10;17:34&#10;for freedom looks grim in this country&#10;17:36&#10;we face a fascist regime so uh so I can&#10;17:40&#10;best fight it in a country that is&#10;17:43&#10;dedicated to fre to the the values that&#10;17:46&#10;I love the values that America the&#10;17:49&#10;United States was formed on freedom and&#10;17:52&#10;equality uh and Canada definitely&#10;17:55&#10;centers those values i have two black&#10;17:58&#10;children uh two black Jewish children&#10;18:01&#10;and you know uh the United States to&#10;18:05&#10;erase to to use one of their identities&#10;18:08&#10;as a sledgehammer for fascism and to try&#10;18:11&#10;to erase another of their identities uh&#10;18:15&#10;is uh deeply problematic for me and you&#10;18:18&#10;know there's all these long-standing&#10;18:20&#10;features of this country like mass&#10;18:22&#10;incarceration that I worry and uh&#10;18:24&#10;violent policing that uh obviously with&#10;18:28&#10;two black sons uh concern me as well but&#10;18:31&#10;I this is my home the United States is&#10;18:33&#10;my home it will always be my home i'm a&#10;18:35&#10;patriotic American and I want to fight&#10;18:38&#10;for our country but I do have two small&#10;18:41&#10;children i do have two young children uh&#10;18:44&#10;and I do think that the institutions&#10;18:47&#10;that I love uh are being existentially&#10;18:50&#10;threatened and they're not defending&#10;18:53&#10;themselves uh in a way that gives me any&#10;18:57&#10;kind of uh hope uh that free inquiry&#10;19:01&#10;will still be possible professor Jason&#10;19:04&#10;Stanley thank you so much for talking&#10;19:07&#10;with us you've certainly given us a lot&#10;19:08&#10;to think about thank you so much&#10;19:10&#10;Michelle&#10;19:15&#10;[Music]&#10;19:22&#10;[Music]" />

when you talk to them&#10;1:10&#10;they all say plainly that it's never&#10;1:11&#10;been this bad it's going downhill the&#10;1:14&#10;automotive industry the whole mechanical&#10;1:16&#10;engineering sector is in free fall&#10;1:18&#10;everyone is&#10;1:24&#10;struggling Yan Peta is still in school&#10;1:27&#10;he feels that politicians aren't&#10;1:29&#10;listening to his&#10;1:34&#10;generation I still remember when we were&#10;1:36&#10;at home for days because school was out&#10;1:39&#10;all the teachers were sick I wish they&#10;1:41&#10;would pay more attention to&#10;1:43&#10;us several hundred kilometers away&#10;1:46&#10;Munich is one of the wealthiest places&#10;1:49&#10;in Germany the Leopold family lives

things&#10;2:03&#10;around inv inv invest invest invest in&#10;2:07&#10;all possible areas in the areas where&#10;2:10&#10;there hasn't been investment in the last&#10;2:12&#10;15 years and that's everything from&#10;2:15&#10;infrastructure to education to internet&#10;2:19&#10;new ideas new technologies&#10;2:25&#10;everything what I can't stand hearing&#10;2:27&#10;anymore what I would tell a politician&#10;2:29&#10;is is about cutting red tape it's always&#10;2:32&#10;talked about always brought up as a&#10;2:34&#10;necessary step and nothing&#10;2:39&#10;happens the mood before the elections in&#10;2:42&#10;Germany is gloomy whether in the west or&#10;2:44&#10;the East among young or old in poor or&#10;2:48&#10;Rich regions there's broad&#10;2:50&#10;dissatisfaction with the political&#10;2:52&#10;system because people are worried about&#10;2:54&#10;the&#10;2:56&#10;future Arthur Sullivan from DW&#10;Arthur Sullivan, DW Business&#10;2:59&#10;businesses here to talk about what&#10;3:02&#10;exactly people are worrying about good&#10;3:04&#10;to see you Arthur so let's start with&#10;3:06&#10;the main economic challenges facing&#10;3:09&#10;Germany today tell us what they are well&#10;3:11&#10;in simplest terms Anya the biggest&#10;3:12&#10;problem is that Germany has no growth so&#10;3:14&#10;for the last two years the country has&#10;3:16&#10;not only not had any growth it has had&#10;3:17&#10;two years of a contraction so the&#10;3:19&#10;economy has actually shrunk in that time&#10;3:21&#10;so when you don't have any growth you&#10;3:22&#10;therefore then don't have any confidence&#10;3:24&#10;now the main reason why there has been&#10;3:25&#10;no growth is primarily driven by a&#10;3:27&#10;collapse in the country's manufacturing&#10;3:29&#10;base so you're talking about Industries&#10;3:31&#10;like car making machine building these&#10;3:33&#10;sectors chemicals which Germany has&#10;3:35&#10;really been a world leader in for much&#10;3:36&#10;of its post-war history but which are&#10;3:38&#10;are collapsing before its eyes shedding&#10;3:40&#10;hundreds of thousands of jobs over the&#10;3:42&#10;last five six years and the country sort&#10;3:44&#10;of flailing as a result of that now&#10;3:45&#10;there's lots of reasons why those&#10;3:46&#10;sectors are flagging but more than&#10;3:48&#10;anything else that big collapse in those&#10;3:50&#10;key sectors is what is undermining&#10;3:52&#10;German growth in fact leading to that&#10;3:54&#10;contraction and fundamentally leading to&#10;3:56&#10;this crisis of confidence at the heart&#10;3:57&#10;of the German economy right it has quite&#10;3:59&#10;heav psychological impact as well&#10;4:01&#10;doesn't it I mean let's look&#10;4:02&#10;specifically more specifically at&#10;4:04&#10;companies and medium-sized businesses so&#10;4:07&#10;what are the main problems there so a&#10;4:10&#10;lot of these companies and and as you&#10;4:12&#10;said medium-sized businesses the Mand as&#10;4:13&#10;it's known in Germany Germany developed&#10;4:15&#10;a reputation over the decades as a world&#10;4:17&#10;leader in manufacturing and then as an&#10;4:19&#10;export power making world-class goods&#10;4:21&#10;from Cars to the smallest type of&#10;4:23&#10;components for different machines and&#10;4:24&#10;various other types of products now what&#10;4:27&#10;has what has really fundamentally&#10;4:28&#10;happened is that since the war in&#10;4:29&#10;Ukraine there's been this huge energy&#10;4:32&#10;crisis in Europe and particularly in&#10;4:33&#10;Germany where because these companies&#10;4:36&#10;which are very energy intensive and&#10;4:38&#10;often reliant on on cheaper gas gas&#10;4:41&#10;prices have become so much more&#10;4:42&#10;expensive and as well a lot of these&#10;4:44&#10;companies have to pay a levy to to the&#10;4:46&#10;German government to you know for&#10;4:47&#10;emergency gas storage so they're just&#10;4:49&#10;crippled with huge gas prices that's not&#10;4:51&#10;necessarily the only issue I mean the&#10;4:53&#10;car industry for example has faced&#10;4:54&#10;competition from China from the electric&#10;4:56&#10;vehicle Market but fundamentally these&#10;4:59&#10;these big issues Energy prices another&#10;5:01&#10;one of course is the high cost of Labor&#10;5:02&#10;in Germany they've eaten away at the uh&#10;5:06&#10;the the profits obviously from the lack&#10;5:08&#10;of market share but then these extra&#10;5:10&#10;costs have further crippled them and&#10;5:12&#10;then as a result we're we're seeing all&#10;5:13&#10;these job losses in the sector now of&#10;5:15&#10;course we know that there's an election&#10;5:17&#10;coming up on Sunday there's been lots of&#10;5:19&#10;campaign pledges to spend to invest more&#10;5:23&#10;but there's a major hurdle in the way of&#10;5:24&#10;that isn't there here in Germany there&#10;5:26&#10;is it's something that some of our&#10;5:27&#10;viewers I'm sure will have heard about&#10;5:28&#10;they may not necessarily know the&#10;5:29&#10;details but it's called The Debt break&#10;5:31&#10;so in 2009 quite a while ago now Angela&#10;5:33&#10;Merkel the then Chancellor brought in a&#10;5:35&#10;specific rule which really limited the&#10;5:37&#10;amount of money that Germany can borrow&#10;5:39&#10;so to very quickly sum it up Germany can&#10;5:41&#10;only borrow a tiny fraction of its GDP&#10;5:44&#10;.35% over its GDP which in the in the&#10;5:47&#10;context of Germany is really only a few&#10;5:49&#10;billion which is a lot of money but not&#10;5:50&#10;much for one of the world's biggest&#10;5:51&#10;economies which means that Germany wants&#10;5:53&#10;to fund itself exclusively through the&#10;5:55&#10;money it takes in and not necessarily&#10;5:57&#10;through any extra borrowing now when you&#10;5:59&#10;have a country country that has a lot of&#10;6:00&#10;economic problems like infrastructure&#10;6:02&#10;for example needs major investment it&#10;6:03&#10;needs much more investment to become&#10;6:05&#10;more digitally Innovative also in areas&#10;6:07&#10;like artificial intelligence a whole&#10;6:09&#10;range of areas where the country needs&#10;6:11&#10;to spend money it's difficult to do that&#10;6:13&#10;when your econom is not growing and you&#10;6:14&#10;won't borrow anything else and the thing&#10;6:16&#10;is the political parties any you they&#10;6:18&#10;disagree over this debt break some of&#10;6:20&#10;them say we need to get rid of it we&#10;6:21&#10;need to borrow more others the more&#10;6:23&#10;fiscally conservative ones like the CDU&#10;6:25&#10;the center right the fdp the who are&#10;6:27&#10;where were in the previous government&#10;6:29&#10;and in fact that previous government&#10;6:30&#10;fell over this very issue they're&#10;6:32&#10;they're much Keener to keep it and have&#10;6:34&#10;that more conservative approach whereby&#10;6:36&#10;you don't take on extra borrowing just&#10;6:38&#10;briefly Arthur looking ahead to the&#10;6:40&#10;election I mean what kind of impact do&#10;6:42&#10;you think the election really can have&#10;6:45&#10;on the economy I mean do you think a new&#10;6:47&#10;government will be able to turn things&#10;6:49&#10;around well I think it's important to&#10;6:51&#10;always be optimistic about the economy&#10;6:52&#10;because you can definitely talk yourself&#10;6:54&#10;and think yourself into a worse&#10;6:55&#10;situation optimism and confidence are&#10;6:57&#10;fundamental factors in driving a&#10;6:59&#10;business economy forward but Anya the&#10;7:00&#10;key thing is here no party we don't know&#10;7:02&#10;the results yet but no party is likely&#10;7:04&#10;to have a majority there's going to be a&#10;7:05&#10;coalition possibly involving as many as&#10;7:07&#10;three parties so it could be that center&#10;7:09&#10;right party the center left the SPD and&#10;7:11&#10;possibly a third party like the greens&#10;7:13&#10;who knows they all have different&#10;7:14&#10;approaches to these issues there's going&#10;7:15&#10;to be horse trading I think the really&#10;7:17&#10;interesting thing will be to see the&#10;7:18&#10;program for government whatever program&#10;7:19&#10;for government emerges from the election&#10;7:21&#10;and see what kind of things they can&#10;7:22&#10;agree on and what is their common&#10;7:24&#10;approach to dealing with Germany's&#10;7:26&#10;multitude of economic problems we'll&#10;7:28&#10;know much more off to Sunday DW uh&#10;7:30&#10;business Arthur Sullivan thank you so&#10;7:32&#10;much&#10;7:34&#10;Arthur let's look at this with Marcel&#10;Marcel Fratzscher, German Institute for Economic Research (DIW)&#10;7:36&#10;frater who is president of the German&#10;7:38&#10;Institute for economic research he's&#10;7:40&#10;also a professor at humal University&#10;7:42&#10;Berlin welcome to&#10;7:45&#10;DW everywhere you look certainly in the&#10;7:47&#10;west they're talking about a cost of&#10;7:49&#10;living&#10;7:51&#10;crisis Germany obviously suffering uh&#10;7:53&#10;the the same at the moment are there&#10;7:56&#10;particular reasons why Germany is being&#10;7:59&#10;hit particularly&#10;8:02&#10;hard the reason why the German economy&#10;8:05&#10;is doing worse is for two reasons first&#10;8:08&#10;uh its openness to trade uh and its&#10;8:11&#10;former dependence on energy Imports um&#10;8:14&#10;exports are suffering uh and second&#10;8:16&#10;industry is doing very poorly and we we&#10;8:18&#10;just saw it in the reports uh industrial&#10;8:21&#10;companies are having a very hard time uh&#10;8:24&#10;the industrial sector is shrinking since&#10;8:27&#10;2018 so this is nothing new so this has&#10;8:30&#10;happened over the last 5 years and it's&#10;8:31&#10;getting worse um but at the same time&#10;8:34&#10;one also has to be very honest and say&#10;8:36&#10;well many services sectors uh people are&#10;8:38&#10;doing well um and my assessment is the&#10;8:41&#10;mood is a lot worse than the reality we&#10;8:44&#10;have record employment we never had more&#10;8:46&#10;people in jobs than today uh we have&#10;8:49&#10;rather rather a shortage of skilled&#10;8:50&#10;workers in particular Engineers uh the&#10;8:53&#10;fear is not so much about the present&#10;8:55&#10;about the business cycle about the&#10;8:56&#10;recession it's really about the future&#10;8:58&#10;and that concern that fear is Justified&#10;9:00&#10;and what do you see from the offerings&#10;9:03&#10;from the the various political parties&#10;9:05&#10;ahead of uh Sunday's election what do&#10;9:07&#10;you see from them that would change this&#10;9:09&#10;for the&#10;9:12&#10;better uh to be quite Frank I see very&#10;9:15&#10;little um by all parties uh this has&#10;9:17&#10;been election debate which basically has&#10;9:20&#10;been a struggle or a fight for&#10;9:22&#10;redistribution the party's right of&#10;9:24&#10;Center are promising huge tax cuts of&#10;9:28&#10;partly three % 4% of GDP uh including uh&#10;9:32&#10;the conservative party which is the&#10;9:34&#10;front runner at the moment knowing full&#10;9:36&#10;well uh that this will not be&#10;9:38&#10;implemented and most of that tax cut to&#10;9:41&#10;the rich the parties left of the center&#10;9:44&#10;are promising increases and pension and&#10;9:46&#10;public pensions so redistribution from&#10;9:48&#10;young to old uh so the Young Generation&#10;9:51&#10;is really the victim of this campaign&#10;9:54&#10;because the promises are we don't have&#10;9:56&#10;to change in Germany it has worked well&#10;9:58&#10;in the past we want to go back to the&#10;10:00&#10;past we don't want to go to the Future&#10;10:02&#10;and that's why I'm not very optimistic&#10;10:04&#10;about a new government really having&#10;10:06&#10;understood that reforms have no&#10;10:08&#10;alternative and they need to be&#10;10:10&#10;courageous and really changing a lot&#10;10:11&#10;within the German economy and Society so&#10;10:14&#10;what if not that if not doing what we&#10;10:18&#10;did before but better if not that then&#10;10:21&#10;what are you calling for what would uh&#10;10:24&#10;uh improve Germany's economic prospects&#10;10:29&#10;I'm convinced there are three things the&#10;10:31&#10;new government needs to do first it&#10;10:32&#10;needs to reestablish confidence um&#10;10:35&#10;especially the economy is a lot about&#10;10:36&#10;trust and that trust is not present so&#10;10:39&#10;companies are not investing consumers&#10;10:40&#10;are not consuming and I'm optimistic on&#10;10:43&#10;that that a new government will be less&#10;10:45&#10;there will be less infighting they will&#10;10:47&#10;have a clearer idea the second major&#10;10:50&#10;investment initiative and also that we&#10;10:51&#10;heard just in the reports uh Germany has&#10;10:54&#10;a pretty bad public infrastructure is&#10;10:57&#10;investing far too little in energy&#10;10:58&#10;infrastructure digital infrastructure&#10;11:00&#10;and education um and the big hurdle is a&#10;11:03&#10;debt break so we Germans love the debt&#10;11:05&#10;break we hate debt um and that's&#10;11:08&#10;probably the biggest dilemma a new&#10;11:10&#10;government needs to solve it needs to&#10;11:12&#10;spend more uh it needs to invest more&#10;11:14&#10;that inevitably will mean more debt and&#10;11:17&#10;the third Big Challenge is Europe&#10;11:19&#10;Germany needs to take more&#10;11:20&#10;responsibility in Europe uh we see this&#10;11:22&#10;with the conflict in the Ukraine we see&#10;11:24&#10;it now with the recent developments um&#10;11:28&#10;um through the US government through&#10;11:31&#10;Donald Trump so without a strong United&#10;11:33&#10;Europe uh particular Germany will pay a&#10;11:36&#10;very high price for this crisis we just&#10;11:38&#10;pick out one of the points you you you&#10;11:39&#10;rais there in in your plan for for the&#10;11:43&#10;the country investment in in&#10;11:45&#10;infrastructure this has been a call for&#10;11:48&#10;the last 10 years at least why is it&#10;11:50&#10;that successive German governments have&#10;11:53&#10;been so shy of putting money into the&#10;11:56&#10;country's infrastructure&#10;12:01&#10;there are two reasons for that first&#10;12:02&#10;it's a federalist structure of the econ&#10;12:06&#10;of of the country uh we have very strong&#10;12:08&#10;checks and balances half of all public&#10;12:11&#10;investment is conducted at the municipal&#10;12:13&#10;level and we have 30% of the&#10;12:14&#10;municipalities that are over indebted&#10;12:16&#10;they cannot invest more um so we need a&#10;12:19&#10;fundamental reform uh helping them to&#10;12:22&#10;invest more um that's one of the reasons&#10;12:24&#10;the second one is look Germany had a&#10;12:26&#10;golden decade of the 2010s the economy&#10;12:28&#10;was hugely successful and when we when&#10;12:30&#10;my Institute 10 years ago actually 12&#10;12:32&#10;years ago was in 2013 said we need more&#10;12:34&#10;public investment people attacked us and&#10;12:36&#10;said that's rubbish the Germany economy&#10;12:38&#10;is doing so great uh so why should we&#10;12:41&#10;change anything and that understanding&#10;12:44&#10;we need to change we need to accept more&#10;12:47&#10;debt in return to more investment and&#10;12:49&#10;more productivity and competitiveness&#10;12:52&#10;that conviction broad conviction in&#10;12:54&#10;public has not sunk in yet and that's my&#10;12:56&#10;concern over the next four years thanks&#10;12:59&#10;for leading us through that Mel frater&#10;13:01&#10;from the German Institute for economic&#10;13:03&#10;research thank you so&#10;13:06&#10;much my pleasure" />

          <attvalue for="0" value="phoenix persönlich: Militärhistoriker Sönke Neitzel zu Gast bei Eva Lindenau | 14.02.25" />
          <attvalue for="1" value="In der Sendung „phoenix persönlich“ spricht Eva Lindenau mit Sönke Neitzel, Professor für Militärgeschichte an der Uni Potsdam, über den Bruch Donald Trumps mit der bisherigen Ukraine-Politik, die Rolle der Europäer, Defizite in der Sicherheitspolitik und über die Reform der Bundeswehr.&#10;&#10;Der Militärhistoriker Sönke Neitzel ist nicht wirklich überrascht von Donald Trumps Bruch mit der bisherigen amerikanischen Ukraine-Politik, aber es sei in einer „schonungslosen Wahrhaftigkeit“ ausgesprochen worden: Eigentlich sei allen klar gewesen, dass es ein Mehr an militärischem Engagement der Amerikaner nicht geben würde und dass bei einem geringeren Engagement die Europäer mehr machen müssten, so Neitzel. Neitzel erinnert daran, „dass seit 2014, seit über 10 Jahren, reden wir darüber, Europa muss mehr machen, der strategische Fokus der USA wird auf dem Pazifik liegen und es wurde geredet, geredet und geredet. Und die Europäer dachten immer, naja, so schlimm wird es schon nicht kommen.“ Trump wisse, dass ohne die militärische Unterstützung der USA, auch konventionell in Europa relativ wenig passiere. „Die Europäer sind abhängig von den USA“. Und an dieser Abhängigkeit hätten sie in den vergangenen Jahren praktisch nichts verändert.&#10;&#10;Die Bedrohungslage sei heute akuter als zu Zeiten des Kalten Krieges, erklärt Neitzel, denn „wir sind in einem hybriden Krieg mit Russland“. Zu Zeiten des Kalten Krieges habe weder die Sowjetunion noch die NATO den Status quo in Europa verändern wollen. „Das ist jetzt anders. Wir müssen davon ausgehen, dass Putin den Status quo verändern wird.“ Er werde uns testen, in dem er weiter versuche, die Gesellschaften „hybrid zu schwächen“, das sehe man gerade in Frankreich, in Deutschland, in anderen Ländern. Und dass er auch „mit militärischen Mitteln“ versuche, einen Schritt zu machen, in ein baltisches Land einmarschiere oder Spitzbergen besetze. „Also, einen Schritt zu machen, auf den man eigentlich militärisch reagieren müsste.“ Wenn die NATO dann nicht entschlossen reagiere, „ist es eigentlich das Ende der NATO“.&#10;&#10;Neitzel geht davon aus, dass Trump als „Dealmaker“ versuchen werde, einen Deal mit Putin auszuhandeln. Die Wahrscheinlichkeit sei groß, dass weder die Ukraine noch die Europäer wesentlich daran beteiligt würden. „Nur mit militärischem Gewicht habe ich einen Einfluss in Diplomatie. Und das sehen wir jetzt. Das Gewicht der Europäer ist militärisch eigentlich zu schwach, als dass Trump gezwungen wäre, die Europäer mit an den Tisch zu lassen.“&#10;&#10;Mit Blick auf die Bundeswehr mahnt Neitzel mehr Investitionen und weitreichende Reformen an. Er schätze Boris Pistorius sehr, betont Neitzel. Pistorius habe ja auch „die Strukturen so ein bisschen reformiert“, das gehe ihm jedoch nicht weit genug. „Ich würde mir da jemand wünschen, der mehr umsetzt, und ich würde mir vor allen Dingen, wenn es einen neuen Verteidigungsminister oder Ministerin gibt, jemanden wünschen, der sich nicht einarbeiten muss. Denn, wir haben keine Zeit.“ Wichtig sei ebenso, dass die Bundeswehr ihren Personalbedarf decken könne, „dass wir irgendwie eine Form der Wehrpflicht bekommen. Und da fand ich es einfach skandalös, dass der Bundeskanzler gesagt hat, die Bundeswehr hat kein Personalproblem.“" />

          <attvalue for="4" value="0:01&#10;[Musik]&#10;0:06&#10;es bleibt zu hoffen dass deutsche&#10;0:08&#10;Soldaten nie in einem&#10;0:09&#10;zwischenstaatlichen Krieg werden kämpfen&#10;0:11&#10;müssen falls dieser Fall doch eintrete&#10;0:14&#10;so schreibt unser Gast in seinem neuen&#10;0:16&#10;Buch werden die Soldaten ihre Pflicht&#10;0:18&#10;erfüllen aber sie würden die&#10;0:20&#10;Versäumnisse von Politik und Generalität&#10;0:22&#10;mit ihrem Leben bezahlen sprechen wir&#10;0:24&#10;darüber und darüber wie Europa auf&#10;0:27&#10;Trumps Telefonat mit Putin reagieren&#10;0:29&#10;soll mit dem Militärhistoriker ske&#10;0:32&#10;neizel herzlich willkommen hallo Herr&#10;0:34&#10;neizel sie analysieren die&#10;0:36&#10;Bedrohungslage und den Zustand der&#10;0:38&#10;Bundeswehr mit dem Blick in die Zukunft&#10;0:40&#10;und dem Blick in die Vergangenheit hilft&#10;0:42&#10;Ihnen dieser Rundumblick zuversichtlich&#10;0:45&#10;zu sein oder sind Sie eher beunruhigt&#10;0:47&#10;also erstmal hilft weil alles was wir&#10;0:50&#10;jetzt erleben die Diskussion um Reform&#10;0:53&#10;um Europa um die&#10;0:55&#10;Ukraine das ganze kommt im Historik&#10;0:58&#10;nicht neu vor und wir haben viele&#10;0:59&#10;Sicherheits Probleme gehabt im 20&#10;1:01&#10;Jahrhundert im 19 Jahrhundert und da&#10;1:03&#10;kann man schon so ein bisschen lernen&#10;1:04&#10;auch welche Erwartung man z.B an&#10;1:06&#10;Reformen ähm ähm stellen kann dass&#10;1:09&#10;Reformen Prozesse sind dass sie lange&#10;1:11&#10;dauern dass es Bürokratie gibt also das&#10;1:13&#10;sind alles keine Dinge die ein&#10;1:15&#10;überraschen gleich wohl ist so die Frage&#10;1:17&#10;die mich wirklich umtreibt ähm wie&#10;1:20&#10;reformfähig sind wir ähm und da kann ich&#10;1:23&#10;nur als Historiker sagen na ja also es&#10;1:25&#10;gab Staaten die reformfähig waren die&#10;1:27&#10;sind den Herausforderung ihrer Zeit weit&#10;1:30&#10;gerecht geworden es gabt andere die&#10;1:31&#10;waren das nicht und die sind vielleicht&#10;1:33&#10;verschwunden die haben große Niederlagen&#10;1:35&#10;erlebt Revolutionen und wir leben ja in&#10;1:38&#10;einer Zeit wo wir glauben alles ist so&#10;1:39&#10;immer und ewig die EU unser politisches&#10;1:42&#10;System die Republik die Sicherheit die&#10;1:45&#10;wir haben den Frieden den wir haben und&#10;1:47&#10;da muss man als hisorcker sagen na nein&#10;1:49&#10;also wir muss das schon dafür auch&#10;1:51&#10;eintreten eine whrhafte Demokratie sein&#10;1:53&#10;und das kann auch in einigen Jahren ganz&#10;1:55&#10;anders aussehen also es ist so ein so&#10;1:57&#10;ein gemischtes Bild es gibt&#10;2:00&#10;Hoffnung dass man reformieren kann dass&#10;2:03&#10;man nach vorne gehen kann es gibt aber&#10;2:05&#10;auch bei mir viel Pessimismus dass ich&#10;2:07&#10;mir denke na ja vielleicht wir sind wir&#10;2:10&#10;Europäer so wie wir sind und deswegen&#10;2:11&#10;kommen wir nicht nicht zu Potte und&#10;2:13&#10;Kriegen unsere PS nicht auf den Boden&#10;2:15&#10;das nicht alles so ist wie es bleiben&#10;2:17&#10;muss zeigt Donald Trump diese Woche der&#10;2:19&#10;ja tatsächlich in einem Telefonat mit&#10;2:23&#10;Putin erklärt hat es soll jetzt&#10;2:24&#10;friedensverhandlung geben und Europa&#10;2:26&#10;müsse sich künftig allein um die&#10;2:28&#10;Sicherheit&#10;2:30&#10;der Ukraine kümmern ein zurück zu den&#10;2:31&#10;Grenzen von vor 2014 sei unrealistisch&#10;2:35&#10;ebenso wie ein natobeitritt was war ihr&#10;2:37&#10;erster Gedanke angesichts dieses Bruchs&#10;2:41&#10;von Trump mit der bisherigen&#10;2:42&#10;ukrainepolitik also genau das war meines&#10;2:45&#10;Achtens zu erwarten also wir haben ja&#10;2:46&#10;lange&#10;2:48&#10;gemutmaß was würde Trump jetzt tun es&#10;2:50&#10;sind Dinge durchgesickert undich allen&#10;2:53&#10;war klar also ein Mehr an amerikanischen&#10;2:55&#10;Engagement militärisch wird's doch wohl&#10;2:57&#10;nicht geben ein weniger die europä&#10;3:00&#10;müssen mehr machen und ein eine Ukraine&#10;3:02&#10;in der NATO war unter Trump überhaupt&#10;3:04&#10;nicht zu erwarten war ja schon vorher&#10;3:06&#10;unrealistisch meine Trump drückt das und&#10;3:08&#10;auch sein Verteidigungsminister jetzt&#10;3:11&#10;sein Vizepräsident die drücken das&#10;3:12&#10;natürlich in einer wie soll ich&#10;3:14&#10;diplomatisch mich ausdrücken an einer&#10;3:16&#10;schonungslosen Wahrhaftigkeit aus aber&#10;3:18&#10;die&#10;3:19&#10;Grundrichtung ist uns allen irgendwie&#10;3:21&#10;klar und ich erinnere da dran dass seit&#10;3:24&#10;2014 seit über 10&#10;3:26&#10;Jahren reden wir da drüber Europa mehr&#10;3:30&#10;machen der strategische Fokus der USA&#10;3:33&#10;wird auf dem Pazifik liegen und es wurde&#10;3:36&#10;geredet geredet und geredet und die&#10;3:39&#10;Europäer dachten immer na ja so stimmt&#10;3:41&#10;wird schon nicht kommen und natürlich&#10;3:42&#10;haben sich die Europäer so ein bisschen&#10;3:43&#10;bewegt aber nicht wirklich und&#10;3:45&#10;daher ist das jetzt alles so ein&#10;3:47&#10;bisschen eine Schocktherapie auch in&#10;3:50&#10;dieser klaren Ansage Trump telefoniert&#10;3:53&#10;jetzt mit Putin kommen wir noch drauf&#10;3:55&#10;mal sehen was da rauskommt aber wenn wir&#10;3:57&#10;uns nur für eine Sekunde vorstellen es&#10;4:00&#10;würde jetzt irgendwie einen&#10;4:00&#10;Waffenstillstand geben und Russland&#10;4:03&#10;rüstet ja weiter auf dann sind wir&#10;4:04&#10;natürlich geostrategisch in der anderen&#10;4:05&#10;Lage kommen wir gleich zu also von daher&#10;4:08&#10;ist das wirklich verwunderlich war es&#10;4:09&#10;nicht für mich nicht verwunderlich aber&#10;4:11&#10;dennoch hat er mit selenski ja erst im&#10;4:13&#10;Anschluss telefoniert wie groß schätzen&#10;4:16&#10;die Gefahr ein dass diese Verhandlung&#10;4:19&#10;mit Putin jetzt ohne die Ukraine&#10;4:22&#10;Beteiligten also direkt zu beteiligen&#10;4:24&#10;stattfinden also ich glaube dass die&#10;4:26&#10;Wahrscheinlichkeit groß ist ich glaube&#10;4:28&#10;dass die weder die Europäer noch die die&#10;4:29&#10;Ukrainer da da&#10;4:32&#10;wesentlich dran beteiligt sind ich&#10;4:33&#10;glaube dass dass Trump als dealmaker mit&#10;4:36&#10;Putin versuchen wird einen ein Deal&#10;4:38&#10;auszuhandeln die große Frage ist kommt&#10;4:41&#10;da wirklich was bei raus ist das im&#10;4:42&#10;Interesse von Putin ich glaube nämlich&#10;4:44&#10;nicht ich glaube nicht dass Putin jetzt&#10;4:47&#10;für ein ein Waffenstillstand eigentlich&#10;4:48&#10;will weil die Ukraine mit dem Rücken zu&#10;4:51&#10;Wand steht und ist der Ukraine mehr&#10;4:54&#10;helfen würde als Russland aber nehmen&#10;4:56&#10;wir nur mal an es würde ein Deal&#10;4:57&#10;rauskommen glaube ich nicht dass die&#10;4:58&#10;Europäer da wesentlich mitsprechen und&#10;5:01&#10;ich glaube auch die Ukraine nicht und&#10;5:03&#10;weil weil Trump kann natürlich die&#10;5:05&#10;Ukraine zwingen sagen also&#10;5:07&#10;es ist klar es sind die größten&#10;5:09&#10;Geldgeber es sind die größten ohne die&#10;5:10&#10;militärische Unterstützung der USA läuft&#10;5:12&#10;überhaupt nichts in der Ukraine das ist&#10;5:14&#10;völlig klar und ähm anderserseits ist&#10;5:18&#10;die USA das machten sie auch klar dran&#10;5:20&#10;interessiert dass es eine unabhängige&#10;5:22&#10;Ukraine gibt also es wird jetzt auch&#10;5:24&#10;nicht so sein dass Putin mit seinen&#10;5:25&#10;maximalzielen sich durchsetzt äh und wir&#10;5:28&#10;sehen jetzt bei den Verhandlungen das&#10;5:30&#10;Gewicht in der Diplomatie wir haben in&#10;5:33&#10;zig runden auch hier bei ihrem Sender&#10;5:36&#10;immer wieder wurde gefordert mehr&#10;5:37&#10;Diplomatie mein Argument W man ja aber&#10;5:40&#10;es hängt davon ab wie viel militärisches&#10;5:42&#10;Gewicht ich reinbringe den nur mit&#10;5:44&#10;militärischem Gewicht habe ich einen&#10;5:45&#10;Einfluss und Diplomatie und das sehen&#10;5:46&#10;wir jetzt das Gewicht der Europäer ist&#10;5:48&#10;militärisch eigentlich zu schwach als&#10;5:51&#10;dass Trump gezwungen wäre die Europäer&#10;5:53&#10;mit an den Tisch zu lassen aber&#10;5:55&#10;nichtsdestotrotz eigentlich müsste es&#10;5:56&#10;doch eine Selbstverständlichkeit sein&#10;5:58&#10;die Europäer mit in die Gespräche zu&#10;6:00&#10;integrieren wenn die Aussage ist dass&#10;6:02&#10;alle Sicherheiten im Anschluss&#10;6:05&#10;eigentlich von den Europäern alleine&#10;6:06&#10;geleistet werden müssen ja&#10;6:08&#10;offensichtlich nicht also offensichtlich&#10;6:11&#10;ist es so dass die USA sagen können wir&#10;6:13&#10;machen ein Ergebnis und das werden die&#10;6:15&#10;Europäer akzeptieren müssen weil was&#10;6:17&#10;bleibt ihn anderes übrig und ähnliche&#10;6:20&#10;Situation hatten wir auch schon da kann&#10;6:22&#10;der Historiker helfen etwa im Kosovo&#10;6:25&#10;denken wir 25 Jahre zurück 1999 da waren&#10;6:29&#10;die Europäer sehr stark bemüht eine&#10;6:31&#10;Lösung zu finden im Kosovo mit den&#10;6:32&#10;Russen das klappte dann irgendwie nicht&#10;6:35&#10;und dann haben die Amerikaner gesagt&#10;6:37&#10;auch mit der UNO und dann haben die&#10;6:38&#10;Amerikaner gesagt also entweder lösen&#10;6:41&#10;wir jetzt das Problem und zwar ohne die&#10;6:42&#10;UNO weil die Russen blockieren oder ihr&#10;6:45&#10;Europäer macht's alleine und darauf&#10;6:48&#10;haben die Europäer um Gottes Willen&#10;6:49&#10;alleine können wir es ja gar nicht und&#10;6:50&#10;die Amerikaner sind dann sehr stark&#10;6:52&#10;vorangegangen und haben dann auch diesen&#10;6:53&#10;Luftkrieg geführt&#10;6:55&#10;gegen Serbien 1999 der ja sehr stark an&#10;6:58&#10;amerikanische ation war also die&#10;7:00&#10;Amerikaner haben sehr oft wenn es um um&#10;7:03&#10;Einsätze ging dann den Europäern klar&#10;7:06&#10;gemacht wie wenig Gewicht sie eigentlich&#10;7:07&#10;haben und die Europäer waren auch nicht&#10;7:09&#10;willens dann wirklich nach vorne zu&#10;7:11&#10;gehen und das spiegelt sich jetzt im&#10;7:13&#10;einer etwas undiplomatischen Art und&#10;7:16&#10;Weise damals wurde das 1999 nicht publik&#10;7:18&#10;jetzt wird es publik jetzt wird es&#10;7:20&#10;offensichtlich aber wir wir wir können&#10;7:22&#10;mitverfolgen als Zeitzeugen welches&#10;7:25&#10;Gewicht sicherheitspolitisch militärisch&#10;7:28&#10;hat Europa eigentlich und das kann einen&#10;7:30&#10;nicht verwundern die Europäer reden&#10;7:32&#10;reden reden ähm und ähm äh sind eben&#10;7:35&#10;viel zu langsam gewesen in dem was sie&#10;7:37&#10;tun und das das zahlt sich jetzt negativ&#10;7:40&#10;aus dass eben ihr ihr Einfluss in&#10;7:42&#10;Diplomatie begrenzt ist und sie&#10;7:44&#10;wahrscheinlich das akzeptieren müssen&#10;7:45&#10;wenn es ein Deal gibt den Trump mit&#10;7:47&#10;Putin aushandelt oder sollten die&#10;7:49&#10;Europäer aus ihrer Sicht auch jetzt&#10;7:51&#10;schon einen eigenen Deal mit versuchen&#10;7:54&#10;mit Trump auf den Weg zu bringen oder&#10;7:56&#10;ist das nicht die richtige Entscheidung&#10;7:57&#10;also man kann ich davon dass natürlich&#10;8:00&#10;die die europäischen Staats und&#10;8:01&#10;Regierungschefs auch versuchen mit der&#10;8:03&#10;Trump Administration Gespräche zu führen&#10;8:06&#10;das wird laufen ich meine der deutsche&#10;8:08&#10;Botschafter in Washington wird ja nicht&#10;8:09&#10;untätig sein aber auch die die&#10;8:11&#10;Außenministerin und so weiter die Frage&#10;8:13&#10;ist&#10;8:15&#10;ähm also sprechen die Europäer mit einer&#10;8:18&#10;Stimme das ist schon das Problem was hat&#10;8:20&#10;können die Europäer anbieten&#10;8:22&#10;und können Sie Trump wirklich&#10;8:25&#10;Zugeständnisse abbringen und das hängt&#10;8:27&#10;wieder immer sehr stark von dem&#10;8:28&#10;Engagement ab und&#10;8:30&#10;das Problem ist dass Trump weiß ohne die&#10;8:33&#10;militärische Unterstützung der USA&#10;8:36&#10;passiert auch konventionell in Europa&#10;8:37&#10;relativ wenig die Europäer sind abhängig&#10;8:39&#10;von den USA und sie haben an dieser&#10;8:41&#10;Abhängigkeit in den letzten 10 Jahren&#10;8:43&#10;praktisch nichts verändert also er ist&#10;8:45&#10;in einer Pool Position er kann die&#10;8:46&#10;Europäer letztlich zwingen dass er dann&#10;8:49&#10;geheim wahrscheinlich Zugeständnisse&#10;8:50&#10;macht also wir haben natürlich den&#10;8:51&#10;nuklearschirm wir würden euch auch&#10;8:53&#10;helfen mit&#10;8:55&#10;bestimmten Waffen der Luftwaffe im&#10;8:58&#10;cyberraum und so weiter und das brauchen&#10;9:00&#10;die Europäer wenn sie alleine z.B&#10;9:02&#10;irgendwie an solchen Frieden sichern&#10;9:03&#10;müssen also ich glaube die die Position&#10;9:05&#10;der Europäer ist wirklich relativ&#10;9:07&#10;schwach gegen einen Präsidenten der so&#10;9:10&#10;stark amerikanische Interessen&#10;9:11&#10;durchsetzen will nichtdestotrotz muss ja&#10;9:13&#10;Donald Trump auch in seinem eigenen Land&#10;9:16&#10;irgendwie rechtfertigen dass die&#10;9:18&#10;bisherige Politik in Amerika ja eine&#10;9:20&#10;andere war sprich wenn es jetzt zu&#10;9:22&#10;Friedensverhandlungen kommen sollte mit&#10;9:24&#10;Putin irgendein Zugeständnis wird Donald&#10;9:26&#10;Trump ja Wladimir Putin abringen müssen&#10;9:29&#10;was ist das dann also es deutet sich&#10;9:31&#10;glaube ich schon an dass er jetzt nicht&#10;9:33&#10;sich völlig zurückzieht aus der Ukraine&#10;9:35&#10;wie aus Afghanistan&#10;9:37&#10;und eine eine ein zerschlagen des&#10;9:39&#10;ukrainischen Staates eine russische&#10;9:41&#10;marinettenregierung&#10;9:42&#10;das kann nicht im amerikanischen&#10;9:44&#10;Interesse sein aber letztlich ist die&#10;9:47&#10;Frage ob dieser Administration wie&#10;9:50&#10;wichtig ist die Ukrain dieser&#10;9:52&#10;Administration sagen sie sich letzt sich&#10;9:54&#10;nicht es ist letztlich ein europäisches&#10;9:57&#10;Problem ob jetzt da eine pro russische&#10;10:00&#10;oder eine proeuropäische Regierung ist&#10;10:02&#10;meine Güte für uns ist das wichtig für&#10;10:05&#10;viele in Amerika ist das wichtig aber&#10;10:07&#10;ist es wirklich für die Trump&#10;10:09&#10;Administration so wichtig&#10;10:12&#10;also ich ich glaube nicht wirklich es&#10;10:14&#10;ich glaube nicht dass das so das&#10;10:15&#10;Entscheidende ist aber nichtdestotrotz&#10;10:18&#10;wird auch Trump nicht die Ukraine&#10;10:20&#10;hoffentlich völlig alleine lassen und&#10;10:22&#10;das ist die große Frage wird es ein&#10;10:24&#10;Waffenstillstand geben bei der jetzigen&#10;10:27&#10;Frontlinie irgendwie eingefroren&#10;10:30&#10;wird das Putin akzeptieren und da ich&#10;10:32&#10;weiß es natürlich auch nicht aber ich&#10;10:34&#10;würde argumentieren nein denn Putin&#10;10:36&#10;glaube ich die Kalkulation ist er geht&#10;10:38&#10;jetzt in Verhandlungen er verhandelt und&#10;10:40&#10;führt diesen Krieg weiter er setzt die&#10;10:42&#10;Ukraine weiter unter Druck weiter&#10;10:44&#10;Verluste und setzt da drauf dass die&#10;10:46&#10;Ukraine diesen Krieg nicht mehr&#10;10:48&#10;unendlich weiterführen kann und dass er&#10;10:50&#10;den längeren Atem hat trotz seiner hohen&#10;10:53&#10;Verluste trotz der Probleme die hat&#10;10:54&#10;haben sie gedacht das ist jetzt der&#10;10:57&#10;Moment wo Putin den Krieg gewonnen haben&#10;11:01&#10;wird nein das habe ich nicht gedacht&#10;11:03&#10;denn ähm der Ausgang von Kriegen ist&#10;11:06&#10;eben hochkontingent hochzufällig es kann&#10;11:09&#10;alles Mögliche passieren und als&#10;11:12&#10;Zivilist ähm der zwar viele Leute kennt&#10;11:15&#10;in der Szene blicke ich natürlich auch&#10;11:16&#10;nicht wirklich tief rein das müssen wir&#10;11:18&#10;immer wieder sagen sage ich auch oft es&#10;11:20&#10;ist vor allen Dingen dass wir nichts&#10;11:21&#10;wissen also wie genau die Lage in&#10;11:23&#10;Russland ist wie genau die Lage vor&#10;11:25&#10;allen Dingen in der Ukraine ist weiß&#10;11:27&#10;auch ich nicht also ähm Frage ist weiß&#10;11:30&#10;das die Bundeswehr die wissen es besser&#10;11:32&#10;auf jeden Fall als ich aber wie lange&#10;11:35&#10;hält ein durches Land durch wie lange&#10;11:36&#10;hält Russland durch das sind Fragen die&#10;11:39&#10;aus meiner Sicht selbst die&#10;11:40&#10;Nachrichtendienste nicht wirklich&#10;11:41&#10;beantworten können und deswegen kann&#10;11:43&#10;alles Mögliche passieren also denken Sie&#10;11:45&#10;nur an die Rolle von China kommt&#10;11:47&#10;irgendwann XI und sagt jetzt ist Schluss&#10;11:49&#10;mit diesem Krieg weil mir wird die&#10;11:50&#10;wirtschaftliche Gefahr zu groß oder&#10;11:52&#10;nicht wer hätte gedacht dass die&#10;11:54&#10;Nordkoreaner auch mit eigenen Truppen&#10;11:56&#10;dort eingreifen also da kann viel&#10;11:58&#10;passieren und und bei Trump ist es ja&#10;12:00&#10;ist ist ja auch nicht vorauszusehen&#10;12:02&#10;denken wir an die Gespräche mit&#10;12:03&#10;Nordkorea also erst verteufelt er den&#10;12:06&#10;nordkoreanischen Diktator dann dann&#10;12:07&#10;trifft er sich mit ihm also und zum&#10;12:09&#10;Schluss kommt gar nichts raus also von&#10;12:11&#10;daher kann das ganze ausgehen diese&#10;12:12&#10;Gespräche Trump Putin auch wieder das&#10;12:14&#10;hornbergers Schießen es ist nach wie vor&#10;12:16&#10;offen dieser Krieg aber ich werde nicht&#10;12:18&#10;müde zu sagen nach wie vor ist es&#10;12:20&#10;möglich dass die Ukraine diesen Krieg&#10;12:22&#10;verliert und wir dräen dieses Problem ja&#10;12:25&#10;weg ne es ist ja die Auflösung von&#10;12:27&#10;kognitiven Dissonanzen darf irgendwie&#10;12:29&#10;nicht passieren und wir haben jetzt&#10;12:30&#10;andere Probleme wirtschaftliche Lage&#10;12:32&#10;Migration alles mögliche den Wahlkampf&#10;12:34&#10;und und und das Drängen wir weg und vor&#10;12:37&#10;allen die Kosten die jetzt eine Stärkung&#10;12:39&#10;unserer Sicherheitspolitik das will ja&#10;12:41&#10;irgendwie keiner beantworten in diesem&#10;12:43&#10;Wahlkampf also&#10;12:45&#10;wir schauen auf andere Dinge und wie das&#10;12:48&#10;wirklich ausgeht ist nach wie vor offen&#10;12:50&#10;in der Tat es gibt wenige Menschen die&#10;12:53&#10;das gerade so klar äußern der NATO&#10;12:54&#10;Generalsekretär rütte hat gesagt wir&#10;12:56&#10;müssen uns auf den Krieg vorbereiten sei&#10;12:59&#10;der beste Weg einen Krieg zu verhindern&#10;13:01&#10;wie vorbereitet sind wir denn in&#10;13:03&#10;Deutschland dre Jahre nach der&#10;13:05&#10;Zeitenwende das ist immer so die Frage&#10;13:08&#10;ist das Glas halb voll oder halb leer es&#10;13:10&#10;ist ja nicht so dass nichts passiert ist&#10;13:12&#10;natürlich haben wir seit dem 24 Februar&#10;13:14&#10;2022 in Europa in Deutschland auch ähm&#10;13:18&#10;Schritte nach vorne gemacht äh es gibt&#10;13:20&#10;die 100 Milliarden es gibt&#10;13:23&#10;Veränderung in der Struktur der&#10;13:24&#10;Bundeswehr es gibt jetzt ein operatives&#10;13:25&#10;Führungskommando die Deutschen wollen&#10;13:27&#10;diese Brigade nach Litauen legen und und&#10;13:29&#10;und esind drohen bestellt Flugabwehr ähm&#10;13:33&#10;die Frage ist immer so ein bisschen und&#10;13:35&#10;natürlich ist Boris bisturis und andere&#10;13:37&#10;sagen was ist alles passiert das ist&#10;13:39&#10;auch nachvollziehbar jetzt auch im&#10;13:40&#10;Wahlkampf wenn wir aber sagen der&#10;13:43&#10;Referenzpunkt ist nicht der Vorabend des&#10;13:45&#10;russischen Angriffs s der Referenzpunkt&#10;13:47&#10;ist könnten wir dann Litauen z.B&#10;13:50&#10;verteidigen dann müssen wir natürlich&#10;13:52&#10;mehr Wasser in den in den Wein&#10;13:55&#10;gießen natürlich haben wir Soldaten wir&#10;13:56&#10;haben auch eine Bundeswehr aber wir&#10;13:58&#10;haben der NATO versprochen 2025 also&#10;14:01&#10;jetzt eine kampfbereite heeresdivision&#10;14:04&#10;zu stellen so wir haben auch eine&#10;14:05&#10;Division zehte panzerdivision aber ist&#10;14:07&#10;die kampfbereit na ja kämpfen kann sie&#10;14:09&#10;schon aber hat sie drohen kaum hat sie&#10;14:11&#10;drohen Abwehr Luftabwehr auch schlecht&#10;14:14&#10;kann man so kämpfen nein so also da muss&#10;14:18&#10;man sagen es ist nicht so dass wir&#10;14:19&#10;völlig völlig bankrott oder blank sind&#10;14:22&#10;aber um das ganz deutlich zu sagen seit&#10;14:25&#10;Februar 22 hat sich die&#10;14:27&#10;Einsatzbereitschaft&#10;14:29&#10;vom herer luftf und Marine nicht&#10;14:31&#10;verbessert warum nicht weil alles&#10;14:33&#10;Material was kam in die Ukraine ging&#10;14:34&#10;nicht das war ja auch wichtig ist auch&#10;14:36&#10;richtig und weil wir letztlich&#10;14:39&#10;trotz allen Bemühens von Boris borus das&#10;14:41&#10;will ich gar nicht klein reden wir nicht&#10;14:43&#10;zu Porto kommen weil die Anforderung&#10;14:45&#10;eine kaputt gesparte Bundeswehr jetzt&#10;14:48&#10;wirklich kampfbereit zu machen in einem&#10;14:50&#10;begrenzten Ausmaß ja gar nicht mehr so&#10;14:52&#10;wie im Kalten Krieg wir sprechen von&#10;14:54&#10;drei Divisionen da haben wir zu wenig&#10;14:56&#10;Geld in die Hand genommen sind zu wenig&#10;14:58&#10;reformfreude gewesen und wir müssen uns&#10;15:00&#10;ja ausrichten an dem was der NATO&#10;15:02&#10;versprochen wurde und nicht da dran dass&#10;15:05&#10;jetzt die 100 Milliarden möglich schnell&#10;15:07&#10;ausgegeben werden und das war oft so wir&#10;15:09&#10;haben Rüstungsprojekte gemacht und deren&#10;15:11&#10;Ziel war möglichst schnell 2% zu&#10;15:14&#10;erreichen damit also die Außenministerin&#10;15:16&#10;sagen kann wir haben es erreicht es ging&#10;15:18&#10;aber nicht darum primär die natoziele zu&#10;15:21&#10;erreichen dann wäre das Schwerpunkt das&#10;15:24&#10;her gewesen das ist aber nicht der&#10;15:25&#10;Schwerpunkt also und diese inneren Logik&#10;15:29&#10;dass es eigentlich um außenpolitische&#10;15:30&#10;Fragen geht und nicht primär darum die&#10;15:33&#10;Bundeswehr verteidigungsbereit oder&#10;15:35&#10;kriegsfähig zu machen und wir müssen&#10;15:38&#10;endlich mal erkennen dass es um diese&#10;15:39&#10;Logik geht es geht eine militärische&#10;15:41&#10;Logik damit diese Bundeswehr bereit ist&#10;15:44&#10;und wir hoffen natürlich alle dass&#10;15:46&#10;dieser Punkt nie kommt und ich glaube&#10;15:47&#10;auch dass der ein Gedanke noch dass der&#10;15:50&#10;dass das Problem von unserer Politik ist&#10;15:52&#10;dass sie letztlich es gilt fürs ganze&#10;15:55&#10;Kabinett ein eine Politik der&#10;15:57&#10;Konfliktvermeidung gemacht also man will&#10;15:59&#10;nicht wirklich in die großen Konflikte&#10;16:01&#10;gehen das betrifft die&#10;16:02&#10;Strukturveränderung das betrifft die&#10;16:04&#10;Einführung der Wehrpflicht die&#10;16:05&#10;Veränderung in der Rüstung man will&#10;16:07&#10;keine großen politischen Konflikte wenn&#10;16:09&#10;ich das aber nicht tue kann ich nicht&#10;16:11&#10;wirklich reformieren also drehen wir an&#10;16:14&#10;relativ kleinen Schrauben und da ist der&#10;16:16&#10;Effekt e einfach begrenzt lassen Sie uns&#10;16:18&#10;gleich darüber sprechen wie sich das&#10;16:19&#10;möglicherweise nach der Wahl wird&#10;16:21&#10;verändern müssen noch mal die Nachfrage&#10;16:23&#10;zu dem natoziel es ist ja so dass klar&#10;16:26&#10;ist dass Deutschland mehr Geld wird&#10;16:28&#10;ausgeben müss für&#10;16:30&#10;Verteidigung unterschiedliche&#10;16:33&#10;Prozentangaben die noch im Raum stehen&#10;16:35&#10;zu den 5% kam schon von Pistorius eine&#10;16:39&#10;klare Absage das ist ja das was die USA&#10;16:42&#10;fordern wird es da aus ihrer Sicht nach&#10;16:45&#10;der Wahl auch ein böses Erwachen geben&#10;16:48&#10;für die Wähler aber auch für die neue&#10;16:50&#10;Regierung also der Wähler sollte ja&#10;16:52&#10;informiert sein und jedem muss klar sein&#10;16:55&#10;dass meines Erachtens die nächste&#10;16:58&#10;Regierung W die Stellen wird mehr Geld&#10;17:01&#10;für Verteidigung wird ausgeben müssen&#10;17:03&#10;ähm weil&#10;17:05&#10;allein durch die Anschaffung des&#10;17:06&#10;Sondervermögens also denken wir an die&#10;17:08&#10;F35 die müssen gewartet werden und so&#10;17:10&#10;weiter&#10;17:11&#10;da kommen viele Kosten auf uns zu die&#10;17:13&#10;mit dem jetzigen et nicht finanzierbar&#10;17:15&#10;sind und&#10;17:17&#10;also für mich ist eher die Frage wie&#10;17:20&#10;will man es finanzieren wie wird man&#10;17:22&#10;umschichten man wird sicherlich mehr&#10;17:24&#10;Schulden machen das ist für mich völlig&#10;17:25&#10;klar&#10;17:26&#10;wie das dann konkret gemacht wird wissen&#10;17:29&#10;wir nicht weiß auch nicht ob es die&#10;17:30&#10;Parteien schon wissen aber dass wir ähm&#10;17:33&#10;deutlich über 2 % glaube ich gehen&#10;17:35&#10;werden das ist schon klar ob wir auf&#10;17:37&#10;3,5% oder so kommen Herr habbeck hat's&#10;17:40&#10;genannt Pistorius geht auch in diese&#10;17:42&#10;Richtung müssen wir mal abwarten aber&#10;17:43&#10;das sind schon realistische Zahlen wie&#10;17:45&#10;wie kommt man eigentlich dahin weil&#10;17:46&#10;viele sagen dann ja auch na ja also es&#10;17:48&#10;droht doch kein großer Krieg brauchen&#10;17:50&#10;wir so viel Geld ähm da kann man nur&#10;17:52&#10;sagen äh dass natürlich das ganze&#10;17:55&#10;Militär immer teurer wird auch durch die&#10;17:57&#10;ähm durch durch die drohen durch it&#10;18:00&#10;durch sehr viele drohen durch KI&#10;18:01&#10;getriebene drohen und was wir brauchen&#10;18:04&#10;ist eigentlich eine eine Investition in&#10;18:07&#10;in in it syysteme in drohen in KI&#10;18:10&#10;Entwicklung und Software Plattform den&#10;18:12&#10;nächsten 5 Jahren von sagen wir mal 2&#10;18:14&#10;bis 300 Milliarden Euro das sind so so&#10;18:16&#10;zahlen die genannt werden um Schritt zu&#10;18:18&#10;halten mit der technischen Innovation&#10;18:20&#10;die wir jetzt im ukraine-russlandkrieg&#10;18:22&#10;sehen weil diese beiden Staaten stehen&#10;18:24&#10;unter massiven Druck täglich sterben&#10;18:26&#10;tausende von Soldaten und ähm sind&#10;18:29&#10;technisch sehr viel weiter als wir das&#10;18:31&#10;sind um da Anschluss zu halten also das&#10;18:33&#10;sind Innovationszyklen von Wochen also&#10;18:35&#10;da brauchen wir Monate oder Jahre um&#10;18:37&#10;dahinterherzukommen da muss man also&#10;18:39&#10;sehr viel Geld investieren&#10;18:41&#10;wie das dann gemacht wird werden wir&#10;18:43&#10;sehen&#10;18:44&#10;aber das es dazu kommt das ist&#10;18:45&#10;eigentlich für mich äh zweifellos klar&#10;18:49&#10;denn ich glaube dieser Krieg wird&#10;18:50&#10;weitergehen ja wenn sie KI ansprechen da&#10;18:52&#10;ist es ja so dass Donald Trump dieses&#10;18:54&#10;500 Milliarden Investitionssumme&#10;18:57&#10;angekündigt hat China hat kurzf eigenes&#10;18:59&#10;kiystem vorgestellt jetzt hat Ela&#10;19:02&#10;vonlein auch gesagt es muss in der EU&#10;19:04&#10;200 Milliarden aufgebracht werden um in&#10;19:07&#10;KI zu investieren reicht das oder zeigt&#10;19:10&#10;sich eigentlich dass wir gerade auch in&#10;19:13&#10;diesem so wichtigen Zukunftstechnologie&#10;19:15&#10;eigentlich gerade eine neue Abhängigkeit&#10;19:18&#10;beginnen zu zementieren also das&#10;19:21&#10;Grundproblem ist da wie in vielen&#10;19:23&#10;Bereichen dass die Europäer halt so sind&#10;19:25&#10;wie sie sind sie sind eben nicht eins&#10;19:27&#10;und wir sind 450 Millionen EU-Europäer&#10;19:29&#10;wir haben&#10;19:31&#10;eine starke startupszene wir als den&#10;19:34&#10;Ländern unterschiedlich ausgeprägt wenn&#10;19:36&#10;wir mal zusammenarbeiten würden was wir&#10;19:39&#10;seit 10 Jahren reden aber nicht tun&#10;19:41&#10;hätten wir natürlich unglaublich viel&#10;19:43&#10;sage ich mal technologische Power die&#10;19:45&#10;wir&#10;19:47&#10;auf die Bühne bringen könnten&#10;19:49&#10;das ist aber nicht so und jedes Land&#10;19:51&#10;versucht seine eigenen Kil Lösung zu&#10;19:54&#10;finden und das ist militärisch gesehen&#10;19:56&#10;natürlich ein ein Horror weil wir&#10;19:58&#10;xstaaten haben die sollen zusammen&#10;20:00&#10;kämpfen aber wieder unterschiedliche&#10;20:02&#10;Systeme haben und was ich vermisse ist&#10;20:05&#10;eigentlich und das seit seit vielen&#10;20:07&#10;Jahren aber gerade seit 22 ist den&#10;20:09&#10;nächsten Schritt der europäischen&#10;20:11&#10;Integration nämlich im Bereich&#10;20:12&#10;Sicherheit also jetzt nicht eine&#10;20:14&#10;europäische Verteidigungsarmee aber eine&#10;20:15&#10;europäische Rüstung eine stärkere&#10;20:18&#10;Verzahnung das wird zwar ständig&#10;20:19&#10;beschworen auf jedem&#10;20:21&#10;Podium auf jeder München&#10;20:23&#10;Sicherheitskonferenz finden sich dazu&#10;20:24&#10;Podien aber es kommt immer n hinten raus&#10;20:27&#10;warum weil die igensinnigkeit der staten&#10;20:30&#10;immer noch so groß ist jeder will Z&#10;20:32&#10;sagen seine Systeme sagen schützen und&#10;20:33&#10;was wir bräuchten wäre ein wie andere&#10;20:36&#10;europäische Schritte Schengen der Euro&#10;20:39&#10;der europäische Wirtschaftsraum das ist&#10;20:40&#10;ja auch hoch umstritten gewesen aber&#10;20:43&#10;damals gab es dann also Koh und mitteron&#10;20:46&#10;oder Schmidt und JC oder de go und&#10;20:48&#10;Adenauer Leute Staatenlenker die dann&#10;20:52&#10;gegen die Widerstände in ihren Ländern&#10;20:54&#10;das durchgedrückt haben se ich und das&#10;20:57&#10;sehe ich eben heute nicht und deswegen&#10;20:58&#10;werden wir auch weiter auf allen&#10;21:00&#10;Konferenzen das fordern und es wird&#10;21:02&#10;nichts passieren und bisher war leider&#10;21:03&#10;so muss man ja sagen der Druck nicht&#10;21:05&#10;groß genug auch in diesem KI Bereich&#10;21:07&#10;jetzt haben wir diesen wegruf das muss&#10;21:10&#10;man ja schon sagen meh kann ja&#10;21:12&#10;eigentlich jetzt vorerst nicht sozusagen&#10;21:15&#10;von den Amerikanern angekündigt werden&#10;21:19&#10;das was Sie ansprechen ist die&#10;21:20&#10;Reformfähigkeit einerseits der EU aber&#10;21:23&#10;auch Deutschlands lassen sie uns darauf&#10;21:26&#10;noch mal gucken&#10;21:28&#10;Situation nach der Bundestagswahl was&#10;21:30&#10;erwarten Sie ganz konkret was eine neue&#10;21:33&#10;Bundesregierung leisten muss also eine&#10;21:37&#10;Bundesregierung müsste sich entscheiden&#10;21:40&#10;die Bundeswehr den ganzen&#10;21:42&#10;sicherheitspolitischen Bereich got nicht&#10;21:43&#10;nur die Bundeswehr dazu grundlegend zu&#10;21:46&#10;reformieren die Bundeswehr ist aus&#10;21:47&#10;sicheraus nicht mehr reformfähig alle&#10;21:50&#10;Reformversuche der letzten Jahre sind&#10;21:52&#10;letztlich im Sande verlaufen sind&#10;21:54&#10;stecken geblieben und eine&#10;21:55&#10;Bundesregierung müsste sich da ganz&#10;21:57&#10;grundlegend dransetzen&#10;21:59&#10;wohlwissend dass Reformen Prozesse sind&#10;22:01&#10;also zu erwarten dass jetzt da über&#10;22:03&#10;Nacht ist ist schon klar aber um&#10;22:05&#10;überhaupt Ergebnisse signifikante&#10;22:07&#10;Veränderungen zu erwarten müsste man&#10;22:09&#10;jetzt eben sag eine endothermreaktion&#10;22:12&#10;mit mehr Energie reingehen um dann in&#10;22:15&#10;einigen Jahren bessere Ergebnisse zu&#10;22:17&#10;haben bislang ist das nie gemacht worden&#10;22:19&#10;weil man sagte das ist kritisch dann&#10;22:21&#10;gibt's Widerstände dann kommen die&#10;22:22&#10;Gewerkschaften der Beamtenbund und das&#10;22:24&#10;wollen wir nicht und weil es auch kein&#10;22:26&#10;kabinettsprojekt war also solche solche&#10;22:28&#10;Umbau der Bundeswehr hin zu mehr&#10;22:30&#10;militärische Effizienz würde nur&#10;22:32&#10;gelingen wenn ein neuer Kanzler eine&#10;22:34&#10;Kanzlerin sagt das ist ein&#10;22:36&#10;kabinettsprojekt und da ist nicht nur&#10;22:37&#10;der Verteidigungsminister dabei da ist&#10;22:39&#10;der Arbeitsminister dabei weil der&#10;22:41&#10;verhandelt die&#10;22:42&#10;arbeitszeitrichtlingen in in in Europa&#10;22:44&#10;da ist der Justizminister dabei da ist&#10;22:46&#10;die Außenministerin dabei der&#10;22:47&#10;Finanzminister und im britischen Sinne&#10;22:50&#10;müsste man ein komit bilden und sagen so&#10;22:52&#10;wie kriegen wir das jetzt gelöst das gab&#10;22:55&#10;es bisher nicht sondern die&#10;22:56&#10;verteidigungsministerinnen und Minister&#10;22:58&#10;waren Kämpfer das ist dann aber auch nur&#10;23:00&#10;einer von 15 am kabinetstisch und&#10;23:03&#10;deswegen sind das alles reformmchen&#10;23:05&#10;gewesen und da kommen wir nicht voran&#10;23:07&#10;und als hisorer kann ich immer sagen es&#10;23:08&#10;gibt ja Beispiele von Reformen die auch&#10;23:11&#10;im Frieden gelangen also ich wohne in&#10;23:14&#10;Berlin und ich gehe jeden Sonntag jogen&#10;23:16&#10;im Tiergarten da gibt's die Siegessäule&#10;23:18&#10;und an dieser Siegessäule stehen drei&#10;23:20&#10;Figuren und einer ist der Herr rohen&#10;23:23&#10;Albrecht von rohen war prusischer&#10;23:25&#10;Kriegsminister nachdem eine heesreform&#10;23:28&#10;bei nannt wurde 1859 und warum konnte er&#10;23:31&#10;die durchsetzen und die führte war ein&#10;23:33&#10;Faktor für die deutschen Siege in den&#10;23:35&#10;einigungskriegen weil er den&#10;23:37&#10;prinzreenten auf seiner Seite hat und&#10;23:38&#10;den Ministerpräsidenten Bismark also er&#10;23:40&#10;hatte die Unterstützung der höchsten&#10;23:42&#10;Politik deswegen konnte er seine&#10;23:44&#10;Reformen umsetzen und davon können wir&#10;23:46&#10;lernen ein Verteidigungsminister wer&#10;23:48&#10;immer das wird ob es pistorus&#10;23:49&#10;weitermacht oder wer immer wird nur den&#10;23:52&#10;Verteidigungsbereich wirklich&#10;23:53&#10;reformieren können wenn er das Kabinett&#10;23:55&#10;hinter sich hat und den und den Kanzler&#10;23:56&#10;oder die Kanzler ist da aus ihrer Sicht&#10;23:59&#10;jetzt gerade ein Wechsel gut dass jemand&#10;24:01&#10;neu kommt oder ist auch das wieder etwas&#10;24:03&#10;was&#10;24:04&#10;eine Reform natürlich erstmal zeitlich&#10;24:06&#10;verzögert weil sich ja erstmal dann&#10;24:08&#10;jemand neues einarbeiten muss wie&#10;24:10&#10;blicken sie da drauf also ich schätze&#10;24:13&#10;Boris Pistorius sehr aber ich glaube&#10;24:15&#10;nicht dass er er hat ja schon die&#10;24:17&#10;Strukturen so ein bisschen reformiert&#10;24:19&#10;und mir ging das nicht weit genug und er&#10;24:20&#10;hat den ostnarbrücke Erlass erlassen ich&#10;24:22&#10;kann mir jetzt nicht vorstellen dass es&#10;24:23&#10;den ostnarbrücke alllast 2 gibt also was&#10;24:26&#10;Boris bustorus verändern wollte hat er&#10;24:27&#10;verändert und mir und sehr vielen in der&#10;24:30&#10;Bundeswehr geht es nicht weit genug also&#10;24:32&#10;ich würde mir da jemand Wünschen der&#10;24:34&#10;mehr umsetzt äh und ich würde mir vor&#10;24:36&#10;allen Dingen wenn es einen neuen&#10;24:37&#10;Verteidigungsminister oder Ministerin&#10;24:39&#10;gibt jemand Wünschen der sich nicht&#10;24:40&#10;einarbeiten muss denn ähm wir haben&#10;24:44&#10;keine Zeit und ich würde von den&#10;24:46&#10;Parteien verlangen dass sie sich&#10;24:48&#10;vielleicht mal Gedanken machen wer das&#10;24:49&#10;werden könnte und dass dieser Mensch&#10;24:51&#10;sich oder Frau wie immer man sich&#10;24:53&#10;Gedanken macht okay wie will ich das&#10;24:55&#10;reformieren und bitte keine&#10;24:57&#10;Bestandsaufnahme keine Reformkommission&#10;24:59&#10;es ist alles bekannt es ist alles&#10;25:01&#10;bekannt ihr müsst es einfach machen und&#10;25:03&#10;vielleicht sagt Boris bistoris auch mit&#10;25:05&#10;einem anderen Kanzler Friedrich Merz&#10;25:08&#10;kann ich jetzt die Dinge durchsetzen ich&#10;25:09&#10;mit Scholz nicht durchsetzen konnte das&#10;25:11&#10;weiß ich natürlich nicht was letztlich&#10;25:13&#10;zählt das einzige was zählt ist was&#10;25:15&#10;kommt am Ende hinten raus das ist ja&#10;25:17&#10;auch Frage ne jetzt die Truppe sie&#10;25:19&#10;wollten sie gerade ansprechen das ist ja&#10;25:20&#10;die andere Frage die eigentlich&#10;25:21&#10;erstaunlich wenig gerade eine Rolle&#10;25:23&#10;spielt wie bekommt man es hin dass die&#10;25:26&#10;Bundeswehr personell aufg s die SPD&#10;25:29&#10;Vorstellung ist ja eher ein freiwilliger&#10;25:31&#10;Ansatz in der Union sagt man das ist&#10;25:34&#10;nicht ausreichend wie würden sie es&#10;25:36&#10;angehen wie würden Sie die Bundeswehr&#10;25:38&#10;personell Stärken also ich fand den&#10;25:40&#10;Ansatz von pistorus mit diesem&#10;25:42&#10;sogenannten schwedischen Modell der&#10;25:43&#10;whrpflicht eigentlich sinnvoll die alte&#10;25:46&#10;whrpflicht ich war noch whrpflichtiger&#10;25:48&#10;Ende der 80er Jahre mit über 200.000&#10;25:50&#10;whrpflichtigen das kann die Bundeswehr&#10;25:51&#10;zur Zeit gar nicht verkraften und Boris&#10;25:54&#10;bistoris war ja so eine Idee so eine&#10;25:56&#10;Auswahl wrflicht wie das die Schweden&#10;25:58&#10;machen ähm die Union sagt äh in in&#10;26:02&#10;Pflichtjahr ein soziales Jahr und da&#10;26:04&#10;kann man auch zur Bundeswehr gehen das&#10;26:06&#10;ist eine politische Entscheidung wichtig&#10;26:08&#10;ist dass die Bundeswehr ihren&#10;26:09&#10;Personalbedarf decken kann dass wir&#10;26:11&#10;irgendwie eine Form der whrpflicht&#10;26:14&#10;bekommen und da fand ich es einfach&#10;26:16&#10;skandalös dass dass der Bundeskanzler&#10;26:18&#10;gesagt hat die Bundeswehr hat kein&#10;26:20&#10;Personalproblem also da dachte ich mir&#10;26:22&#10;wie man so lügen kann wie man doch&#10;26:24&#10;wirklich einfach so lügen kann und da&#10;26:26&#10;ist es einfach erschütternd gewesen&#10;26:28&#10;dass auch von der Generalität kein&#10;26:30&#10;öffentlicher widerspruch kam zu sagen&#10;26:32&#10;das stimmt einfach nicht wir sagen das&#10;26:34&#10;in internen runden immer und immer&#10;26:36&#10;wieder und da kannst da sagen so ist es&#10;26:37&#10;nicht nicht ich weiß nicht in welcher&#10;26:38&#10;Welt Scholz da lebt also ich höre von&#10;26:41&#10;allen was&#10;26:42&#10;anderes so boris bistoris hat das&#10;26:44&#10;versucht er braucht auch mehr Geld dafür&#10;26:46&#10;er ist von von Scholz al abgewarscht&#10;26:48&#10;worden und mit dem Personalbestand geht&#10;26:51&#10;es nicht sagen alle also müssen wir&#10;26:54&#10;welches Modell man nun verfolgt also&#10;26:56&#10;eine auswahlwerrpflicht wie Schweden&#10;26:58&#10;oder ein ein Dienstjahr wie die wie die&#10;27:00&#10;Union das&#10;27:01&#10;vorschlägt das ist ist mir wurscht&#10;27:04&#10;sozusagen aber es muss was passieren&#10;27:07&#10;und es war ein fataler Fehler aus me&#10;27:09&#10;meines Achtens dass wir nicht früher da&#10;27:11&#10;eingestiegen sind weil auch das ist ja&#10;27:12&#10;wieder ein Prozess das dauert natürlich&#10;27:15&#10;bis dann die ersten Soldaten kommen wir&#10;27:16&#10;müssen wieder Kasernen bauen und so&#10;27:17&#10;weiter und wir haben keine Zeit die Zeit&#10;27:20&#10;läuft uns weg sie schreiben in ihrem&#10;27:22&#10;neuen Buch das Mitte März erscheint dass&#10;27:24&#10;die Bedrohungslage akuter ist als im&#10;27:27&#10;kalten Krieg wenn sie das noch mal zum&#10;27:30&#10;Schluss dieses Gesprächs noch mal&#10;27:32&#10;zusammenfassen worin liegt das für uns&#10;27:34&#10;ganz speziell erstmal in der&#10;27:35&#10;hybrienbedrohung ja in der&#10;27:37&#10;hybridenbedrohung weil wir sind in einem&#10;27:39&#10;Hybriden Krieg mit Russland und ich darf&#10;27:41&#10;daran erinnern das schreibe ich auch in&#10;27:43&#10;in meinem kleinen Buch dass die Staats&#10;27:47&#10;Regierungschefs auf dem natogipfel in&#10;27:49&#10;Madrid 2022 festgehalten haben the euro&#10;27:52&#10;Atlantic area is not at peace wir sind&#10;27:55&#10;nicht im Frieden nicht im Krieg wir sind&#10;27:57&#10;dazwischen so&#10;27:58&#10;und die Bedrohung ist ganz konkret dass&#10;28:00&#10;im Kalten Krieg&#10;28:02&#10;wir eigentlich in Europa ein Status Quo&#10;28:04&#10;hatten die Sowjetunion wollte den Status&#10;28:07&#10;Quo in Europa nicht verändern und die&#10;28:08&#10;NATO auch nicht das ist jetzt anders wir&#10;28:10&#10;müssen davon ausgehen dass Putin den&#10;28:12&#10;Status Quo verändern wird und das heißt&#10;28:14&#10;jetzt nicht dass drei russische&#10;28:15&#10;Panzerarmeen auf Berlin marschieren aber&#10;28:18&#10;nach allem was ich weiß sagt die NATO&#10;28:22&#10;sagen die Nachrichtendienste er wird uns&#10;28:24&#10;testen also was heißt das dass er weiter&#10;28:27&#10;versucht die Gesellschaften Hybrid zu&#10;28:29&#10;schwächen und das sehen wir ja gerade in&#10;28:31&#10;Frankreich in Deutschland in anderen&#10;28:33&#10;Ländern und dass er dann auch mit&#10;28:35&#10;militärischen Mitteln versucht&#10;28:37&#10;ein ein Schritt zu machen sei es dass er&#10;28:40&#10;in einem baltischen Land einmarschiert&#10;28:42&#10;oder Spitzbergen besetzt oder irgendwie&#10;28:43&#10;sowas als ein Schritt zu machen auf dem&#10;28:45&#10;man eigentlich militärisch reagieren&#10;28:47&#10;müsste und damit schaut begrenzter&#10;28:50&#10;Mitteleinsatz wie reagiert die Nato und&#10;28:52&#10;wenn die NATO dann nicht entschlossen&#10;28:55&#10;reagiert ja ist es eigentlich das Ende&#10;28:57&#10;der NATO weil weil wir haben den Artikel&#10;28:59&#10;5 und wir müssen Beistand leisten und&#10;29:01&#10;mit diesen Szenarien wird wirklich&#10;29:03&#10;gerechnet gerade weil sie dieses&#10;29:05&#10;Szenarien ansprechen was macht ein&#10;29:06&#10;Militärhistoriker der diesen Rundumblick&#10;29:09&#10;hat um sich trotz dieser Szenarien mit&#10;29:11&#10;denen sie sich ja befassen müssen um&#10;29:13&#10;abzuschalten und auch ein bisschen Kraft&#10;29:16&#10;dafür zu finden sich mit diesen Dingen&#10;29:19&#10;so zu beschafassen ich gehe im&#10;29:21&#10;brandenburgischen wandern und bei den&#10;29:23&#10;Wäldern und Seen Brandenburgs kommt man&#10;29:25&#10;dann auf andere Gedanken herzlichen Dank&#10;29:28&#10;kernhizel für dieses Gespräch bei Phönix&#10;29:30&#10;persönlich se sehr gerne&#10;29:37&#10;[Musik]" />

          <attvalue for="4" value="0:01&#10;WE HAVE THE TIME. THANKS, JEN.&#10;0:03&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. HI, LAWRENCE.&#10;0:04&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. WELL, AS I SAY,&#10;0:06&#10;THE BREAKING NEWS OF THE NIGHT&#10;0:07&#10;IS THAT DONALD TRUMP'S ILLEGAL&#10;0:09&#10;TARIFFS ARE GONE THANKS TO A&#10;0:12&#10;RULING OF THE UNITED STATES&#10;0:14&#10;COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE.&#10;0:16&#10;FUTURES TRADING IS NOW SOARING&#10;0:19&#10;TONIGHT IN THE EXPECTATION OF AN&#10;0:21&#10;EXPLOSIVELY POSITIVE REACTION BY&#10;0:22&#10;THE STOCK MARKET. TOMORROW, WHEN&#10;0:24&#10;THE WORLD WILL RESET ITSELF&#10;0:27&#10;AROUND THE RESTORATION OF LAW&#10;0:29&#10;AND ORDER IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE&#10;0:32&#10;AND THE CRUSHING OF THE TRUMP&#10;0:36&#10;TARIFFS AND RESULTANT PERSONAL&#10;0:39&#10;WORLDWIDE HUMILIATION OF DONALD&#10;0:41&#10;TRUMP. THE TRUMP TARIFFS WERE&#10;0:44&#10;ALWAYS ILLEGAL AND&#10;0:46&#10;UNCONSTITUTIONAL. AND YOU HEARD&#10;0:47&#10;THAT ON THIS PROGRAM. EVERY TIME&#10;0:49&#10;WE COVERED DONALD TRUMP'S&#10;0:51&#10;COMMENTS ABOUT TARIFFS,&#10;0:52&#10;INCLUDING VERY MUCH DURING THE&#10;0:55&#10;PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, WHEN THE&#10;0:56&#10;CAMPAIGN PRESS CORPS NEVER, EVER&#10;0:59&#10;REPORTED TO VOTERS THAT THE&#10;1:02&#10;TRUMP PROPOSED TARIFFS DURING&#10;1:03&#10;THE CAMPAIGN WERE COMPLETELY&#10;1:05&#10;ILLEGAL AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL.&#10;1:08&#10;THE CAMPAIGN PRESS CORPS NEVER&#10;1:10&#10;REPORTED TO VOTERS THAT THOSE&#10;1:13&#10;PROPOSALS WERE CONSTITUTIONALLY&#10;1:16&#10;INSANE, AND THE PERSON&#10;1:17&#10;PRONOUNCING THOSE PROPOSALS AT&#10;1:19&#10;THOSE TRUMP RALLIES WAS&#10;1:22&#10;CONSTITUTIONALLY OUT OF HIS&#10;1:24&#10;MIND, JUST BASED ON WHAT HE WAS&#10;1:26&#10;SAYING ABOUT TARIFFS ALONE. THE&#10;1:27&#10;CAMPAIGN PRESS CORPS COMPLETELY&#10;1:29&#10;FAILED THE AMERICAN VOTER ON&#10;1:32&#10;THIS ISSUE, WITH AMERICAN VOTERS&#10;1:33&#10;JUST DISCOVERING TONIGHT FROM&#10;1:35&#10;THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF TRADE&#10;1:37&#10;JUST HOW ILLEGAL AND&#10;1:39&#10;UNCONSTITUTIONAL THE TRUMP&#10;1:40&#10;TARIFFS ALWAYS HAVE BEEN. THE&#10;1:43&#10;UNITED STATES COURT OF&#10;1:44&#10;INTERNATIONAL TRADE, WHICH HAS&#10;1:46&#10;EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER&#10;1:47&#10;CASES INVOLVING TARIFF DISPUTES,&#10;1:50&#10;HAS RULED UNANIMOUSLY THAT WHEN&#10;1:53&#10;IT COMES TO TARIFFS, DONALD&#10;1:55&#10;TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE, QUOTE,&#10;1:58&#10;UNBOUNDED AUTHORITY. AND THE&#10;2:00&#10;COURT SETS ASIDE THE CHALLENGED&#10;2:03&#10;TARIFFS THE COURT GAVE THE&#10;2:06&#10;PLAINTIFFS SUING THE TRUMP&#10;2:07&#10;ADMINISTRATION EVEN MORE THAN&#10;2:09&#10;THEY EXPECTED. THE PLAINTIFFS&#10;2:11&#10;INCLUDE 12 STATES WITH&#10;2:13&#10;DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS WHO SUED,&#10;2:15&#10;ARGUING THAT THE TRUMP TARIFFS&#10;2:17&#10;ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND&#10;2:19&#10;ILLEGAL, AND ASK THE COURT FOR&#10;2:20&#10;AT LEAST A TEMPORARY INJUNCTION&#10;2:23&#10;TEMPORARILY BLOCKING THE&#10;2:25&#10;TARIFFS. BUT THE COURT WENT ALL&#10;2:27&#10;THE WAY AND DELIVERED A FULL AND&#10;2:30&#10;FINAL RULING IN THE CASE,&#10;2:32&#10;GRANTING WHAT THE COURT CALLS A&#10;2:34&#10;SUMMARY JUDGMENT AGAINST DONALD&#10;2:37&#10;TRUMP AND ALL OF HIS TARIFFS. SO&#10;2:40&#10;AS OF THIS HOUR TONIGHT, IT IS&#10;2:41&#10;NO LONGER LEGAL AT ANY PORT OF&#10;2:44&#10;ENTRY IN THE UNITED STATES FOR A&#10;2:46&#10;UNITED STATES CUSTOMS SERVICE TO&#10;2:47&#10;COLLECT A SINGLE DOLLAR OF TRUMP&#10;2:50&#10;TARIFFS. CIVIL LAWSUITS LIKE&#10;2:52&#10;THIS SELDOM HAVE SUCH TOTAL AND&#10;2:55&#10;COMPLETE AND FINAL VICTORIES.&#10;2:57&#10;JUST TWO WEEKS AFTER THE COURT&#10;3:00&#10;HEARD ARGUMENTS IN THE CASE.&#10;3:01&#10;VICTORIES IN THIS CASE FOR&#10;3:03&#10;PLAINTIFFS AT THIS STAGE OF THIS&#10;3:06&#10;KIND OF LITIGATION ARE VERY&#10;3:07&#10;UNUSUAL. BUT HERE WE ARE, AND AS&#10;3:09&#10;I'VE BEEN REPORTING TO YOU&#10;3:11&#10;LITERALLY FOR YEARS NOW, THERE&#10;3:13&#10;ARE FEW THINGS MORE CLEAR IN LAW&#10;3:16&#10;THAN CONGRESS'S COMPLETE&#10;3:18&#10;AUTHORITY OVER TARIFFS. THE&#10;3:19&#10;COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE&#10;3:21&#10;SAID IN ITS OPINION THAT EVEN IF&#10;3:23&#10;CONGRESS WANTED TO GIVE DONALD&#10;3:25&#10;TRUMP POWER OVER TARIFFS, IT&#10;3:27&#10;WOULD BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO DO&#10;3:29&#10;SO. QUOTE, AN UNLIMITED&#10;3:32&#10;DELEGATION OF TARIFF AUTHORITY&#10;3:34&#10;WOULD CONSTITUTE AN IMPROPER&#10;3:37&#10;ABDICATION OF LEGISLATIVE POWER&#10;3:39&#10;TO ANOTHER BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT.&#10;3:40&#10;DONALD TRUMP'S ILLEGAL TARIFFS&#10;3:41&#10;WERE BASED ON THE INTERNATIONAL&#10;3:45&#10;EMERGENCY ECONOMIC POWERS ACT OF&#10;3:48&#10;1977. AND TODAY, FINALLY, THE&#10;3:50&#10;COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE&#10;3:52&#10;SAID WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING SINCE&#10;3:53&#10;THE DAY DONALD TRUMP INVOKED&#10;3:55&#10;THAT LAW TO SUPPORT HIS TARIFFS,&#10;3:58&#10;QUOTE, ANY INTERPRETATION OF THE&#10;4:00&#10;INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY ECONOMIC&#10;4:02&#10;POWERS ACT THAT DELEGATES&#10;4:04&#10;UNLIMITED TARIFF AUTHORITY IS&#10;4:07&#10;UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THE COURT&#10;4:08&#10;REJECTED DONALD TRUMP'S CLAIM OF&#10;4:10&#10;A NATIONAL EMERGENCY TO JUSTIFY&#10;4:12&#10;HIS TARIFFS, SAYING THE MERE&#10;4:15&#10;INCANTATION OF NATIONAL&#10;4:16&#10;EMERGENCY CANNOT, OF COURSE,&#10;4:18&#10;SOUND THE DEATH KNELL OF THE&#10;4:22&#10;CONSTITUTION. AND THAT'S WHAT&#10;4:23&#10;DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO DO.&#10;4:25&#10;HE'S TRYING TO KILL THE&#10;4:27&#10;CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED&#10;4:28&#10;STATES IN A DIFFERENT WAY EVERY&#10;4:31&#10;DAY. HE TRIED AND FAILED THANKS&#10;4:34&#10;TO THE COURT OF INTERNATIONAL&#10;4:36&#10;TRADE, TO SOUND THE DEATH KNELL&#10;4:37&#10;OF THE CONSTITUTION BY STEALING&#10;4:40&#10;CONGRESS'S EXCLUSIVE POWER OVER&#10;4:43&#10;TARIFFS. AND IN A 49 PAGE RULING&#10;4:45&#10;COAUTHORED BY THREE JUDGES OF&#10;4:48&#10;THE COURT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE&#10;4:49&#10;IN NEW YORK CITY, DONALD TRUMP'S&#10;4:52&#10;ATTEMPTS TO KILL THE&#10;4:53&#10;CONSTITUTION THIS TIME HAVE&#10;4:56&#10;FAILED. JUDGE GARY KATZMANN WAS&#10;4:58&#10;APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA.&#10;5:00&#10;JUDGE JANE RESTANI WAS APPOINTED&#10;5:02&#10;BY REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT RONALD&#10;5:04&#10;REAGAN. JUDGE TIMOTHY REIF WAS&#10;5:06&#10;APPOINTED BY REPUBLICAN&#10;5:09&#10;PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, AND&#10;5:12&#10;THOSE THREE JUDGES UNANIMOUSLY&#10;5:15&#10;AGREED TO EVERY WORD IN&#10;5:16&#10;TONIGHT'S BREAKING NEWS OPINION&#10;5:18&#10;THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN&#10;5:20&#10;AMERICAN LAW THAT CAN MAKE&#10;5:22&#10;DONALD TRUMP'S TARIFFS LEGAL.&#10;5:25&#10;TWO SETS OF PLAINTIFFS BROUGHT&#10;5:27&#10;CASES TO THE COURT OF&#10;5:29&#10;INTERNATIONAL TRADE. AND IN&#10;5:30&#10;THEIR UNANIMOUS OPINION TONIGHT,&#10;5:32&#10;THE COURT SAID THE QUESTION IN&#10;5:33&#10;THE TWO CASES BEFORE THE COURT&#10;5:35&#10;IS WHETHER THE INTERNATIONAL&#10;5:36&#10;EMERGENCY ECONOMIC POWERS ACT OF&#10;5:39&#10;1977 DELEGATES THESE POWERS TO&#10;5:40&#10;THE PRESIDENT IN THE FORM OF&#10;5:43&#10;AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE UNLIMITED&#10;5:44&#10;TARIFFS ON GOODS FROM NEARLY&#10;5:46&#10;EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. THE&#10;5:49&#10;COURT DOES NOT READ THE&#10;5:51&#10;INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY ECONOMIC&#10;5:52&#10;POWERS ACT TO CONFER SUCH&#10;5:54&#10;UNBOUNDED AUTHORITY, AND SETS&#10;5:56&#10;ASIDE THE CHALLENGED TARIFFS&#10;6:00&#10;IMPOSED THEREUNDER FOR DONALD&#10;6:02&#10;TRUMP'S BENEFIT, THOUGH HE, OF&#10;6:04&#10;COURSE, COULD NEVER ACTUALLY&#10;6:06&#10;READ A SINGLE PAGE OF A COURT&#10;6:07&#10;OPINION, BUT MOSTLY FOR THE&#10;6:09&#10;BENEFIT OF THE UNITED STATES&#10;6:10&#10;SUPREME COURT. THE TRADE EXPERTS&#10;6:13&#10;ON THE COURT OF INTERNATIONAL&#10;6:14&#10;TRADE WROTE A BRIEF HISTORY OF&#10;6:19&#10;INTERNATIONAL TRADE RIGHT IN&#10;6:20&#10;THEIR OPINION AND A BRIEF&#10;6:22&#10;HISTORY OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE&#10;6:23&#10;LAW FOR DONALD TRUMP'S SUPREME&#10;6:25&#10;COURT JUSTICES TO STUDY, BECAUSE&#10;6:27&#10;THEY KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT&#10;6:29&#10;INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW. WHEN&#10;6:30&#10;DONALD TRUMP NO DOUBT APPEALS&#10;6:32&#10;THIS CASE ALL THE WAY UP TO THE&#10;6:34&#10;JUDGES ON THE SUPREME COURT, WHO&#10;6:36&#10;HE BELIEVES OWE HIM THEIR&#10;6:37&#10;PERMANENT LOYALTY, THE TRADE&#10;6:39&#10;COURT IDENTIFIED THREE DIFFERENT&#10;6:41&#10;KINDS OF TARIFFS DONALD TRUMP&#10;6:43&#10;WAS ILLEGALLY IMPOSING AND RULED&#10;6:46&#10;AGAINST EACH OF THEM, CALLING&#10;6:48&#10;EACH OF THEM ILLEGAL AND&#10;6:50&#10;UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THE COURT&#10;6:51&#10;REFERRED REFERRED TO TARIFFS&#10;6:53&#10;IMPOSED ON COUNTRIES TO&#10;6:55&#10;INDIRECTLY FORCE THEM TO SOMEHOW&#10;6:57&#10;STOP THE FLOW OF FENTANYL AROUND&#10;6:59&#10;THE WORLD AND OTHER ILLICIT&#10;7:01&#10;DRUGS THAT ARE ILLEGAL BECAUSE&#10;7:04&#10;TARIFFS CANNOT LEGALLY BE USED&#10;7:07&#10;TO LEVERAGE THE BEHAVIOR OF&#10;7:08&#10;OTHER GOVERNMENTS ON ISSUES&#10;7:10&#10;OTHER THAN REGULATED&#10;7:13&#10;INTERNATIONAL TRADE, THE COURT&#10;7:14&#10;WROTE. ATTACKS DEALS WITH A&#10;7:16&#10;BUDGET DEFICIT BY RAISING&#10;7:18&#10;REVENUE. A DAM DEALS WITH&#10;7:20&#10;FLOODING BY HOLDING BACK A&#10;7:22&#10;RIVER, BUT THERE IS NO SUCH&#10;7:24&#10;ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE ACT OF&#10;7:25&#10;IMPOSING A TARIFF AND THE&#10;7:27&#10;UNUSUAL AND EXTRAORDINARY&#10;7:30&#10;THREATS THAT THE TRAFFICKING&#10;7:31&#10;ORDERS PURPORT TO COMBAT. THE&#10;7:34&#10;TRAFFICKING ORDERS DO NOT DEAL&#10;7:37&#10;WITH THEIR STATED OBJECTIVES.&#10;7:39&#10;RATHER, AS THE GOVERNMENT&#10;7:41&#10;ACKNOWLEDGES, THE ORDERS AIM TO&#10;7:43&#10;CREATE LEVERAGE TO DEAL WITH&#10;7:45&#10;THOSE OBJECTIVES, THAT USE IS&#10;7:49&#10;IMPERMISSIBLE NOT BECAUSE IT IS&#10;7:51&#10;UNWISE OR INEFFECTIVE, BUT&#10;7:53&#10;BECAUSE SECTION 1701 DOES NOT&#10;7:57&#10;ALLOW IT. THE COURT LAID OUT THE&#10;8:00&#10;LEGAL SPECIFICS, STRIKING DOWN&#10;8:03&#10;ALL OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP CALLS&#10;8:05&#10;HIS RECIPROCAL TARIFFS. AND&#10;8:07&#10;THROUGHOUT THE OPINION, THE&#10;8:08&#10;COURT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT&#10;8:10&#10;CONGRESS WOULD HAVE THE&#10;8:11&#10;AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE ANY OF THESE&#10;8:14&#10;TARIFFS. BUT THE PRESIDENT&#10;8:14&#10;SIMPLY DOES NOT HAVE THAT LEGAL&#10;8:16&#10;AUTHORITY IN THE SAME SENSE THAT&#10;8:18&#10;THE PRESIDENT DOES HAVE THE&#10;8:20&#10;POWER TO PARDON PEOPLE CONVICTED&#10;8:21&#10;OF FEDERAL CRIMES, WHICH DONALD&#10;8:23&#10;TRUMP IS DOING IN THE MOST&#10;8:24&#10;CORRUPT MANNER IN HISTORY. BUT&#10;8:26&#10;CONGRESS DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER&#10;8:29&#10;TO PARDON PEOPLE CONVICTED OF&#10;8:30&#10;FEDERAL CRIMES. THESE&#10;8:32&#10;DISTINCTIONS IN PRESIDENTIAL AND&#10;8:34&#10;CONGRESSIONAL POWER HAVE ALWAYS&#10;8:36&#10;BEEN EASY AND SIMPLE FOR PEOPLE&#10;8:38&#10;TO UNDERSTAND, AND NO ONE HAS&#10;8:40&#10;EVER DISPUTED THEM, JUST AS NO&#10;8:41&#10;ONE HAS EVER IMAGINED PRIOR TO&#10;8:43&#10;DONALD TRUMP, THAT A PRESIDENT&#10;8:45&#10;HAS THE AUTHORITY TO RAISE OR&#10;8:47&#10;LOWER TARIFFS, THE COURT WENT&#10;8:49&#10;THROUGH A PAINFUL RECITATION OF&#10;8:51&#10;ALL THE TARIFFS DONALD TRUMP HAS&#10;8:53&#10;THREATENED TO IMPOSE, AND THEN&#10;8:55&#10;REDUCED AND THEN POSTPONED,&#10;8:57&#10;SAYING EVERY ONE OF THOSE&#10;8:58&#10;DECISIONS WAS MADE ILLEGALLY.&#10;9:00&#10;THE COURT EXPLAINED THAT A&#10;9:02&#10;SUMMARY JUDGMENT IS THE ONLY&#10;9:05&#10;POSSIBLE WAY IN THIS CASE THAT&#10;9:07&#10;THIS CASE CAN BE RESOLVED AND&#10;9:09&#10;NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED NOW, AND&#10;9:11&#10;THE COURT EXPLAINED THE&#10;9:14&#10;STANDARDS FOR A SUMMARY&#10;9:16&#10;JUDGMENT, SAYING THE COURT SHALL&#10;9:19&#10;GRANT SUMMARY JUDGMENT IF THE&#10;9:22&#10;MOVANT SHOWS THAT THERE IS NO&#10;9:24&#10;GENUINE DISPUTE AS TO ANY&#10;9:26&#10;MATERIAL FACT AND THE MOVEMENT&#10;9:29&#10;IS ENTITLED TO JUDGMENT AS A&#10;9:32&#10;MATTER OF LAW, THAT IS A VERY&#10;9:34&#10;HIGH BAR. BUT DONALD TRUMP'S&#10;9:36&#10;CONSTITUTIONAL ILLITERACY EASILY&#10;9:38&#10;DELIVERED A SUMMARY JUDGMENT TO&#10;9:40&#10;THE STATES AND OTHER PLAINTIFFS&#10;9:42&#10;TO END ALL OF THE TRUMP TARIFFS&#10;9:44&#10;AND NOT ALLOW THEM TO BE&#10;9:47&#10;COLLECTED AT ANY PORT OF ENTRY&#10;9:49&#10;ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES.&#10;9:50&#10;THE COURT, OF COURSE, CITED&#10;9:51&#10;JAMES MADISON, WRITING IN THE&#10;9:53&#10;FEDERALIST PAPERS, ON THE&#10;9:54&#10;IMPORTANCE OF SEPARATION OF&#10;9:56&#10;POWERS AND SAID AN UNLIMITED&#10;9:58&#10;DELEGATION OF TARIFF AUTHORITY&#10;10:00&#10;WOULD BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THE&#10;10:02&#10;COURT SAID, QUOTE, THE&#10;10:04&#10;PRESIDENT'S ASSERTION OF&#10;10:05&#10;AUTHORITY HERE HAS NO MEANINGFUL&#10;10:07&#10;LIMITING STANDARDS, ESSENTIALLY&#10;10:10&#10;ENABLING HIM TO IMPOSE ANY&#10;10:12&#10;TARIFF RATE HE WANTS ON ANY&#10;10:14&#10;COUNTRY AT ANY TIME FOR&#10;10:15&#10;VIRTUALLY ANY REASON. THE COURT&#10;10:17&#10;STOPPED THAT MADNESS TONIGHT.&#10;10:20&#10;IT'S OVER. THE TRUMP TARIFF&#10;10:23&#10;MADNESS ENDS NOW, THE COURT&#10;10:25&#10;SAID. DONALD TRUMP'S ATTEMPT TO&#10;10:27&#10;USE OUR INTERNATIONAL TRADE&#10;10:29&#10;BALANCE OF PAYMENTS WITH&#10;10:30&#10;COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AS A&#10;10:32&#10;REASON FOR A PRESIDENT TO IMPOSE&#10;10:34&#10;TARIFFS WAS ILLEGAL AND&#10;10:36&#10;UNCONSTITUTIONAL. DONALD TRUMP&#10;10:37&#10;HAS LOST IN COURT MANY TIMES&#10;10:39&#10;BEFORE, MOST NOTABLY IN THE 34&#10;10:41&#10;GUILTY VERDICTS RETURNED AGAINST&#10;10:43&#10;HIM BY A JURY OF HIS PEERS IN A&#10;10:45&#10;CRIMINAL CASE IN MANHATTAN LAST&#10;10:47&#10;YEAR, AND THE JUDGMENT AGAINST&#10;10:49&#10;DONALD TRUMP BY THE COURT OF&#10;10:51&#10;INTERNATIONAL TRADE WILL NOW&#10;10:52&#10;TAKE ITS PLACE. AMONG THOSE&#10;10:54&#10;LEGAL CASES IN WHICH DONALD&#10;10:55&#10;TRUMP HAS LOST AND LOST&#10;10:58&#10;DECISIVELY ON EVERY SINGLE POINT&#10;11:01&#10;THAT DONALD TRUMP RAISED IN THE&#10;11:03&#10;COURT, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE&#10;11:06&#10;WORD THAT WAS SAID BY DONALD&#10;11:08&#10;TRUMP'S LAWYERS JUSTIFYING HIS&#10;11:10&#10;TARIFFS THAT WAS ACCEPTED BY A&#10;11:12&#10;SINGLE JUDGE ON THE COURT OF&#10;11:14&#10;INTERNATIONAL TRADE, INCLUDING&#10;11:16&#10;THE TRUMP APPOINTED JUDGE WHO&#10;11:18&#10;JOINED THIS UNANIMOUS OPINION.&#10;11:19&#10;AND SO TOMORROW, WHEN DONALD&#10;11:21&#10;TRUMP STANDS BEFORE A MICROPHONE&#10;11:22&#10;AND LIES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE" />

SCHIFF: TODAY, I WANT TO&#10;0:02&#10;TALK ABOUT THE ART OF THE DEAL,&#10;0:05&#10;BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN&#10;0:06&#10;BUSY MAKING DEALS, NOT HIS&#10;0:10&#10;PROMISED TRADE DEALS.&#10;0:11&#10;THOSE ARE HEAVY ON PROMISES, BUT&#10;0:13&#10;VERY LIGHT ON ACTUAL DEALS.&#10;0:16&#10;NOT ANY DEALS IN CONGRESS TO&#10;0:17&#10;LOWER COSTS FOR THE AMERICAN&#10;0:19&#10;PE&#10;0:20&#10;PEOPLE THAT COULD MAKE IT EASIER&#10;0:22&#10;TO AFFORD A HOME OR TO BUY&#10;0:24&#10;GROCERIES.&#10;0:25&#10;IN FACT, WITH FEWER CARGO SHIPS&#10;0:28&#10;ARRIVING IN OUR PORTS, AND OUR&#10;0:30&#10;CLOSEST ALLIES AND NEIGHBORS&#10;0:32&#10;BOYCOTTING AMERICAN GOODS, THE&#10;0:33&#10;PRESIDENT HAS DONE NOTHING BUT&#10;0:35&#10;MAKE YOUR LIFE MORE DIFFICULT.&#10;0:38&#10;MEDICAID IS UNDER ATTACK.&#10;0:40&#10;SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICES ARE&#10;0:42&#10;CLOSING BY THE DOZENS.&#10;0:44&#10;FOOD ASSISTANCE, RENTSAL&#10;0:46&#10;ASSISTANCE, ENERGY ASSISTANCE,&#10;0:48&#10;ALL ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.&#10;0:49&#10;THERE IS NO END TO THE&#10;0:52&#10;DESTRUCTION.&#10;0:53&#10;THE FIRST 114 DAYS OF THIS&#10;0:56&#10;ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN ONE BAD&#10;0:59&#10;DEAL AFTER ANOTHER FOR AMERICAN&#10;1:02&#10;FAMILIES.&#10;1:03&#10;BUT IF YOUR LAST NAME IS TRUMP?&#10;1:06&#10;THESE 114 DAYS HAVE BEEN JUST&#10;1:09&#10;ABOUT THE GREATEST DEAL OF ALL&#10;1:13&#10;TIME.&#10;1:13&#10;NEW AIRPLANES FROM YOUR FRIENDS&#10;1:14&#10;IN THE GULF.&#10;1:16&#10;NEW HOTEL DEALS.&#10;1:17&#10;NEW GOLF COURSES.&#10;1:19&#10;NEW MEME COUNCILS.&#10;1:20&#10;NEW TOWERS -- NEW MEME COINS,&#10;1:25&#10;NEW TOWERS.&#10;1:25&#10;YOU NAME IT, DONALD TRUMP AND&#10;1:27&#10;HIS FAMILY ARE CASHING IN.&#10;1:29&#10;SO TODAY, I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT&#10;1:32&#10;JUST A FEW OF THOSE DEALS FOR&#10;1:35&#10;THE TRUMP FAMILY, HOW HE'S&#10;1:37&#10;LINING HIS OWN POCKETS AND&#10;1:39&#10;FLEECING THE REST OF US IN THE&#10;1:41&#10;PROCESS.&#10;1:42&#10;HOW HIS FAMILY IS GETTING EVEN&#10;1:44&#10;RICHER, WHILE THE REST OF US ARE&#10;1:46&#10;TREATED LIKE SUCKERS.&#10;1:49&#10;TODAY, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE&#10;1:53&#10;TEN BEST DEALS FOR DONALD TRUMP&#10;1:56&#10;AND THE WORST DEALS FOR THE&#10;1:58&#10;AMERICAN PEOPLE.&#10;1:59&#10;HOW THE GRAFT IS ON FULL&#10;2:02&#10;DISPLAY, AND HOW YOU, THE&#10;2:04&#10;AMERICAN PEOPLE, ARE BEING LEFT&#10;Tesla Deal&#10;2:06&#10;HOLDING THE BAG.&#10;2:08&#10;YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK FAR FROM&#10;2:10&#10;THE WHITE HOUSE TO FIND SOME OF&#10;2:12&#10;THE MOST FLAGRANT EXAMPLES.&#10;2:14&#10;SO ENTERING IN AT NUMBER TEN OF&#10;2:17&#10;THE TOP TEN DEALS FOR DONALD&#10;2:19&#10;TRUMP AND THE WORST DEALS FOR&#10;2:22&#10;THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WE ONLY&#10;2:24&#10;NEED TO LOOK AT THE SOUTH LAWN.&#10;2:28&#10;WE ALL SAW THIS HAPPEN ON THE&#10;2:30&#10;WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS.&#10;2:31&#10;DONALD TRUMP AND ELON MUSK&#10;2:34&#10;TURNING THE PLACE INTO A TESLA&#10;2:37&#10;SHOW ROOM.&#10;2:38&#10;BUT WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED&#10;2:40&#10;IS WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE AND&#10;2:42&#10;AFTER THIS PHOTO WAS TAKEN.&#10;2:45&#10;JUST BEFORE TRUMP TURNED THE&#10;2:47&#10;WHITE HOUSE GROUNDS INTO A USED&#10;2:49&#10;CAR LOT, TESLA STOCK HAD BEEN IN&#10;2:52&#10;AN HISTORIC AND DISASTROUS&#10;2:56&#10;SLUMP.&#10;2:56&#10;WITH THEIR MARKET VALUE CUT IN&#10;2:58&#10;HALF SINCE DECEMBER, MUSK NEEDED&#10;3:01&#10;A JOLT TO HIS AILING COMPANY,&#10;3:04&#10;AND HE GOT IT.&#10;3:05&#10;WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED&#10;3:07&#10;WHETHER HIS SYMBOLIC PURCHASE OF&#10;3:08&#10;A TESLA AT THE WHITE HOUSE MIGHT&#10;3:11&#10;HELP THE COMPANY'S STOCK, TRUMP&#10;3:13&#10;SAID, I HOPE IT DOES.&#10;3:16&#10;BUT THAT WASN'T ALL.&#10;3:18&#10;BECAUSE THE BEST PART OF THE&#10;3:20&#10;DEAL FOR DONALD TRUMP TOOK PLACE&#10;3:22&#10;AFTER THE TESLAS HAD BEEN DRIVEN&#10;3:25&#10;AWAY AND THE CAMERAS HAD BEEN&#10;3:28&#10;PACKED UP.&#10;3:30&#10;BECAUSE NOT LONG AFTER THE&#10;3:32&#10;SPECIAL LIVE STREAM ON X, OR&#10;3:35&#10;TWITTER, HAD ENDED, SOMETHING&#10;3:37&#10;EVEN MORE IMPORTANT HAPPENED.&#10;3:39&#10;WITH TESLA SHARES ON THE&#10;3:41&#10;REBOUND, ELON MUSK PROMISED TO&#10;3:43&#10;PUMP $100 MILLION INTO DONALD&#10;3:48&#10;TRUMP'S POLITICAL OPERATION.&#10;3:50&#10;THAT'S RIGHT, DONALD TRUMP&#10;3:51&#10;RECEIVED ONE OF THE LARGEST&#10;3:53&#10;POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS IN&#10;3:56&#10;AMERICAN HISTORY, ALL FOR THE&#10;3:58&#10;PRICE OF ONE MEASLY TESLA MODEL&#10;4:02&#10;S AND THE USE OF THE WHITE HOUSE&#10;4:04&#10;AS A SALES ROOM.&#10;4:06&#10;A DAMN GOOD DEAL FOR DONALD&#10;4:10&#10;TRUMP, IF YOU ASK ME.&#10;4:13&#10;FOR YOU, THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER,&#10;4:16&#10;NOTHING AT ALL.&#10;4:18&#10;ZERO, ZILCH, ZADEH.&#10;4:20&#10;ALL YOU GOT -- ZERO, ZILCH,&#10;Trump Golfing&#10;4:27&#10;NADA.&#10;4:27&#10;FOR NUMBER NINE, WE ZOOM TO&#10;4:29&#10;MAR-A-LAGO WHERE YOU CAN&#10;4:31&#10;GENERALLY FIND THE PRESIDENT&#10;4:32&#10;GOLFING ON YOUR DIME AND LINING&#10;4:33&#10;HIS POCKETS IN THE PROCESS.&#10;4:35&#10;WE SAW THIS DURING THE FIRST&#10;4:37&#10;TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, BUT AT&#10;4:38&#10;THAT TIME HE WAS STILL FINISHING&#10;4:40&#10;THE FRONT NINE.&#10;4:42&#10;DURING HIS FIRST TERM, DONALD&#10;4:44&#10;TRUMP MADE AN ASTOUNDING 473&#10;4:48&#10;TRIPS TO HIS OWN GOLF COURSES&#10;4:50&#10;WHILE IN OFFICE.&#10;4:52&#10;BUT THIS TERM, HE SEEMS&#10;4:54&#10;DETERMINED TO GO FOR THE CLUB&#10;4:55&#10;RECORD.&#10;4:56&#10;IN JUST HIS FIRST 100 DAYS&#10;4:59&#10;DONALD TRUMP SPEND OVER A&#10;5:01&#10;QUARTER OF THOSE DAYS WHILE IN&#10;5:05&#10;OFFICE, A QUARTER OF THOSE DAYS&#10;5:06&#10;WHILE IN OFFICE, GOLFING.&#10;5:09&#10;WOULDN'T YOU LIKE A JOB LIKE&#10;5:11&#10;THAT?&#10;5:12&#10;WHERE YOU GET TO PLAY GOLF EVERY&#10;5:15&#10;FOUR DAYS?&#10;5:16&#10;PRETTY SWEET.&#10;5:19&#10;THROUGH MARKET COLLAPSES, DONALD&#10;5:21&#10;TRUMP IS OUT ON THE GOLF COURSE.&#10;5:23&#10;THROUGH NATIONAL CRISES, DONALD&#10;5:25&#10;TRUMP WAS OUT ON THE GOLF&#10;5:26&#10;COURSE.&#10;5:27&#10;ENJOYING THE GOLDEN AGE IN HIS&#10;5:29&#10;GOLDEN GOLF CARS, PLAYING THE&#10;5:31&#10;BACK NINE WHILE YOU STRUGGLE TO&#10;5:33&#10;PAY YOUR RENT OR MORTGAGE.&#10;5:34&#10;WHICH IS BAD IN AND OF ITSELF,&#10;5:37&#10;THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED&#10;5:38&#10;STATES IS SPENDING SO MUCH TIME&#10;5:41&#10;WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY&#10;5:43&#10;CHALLENGES FACES AMERICAN&#10;5:44&#10;FAMILIES, OUT ON THE GOLF&#10;5:45&#10;COURSE, BUT THAT'S NOT THE WORST&#10;5:46&#10;OF IT, BECAUSE GUESS WHO IS&#10;5:49&#10;PAYING FOR ALL THAT GOLF -- YOU&#10;5:51&#10;ARE!&#10;5:52&#10;YOU ARE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,&#10;5:55&#10;THE TAXPAYER.&#10;5:57&#10;THAT'S RIGHT, ALL THOSE DRIVES&#10;5:58&#10;AND CHIP SHOTS, ALL THOSE SLICES&#10;6:01&#10;AND THOSE HOOKS, ALL THE MISSED&#10;6:04&#10;PUTTS, YOU'RE

GOLFING&#10;6:18&#10;TRIMS.&#10;6:19&#10;THAT'S YOUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK,&#10;6:22&#10;LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AND IT'S&#10;6:22&#10;NOT JUST THE USE OF THESE&#10;6:24&#10;TAXPAYER FUNDS THAT'S A&#10;6:26&#10;TRAVESTY, IT'SHAT THESE&#10;6:29&#10;TAXPAYER DOLLARS GO TO BENEFIT&#10;6:31&#10;HIM DIRECTLY, HIS GOLF COURSES,&#10;6:35&#10;HIS HOTELS CHARGE THE U.S.&#10;6:39&#10;GOVERNMENT TO PAY

BEYOND THE LINE&#10;10:45&#10;OF SIGHT IN THE DISTANCE IS THE&#10;10:48&#10;SKYLINE OF DUBAI THAT WILL&#10;10:52&#10;LIKELY GET A NEW FEATURE, THE&#10;10:55&#10;TRUMP INTERNATIONAL HOTEL TOWER&#10;11:00&#10;DUBAI, AN 80-FLOOR BEHEM&#10;11:04&#10;OTSDZ -- BEHEMOTH, IT WILL&#10;11:10&#10;APARTMENTS THAT START AT&#10;11:13&#10;$2 MILLION AND PENTHOUSES THAT&#10;11:14&#10;WILL START AT TENS OF MILLIONS&#10;11:16&#10;OF DOLLARS.&#10;11:17&#10;EVEN BETTER, IF YOU CAN'T MAKE&#10;11:19&#10;THE TRUMP NEW CLUB HERE IN D.C.,&#10;11:21&#10;THERE WILL BE AN EXCLUSIVE&#10;11:25&#10;MEMBERS ONLY CLUB IN DUBAI, SAID&#10;11:29&#10;TO REDEFINE THE MEANING OF&#10;11:32&#10;EXCLUSIVE LUXURY, ALL&#10;11:34&#10;BENEFITING, THAT'S RIGHT, DONALD&#10;11:35&#10;TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY.&#10;11:38&#10;NOW THEIR VENTURES IN THE MIDDLE&#10;11:41&#10;EAST DON'T START OR STOP IN&#10;11:43&#10;DUBAI.&#10;11:43&#10;NUMBER FIVE OF THE BEST DEALS OF&#10;11:46&#10;THE TRUMP FAMILY OF HIS&#10;11:48&#10;PRESIDENCY, THEY'RE CASHING IN&#10;11:50&#10;THIS TIME IN QATAR.&#10;11:52&#10;COMING SOON TO DOHA, THE TRUMP&#10;11:56&#10;ADMINISTRATION GOLF COURSE.&#10;11:57&#10;THIS IS AN 18-HOLE COURSE, A&#10;12:01&#10;CLUBHOUSE, HIGH-END VILLAS WITH&#10;12:04&#10;BEACH ACCESS.&#10;12:07&#10;A $5.5 BILLION DEAL, BILLION&#10;12:09&#10;WITH A B, SET TO NET THE TRUMP&#10;12:11&#10;FAMILY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF&#10;12:14&#10;DOLLARS.&#10;12:15&#10;A DEAL THAT'S REPORTEDLY IN&#10;12:17&#10;PARTNERSHIP WITH QATARI D.R., A&#10;12:21&#10;COMPANY OWNED BY IN THIS CASE&#10;12:22&#10;THE QATARI GOVERNMENT ITSELF.&#10;12:26&#10;NOW, I'M SURE QATAR'S&#10;12:29&#10;MULTIBILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT&#10;12:30&#10;IN THE PERSONAL FINANCES OF THE&#10;12:32&#10;TRUMP FAMILY IS ENTIRELY&#10;12:37&#10;COINCIDENTAL.&#10;12:37&#10;I AM SURE IT IS NOT INTENDED TO&#10;12:40&#10;INFLUENCE U.S. POLICY TOWARDS&#10;12:43&#10;THE COUNTRY WHICH ALSO HOSTS&#10;12:45&#10;AL-JAZEERA IN ANY WAY.&#10;12:47&#10;I KNOW IT'S EASY IN ALL THE&#10;12:50&#10;TRUMP CORRUPTION AND SCHEMES TO&#10;12:51&#10;MISS THE FOREST FOR THE TREES,&#10;12:53&#10;BUT LET'S NOT FAIL TO APPRECIATE&#10;12:55&#10;JUST HOW UNPRECEDENTED THIS IS,&#10;12:58&#10;JUST HOW CORRUPT AND DANGEROUS&#10;13:00&#10;THIS IS.&#10;13:01&#10;THE PRESIDENT'S NAMESAKE COMPANY&#10;13:05&#10;IS DIRECTLY IN BUSINESS WITH A&#10;13:09&#10;FOREIGN GOVERNMENT AND THE MONEY&#10;13:11&#10;IS GOING INTO HIS POCKET -- NOT&#10;13:14&#10;THE TREASURY, NOT YOUR POCKET AS&#10;13:16&#10;THE TAXPAYER, IT'S GOING INTO&#10;13:18&#10;DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY'S&#10;Saudi Arabia&#10;13:22&#10;POCKET, HIS.&#10;13:23&#10;BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY GULF&#10;13:26&#10;NATION IN BUSINESS WITH THE&#10;13:27&#10;PRESIDENT AND HIS FAMILY.&#10;13:28&#10;NOT BY A LONG STRETCH.&#10;13:30&#10;THERE IS AS SAUDI ARABIA.&#10;13:32&#10;BECAUSE ENTERING IN AT NUMBER&#10;13:34&#10;FOUR IS THE NEWLY ANNOUNCED&#10;13:38&#10;TRUMP TOWER IN JETTA AND THEIR&#10;13:43&#10;TWO BRAND-NEW PROJECTS IN&#10;13:47&#10;RIYADH.&#10;13:47&#10;THESE WILL NET THE TRUMP FAMILY&#10;13:50&#10;MILLIONS AS WELL, AND THIS ISN'T&#10;13:51&#10;THE FIRST TIME THE TRUMP FAMILY&#10;13:53&#10;HAS CASHED IN WITH THE SAUDIS.&#10;13:57&#10;MONTHS AFTER TRUMP LEFT THE&#10;13:58&#10;OFFICE THE FIRST TIME JARED&#10;14:03&#10;KUSHNER FIRM RECEIVED A&#10;14:06&#10;$2 MILLION INVESTMENT FROM NONE&#10;14:07&#10;OTHER THAN THE SAUDI CROWN&#10;14:11&#10;PRINCE, IT WAS SO SHADY -- THEY&#10;14:16&#10;WERE OVERRULED BY HIGHER UPS IN&#10;14:19&#10;THE SAUDI ROYAL FAMILY AND THE&#10;14:22&#10;MONEY WEPT STRAIGHT INTO THE&#10;14:23&#10;TRUMP FAMILY'S ENTERPRISE,&#10;Elon Musk&#10;14:28&#10;$2 BILLION.&#10;14:29&#10;IT IS NOT JUST DONALD TRUMP AND&#10;14:30&#10;HIS FAMILY CASHING IN AT YOUR&#10;14:32&#10;EXPENSE.&#10;14:33&#10;THE WORLD'S RICHEST MAN IS USING&#10;14:36&#10;HIS ROLE TOO AS A SPECIAL&#10;14:41&#10;GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE TO CASH IN&#10;14:42&#10;AS WELL.&#10;14:43&#10;BECAUSE EVEN WHEN YOU'RE THE&#10;14:45&#10;WORLD'S RICHEST MAN, AS ELON&#10;14:46&#10;MUSK IS, ENOUGH IS NEVER ENOUGH.&#10;14:51&#10;ENTERING IN AT NUMBER THREE ARE&#10;14:56&#10;ELON MUSK'S SHADY STARLINK&#10;14:59&#10;DEALS.&#10;15:00&#10;ELON MUSK WHEN HE'S NOT TWEETING&#10;15:03&#10;OR FIRING ESSENTIAL GOVERNMENT&#10;15:06&#10;WORKERS IS STURNING STAR -- IS&#10;15:08&#10;IT TURNING STARLINK INTO A&#10;15:11&#10;GLOBAL POWER.&#10;15:12&#10;HOW?&#10;15:12&#10;BY USING HIS PROXIMITY TO TRUMP&#10;15:16&#10;TO HAVE A RAFT OF DEALS TO OTHER&#10;15:21&#10;NATIONS TO PURCHASE STARLINK&#10;15:27&#10;SATELLITE.&#10;15:27&#10;REMEMBER LOSETTO, DONALD TRUMP&#10;15:31&#10;SLAPPED TARIFFS ON THE COUNTRY,&#10;15:33&#10;IN HOPES OF A TRADE DEAL, THEY&#10;15:35&#10;CAME TO THE TABLE AND THAT MEANT&#10;15:37&#10;COMING TO ELON MUSK'S TABLE.&#10;15:39&#10;I WANT TO READ FROM A LEAKED&#10;15:42&#10;INTERNAL STATE DEPARTMENT MEMO.&#10;15:43&#10;QUOTE,INGAS THE GOVERNMENT OF&#10;15:47&#10;LASOTHO NEGOTIATES A TRADE DEAL&#10;15:48&#10;WITH THE UNITED STATES, IT HOPES&#10;15:51&#10;THAT LICENSING STARLINK&#10;15:54&#10;DEMONSTRATES GOOD WILL AND THE&#10;15:56&#10;INTENT TO WELCOME U.S. BUSINESS.&#10;15:59&#10;AS THE GOVERNMENT OF LASOTHO, IT&#10;16:05&#10;HOPES THAT LICENSING STARLINK&#10;16:08&#10;REPRESENTS GOODWILL AND AN&#10;16:10&#10;ATTEMPT TO WELCOME U.S.&#10;16:12&#10;BUSINESSES.&#10;16:12&#10;THIS IS FROM THE STATE&#10;16:14&#10;DEPARTMENT'S OWN CABLE IN BLACK&#10;16:16&#10;AND WHITE.&#10;16:16&#10;IT'S JUST PLAY TO PAY TO GET OUT&#10;16:19&#10;FROM UNDER THE TARIFFS THAT&#10;16:21&#10;TRUMP IMPOSED ON LASOTHO, THEY&#10;16:27&#10;WILL BUY ELON MUSK SATELLITE&#10;16:31&#10;SYSTEM.&#10;16:31&#10;PAY OFF THE TRUMP REGIME, YOU&#10;16:35&#10;WILL GET A DEAL.&#10;16:40&#10;ELON MUSK MET WITH MIRENDO BOTO.&#10;16:46&#10;THE MEETING WAS PRIVATE BUT THE&#10;16:48&#10;RESULTS WERE PUBLIC.&#10;16:49&#10;SHORTLY AFTER THE MEETING, INDIA&#10;16:53&#10;ANNOUNCED TWO STARLINK&#10;16:55&#10;DISTRIBUTION DEALS, MILLIONS&#10;16:57&#10;INTO MUSK'S POCKETS NEGOTIATED&#10;16:58&#10;STEPS AWAY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.&#10;17:01&#10;SINCE THEN -- SINCE THE&#10;17:03&#10;IMPOSITION OF THESE TARIFFS,&#10;17:05&#10;SINCE THE NEED OF OTHER&#10;17:06&#10;COUNTRIES TO COME IN AND&#10;17:08&#10;NEGOTIATE TARIFFS AWAY WITH THE&#10;17:10&#10;TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, ELON MUSK&#10;17:12&#10;HAS REACHED DEALS WITH SOMALIA,&#10;17:14&#10;THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE&#10;17:17&#10;CONGO, BANGLADESH, PAKISTAN AND&#10;17:21&#10;VIETNAM.&#10;17:21&#10;AND THAT'S JUST WHAT WE KNOW&#10;17:22&#10;ABOUT SO FAR.&#10;17:23&#10;BUT I PROMISE YOU THIS WILL NOT&#10;17:26&#10;BE THE END OF IT.&#10;17:28&#10;IT'S AMONG THE MOST OBVIOUS,&#10;17:30&#10;EGREGIOUS AND DANGEROUS ACTS OF&#10;17:32&#10;CORRUPTION IN AMERICAN HISTORY.&#10;17:36&#10;WANT OUT FROM UNDER A TARIFF,&#10;17:37&#10;MAKE A DEAL WITH ELON MUSK AND&#10;Air Force One&#10;17:41&#10;STARLINK AND THEY'RE BARELY&#10;17:42&#10;TRYING TO HIDE IT.&#10;17:44&#10;WHICH BRINGS US TO NUMBER TWO OF&#10;17:46&#10;THE TOMORROW TEN DEALS FOR&#10;17:48&#10;DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT, AND&#10;17:51&#10;IN THE TOP TEN DAYS, THE TOP TEN&#10;17:55&#10;WAYS THAT THE AMERICAN ARE&#10;17:56&#10;ENDING UP HOLDING THE BAG.&#10;17:58&#10;BECAUSE QATAR ISN'T JUST&#10;18:00&#10;INVESTING IN A NEW TRUMP TOWER&#10;18:02&#10;AT HOME.&#10;18:03&#10;THE QATARI GOVERNMENT IS ALSO&#10;18:06&#10;GIFTING THE PRESIDENT A NEWS AIR&#10;18:11&#10;FORCE ONE.&#10;18:13&#10;AN AIRCRAFT SO OPULENT THAT&#10;18:16&#10;THEY'RE CALLING IT A SKY PALACE,&#10;18:17&#10;A PALACE IN THE SKY.&#10;18:20&#10;A $400 MILLION GIFT FOR DONALD&#10;18:22&#10;TRUMP THAT TAXPAYERS WILL HAVE&#10;18:24&#10;TO PAY TO DEBUG.&#10;18:26&#10;YOU CAN IMAGINE ALL THE NATIONAL&#10;18:30&#10;SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF GETTING&#10;18:33&#10;AN AIRPLANE WITH ALL OF ITS&#10;18:36&#10;ELECTRONICS AND ALL OF THE&#10;18:39&#10;VENUES THAT COULD BE HID EN, YOU&#10;18:41&#10;CAN IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD COST&#10;18:44&#10;TO DEBUG.&#10;18:46&#10;IT WILL NEED TO BE UPGRADED TO&#10;18:48&#10;MEET THE STANDARDS OF AN AIR&#10;18:51&#10;FORCE ONE.&#10;18:52&#10;IT WILL COST TAXPAYERS A&#10;18:54&#10;FORTUNE.&#10;18:55&#10;AND THEIR PLAN, THE QATARI PLAN&#10;18:58&#10;IS TO GIVE THE PLANE TO THE&#10;19:01&#10;PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY BEFORE&#10;19:03&#10;DONALD TRUMP'S TERM ENDS.&#10;19:04&#10;THAT WAY THE PRESIDENT CAN KEEP&#10;19:07&#10;USING IT AS HE PLEASES.&#10;19:10&#10;THAT WAY DONALD TRUMP, IN&#10;19:11&#10;ADDITION TO HIS OWN PRIVATE&#10;19:12&#10;PLANE, IN ADDITION TO AIR FORCE&#10;19:15&#10;ONE, WHICH HE IS VERY UPSET WITH&#10;19:17&#10;BECAUSE IT'S A FEW DECADES-OLD&#10;19:19&#10;AND, YOU KNOW, IT JUST DOESN'T&#10;19:22&#10;HAVE THE AMENITIES THAT DONALD&#10;19:23&#10;TRUMP HAS COME TO EXPECT, HE&#10;19:25&#10;GETS TO KEEP THIS PALACE IN THE&#10;19:28&#10;SKY.&#10;19:28&#10;WHILE AMERICAN AIRPORTS ARE IN&#10;19:32&#10;CRISIS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS,&#10;19:37&#10;SHORTAGES, MASS BLACKOUTS AND&#10;19:39&#10;DELAYS, SURGING PRICES FOR YOU&#10;19:41&#10;THE PASSENGER, THIS IS WHAT THE&#10;19:42&#10;PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES&#10;19:44&#10;IS FOCUSED ON.&#10;19:44&#10;NOT BRINGING DOWN AIR FAIR FOR&#10;19:47&#10;YOU, NOT DEALING WITH THE&#10;19:50&#10;LUGGAGE FEES AND THE HIDDEN&#10;19:52&#10;COSTS WHEN YOU BUY TICKETS,&#10;19:53&#10;THAT'S NOT WHAT THE PRESIDENT OF&#10;19:56&#10;THE UNITED STATES CARES ABOUT,&#10;19:58&#10;THIS IS WHAT HE CARES ABOUT, HE&#10;20:00&#10;CARES ABOUT GETTING A&#10;20:03&#10;$400 MILLION GIFT FROM QATARI,&#10;20:06&#10;WHICH HE CALLS A NICE GESTURE.&#10;20:09&#10;GIVING A NEW TERM TO NICE&#10;20:11&#10;GESTURE.&#10;20:12&#10;I THINK OF NICE GESTURE AS&#10;20:15&#10;SOMEONE PICKING UP THE TAB AT&#10;20:21&#10;CHIPOLTE, BUT FOR DONALD TRUMP&#10;20:22&#10;IT IS A $400 MILLION PALACE IN&#10;20:25&#10;THE SKY THAT HE GETS COULD&#10;20:28&#10;KEEP -- GETS TO KEEP OR MAKE USE&#10;20:30&#10;OF WHEN HE IS NO LONGER&#10;20:33&#10;PRESIDENT.&#10;20:34&#10;NO MATTER THAT IT SURPASSES&#10;20:42&#10;EMOLUMENTS, BUT THE FACT IS THE&#10;20:45&#10;QATARIS ARE NOT STUPID.&#10;20:47&#10;THEY'RE GOING TO WANT SOMETHING&#10;20:49&#10;FOR THAT $400 MILLION PLANE.&#10;20:53&#10;THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A FREE&#10;20:55&#10;LUNCH, THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS&#10;20:56&#10;A FREE $400 MILLION PLANE.&#10;20:59&#10;AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE&#10;21:01&#10;QATARIS ARE GOING TO WANT IS&#10;21:04&#10;FAVORABLE U.S. POLICIES TOWARDS&#10;21:06&#10;QATAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST.&#10;21:08&#10;THEY DIDN'T WANT SOMETHING FOR&#10;21:09&#10;THAT PLANE, MAYBE THEY WOULD&#10;21:10&#10;HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU OR SOMEBODY&#10;21:14&#10;ELSE NOT NAMED TRUMP.&#10;21:17&#10;THIS IS, IN FACT, WHY WE HAVE A&#10;21:20&#10;CLAUSE IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT&#10;21:22&#10;PROHIBITS GIFTS LIKE THIS&#10;21:23&#10;BECAUSE WE WANT TO KNOW THE&#10;21:26&#10;PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES&#10;21:26&#10;IS ACTING ON OUR BEHALF, ON OUR&#10;21:29&#10;COUNTRY'S BEHALF, ON OUR&#10;21:32&#10;NATIONAL SECURITY BEHALF, NOT&#10;21:33&#10;SOME FOREIGN INTEREST THAT GAVE&#10;21:35&#10;THEM A $400 MILLION GIFT.&#10;21:37&#10;IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE TRUMP&#10;21:39&#10;WON'T RETURN THE FAVOR WHEN THE&#10;21:40&#10;TIME COMES, WHEN THE QATARIS&#10;21:42&#10;WANT SOMETHING THAT MAY OR MAY&#10;21:43&#10;NOT BE IN OUR NATIONAL INTEREST,&#10;21:46&#10;IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE TRUL WON'T&#10;21:48&#10;RETURN THE FAVOR WHEN THAT TIME&#10;21:50&#10;COMES, AND I'VE GOT A 747 PALACE&#10;Memecoin&#10;21:53&#10;IN THE SKY THAT I'D LIKE TO SELL&#10;21:54&#10;YOU.&#10;22:01&#10;BUT THAT'S NOT THE MOST CORRUPT.&#10;22:05&#10;COMING IN AT NUMBER ONE OF THE&#10;22:06&#10;TOP TEN BEST DEALS FOR DONALD&#10;22:10&#10;TRUMP AND THE WORST DEALS IS&#10;22:13&#10;TRUMP'S CRYPTO SCHEME.&#10;22:16&#10;YOU HEARD ABOUT THE MEME COIN.&#10;22:19&#10;THIS IS THE LOGO OF THE MEME&#10;22:22&#10;COIN.&#10;22:22&#10;THE PRESIDENT'S MOST BRAZEN&#10;22:25&#10;CASHING IN, HAS ALREADY MADE HIS&#10;22:28&#10;FAMILY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS&#10;22:29&#10;BETWEEN ITS SOARING VALUES AND&#10;22:31&#10;THE TRADING FEES.&#10;22:32&#10;THIS MEME COIN HAS GONE UP AND&#10;22:34&#10;DOWN IN VALUE, BUT THE THING IS,&#10;22:36&#10;EVERY TIME IS GETS TRADED, EVERY&#10;22:38&#10;TIME IT'S BOUGHT OR SOLD, THIS&#10;22:40&#10;GUY GETS CUT.&#10;22:41&#10;HE GETS THE FEES, ESTIMATED&#10;22:43&#10;ALREADY AT THE VALUE OF HUNDREDS&#10;22:45&#10;OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.&#10;22:47&#10;IT'S LIKE POSTING HIS VENMO&#10;22:50&#10;ACCOUNT ONLINE, INVITING&#10;22:51&#10;PERSONAL MONETARY TRIBUTES FROM&#10;22:55&#10;FOREIGN POWERS, FOREIGN&#10;22:56&#10;INVESTORS OR ANYONE ELSE WHO IS&#10;22:58&#10;WILLING TO PAY UP.&#10;23:00&#10;YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE PRIVATE&#10;23:01&#10;DINNER THAT THEY'RE OFFERING&#10;23:02&#10;ASSOCIATED WITH THIS MEME COIN.&#10;23:04&#10;THE TOP 220 MEME COIN OWNERS,&#10;23:07&#10;MANY OF WHOM ARE IMPORTANT&#10;23:08&#10;INVESTORS INVITED TO A PRIVATE&#10;23:10&#10;DINNER WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE&#10;23:12&#10;UNITED STATES.&#10;23:13&#10;BUSINESSES ARE BUYING AND&#10;23:15&#10;JOCKEYING TO BE ONE OF THE&#10;23:17&#10;FAVORED FEW WHO ALSO GET A&#10;23:18&#10;PRIVATE AUDIENCE WITH HIM IF&#10;23:20&#10;THEY'RE WILLING TO BUY MILLIONS&#10;23:22&#10;OF MEME COINS, NOT TO MENTION

IF YOU HAVE&#10;0:03&#10;NOT BEEN COUNTING, YOU'RE IN&#10;0:04&#10;LUCK, BECAUSE I HAVE. IT IS DAY&#10;0:08&#10;129 OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.&#10;0:09&#10;AND THERE.&#10;0:10&#10;&gt;&gt; IS MAJOR NEWS TONIGHT.&#10;0:11&#10;&gt;&gt; JUST HOURS AGO, A.&#10;0:13&#10;&gt;&gt; FEDERAL COURT.&#10;0:14&#10;&gt;&gt; STRUCK DOWN DONALD TRUMP'S&#10;0:16&#10;RECIPROCAL TARIFFS. THOSE ARE&#10;0:17&#10;THE ONES HE DECLARED BACK ON&#10;0:19&#10;APRIL 2ND, HIS SO-CALLED&#10;0:21&#10;LIBERATION DAY. THE COURT SAID&#10;0:22&#10;HIS EFFORT TO JUSTIFY THEM WITH&#10;0:24&#10;BROAD CLAIMS OF NATIONAL&#10;0:26&#10;EMERGENCIES EXCEEDED HIS LEGAL&#10;0:28&#10;AUTHORITY. CAN YOU.&#10;0:29&#10;&gt;&gt; BELIEVE IT?&#10;0:30&#10;&gt;&gt; THE RULING CAUSED STOCK&#10;0:31&#10;FUTURES TO JUMP. I'M GOING TO&#10;0:33&#10;SAY THIS TO YOU TWICE. THE TRUMP&#10;0:35&#10;POLICY THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE GOT&#10;0:37&#10;STRUCK DOWN BY THE COURTS. AND&#10;0:38&#10;WHAT DID THE MARKETS DO? JUMPED.&#10;0:40&#10;THEY WERE EXCITED ABOUT IT. THIS&#10;0:42&#10;IS OBVIOUSLY A MAJOR. BLOW TO&#10;0:44&#10;TRUMP'S ECONOMIC AGENDA AMID THE&#10;0:46&#10;ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY FILED&#10;0:48&#10;AN APPEAL. TRUMP IS ALSO FACING&#10;0:50&#10;PUSHBACK FROM HIS NUMBER ONE&#10;0:52&#10;SUPPORTER. YOU KNOW HIM ELON&#10;0:54&#10;MUSK. HE HAS PRETTY MUCH BEEN&#10;0:55&#10;OPPOSED TO THOSE VERY TARIFFS.&#10;0:57&#10;AND NOW IT APPEARS HE IS OPPOSED&#10;1:00&#10;TO TRUMP'S BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL.&#10;1:01&#10;AND THIS COULD BE DRIVING A&#10;1:03&#10;WEDGE BETWEEN THE TWO MEN. MUSK&#10;1:04&#10;HAS COMPLAINED THAT THE BUDGET&#10;1:06&#10;PROPOSAL WOULD UNDERMINE DOJ'S.&#10;1:08&#10;&gt;&gt; WORK.&#10;1:08&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT HIS COST CUTTING TEAM&#10;1:10&#10;HAS BEEN TREATED LIKE WASHINGTON&#10;1:12&#10;DC'S. AND I'M QUOTING HIM&#10;1:13&#10;WHIPPING BOY AND HE IS NOT TOO&#10;1:15&#10;HAPPY ABOUT THE SPENDING&#10;1:16&#10;INCREASES EITHER. BUT EARLIER&#10;1:18&#10;TODAY, WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS&#10;1:19&#10;ASKED ABOUT MUSK'S CRITICISM, HE&#10;1:22&#10;DIDN'T COMPLETELY DISAGREE.&#10;1:23&#10;&gt;&gt; WATCH THIS.&#10;1:24&#10;&gt;&gt; WE WILL BE NEGOTIATING THAT&#10;1:26&#10;BILL, AND I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT&#10;1:28&#10;CERTAIN. ASPECTS OF IT, BUT I'M&#10;1:30&#10;THRILLED.&#10;1:31&#10;&gt;&gt; BY OTHER ASPECTS OF IT.&#10;1:32&#10;THAT'S THE WAY THEY GO. IT'S&#10;1:33&#10;VERY BIG. IT'S THE BIG BEAUTIFUL&#10;1:36&#10;BILL.&#10;1:36&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT THE BEAUTIFUL IS BECAUSE.&#10;1:37&#10;&gt;&gt; OF ALL OF THE THINGS. WE&#10;1:39&#10;HAVE.&#10;1:40&#10;&gt;&gt; THE BIGGEST THING BEING.&#10;1:41&#10;&gt;&gt; I WOULD SAY, THE. LEVEL OF&#10;1:44&#10;TAX CUTTING THAT WE'RE GOING TO&#10;1:45&#10;BE DOING.&#10;1:46&#10;&gt;&gt; HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PAY.&#10;1:48&#10;&gt;&gt; FOR IT? HOUSE SPEAKER MIKE&#10;1:49&#10;JOHNSON, ON THE OTHER HAND,&#10;1:50&#10;DEFENDED THE BILL, WRITING THIS&#10;1:52&#10;IN PART, QUOTE, THE HOUSE MADE&#10;1:54&#10;SURE TO BUILD ON DOJ'S SUCCESS.&#10;1:56&#10;DOJ'S FOUND SAVINGS IN&#10;1:57&#10;DISCRETIONARY SPENDING, SUCH AS&#10;1:58&#10;FUNDING AGENCIES. WHILE OUR BILL&#10;2:01&#10;SECURED OVER $1.6 TRILLION IN&#10;2:05&#10;SAVINGS IN MANDATORY SPENDING&#10;2:06&#10;SUCH AS MEDICAID, BOTH A&#10;2:08&#10;HISTORIC AND TAKE HUGE STEPS&#10;2:10&#10;TOWARDS ADDRESSING OUR DEBT AND&#10;2:11&#10;DEFICIT. HERE'S AN IMPORTANT&#10;2:13&#10;REMINDER THAT'S NOT TRUE. THE&#10;2:15&#10;PENN WHARTON BUDGET MODEL&#10;2:17&#10;ESTIMATES THE HOUSE VERSION OF&#10;2:18&#10;THIS BILL. ARE YOU LISTENING TO&#10;2:20&#10;ME? WOULD INCREASE THE DEFICIT&#10;2:22&#10;BY $3.3 TRILLION OVER TEN YEARS.&#10;2:26&#10;ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET SMARTER&#10;2:28&#10;WITH OUR NIGHTCAP PANEL TONIGHT.&#10;2:29&#10;DAVID GURA IS HERE, BLOOMBERG&#10;2:31&#10;CORRESPONDENT AND HOST OF THE&#10;2:32&#10;BIG TAKE PODCAST. FORMER&#10;2:34&#10;DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN MAX ROSE&#10;2:35&#10;OF NEW YORK. HE'S A SENIOR&#10;2:37&#10;ADVISER TO VOTEVETS. AND MY DEAR&#10;2:39&#10;FRIEND MOLLY JONG-FAST, SPECIAL&#10;2:40&#10;CORRESPONDENT FOR VANITY FAIR&#10;2:41&#10;AND MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR, AND A NEW&#10;2:44&#10;AUTHOR OF A BOOK THAT I JUST&#10;2:46&#10;READ WHILE I WAS OUT. AND I URGE&#10;2:48&#10;YOU TO READ IT NOT BECAUSE SHE'S&#10;2:50&#10;MY FRIEND, NOT BECAUSE I ADORE&#10;2:51&#10;HER, BECAUSE THE BOOK IS&#10;2:53&#10;INCREDIBLE. HOW TO LOSE YOUR&#10;2:54&#10;MOTHER A DAUGHTER'S MEMOIR. IT&#10;2:55&#10;IS OUT NEXT WEEK. ALL RIGHT,&#10;2:59&#10;DAVID, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE&#10;3:01&#10;COURT, THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE&#10;3:03&#10;RULING. WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON&#10;3:04&#10;THIS?&#10;3:05&#10;&gt;&gt; WELL, WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.&#10;3:07&#10;&gt;&gt; HERE WITH THIS APPEAL.&#10;3:07&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT I.&#10;3:09&#10;&gt;&gt; FOLLOWED.&#10;3:09&#10;&gt;&gt; THE ARGUMENTS AS THEY WERE&#10;3:10&#10;MADE A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.&#10;3:12&#10;&gt;&gt; AND AGAIN. AS YOU AS.&#10;3:14&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU ARTICULATED.&#10;3:14&#10;&gt;&gt; THE GRIEVANCE HERE BY.&#10;3:15&#10;&gt;&gt; VERY INTERESTING CONSORTIUM&#10;3:17&#10;OF.&#10;3:17&#10;&gt;&gt; 14 DEMOCRATIC.&#10;3:18&#10;&gt;&gt; STATES AND A GROUP OF SMALL&#10;3:19&#10;BUSINESSES, KIND.&#10;3:20&#10;&gt;&gt; OF HELMED BY A CONSERVATIVE&#10;3:22&#10;GROUP, WAS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS&#10;3:23&#10;USING MORE POWERS THAN HE'S&#10;3:24&#10;ALLOTTED TO DO ALL OF THIS. HE'S&#10;3:25&#10;BEEN RELYING ON THIS LAW FROM&#10;3:27&#10;THE 1970S TO PUT THESE TARIFFS&#10;3:29&#10;IN PLACE. AND THEY'VE SAID&#10;3:30&#10;EFFECTIVELY, HE CAN'T DO THAT.&#10;3:31&#10;AND THE ARGUMENT THAT STATES&#10;3:33&#10;HAVE MADE IS HE'S PUTTING IN&#10;3:33&#10;PLACE A EFFECTIVELY A TAX ON&#10;3:36&#10;THOSE, THOSE STATES. SO THAT WAS&#10;3:37&#10;SOMETHING THIS COURT WAS&#10;3:38&#10;SYMPATHETIC TO. YOU TALK ABOUT&#10;3:39&#10;THE MARKET REACTION. I THINK&#10;3:41&#10;THAT INFUSES INTO THIS SOME&#10;3:42&#10;SEMBLANCE OF CERTAINTY ABOUT HIS&#10;3:43&#10;POLICY. WHAT WE'VE LIVED THROUGH&#10;3:44&#10;OVER THESE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS&#10;3:46&#10;IS HIM GOING BACK AND FORTH, AS&#10;3:47&#10;YOU KNOW, ON WHAT THE TARIFFS&#10;3:49&#10;ARE GOING TO BE, WHAT THEY'RE&#10;3:50&#10;NOT GOING TO BE. THIS DOESN'T&#10;3:52&#10;AFFECT ALL OF THE ONES THAT HE'S&#10;3:54&#10;PUT IN PLACE. IT AFFECTS THE&#10;3:55&#10;KIND OF BROAD BASED ONES, THE&#10;3:57&#10;RECIPROCAL ONES AS WELL. I THINK&#10;3:58&#10;THAT MARKETS ARE REACTING TO&#10;3:59&#10;ANOTHER BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT&#10;4:01&#10;INSTITUTION PUSHING BACK ON&#10;4:01&#10;SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT'S DOING&#10;4:02&#10;HERE. BUT WHAT I WANT TO STRESS&#10;4:05&#10;HERE IS FUNDAMENTALLY, I'VE SAID&#10;4:06&#10;THIS ALL ALONG, CONGRESS COULD&#10;4:06&#10;PLAY A BIG ROLE HERE DOING THIS.&#10;4:09&#10;SO WE LOOK AT THE COURTS DOING&#10;4:10&#10;ALL OF THIS. HISTORICALLY, IT&#10;4:11&#10;HAS BEEN THE ROLE OF CONGRESS TO&#10;4:13&#10;DETERMINE WHAT TARIFF POLICY,&#10;4:14&#10;WHAT TRADE POLICY IS. HERE WE&#10;4:16&#10;SEE THE COURTS KIND OF STEPPING&#10;4:17&#10;UP. BUT BUT FUNDAMENTALLY AND&#10;4:18&#10;HISTORICALLY, IT'S SOMETHING&#10;4:19&#10;THAT CONGRESS.&#10;4:20&#10;&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. BUT STAY WITH ME&#10;4:22&#10;FOR A SECOND, MAX. COULD THIS BE&#10;4:23&#10;THE PRESIDENT'S OFF RAMP? RIGHT.&#10;4:24&#10;HE'S ARGUED FOR YEARS AND YEARS&#10;4:26&#10;AND YEARS TARIFFS, TARIFFS,&#10;4:27&#10;TARIFFS. BUT HE KNOWS THESE&#10;4:28&#10;TARIFFS ARE CRUSHING THE&#10;4:30&#10;MARKETS. HE KNOWS THESE TARIFFS&#10;4:32&#10;ARE CRUSHING BUSINESS. RIGHT.&#10;4:33&#10;WHEN THIS RULING HAPPENED A&#10;4:35&#10;SOURCE CALLED ME AND SAID SCOTT&#10;4:37&#10;BESSENT IS SOMEWHERE QUIETLY&#10;4:40&#10;CRYING TEARS.&#10;4:40&#10;&gt;&gt; OF JOY.&#10;4:42&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.&#10;4:42&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, THANK.&#10;4:44&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU.&#10;4:44&#10;&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.&#10;4:45&#10;&gt;&gt; COULD THIS BE EVEN THOUGH&#10;4:46&#10;EVEN THOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION&#10;4:48&#10;IS APPEALING IT, COULD THIS BE&#10;4:48&#10;TRUMP'S ELEGANT OFF RAMP THAT HE&#10;4:50&#10;COULD SAY, I WANT TO DO IMPOSE&#10;4:52&#10;THE TARIFFS? THIS IS WHAT I&#10;4:54&#10;THINK WE SHOULD DO. BUT THE&#10;4:55&#10;COURT STOPPED ME. AND IN THE END&#10;4:57&#10;MARKETS GO UP, BUSINESSES LIKE&#10;4:58&#10;IT. THAT'S WHAT TRUMP ACTUALLY&#10;5:00&#10;LOVES. WELL I.&#10;5:00&#10;&gt;&gt; WOULD SAY HIS.&#10;5:01&#10;&gt;&gt; ELEGANT OFF.&#10;5:02&#10;&gt;&gt; RAMP WOULD PROBABLY BE SOME&#10;5:03&#10;TYPE OF PHARMACEUTICAL COCKTAIL&#10;5:04&#10;TO ADDRESS HIS UNPRECEDENTED&#10;5:06&#10;LEVEL OF CRAZINESS. THEY'RE&#10;5:08&#10;GOING TO APPEAL THIS.&#10;5:09&#10;&gt;&gt; AND TIME AND AGAIN, WE'VE.&#10;5:11&#10;&gt;&gt; SEEN THAT THE SUPREME COURT&#10;5:12&#10;IS A FULLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY NOW&#10;5:14&#10;OF EXTREMIST MAGA ISM. SO I&#10;5:16&#10;DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S AN OFF&#10;5:18&#10;RAMP, POLITICALLY SPEAKING, TO&#10;5:20&#10;THE EXTRAORDINARILY LEVEL OF&#10;5:23&#10;ECONOMIC CHAOS THAT THIS&#10;5:25&#10;ADMINISTRATION AND THIS ONE MAN.&#10;5:26&#10;&gt;&gt; HAS CATALYZED.&#10;5:28&#10;&gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE&#10;5:29&#10;SWING REPUBLICAN DISTRICTS THAT&#10;5:31&#10;ARE HELD IN SUBURBAN AREAS.&#10;5:33&#10;&gt;&gt; THROUGHOUT.&#10;5:34&#10;&gt;&gt; THE COUNTRY, IT'S THAT LEVEL&#10;5:35&#10;OF CHAOS THAT THEY ACTUALLY&#10;5:36&#10;DETEST MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.&#10;5:38&#10;SO I THINK THIS IS STICKING, AND&#10;5:40&#10;I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY OFF&#10;5:42&#10;RAMP TO IT. OKAY. BUT MOLLY, I'M&#10;5:43&#10;COMING TO YOU IN A SECOND. BUT&#10;5:45&#10;DAVID I WANT TO COME BACK. THESE&#10;5:47&#10;TARIFFS THE ARGUMENT WAS THESE&#10;5:48&#10;TARIFFS WERE GOING TO PAY FOR&#10;5:50&#10;ALL SORTS OF STUFF. THEY WERE&#10;5:52&#10;GOING TO BRING IN BILLIONS AND&#10;5:53&#10;BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SO IF WE&#10;5:54&#10;DON'T IMPLEMENT THE TARIFFS,&#10;5:55&#10;WHETHER IT'S THE COURT'S&#10;5:57&#10;DECISION OR THE PRESIDENT BACKS&#10;5:58&#10;OFF, WHERE DOES THE MONEY COME&#10;6:00&#10;TO PAY FOR THE BIG BEAUTIFUL&#10;6:03&#10;BILL?&#10;6:03&#10;&gt;&gt; I HAVE NO GOOD ANSWER FOR&#10;6:05&#10;THAT, OTHER THAN THE FACT IT'S&#10;6:07&#10;GOING TO ADD TO THE DEBT. NO,&#10;6:09&#10;BUT.&#10;6:09&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT.&#10;6:10&#10;&gt;&gt; HE IS COUNTING ON THAT. AND&#10;6:11&#10;IT GETS TO THE KIND OF THE HEART&#10;6:13&#10;OF THE MATTER WHEN IT COMES TO&#10;6:14&#10;THIS TARIFF POLICY. THAT'S BEEN&#10;6:16&#10;ONE MOTIVATING FACTOR THAT THE&#10;6:18&#10;PRESIDENT HAS CITED. ANOTHER HAS&#10;6:19&#10;BEEN TO KIND OF PENALIZE OTHER&#10;6:20&#10;COUNTRIES, TO HOLD THEM TO&#10;6:21&#10;ACCOUNT FOR ANY MATTER OF POLICY&#10;6:23&#10;DECISIONS THEY'VE MADE. BUT&#10;6:24&#10;YOU'RE RIGHT TO POINT OUT THE&#10;6:25&#10;FACT THAT THE ARGUMENT THAT HE&#10;6:26&#10;MADE THE REPUBLICANS IN THE&#10;6:28&#10;HOUSE MADE ALL ALONG WAS, THIS&#10;6:30&#10;IS GOING TO BE A BIG DRIVER OF&#10;6:31&#10;MONEY COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY.&#10;6:33&#10;THEY CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THAT&#10;6:34&#10;IN THIS KIND OF FANTASTIC WAY,&#10;6:36&#10;CITING ALL THE BILLIONS OF&#10;6:37&#10;DOLLARS THAT HAVE COME IN THUS&#10;6:38&#10;FAR. IT HASN'T. AND I THINK THAT&#10;6:40&#10;THAT'S A HUGE X FACTOR AND&#10;6:42&#10;HUGELY COMPLICATES WHERE THIS&#10;6:43&#10;BILL GOES NOW WHEN IT GOES TO&#10;6:44&#10;THE SENATE.&#10;6:45&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT YOU HEARD IN THAT&#10;6:46&#10;SOUNDBITE RIGHT THERE WHEN TRUMP&#10;6:48&#10;SAID THERE'S THINGS IN THE BILL&#10;6:49&#10;I DON'T LIKE, BUT WHAT I LOVE&#10;6:51&#10;ARE THE TAX CUTS, TAX CUTS, TAX&#10;6:52&#10;CUTS. IF HE'S NOT BRINGING IN&#10;6:55&#10;BILLIONS FROM THE TARIFFS, IF&#10;6:55&#10;DOGE DIDN'T CUT TRILLIONS, WHICH&#10;6:57&#10;THE PLAN WAS TO CUT 2 TRILLION,&#10;6:58&#10;THEN HOW DO THESE TAX CUTS GET&#10;7:00&#10;PAID FOR? WELL.&#10;7:01&#10;&gt;&gt; IT'S A.&#10;7:01&#10;&gt;&gt; VERY GOOD QUESTION.&#10;7:03&#10;&gt;&gt; BUT THE OTHER THING ABOUT&#10;7:05&#10;THIS BILL, THE BIG BEAUTIFUL&#10;7:06&#10;BILL, IS THIS.&#10;7:06&#10;&gt;&gt; IS THE. PUREST DISTILLATION.&#10;7:07&#10;WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A DECISION.&#10;7:09&#10;YES, WE'RE DONE CALLING IT OKAY.&#10;7:10&#10;WE'RE OFFICIALLY DONE CALLING IT&#10;7:12&#10;THAT.&#10;7:12&#10;&gt;&gt; THE IT IS THE PUREST.&#10;7:13&#10;&gt;&gt; DISTILLATION OF.&#10;7:14&#10;&gt;&gt; MAGA, RIGHT? IT IS.&#10;7:15&#10;&gt;&gt; EVERYTHING TRUMP.&#10;7:16&#10;&gt;&gt; RAN ON. THEY HAVE PUT&#10;7:18&#10;TOGETHER A BILL. AND MIKE&#10;7:20&#10;JOHNSON SERVES AT THE PLEASURE&#10;7:21&#10;OF DONALD TRUMP. SO THE IDEA&#10;7:23&#10;THAT TRUMP DOESN'T LIKE THINGS&#10;7:24&#10;IN THIS.&#10;7:25&#10;&gt;&gt; HE WHIPPED THE VOTE. WHAT&#10;7:26&#10;DOESN'T.&#10;7:27&#10;&gt;&gt; HE LIKE?&#10;7:27&#10;&gt;&gt; HE SET THIS UP. AND THE OTHER&#10;7:29&#10;THING IS I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS&#10;7:31&#10;A BILL.&#10;7:33&#10;&gt;&gt; THAT BOTH GROWS.&#10;7:33&#10;&gt;&gt; THE DEFICIT.&#10;7:34&#10;&gt;&gt; CUTS FOOD.&#10;7:34&#10;&gt;&gt; STAMPS FOR CHILDREN. RIGHT.&#10;7:36&#10;THERE ARE SOME STATES. THERE ARE&#10;7:38&#10;THREE STATES WHERE CHILDREN ARE&#10;7:41&#10;25% OF ALL KIDS ON FOOD STAMPS&#10;7:43&#10;WILL BE AFFECTED. RIGHT. IT ALSO&#10;7:45&#10;CUTS MEDICAID. I MEAN, IT IS&#10;7:47&#10;LIKE THIS. IF IT IF IT IS&#10;7:49&#10;ENACTED IN.&#10;7:50&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS FORM.&#10;7:51&#10;&gt;&gt; IT WILL BE A SEISMIC CHANGE&#10;7:53&#10;TO THE WAY WE LIVE AND THE&#10;7:55&#10;SERVICES WE GET FROM OUR&#10;7:56&#10;GOVERNMENT.&#10;7:57&#10;&gt;&gt; THEN HOW DO REPUBLICANS WIN?&#10;7:58&#10;LET'S SAY THEY GET THIS BILL&#10;8:00&#10;PASSED AND IT'S IMPLEMENTED. HOW&#10;8:02&#10;DO THEY WIN IN THE MIDTERMS? HOW&#10;8:04&#10;DO THEY WIN IN THE WHITE HOUSE&#10;8:06&#10;NEXT TIME AROUND? GIVEN WHAT'S&#10;8:07&#10;IN THIS BILL? IF EVERYONE VOTING&#10;8:08&#10;OWNS A PRIVATE PRISON, WELL THEN&#10;8:10&#10;GUESS WHAT? REPUBLICANS ARE&#10;8:11&#10;GOING TO WIN FOREVER. BUT WITH&#10;8:13&#10;THE EXCEPTION OF THAT FACTION,&#10;8:14&#10;WHO DOES THIS BILL SERVE? IT&#10;8:17&#10;DOESN'T SERVE THE MAJORITY OF&#10;8:20&#10;AMERICANS. SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING&#10;8:21&#10;TO SEE REPUBLICANS VERY QUICKLY&#10;8:23&#10;DO IS START TALKING ABOUT HOW&#10;8:24&#10;THEY'RE NOT WOKE. REMEMBER THAT&#10;8:27&#10;ARGUMENT. AND IT'S NOT ENOUGH,&#10;8:29&#10;BUT IT'S ON THE IT'S IMPORTANT&#10;8:30&#10;THAT DEMOCRATS DON'T LOSE. SO&#10;8:33&#10;WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT? FIRST OF&#10;8:35&#10;ALL, THEY HAVE TO STOP STEPPING&#10;8:37&#10;ALL OVER CULTURAL THIRD. RAILS&#10;8:39&#10;ALMOST INTENTIONALLY, AS IF&#10;8:41&#10;THEY'RE TRYING TO LOSE&#10;8:42&#10;ELECTIONS. BUT SECONDLY, AND YOU&#10;8:43&#10;SEE THEM DOING THIS RIGHT NOW,&#10;8:45&#10;WHO'S THEY, REPUBLICANS OR&#10;8:47&#10;DEMOCRATS? DEMOCRATS. ALL RIGHT.&#10;8:48&#10;SEE THEM ELEVATING INCREDIBLY&#10;8:51&#10;STRONG CANDIDATES ACROSS THE&#10;8:53&#10;COUNTRY. IT LOOKS LIKE 2018 ALL&#10;8:56&#10;OVER AGAIN. MANY OF THEM ARE&#10;8:58&#10;VETERANS. MANY OF THEM HAVE&#10;8:59&#10;INCREDIBLE PUBLIC SERVICE&#10;9:01&#10;RECORDS EVERYWHERE FROM, YOU&#10;9:04&#10;KNOW, REBECCA BENNETT IN IN NEW&#10;9:06&#10;JERSEY, JOANNA MENDOZA IN THE&#10;9:08&#10;SOUTHWEST. I MEAN, IT'S&#10;9:10&#10;EXTRAORDINARY THE CANDIDATES&#10;9:10&#10;THAT WE SEE RIGHT NOW, AND&#10;9:12&#10;THAT'S HOW THE DEMOCRATS ARE&#10;9:14&#10;GOING TO WIN. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS&#10;9:16&#10;THAT. REPUBLICANS ARE OUT OF&#10;9:18&#10;THEIR DAMN MIND. AND THAT&#10;9:20&#10;DOESN'T LOOK GOOD FOR POLITICS.&#10;9:22&#10;I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE COURTS,&#10;9:25&#10;BECAUSE TONIGHT, ONE OF THE&#10;9:26&#10;PRESIDENT'S MOST SENIOR&#10;9:27&#10;ADVISERS, STEPHEN MILLER,&#10;9:28&#10;TWEETED, THE JUDICIAL COUP IS&#10;9:31&#10;OUT OF CONTROL. HOW UGLY IS THIS&#10;9:36&#10;ADMINISTRATION'S WAR ON THE&#10;9:37&#10;COURTS ABOUT TO GET? BECAUSE&#10;9:38&#10;THUS FAR, TO DAVID'S ORIGINAL&#10;9:40&#10;POINT, CONGRESS HAS PRETTY MUCH&#10;9:42&#10;DONE BUPKIS. AND THE COURTS, IF&#10;9:45&#10;ANY GROUP HAVE BEEN THE ONLY TO&#10;9:47&#10;STAND UP AND THE ONLY ONES TO&#10;9:49&#10;STAND UP TO TRUMP AND&#10;9:50&#10;JOURNALISTS.&#10;9:51&#10;&gt;&gt; YEAH.&#10;9:51&#10;&gt;&gt; AND I, I SEE THIS CASE. GOING&#10;9:54&#10;TO THE SUPREME.&#10;9:55&#10;&gt;&gt; COURT.&#10;9:55&#10;&gt;&gt; AND I SEE A WORLD IN WHICH&#10;9:57&#10;THE SUPREME.&#10;9:58&#10;&gt;&gt; COURT DOES.&#10;9:58&#10;&gt;&gt; NOT RUBBER STAMP TRUMP.&#10;10:00&#10;REMEMBER, THE PEOPLE ON THE SIDE&#10;10:01&#10;OF THIS CASE, THIS TARIFF. CASE&#10;10:03&#10;ARE CHARLES KOCH, OUR LEONARD&#10;10:05&#10;LEO.&#10;10:05&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS CREW DOES NOT.&#10;10:07&#10;&gt;&gt; MESS AROUND. RIGHT. AND THEY.&#10;10:09&#10;&gt;&gt; AND THEY KNOW.&#10;10:10&#10;&gt;&gt; HOW TO BRING A CASE IN FRONT&#10;10:12&#10;OF THE COURT.&#10;10:13&#10;&gt;&gt; AND THE COURT HAS.&#10;10:14&#10;&gt;&gt; QUITE A.&#10;10:15&#10;&gt;&gt; LOT. OF RESPECT AND&#10;10:17&#10;ADMIRATION.&#10;10:17&#10;&gt;&gt; FOR THESE.&#10;10:18&#10;&gt;&gt; TWO MEN FOR ANY NUMBER OF&#10;10:19&#10;DUBIOUS REASONS.&#10;10:19&#10;&gt;&gt; SO I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT&#10;10:21&#10;TRUMP WINS IN COURT HERE. LOOK,&#10;10:22&#10;STEPHEN MILLER CAN SAY WHATEVER&#10;10:24&#10;HE WANTS, BUT AT THE END OF THE&#10;10:25&#10;DAY, THIS IS ALL THE LEGAL&#10;10:28&#10;FRAMEWORK FOR. THIS WAS.&#10;10:29&#10;&gt;&gt; ALWAYS SO SUSPECT.&#10;10:29&#10;&gt;&gt; AND ANYONE WHO READ PROJECT&#10;10:30&#10;2025 THIS SUMMER SAW THAT&#10;10:32&#10;EVERYTHING WAS LIKE EMERGENCY,&#10;10:33&#10;THIS, EMERGENCY THAT, AND THAT&#10;10:35&#10;WOULDN'T STAND UP TO MUCH&#10;10:36&#10;SCRUTINY." />
