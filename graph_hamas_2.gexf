          <attvalue for="7" value="Hello. – Hi. Do you speak English? – Yes. Can I ask you a question? We're looking for the green line, do you know where the green line is? It doesn't exist. – It doesn't exist? All of Israel is our land. All of Israel is yours? – Yeah. Did the the green line used to exist? – No, never. You don't recognise the green line, there is no green line? God gave us Israel, all of it. Reporting in the Middle East for over 20 years, I've seen the conflict between  Israelis and Palestinians deepen, shift and return to the same painful questions again and again. At one point, there was hope for a resolution based on the green line. Drawn in 1949 to separate Israel from the West Bank in Gaza, it was seen as the boundaries of a possible two-state solution. But today, amid Israel's devastating war in Gaza and the occupation of the West Bank, that vision feels more distant than ever. The green line still exists on maps, but on the ground it's been blurred, physically, politically and in  ways that continue to inflame the conflict.   How can you have your next door neighbour saying,  'I want to have a safe house right next door to you and also I want to kill you and I want to drive you into the sea.' In this series, I'm travelling along the green line, meeting  Palestinians and Israelis living just kilometres apart, but shaped by vastly different realities, to discover whether peace is still possible and what future they envision. Now in this moment, I'm looking, and I see the Dome of the Rock, and I see the al-Aqsa, and I know things are going to change in Jerusalem.   In episode one, I begin in Jerusalem, a city at the heart of the conflict, and where divisions run deep. Excuse me, do you know where the Green Line is? It used to be here somewhere, I think. I don't know. It's not here any more? – No, I don't know. All right, thank you. Do you know where the green line is? This way? – Straight. OK, shukran. Do you know where the green gine is? No idea. – Do you know what the green line is? No idea. I don't know anything about it. Go from there, all the way to the right. Is it a border, do I need my passport? [Laughs] No? – You don't need your passport. OK, thank you, shukran. I'll go find it, thank you, thank you. For most of those I ask, the green line no longer exists in Jerusalem,  and hasn't for a long time. In many ways, the erasure of the green line began in 1967, when Israel occupied the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including here in East Jerusalem. Sorry? We didn't occupy the Gaza Strip, it's ours. What did – What did the gentleman say? He's saying that Israel never occupied the Gaza Strip or the West Bank,  that these territories belong to Israel, they're theirs. years after the occupation began, Israel  annexed the eastern part of the city, expanding Jerusalem and declaring it as the complete and united capital of Israel. For Palestinians, many of whom were displaced from western Jerusalem during the creation of Israel in 1948, the ongoing occupation is a painful reminder  of the loss of their most important city. Why? Today does the green line  still have any meaning for you? This is 'bullshit' in English. For me, this is my past and it's my future, and for you, when you come here, it's a story. For us, this isn't a story. It's our life and it's our survival. As the the Arabs express themselves, they're saying, 'no Jews should live in Israel', and they say it openly. They have an open agenda not a hidden – But I think the official position of the Palestinian government in any case has been of one of two states. Is that not something you would support? One of the three characteristics of a Jew is that they're compassionate, and we're compassionate until they're standing with rifles at us wanting to kill us and kill our children. Then we say, hang on a second, a two-state solution? Before we can talk about a two-state solution, we need to say, 'are you willing to live in peace?' The majority of those living in East Jerusalem are Palestinians but since the occupation began, an increasing number of Israeli settlers have crossed the Green Line and moved into Palestinian areas of the city. Shalom. Tziporah Piltz is one such settler. A mother of 10 and a tour guide, she's chosen to raise her family in the Arab neighbourhood of Ras al-Amud. Her home is located in the middle of a Jewish cemetery and overlooks one of Islam's holiest sites, al-Aqsa Mosque compound. We'll walk around over here, we'll see the view of the Temple Mount. Let's do it. – OK, let's go. We've lived here for 23 years. This is a very special cemetery because in the redemption, we're going to have the Messiah, we're going to have the temple, and all the dead people are going to become alive again so it's going to start from here, from the Mount of Olives. That's why people – – This is where going to where it's going to – Exactly, it's going to start from here. – OK, interesting. This is East Jerusalem and I like to talk about the Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem. You see there's a wall at the end of the the trees over there? – Yeah. They have 10 families living over there. Now all the mountain over there, that you see there now, is empty, that's going to be a big Jewish  neighbourhood of 300 families. So who makes that? The Jerusalem municipality, the Israeli government?  The Israeli government, yeah. That will be the eastern neighbourhood of of Yerushalayim What does it feel like for you, living, as you described, surrounded by Palestinian Arabs from this community in East Jerusalem. Well I feel it's a privilege, OK, living here,   because the first reason is as making  all Yerushalayim, all Jerusalem to be Jewish, that's like one of our aims, and to live overlooking the holiest site, overlooking the Temple Mount. This is the reason why I live here, you see this is my house over here. Wow, I have never seen the old city from this perspective. Yeah, this is amazing, amazing. The world was founded from this spot, OK, because over here is still the first temple of King Solomon, over here is the second temple of King Herod, and I believe where is going to be the third temple. So tell me about that, you say you want to build the third temple, why is that important to you? After the destruction of the second temple, we were all separated to Poland, Germany and Morocco and Yemen. What kept the Jews in all of these countries is the coming back to our nation, to our homeland, and rebuilding the Third Temple. Now, in this moment, I'm looking and I see the Dome of the Rock and I see the al-Aqsa and I know that it doesn't have to be in this spot. So, is there a place for both of them to exist or do you have to actually destroy one of those Islamic sites in order to build the temple?   We cannot have a mosque together with the Third Temple together, it doesn't go together. Meaning one of those structures, the al-Aqsa mosque, has to go in order for the temple to be built? Yes. My daily music. Instead of hearing the muezzin calling people to pray, I know that I'm supposed to hear the levites playing their instruments in the temple. I know it's music I'm supposed to hear, this is something temporarily,  it's not supposed to be in Israel. Do you ever see a solution based around two states –  one for Israelis one for Palestinians – based on the Green Line?   Definitely not. To give the Palestinian state, it means to give away, to give up, my homeland. The more settlements we'll have in Judea and the more settlements we're going to have in Samaria, that will solve our side because we need Jews, not only living in Tel Aviv and Haifa, we need two million, three millions Jews living in those in our original homeland. Now you're asking what to do with all the Arabs, and uh – That's a logical question to ask next, I mean, what about all the Arabs that are living already in East Jerusalem in these neighbourhoods that you mentioned. OK, so first of all, we have to know that Jerusalem is the capital of the state of Israel. If other people want to live here, they're welcome, they could live in Jerusalem, but they have their obligations what to do, OK. If the Palestinians you mentioned were to to stay  in Jerusalem, what would they need to do exactly?   First of all, recognise that things are going to change in the Temple Mount, we're going to have the Third Temple, OK. Things are going to change. Look, we have a lot of Arab countries all over the world, and we have only one homeland.  Everybody has to accept that this is our homeland But for Palestinians like Ramzi Abbassi, whose roots to Jerusalem trace back generations, this is the only homeland he's ever known. Like Tziporah, Ramsey is also a tour guide of Jerusalem. With a large following on social media, he creates videos about the issues facing Palestinians in this ancient city. Hi, Ramzi. – How are you doing, kefak. How's it going, nice to meet you, Matthew. The green line was here. – Yes, here, exactly. If a Palestinian from  the Gaza Strip or the West Bank, they want to come to Jerusalem, are they able to? and you have a lot of soldiers  and police walking around, I guess? in 2023, Ramzi was convicted by an Israeli court for communicating with a person affiliated with a terror group and for working with a banned social media platform, charges he vehemently denies. I've been noticing, we've been trying to talk with a lot of Palestinians here in East Jerusalem and a lot of people they're scared to say anything political, why is that? You're not worried about yourself to talk about these things? After taking me on a tour, Ramzi joins his  family for a meal at their favourite spot,   on the rooftops of the old city,  overlooking the al-Aqsa compound. How is it to live in Jerusalem? The Israelis will say they're doing all of this because they're worried about attacks from Palestinians, that they need to do all this for self-defence, what do you say to that? So, what's the solution then? As we eat, a group of a few dozen Jewish  Israeli women turn up on a tour of their own.   Leading the group is Tziporah. How's it going, we're filming. I'm giving a tour. – Are you? We've been going around the Old City  today just meeting all kinds of people   and it's funny we came across you here. So what are you doing? It's a tour that the whole aim of it is, first  of all, a connection between mothers and daughters. None of the women over here are from  Jerusalem, all of them are out of Jerusalem to increase the rebuilding of the temple, that's the whole aim of the tour, this is what we do. In the next episode, I'll travel north along the green line to the city of Tulkarm, meeting Palestinians  displaced from their homes and speaking with Israelis living in towns just across the wall facing the edge of the West Bank." />

          <attvalue for="3" value="Is Syria stabilizing? Six months after the dramatic fall of the Assad regime, Syria finds itself at a critical crossroads. While the collapse of the long-standing dictatorship shocked the Middle East, hopes for a swift transition to peace and stability remain uncertain. The new administration, led by Ahmed al-Sharaa and backed by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), has made tentative moves towards governance and reform—including an interim constitution and a new cabinet—but deep concerns persist. With HTS's jihadist roots, questions about future democratic development and sectarian tensions loom large, particularly after revenge attacks against minorities and fears of rising Islamist influence. Despite these risks, many Syrians and international observers cautiously await signs of lasting stability.&#10;&#10;Internationally, the new Syrian government has made surprising diplomatic gains. Turkey has emerged as a strong ally, and even Western nations have shown a willingness to engage—highlighted by Sharaa’s meeting with US President Trump. Sanctions have been lifted, and Gulf states are offering economic aid, raising hopes for reconstruction. But serious obstacles remain: destroyed infrastructure, widespread poverty, and a fragile internal security environment. With the threat of insurgency, Israeli military action, and the risk of Syria becoming a proxy battleground, the country’s long-term future is far from secure.

          <attvalue for="7" value="Is Syria finally stabilizing? It's now been 6 months since the 50-year-old  Assad regime was toppled in the country. But while this sent shockwaves  throughout the Middle East and   the broader international community, many  were concerned about the implications it   would have for a country that's long been  regarded as a pivotal actor in the region. So half a year on, how is Syria now doing? Hello and welcome. If you're new to the channel,  my name is James Ker-Lindsay and   here I take an informed look at international  relations, conflict, security and statethood. We often tend to think that  when a side wins a civil war,   the conflict is over and the country  enters a new phase of peace and stability. But of course, this is usually far from the case. The new regime often faces  a multitude of problems. As well as the challenge of  establishing a new government,   they're also faced with stabilizing the economy. And in many cases, the internal security  situation remains precarious as other factions,   including elements loyal to the previous  regime, often continue to fight on. To add to all this, external parties can often  complicate efforts to ease the situation. An excellent example of this is Syria. Since overthrowing the Assad regime, the new   administration has faced numerous  internal and external challenges. But 6 months on, is the country  finally on the path to stability? Syria, more officially known as the Syrian  Arab Republic, is situated in the Middle East. To its north lies Turkey. To its east is Iraq. And to its south is Jordan. To its west, it shares borders with Israel  and Lebanon and has a Mediterranean coastline. While its population is estimated to  be around 21 million, exact figures are   unavailable as many millions fled  the country during the civil war. And while most Syrians are Arab, there are  also Kurdish, Skassian and Turk communities. As for religion, while three quarters  of the population are Sunni Muslims,   the country also has Christians and other Muslim  minorities, including Shia, Druze, and Alawites. While Syria has a long history that  stretches back to ancient times,   after centuries of Ottoman rule, it came under  French control following the First World War. This lasted until 1945, when  it gained its independence and   became a founding member of the United Nations. However, following independence, the  country soon fell into political turmoil. Following its unsuccessful attack on the new  state of Israel in 1948, the country experienced   prolonged unrest, as well as a succession  of military coups between 1949 and 1961. It also entered a brief political union with  Egypt, becoming the United Arab Republic. But in the end, things began to change in  1966, when a young Alawite Air Force general,   Hafez al-Assad, became Minister of  Defence, thus beginning his rise to power. Although Syria suffered another defeat in the 1967  war against Israel, Assad held on to his position. And in 1970, he led another coup,  becoming president the following year. Assad's presidency marked  a turning point for Syria. Imposing an authoritarian and highly  repressive regime that elevated Alawites   to key government roles, he focused  Syrian foreign policy against the West. As well as becoming a major opponent  of Israel and the United States,   earning Syria the label of a  state sponsor of terrorism,   Assad expanded the country's regional influence  by intervening in Lebanon and aligning with Iran. But after 30 years in power, Hafez al-Assad died  in 2000 and was succeeded by his son Bashar. Although the younger Assad was  initially seen as a potential reformer,   he in fact continued his father's dictatorship. However, in 2011, everything changed  with the start of the Arab Spring. As mass protests erupted in Syria,  Assad launched a brutal crackdown,   and from there the country  quickly descended into civil war. At first, the opposition appeared to be  gaining the upper hand, especially as   much of the Arab world and the international  community lined up against the Assad regime. However, despite widespread calls for US   and Western direct intervention to  help the rebels, Washington refused. But I have resisted calls for military action   because we cannot resolve someone  else's civil war through force. With Russian military intervention,  combined with continuing support from Iran,   government forces began to regain lost territory. And by 2020, the situation  had been largely reversed. Although rebel and Kurdish groups still  held areas in the north and northeast,   and various Islamist groups  continued to operate in the east,   Assad had effectively reasserted  control over most of the country. Indeed, having now seemingly won the war,   Syria began to regain international acceptance,  including full membership in the Arab League. But although the Syrian war now seemed to be  over, things weren't quite as they appeared. Within the country, opposition forces   were regrouping and strengthening  their control over the Northwest. Likewise, the international  context was also changing. With Russia focused on Ukraine and Iran  weakened following Israel's war against   Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon,  the chance came to strike against Assad. In late November 2024, the civil war reignited. Led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham,  an offshoot of al-Qaeda that   allied with Turkish-backed forces, the  rebels launched a surprise offensive. With Assad's forces offering little resistance  and no external support from traditional allies,   they rapidly closed in on the  country's capital Damascus. On 7 December 2024, Assad fled to Moscow, marking  the end of half a century of his family's rule. In his place, a new HTS government was formed  under the group's leader Ahmed Al-Sharaa,   who became the new president of Syria. I hope you're finding this useful. If so, please do give it a like and perhaps  subscribe to the channel if you haven't already. Thanks so much, and now back to the video. While the end of the Assad regime certainly marked   a landmark moment for Syria, how  has the country fared since then? In truth, it's been a mixed picture. First of all, there's the question of governance. While many may have cheered Assad's demise,  many also feared the incoming administration,   especially given HTS's links to  al-Qaeda and al-Shara's militant past. But so far, things appear  more positive than expected. At least on the surface, HTS has transitioned  from Islamism to Syrian nationalism,   and from a militant insurgent  group to a national government. In January 2025, an interim  constitution was introduced. And in March, a cabinet was  established under al-Sharaa. However, hopes that this will eventually lead  to an inclusive democracy seem premature. Alshara has already suggested that it could  take up to five years before elections are held,   although many suspect that these  may never in fact even happen. Furthermore, the government remains  relatively unrepresentative. For instance, Hind Kabawat is the sole  female and only Christian minister. Yet, lurking behind this is a more profound fear. Despite the administration's  relatively moderate tone,   there are concerns that it may revert to its  Islamist roots at some point in the future. As for international relations, the new government  has had a better start than many expected. In marked contrast to the Taliban in Afghanistan,   which remains shunned by the international  community, many countries have given the   new Syrian government the benefit  of the doubt, at least for now. Aside from the strong support from Turkey,  which has become a key international ally   of the new government, many Arab states  are working with the new administration. Likewise, many Western countries have also shown  a willingness to engage with the new government. This was graphically highlighted when al-Sharaa   met with US President Donald  Trump in Saudi Arabia in mid-May. However, there are still grounds for concern. While the Syrian government has  severed the country's ties with Iran,   the government seems to be engaging with Russia,   with reports suggesting that al-Sharaa may permit  Moscow to maintain its military bases in Syria. This will no doubt worry Western observers. Furthermore, the relationship with Turkey  may not be as firm as it outwardly appears. Scepticism towards Turkey is deeply  rooted in much of the Arab world,   particularly in the regions that  were once under Ottoman control. This could eventually lead to  tensions between the two neighbours. However, the most pressing issue is Israel. As the Assad regime collapsed, Israeli  troops advanced further into the country,   establishing a security zone and  targeting critical military sites. While the Israeli government insists that this  is temporary, many fear another land grab. In addition to the Galan Heights, which  Israel seized in 1967 and annexed in 1981,   this will further complicate peace  talks between the two countries,   something the US is now actively calling for. All the while, there are also  fears that Syria may well   become a proxy battleground for Israel and Turkey. An issue I covered in another recent video. Thirdly, the country also faces  enormous economic challenges. The impact of the civil war has been immense. Much of the country's infrastructure  has been destroyed, and estimates   suggest that over 16 million people  are still in need of humanitarian aid. In addition, the country faces a possible  influx of returnees as many countries try   to persuade refugees to return now  that the war appears to be over. But again, there are signs of hope. Both the United States and the European Union  have now lifted sanctions on the country. Meanwhile, Gulf Arab nations,  including Saudi Arabia and Qatar,   have stepped in to provide crucial support,  including funds to pay government salaries. But while this should hopefully begin to  alleviate the immediate economic problems,   the longerterm picture is less certain. Syria requires enormous funds  to rebuild, and without these,   the overall situation may start to deteriorate. And this brings us to the fourth and most pressing  immediate issue: the internal security situation. So far, the new government has consolidated  its control over large parts of the country. Crucially, the prospect of a  significant new conflict in   the Kurdish held northeast seems to have receded. Although the Kurds established considerable  self-ruule throughout the civil war,   they've seemingly accepted the government's broad  authority and the unity of the Syrian state. However, there are questions about  how deeply rooted all this is,   especially since the Kurdish areas will want  formal autonomy under any new constitution. Meanwhile, there are still serious  concerns in many other areas. For instance, there have been  disturbing attacks against the   minorities in the country, as  was highlighted in March 2025,   when Alawites were killed in what many saw  as revenge attacks against the community. Likewise, tensions have also been  growing with the country's DRS community. To add to all this, several armed groups  continue to pose a major challenge. These include the Syrian popular resistance,  made up of Assad loyalists, and Islamic State,   which continues to operate in parts of the East. All the while, questions about the government's   ideological agenda continue  to worry many observers. For instance, the decision  to integrate 3500 foreign   jihadists into the National Army has  raised fears about radicalization. That said, the plan has been  backed by the United States,   which sees it as a way to  keep the fighters in check. And it's for all these reasons that  Syria's path to lasting peace and   stability remains fraught with serious challenges. The complex mixture of governance,  security and economic problems will   pose significant challenges for the  new government in the period ahead. But even if there may be doubts  about the government's direction,   there seems to be little choice but to press  on and support al-Sharaa, at least for now. Whatever doubts may exist is also balanced  by the realization that there's no credible   alternative and that Syria still faces  numerous internal and external threats. If the administration falls, Syria could  well be plunged into even deeper chaos. While Assad may now be gone, Syria  still faces a precarious future. I hope you found that useful. If so, here are some more videos on Syria and  the Middle East that you might find useful." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Iran's most famous ski destination is tol Resort it overlooks the capital tyan you can get there on a 7 km chairlift from the tyan suburb of tajrish and on the way up the chairlift if you turn around at just the right time you can see something interesting a giant walled off area filled with lush green trees in amongst the trees is the Palace of the former Sha of Iran his majesty liked skiing hence the convenient chairlift these days it's where the president of Iran holds big events and meets with world leaders right on the edge of the palace grounds is a concrete building five stories high and if you happen to be on the chairlift at 1:37 a.m. on the 31st of July this year you would have seen the Western corner of that building explode windows were shattered and exterior wall crumbled and Rubble fell onto the Terrace below now that explosion was no accident it was the result of a bomb a bomb that killed an extremely high-profile Target Hamas leader Ishmael hania has been assassinated in the Iranian Capital tyan this attack appears to have been meticulously planned and carried out flawlessly probably by Israel as is its usual practice the Israeli government has declined to make any official comment the mozard simply never comments at all but if that's true it's wild killing a Hamas leader inside the compound of the Iranian president while he's under the protection of the Iranian revolutionary guard is an extraordinary statement the Iran supreme leader said Revenge was our duty and that Israel had prepared a harsh punishment for itself by killing a dear guest in our home there's some debate about the mechanic of how they pulled this off which I'll definitely be getting into later in this episode but no matter the methods they used the risk involved in this assassination operation is Extreme if it was Israel that did this why did they do it in such an extraordinary manner well the answer is fascinating and it tells us a lot about the incredibly complex political situation that Israel has found itself in where it feels the need for Revenge but only in a way that doesn't alienate its allies today the unbelievable assassination plot against Ismael Hanah and what it tells us about the escalating conflict between Israel and its enemies the world is on the brink of a fullscale war in the Middle East I'm Matt beon and this is if you're [Music] listening the Israeli intelligence agency mad was once considered to be one of the most terrifying ruthless spy agencies in the world known for its daring and brutal missions the kidnapping trial and execution of Nazi Adolf Aman the Israeli bombing of the Syrian nuclear reactor assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists the purpose of these plots was to communicate to Israel's enemies that there was nowh they could hide without mad finding them and yet for nearly a decade Ismael Hanah leader of Israel's number one enemy Hamas has been living in Qatar for safety security the Israelis would like to kill him he's not alone a bunch of Hamas leaders live in qat it's a weird setup billionaire gas princes the US Military and Hamas all living next door to each other on the Arabian Peninsula and they're not hiding there either they live out in the open Ismael hanas spent years there and nothing happened to him you might think that sending your spies to assassinate your greatest enemies would be easier to do in a country that you share a bunch of allies with but it's not and the reason for that goes back to a series of mad operations that went terribly terribly wrong Israelis once saw their foreign intelligence Service as Invincible not anymore throughout the '90s and 2000s mad bungled a few really high-profile missions the Mad used to have the image of working like a Swiss clock and now it is almost like a Swiss cheese but the biggest of all their screw-ups came in 2010 and that's because they screwed up in a very particular way this is the Spy story that could well spell the end of old fashion Cloak and Dagger Espionage this time the operation was in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates the target hamas's top weapons supplier a man named Mamud almu the Palestinian resistance fighter was known to mosad for buying weapons from Iran and notorious also for kidnapping and killing two Israeli soldiers in 1989 it was called operation plasma screen I assume mad had run out of intimidating operation names and had moved on to household appliances it involved more than 20 mad agents all traveling on non-israeli passports that's really necessary for the operation to work at the time more than two dozen countries including the UAE did not accept Israeli passports so while the CIA and MI6 can print Jack Ryan and James Bond new passports whenever they like Massad agents have to use foreign passports without those foreign passports there's no operation plasma screen not to mention operation DVD player operation Lazy Boy recliner and operation universal remote so how do you get hold of foreign passports well apparently Israel developed a system if you're in Israeli with two passports be that second passport British or Australian you can be approached by an official the official asks you if you need that second passport in the short term and if you say no you're asked if out of Duty to the country whether you'd be prepared to have your passport details borrowed borrowed best no one asks what they're being borrowed for operation plasma screen would require more than 20 of these borrowed passports using fake passports more than once is risky they'd have to get the job done with as few visits to Dubai as possible on visit one the agents followed elabo around Dubai observing his patterns on visit 2 they slipped poison in his drink but he inconveniently failed to die and went home to Syria thinking that he was just sick 2 months later alive and well he headed back to Dubai spies traveling on the same set of passports followed him again M arrives from Damascus midaf afternoon and is watched by several operatives the man in the baseball cap goes by the name of Australian Adam Corman virtually the entire operation is captured on CCTV Israeli operatives follow alabu from the airport to the hotel when he goes to his room two spies with tennis rackets manage to slide into the lift with him hate it when people do that one of the tennis players watches which room he goes into the operatives book a room opposite and still more agents move in and when the Hamas man leaves to go shopping he's followed every step it's quite funny watching these surveillance teams go about their business you can see them changing disguises into business suits pushing on doors that say pull endlessly wandering up and down Hotel corridors like weird business ghosts meanwhile while four of them break into albo's room the Hamas official arrives back from his shopping trip and into the ambush of four assassins they use a special ultrasonic device to anesthetize him without a needle and lower him to the floor waiting for his heart to stop but they aren't out of the woods yet once a team like this starts working it is very easy technologically to trace them at each and every point of the whole of the whole maneuver unlike in the movies they don't have a guy in a van who hacks into the security system and erases the CCTV footage the whole thing is caught on camera their only hope is that nobody will ever bother to check it so they take off albo's clothes and Tuck him into bed it'll look like he died in his sleep in the absence of signs of a struggle for days police thought he' died of natural causes and with agents safely out of the country it seemed the perfect hit it was the passports that blew their cover after Hamas notified duai police that their man was dead it was simple for investigators to check immigration logs for anything suspicious they discovered that the same group of people had clearly been following al-mu in and out of the country Dubai Police say Mahmud al- mau's Killers tracked him from the moment he arrived in the country warrants are now being issued for their arrest which was a bit of a nasty surprise for the people who the passports belong to imagine waking up one morning only to find out that apparently you've traveled to an exotic Middle Eastern location and assassinated an alleged arms dealer the Australians Brits Irish French and Germans whose passports had been used were not very happy I'm angry why is this happening to me does this mean I can't visit my parents because someone used my name it's like a movie the governments of the countries the passports came from were also not very happy they were all friendly with Israel and here was their Ally using their passports for international assassinations such misuse of British passports is intolerable the fact that this was done by a country which is a friend only adds insults to injury this was not the act of a friend this is this is not the first occasion where there has been misuse of an Australian passport by Israeli agencies needless to say Dubai was angry too that is a deplorable and unacceptable method of operation it was extremely embarrassing and damaging for Israel Israel relies on the support of its allies well for its very existence they couldn't risk doing this again in a place like Dubai that's why hamas's headquarters are now in Qatar the Americans had an agreement with the qataris and the Israelis that you don't kill Hamas leaders in Qatar this has provided a challenge for Israel which previously pledged to eliminate Hamas leaders when those leaders aren't in Qatar they're other highly developed Western Allied countries like Egypt and turkey if you Aspire for a country that's pledged to eliminate Hamas leaders it might be easier for you to get them there logistically but diplomatically it's Kryptonite when those Leaders Travel to meet their allies in Iran though well the Palestinian militant group Hamas says its political leader isma hania has been assassinated in Iran so how'd they pull it off mad couldn't get is Hana in Qatar where he lived so they'd have to get him while he was traveling mad knew that Hana traveled regularly to tan mad also knew that he stayed in the guest house of the Iranian revolutionary guard Corps on the edge of the presidential Palace complex at the foot of the mountains it seems they had also managed to bribe two of the building's guards offering them cash and asylum in Europe in exchange for attaching a brick-sized bomb to the bottom of hania's bed they had the where and the how but they were missing the when you can't have a crew of Massad agents hiding in the hills of tyan endlessly staking out the building waiting for your guy to arrive but on the 18th of May this year something happened to help with that third thing I've seen vision of it already there's a huge plume of smoke coming from that site the Iranian president Ibrahim REI was killed in a helicopter accident we did a whole episode about it at the time give it a watch after this one the president's death opened up an opportunity for mad it knew that hania would be invited to the inauguration of the new president in July what happened next is still a little unclear there's at least three versions of the story The New York Times and the Jerusalem Post report that the bomb was planted soon after Rey's death and sat there for 8 weeks waiting for hania to visit for the event the Jewish Chronicle in Lon reports that in fact the bomb was planted on the afternoon of hania's arrival But whichever version turns out to be true we know that by the time hania turned in for the night on the 30th of July the bomb had been planted and it wasn't on a timer it could be detonated when the time was right luckily for Mad the building was unbelievably easy to spy on you can see it clearly from anywhere on the hillside that stretches up behind the palace you can see get from the chairlift on your way up for a ski or you could dress up in green camouflage and climb any of the several hundred trees surrounding the building which is what the Jewish Chronicle reports that Massad agents did hania attended the inauguration of Iran's new president met with the country's supreme leader and then went to the guest house the agents watched hania's car arrive they watched him go into his room watched him turn off the light waited a few moments and then pressed the button two assassinations 14 years apart the differences between them tell us a lot about Israel's position in the world in 2010 mad's operation in Dubai really irritated Israel's allies in Europe and Australia but in 2024 Israel needs those allies more than they've needed them in decades by carrying out assassinations in Iran they're operating in a way that is far more risky for their but much less likely to anger their friends what mad does though it's it's different from the CIA or MI6 CIA people they don't like they don't like this stuff you know it's it's messy while British and American spy agencies do assassinate people they do it in war zones and they tend to do it with military operations or drone strikes and they tend to tell the public about it why don't they do sneaky James Bond St sty assassinations because it was believed to be counterproductive you're just creating martyrdom you're creating that feel of persecution and in the long term that's negative and top it off it usually doesn't achieve anything all terrorists are replaced sooner or later the point of these assassinations is to create fear to terrorize your opponents to make your enemies constantly worry that you've planted a bomb under their bed that the places that they think are safe aren't really Israel's basically sending a message to the Iranians can kill any one of you anywhere anytime it's the same reason Russia kills people by poisoning their underpants or their tea or their door knobs isma hania was the chief negotiator in the peace talks aimed at ending the war in Gaza and now he's been replaced as Hamas Leader by a far more fanatical islamist Yaya sinoa hania's death potentially indicates an Israeli desire to prolong the war and it's part of a series of tit fortat attacks in recent weeks that could signal an escalation of the conflict the thing is though when Russia pulls stunts like this they're condemned by the Western World Israel thinks it's found the guard rails for how to carry out crossborder assassinations without losing friends but right now their friendships are quite stretched they cannot afford to make any mistakes [Music] [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="- This was the Gaza Strip, a 25 mile stretch along the Mediterranean coast, home to just over 2 million people. Today, the once bustling streets and high-rise buildings have been reduced to rubble. But underneath the wreckage lies a vast, sophisticated web of tunnels longer than London's underground. This extensive network is a key weapon in Hamas' arsenal, from which they smuggle weapons and people for their w*r against Israel. The tunnels began as a lifeline for families divided by impermeable borders. When Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in 2007, they poured billions of dollars into this underground infrastructure, waiting for the day their enemy would meet them in this airless, subterranean battlefield. How did Gaza's tunnels go from a primitive supply network to the world's largest underground w*r zone? (gentle instrumental music) Our story starts in Rafah, a city in the south of Gaza with a tumultuous history. In a matter of decades, it changed hands four times, from the Ottomans, to the British, to the Egyptians, to the Israelis. In 1979, things changed once again when Israel and Egypt signed a peace agreement. As part of the deal, Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula. The new border between Israel and Egypt split Rafah in half. One part returned to Egypt, the other remained under Israeli control. And in the middle, a massive, impenetrable wall. - Right now, we are standing in the urban area of the town of Rafah. The immediate problem that the line, as you see it over there, should run across the city, and cut the town into two parts between Israel and Egypt. - Suddenly, neighbors who had grown up side by side lived in different countries. Families separated, unable to visit one another. But Gaza's people weren't about to let a wall keep them from their loved ones. Armed with shovels and determination, they dug the first tunnels beneath Gaza. Simple passageways carved out of sandy soil, connecting homes on either side of the border. These early tunnels were modest and easy to build with openings hidden in basements. On one side, a family in Gaza, on the other, a family in Egypt. In between, a secret passageway that allowed them to visit. For a brief moment, the tunnel stood as a testament to the enduring power of human connection. But it didn't take long for bad actors to exploit the system. With the wall cutting off access to Egypt, Gaza faced severe shortages of everyday essentials. Seizing the moment, enterprising smugglers turn the tunnels into underground trade routes, moving car parts, gasoline, and cigarettes into Gaza, all with a hefty markup, of course. When supply is low and demand is high, profits soar. And while the smugglers were cashing in, they were also filling a critical gap, helping your neighbors get the supplies they so desperately needed. For many Gazans, these tunnels became a lifeline. One Palestinian poetically called them, &quot;The lungs through which Gaza breathed&quot;, the only escape from the suffocating blockades that Egypt and Israel imposed. Egypt and Israel were well aware of the tunnels, but for a long time, the two countries just looked away. They weren't going to interfere with the smuggling of cigarettes or with the family reunions that the tunnels enabled. Everyone, from the people of Rafah to the governments on either side of its wall, understood that this underground network kept Gaza's economy and morale afloat. But everything changed with the First Intifada. In 1987, tensions between Israelis and Palestinians reached a boiling point. Palestinians, frustrated by decades under Israeli control, began protesting. But the grassroots movement escalated quickly. Protests turned to riots, screams turned to stone throwing, Palestinians took up arms, and the clashes between the IDF and the Palestinian crowds soon turned deadly. Gaza was tightly controlled by its neighbors in Israel and Egypt, and still weapons kept appearing in the streets as if by magic. The tunnels had become a pipeline for the w*r against Israel. Israeli authorities tried to destroy the tunnels where they could, but the network grew increasingly sophisticated, and no one in Gaza was going to give up their lifeline to the other side. In 1993, Israel signed a peace deal with the Palestinian Liberation Organization, creating a semi-autonomous Palestinian government for the first time. The Jewish state asked the newly created Palestinian authority for help in locating and destroying the tunnels, an opportunity for the PA to demonstrate its commitment to peace by cracking down on weapon smuggling. But the PA failed miserably. Through a toxic combination of incompetence, corruption, and complicity, the PA left the tunnels intact, and for the next decade, the tunnel network only expanded, snaking underneath more and more of Gaza. By the time the Second Intifada broke out in 2000, the tunnels had become a critical component of Gaza's underground w*r machine. Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Fatah smuggled weapons at unprecedented rates. Underneath the ground, weapons makers assembled the bombs that would detonate Israeli cafes, and buses, and streets, claiming more than 1000 Israeli lives. Israel cracked down hard, determined to stop the terror. And at the end of the Second Intifada, more than 5,000 people were dead. The military launched operations in Gaza to stem the flow of weapons. Demolishing buildings suspected of concealing tunnel entrances, but these efforts often meant displacing civilians and destroying homes, drawing harsh international condemnation. Despite these efforts, the tunnel network endured, smugglers kept profiting, terror groups kept building weapons. The problem seemed insurmountable, so Israel tried a different approach. In 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in the hopes that granting Gazans self rule would finally reduce tensions, - But the move backfired, spectacularly. Without Israeli forces on the ground, Hamas and other groups expanded their tunnel operations unchecked. What had once been a covert network grew into an underground empire, a sprawling web of tunnels beneath Gaza streets, the most important weapon in the fight against Israel. And that fight was now Gaza's first priority, because in 2006, Gazans voted for Hamas to lead them. - Now to be clear, these people weren't all terror supporters. In fact, exit polls showed that a shocking 40% of Hamas voters supported the peace process, and over 1/3 thought that the best path forward was the Two State solution. They saw Hamas as an antidote to the spectacular corruption of the Palestinian Authority. But Hamas and its rival party, Fatah, were unable to share power. Their attempts at a unity government ended in a civil w*r. By 2007, there was only one ruler in Gaza, Hamas, and they had one goal, targeting Israel. - So they poured their considerable resources into expanding the tunnel network. Billions of dollars earmarked for aid went instead to building a fully equipped w*r machine, with tunnels carved from solid rock more than 20 stories underground. For many Gazans, the tunnels still served a practical purpose, alongside weapons, they continued to deliver essential goods like food and medicine. But Israel and Egypt had imposed blockades to curb the flow of weapons and weapons making materials, and the blockades meant the demand for smuggled goods skyrocketed. Smuggling was lucrative, particularly for those who controlled the operation. Known as snakeheads, these individuals invested heavily to build the tunnels and then rented them out to groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. In return, they earned a cut of every shipment. The prophets were staggering. By 2010, snakeheads could rake in up to $200,000 a day. It was a fortune in a region plagued by poverty. But for the ones doing the digging, the story was starkly different. Thousands of Gazans had once worked in Israel, an economic lifeline for a region plagued by poverty and unemployment. But that lifeline soon dried up. Hamas had refused to give up on its goal of eliminating Israel, launching more and more attacks on Israeli cities. And so Israel rescinded the work permits that had allowed Gazan men to feed their families. Without other options, Gazans turn to the backbreaking, dangerous work of digging tunnels. But the burden often fell on children who were small and nimble enough to chisel away at the tight crevices in the bedrock, dozens of feet under the ground. A veritable army of kids risked their lives every day just to bring home a few dollars. - For many children in Gaza, digging tunnels has been a grim rite of passage. But the work was deadly. Cave-ins, electrocution, and exposure to toxic gases were constant threats. - By Hamas' own admission, at least 160 people had died digging tunnels by 2010. Yet the practice continued. Perhaps the most heartbreaking part is that these children understood the dangers before they ever picked up a shovel. - But with no other options, the risk wasn't enough to stop them. For many, it was their only chance to put food on the table. - The tunnels offer a devastating glimpse into Gaza's increasing desperation. For many, they provided essential income and supplies. But for Israel, the tunnels represented an existential threat. Eliminating them became a national security imperative. The Israeli government wasn't interested in cracking down on the smuggling of food, cigarettes, and other goods. It mostly cared about the terrifying prospect of the tunnels being used to launch attacks within Israeli borders. This wasn't just paranoia. - In 2006, Hamas fighters emerged from an underground tunnel and kidnapped an Israeli soldier named Gilad Shalit. For five years, they held him in a two-room complex lined with explosives, 50 feet underground. So the Israelis built a 20-foot high, 10-foot deep border wall equipped with sonar sensors to detect underground activity. But Hamas adapted, digging tunnels deeper, sometimes hundreds of feet below the surface, rendering the wall ineffective. In 2014, the IDF destroyed over 30 tunnels in a major military campaign. And on the other side of Gaza's border, Egypt flooded the tunnels with seawater from the Mediterranean. But the problem persisted. For every tunnel Egypt and Israel destroyed, Hamas just built more, deeper, stronger, and more sophisticated. Israeli engineers developed high tech detection systems and implemented a systematic process for locating and destroying tunnels. Dubbed the Steel Dome, this initiative aimed to neutralize the underground threat. In 2021, Israel announced significant progress, claiming to have destroyed 62 miles of tunnels. But Hamas was quick to counter, asserting that much of the 350 mile network remained intact. - These are no longer the narrow, rudimentary tunnels of the 1980s. Today's tunnels are fortified with concrete and steel rebar, designed to last. Some even resemble luxury living spaces, complete with toweled floors, air conditioning, plumbing, and ventilation systems, and they've grown in scale. Some wealthier Gazans have even used them to smuggle in luxury cars. This vast underground network is more than a military asset. It's an entire infrastructure hidden beneath Gaza's surface. Building hundreds of miles of deep, fortified, and well-equipped tunnels doesn't come cheap. Estimates suggest that constructing Gaza's underground cost nearly $1 billion. That's an extraordinary sum, especially in a region devastated by poverty. So where did the money come from? Much of it was stolen from the very people Hamas claims to represent. Israel approved construction materials to enter Gaza for civilian projects, like rebuilding homes, roads, and schools. But instead of improving life on the surface, Hamas diverted these materials underground, redirecting them to expand their network of terror tunnels. The cost to Gaza civilians was staggering. Homes crumbled, schools and hospitals were left unfinished. Communities in desperate need of support saw their resources vanish into the ground, literally. When Israel discovered this blatant misuse of resources, they stopped sending construction materials, a logical step to protect their own security. Unfortunately, this also made life harder for ordinary Gazans who were caught between Hamas' ambitions and the resulting restrictions. - Gazans lacked basic supplies. But they did have a sprawling, fully operational underground military base, complete with communication systems, storage facilities for weapons, training areas, and even weapons manufacturing sites. Hamas can move personnel, vehicles, and arms anywhere in Gaza without exposing themselves above ground. For over a year, they've been waging w*r from below the surface. But the most critical and dangerous function of the tunnels is their ability to shield Hamas from Israeli surveillance and airstrikes. The subterranean tunnel network presents a serious challenge to the Israeli Air Force. Many tunnels are buried so deep that surface attacks have no impact. The sandy soil, which made the tunnels easy to dig in the first place, now absorbs much of the force from the strikes. And then there's the simple but crucial advantage of concealment. No satellite, drone, or advanced technology can detect targets hidden beneath layers of earth. This isn't a side benefit of the tunnel system, it's a core feature. Hamas values the tunnels because they give them the ability to operate in complete secrecy, outmaneuvering even the most advanced military technology. - Meanwhile, Hamas officials refuse to let ordinary Gazans shelter inside, leaving them exposed to Israeli airstrikes. Hamas leaders shelter beneath schools, hospitals, and homes, turning Gazan civilians into human shields. The international community is quick to blame Israel when civilians are caught in the crossfire. - Gross violations of the human rights of civilians. - We believe that w*r cr!mes are being committed there. - But they conveniently omit the fact that Hamas intentionally places its terror infrastructure directly beneath civilian populations for this very reason. Hamas has been explicit about its willingness to sacrifice civilians. - So Israel is left with only bad choices. Should they sacrifice young soldiers to the booby traps inside tunnels and homes, or should they target Hamas' infrastructure with drones and bunker busters, knowing that civilians and Israeli hostages might be inside? When Israel has chosen the latter, it has been at a very high price for civilians. When Israel has chosen the former, it has been at a very high price for its soldiers. Meanwhile, Hamas exploits its remaining tunnels to move undetected and ambush IDF soldiers. This has dragged the conflict into a prolonged w*r, and that's part of Hamas' strategy. By forcing Israel into a drawn out conflict in a civilian heavy area, Hamas is betting on fierce international backlash. So far, it's working. Israeli citizens are fiercely critical of their government. While the rest of the world claims Israeli tactics are tantamount to genoc!de. - Madam Speaker, we are witnessing the Israeli government carry out a genoc!de in Gaza. - This w*r is unlike any of the world has ever seen before, but Israeli military is clear in its purpose. It's not waging a w*r against Palestinian civilians, it's not waging a w*r against Gaza, it's fighting Hamas, an internationally recognized terror organization that for years has treated its own people as cash cows and human shields. For everyone's sake, they must be defeated. Only then can the people of Gaza live the safe, dignified, prosperous life they deserve." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="democracy depends on a free press please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org/give this is democracyow democracynow.org i'm Amy Goodman we go to get an update from the Freedom Flotilla boat the Madlin sailing to Gaza with vital humanitarian aid the Freedom Flotilla Coalition initially planned to sail from Malta last month but their ship was damaged after it was bombed by drones in international waters earlier this week the Madlin received a Mayday call directing them to a boat that was rapidly deflating with about 30 to 40 migrants on board for more we go to the Freedom Flotilla where we're joined by Thiago Aila he's a Brazilian activist and steering committee member of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition he's among 12 activists sailing to Gaza the mission also includes the renowned Swedish climate activist Greta Tunbury whom we spoke to earlier this week thiago welcome to Democracy Now israel has threatened to raid your ship we know what happened to the Mauvi Marura more than a decade ago when uh the Israeli military raided the ship and killed nine people on board um how are you where are you now in the sea what's happened with these migrants and um how do you plan to challenge the Israeli blockade of Gaza thank you so much for having the plotilla here on democracy now for us it's an honor you do a very important work we are here somewhere in the Mediterranean actually 500 nautical miles from Gaza if we would go to the north we'll be going to Cit in Greece if we would go to south we would be going to Egypt right now and we are on the sixth day of a a day of a journey that will end on Monday likely on the morning to get to Gaza that's our estimated time of arrival and we are right now with 12 people spirits are high and we are carrying life saving aid food medicine crutches prosthetics for imitated children water filters and we're doing our best here to be useful for the solidarity movement for Palestine we are nonviolent direct action mission that not only wants to break the siege the legal siege that Israel has put Gaza for 18 years but also wants to create a people's humanitarian corridor so that all countries all organizations institutions and the social majorities of the world can help and can be in support of the Palestinian people people cannot stand anymore seeing children starving to death and it's in their hearts the idea of doing something and we're part of this doing something collectively all the demonstrations all the global uprising doc workers blocking the cargo vessels to through to through Israel so many people doing amazing things disrupting arms factories creating breaking the media blockade and spreading true information about the genocide of eight decades so we are part of the same thing and yesterday we received a Mayday call from a boat that was rapidly defiliating and we managed to rescue four four of these people unfortunately the rest has been taken and illegally deported back to Libya from uh li Libyan so-called coast guard but the four of the ones that we managed to rescue they were sent to the coast guard and they we are asking for refugee for them in Greece so this was something that happened that we did not expect we sailed for two and a half hours doing search and rescue operation despite the fact that only a few of our members here are trained in search and rescue operation but life comes first so we changed our course completely yesterday to do and attend to this Mayday call and in the end we did what we could and we were very happy that we managed to rescue four people from the water and the Mediterranean being on the water means death very very fast so we're glad that Thiago we just have another minute but I wanted to ask you about Latin American solidarity with Gaza you're a Brazilian activist why you decided to come from Brazil yes oh I come from a place where imperialism always play always plays a decisive role my country suffered two two military coups and and both of them had the support of the United States and so it's important that we understand that imperialism and Zionism they are the greatest evils of our generation and we need to defeat them wherever we can and Palestine is now the strategic place for all peoples to unite and fight against oppression exploitation and the destruction of nature they have been threatening us for many many years for 17 years any flotilla mission that tried to reach Gaza has been threatened by them but we will not bow to their threats we do not need their permission this is international waters and we're going to Palestinian territorial waters so we're going not with their permission but with the help of millions and billions of people that know that starving pe children to death is wrong that bombing hospitals shelters and schools is wrong and that's what we are counting on we they cannot defeat us by force if they attack us we'll have thousands of people on the next flotilla and they will understand like all oppressive regimes understand in the end that they cannot beat the people's true force that people's power is the ultimate power and love and solidarity can beat any hateful racist and supremacist ideology like Zionism and if Israel raids uh your boat um they have pledged not to allow the ship to dock uh or to even approach Thiago yes they did this before like you mentioned 15 years ago they killed nine executed nine of our participants and and another 10th died six months later and one month ago they just bombed our boats and they've been sending drones every night here for three nights in a row so we can expect violence from them and we do our preparations we train our participants in nonviolent direct action so that even facing extreme violence we remain nonviolent because there's no military victory for us here we're a humble boat 12 people that 18 meters boat so we only can win through solidarity making sure that the whole world knows that Gaza has been under siege for 18 years leaving eight decades of genocide and ethnic cleansing and this is how we also move the structures for a safe passage so spread word of what we're doing guarantee us a safe passage because if they understand that they cannot afford to attack us and that will be even worse for them in the attack we have a chance thiago Avila we want to thank you for being with us all safety to you brazilian activists among 12 activists sailing to Gaza to deliver humanitarian aid on the Madlin ship named for the first Gazen Fisher woman uh the ship launched by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition you can also see our interview with Greta Tunbury also on that vote at democracynow.org democracy Now is funded by viewers like you please give today at

          <attvalue for="7" value="this week on Christian World News in the shadow of Islamic terror groups like Boo Haram and ISIS Christian missionaries shine the light of the gospel see how they're reshaping the spiritual landscape in one of the most dangerous places on earth plus from the war torn streets of Beirut to the critically acclaimed set of The Chosen actor Nick Shakur tells CBN News how The Hand of God was with him the entire time and it was one of the largest church breakups in American history 3 years after the split that rocked the Methodist church we look at the fallout on both sides hello everyone welcome to this week's edition of Christian World News i'm George Thomas and I'm Wendy Griffith in one of the most dangerous regions on Earth an American missionary is quietly building an army not with weapons but with prayer you are going to meet an incredible woman her name is Carol Ward and she has made it her mission to obey God and train fearless believers on the African continent here's my report from the southern edge of the Sahara Desert the Sahel region of Africa isn't the kind of place you just wander into you're cold here it's very dry it's very sandy it's dusty it's desert it can be 115° year round this vast stretch of land cuts across 10 African nations from Seneagal to Eritrea it's a land of extremes scorching heat shifting sand and deadly danger more than half of the world's terror related deaths happen here it's the front line in a spiritual and physical battle and now here you are in the middle of one of the most dangerous swats of land in Africa what is wrong with you the call of the wild i don't know i think it's in the blood carol Ward runs toward the fire she's been doing it for decades starting in northern Uganda during the height of the Lord's Resistance Army then came South Sudan civil war destroyed villages broken hearts while others fled Ko stayed bringing healing hope and the relentless love of Jesus you can't live here until you've already died and then then what do you mean by that you've died to yourself and the devil can't kill a dead man because your life isn't your own this kind of courage runs deep so this map was my father's map on the wall of his um of our missionary house actually in the Philippines and he would lay his hands particularly on Muslim areas just weeping and weeping her parents spent 62 years preaching the gospel in regions terrorized by Abu Sai in the Philippines her grandparents served as missionaries in China for 30 years following Jesus wasn't just a decision it was their legacy i realized then fear is contagious but so is faith and so I grew up in a home that even though Abu Sai was looking for my own father's head for 45 years he had no fear he absolutely loved the people that burned the Bibles and threw him back in his face and he was willing as lay to lay his life down today Carol's mission continues here in Chad a country shadowed by the presence of Boka Haram ISIS and al-Qaeda my heart is to move farther and farther north into more Islamic darkness with the gospel because if we're not advancing as rapidly as they are we've lost she's launched a nationwide prayer movement raising up local believers chadians who know the land language and cost of following and sharing Christ we've had some Boka Haram come to Jesus in our missionary training school we've done five of them in Chad now and are launching missionaries we have over 150 launched in Chad and these are Chadian missionaries some of those missionaries have gone east into the flood of Sudanese refugees escaping war many believers baptized 202 of them the first missionary training school they had these aren't outsiders they're locals trained equipped and ready to go where few others will ready to go people like Digba Katsala a street [Applause] evangelist he doesn't just preach he rides straight into the chaos sometimes people are not very receptive at times it gets a little confrontational but afterwards when people see that you persist with the word of God then they get used to you and when you preach at the end there are people that start giving their lives to Christ and that's extraordinary for the past 5 years Pastor Digba has been using his motorcycle to ride the streets of Chad's capital city Angelina and at different locations he would set up his audio uh system and get his microphone out and he would open his Bible uh in either French or Arabic and he would boldly proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ chad is more than 50% Muslim but that doesn't stop Digba from openly talking about Jesus his voice echoing through market squares and busy roads people stop they listen and many respond then there's Abdullahimi Mahayanga another missionary who once followed Islam i was a fervent Muslim i prayed five times a day i fasted during Ramadan and I did not like Christians at all his father trained with Islamic extremists in the Sahel to target Christians now Abdullahi walks into the same regions not with hate but with hope while the world sees terror here he sees something else there is hope because many Muslims in these countries are open today to listening to the gospel god is really working in the Sahel they are coming to Jesus in large numbers and their lives are being transformed carol calls Abdulah Digbar and countless other Chadian believers the tip of the spear through prayer sacrifice and the reckless love of God they are reshaping the spiritual map of one of the most dangerous places here on the continent prayer transforms us to be willing to lay our lives down and fulfill the great commission no matter the cost prayer gives us the burden we actually get maps out and we map where are the unreached people groups where's terrorism where are wars and bloodshed let's go let's go let's Let's go and that's exactly what she has been doing for the last almost three decades on the African continent from Uganda to Sudan and now to this most dangerous part of the African continent where Islamic terrorists are wreaking havoc and she's right in the middle with the gospel of Jesus Christ is there anywhere you won't go for a great story cuz that was a great story thank you heck no of course not i mean that was fantastic i loved every second of it wow well up next from war torn Lebanon to Hollywood stardom

position of we could get bombed at any second and then we did as well we we were dealing with that but then the the polar opposite of that was neighbors being there for each other um you're always invited over to somebody's house that you don't know for dinner or coffee and it was this very tight-knit community and it needed to be because we were under such kind of dire circumstances i remember vividly looking up into the sky and there's several missiles just coming down it was all very slow motion and literally like you know feet waves are like things are just blowing into smitherreens there was a intense civil war happening within the country at the time so what I call like in the book I talk about this protective power encapsulated me that protective power continued from his childhood into his adult life and it led to an unforgettable meeting what can you share or share what you desire about that encounter what happened there's so much that happened at that church conference it's just overwhelming to even talk about but I I showed up completely disarmed and broken when I finally made it to the conference like I was in such a dark dark dark dark dark place and I I won't even say it's a suicidal dark place it wasn't that and I've also dared to say before it was almost if it's even possible worse than that i I can't even describe it that's how dark it was and next thing I know when the conference is over people are ushering out you know the intercessor there who they call Papa James who I call Papa Smurf because he was wearing a blue shirt and I call him that in the book too and I call it that to him directly and he says &quot;Yeah I'm Papa Smurf.&quot; Um he's their intercessor he came over did the anointing oil on the palms and forehead and I said &quot;Sure go for it.&quot; My grandpa baptized me he did the same thing but I wasn't expecting something to happen when he started you know praying over me in what they call the spiritual language speaking in tongues and my cells started to vibrate at a very rapid pace and that's when I saw a transparent presence of God rise from the ground it wasn't it wasn't like a man with a beard but that presence that God used encapsulated everything about his personality and who he was and who Jesus calls the father in heaven when you encounter him he becomes everything you've ever wanted and your body knows it but your mind doesn't comprehend it i met him through the Holy Spirit and and what was more so I could sense that Holy Spirit all around me and looking back he sees the Holy Spirit often connected him to spiritual superheroes along the journey the book's about superheroes and everybody that poured into my life in the book gets a superpower when the viewer opens it I want them to literally fall head first into the book and experience life the way I experienced it one of those superheroes is Dallas Jenkins the filmmaker who cast him as Zebedee after an audition Nick thought cost him the role when you are auditioning now for The Chosen you thought you bombed it right yes because nothing in me wanted the role because I I flipped out when I read Zebed's description as being a fisherman and a father in his 50s i was like 50s 50s it's like because I'd gone so long with so many rejections at auditions that my body my mind my soul as I describe it in the book gave out i made a joke of the whole audition and I asked Dallas later on during season 3 I said &quot;I just got to ask you while we're setting up why did you cast me for this role my audition wasn't good.&quot; And then he said &quot;Well that's what I liked about it you were actually being very careless.&quot; And he saw something in that kind of carelessness and shrugging things off the constant in Nick's story is the greatest superhero of them all as I'm writing the book and I'm going back and connecting the dots wait something felt like it took over me as I'm running away from bombs something took over me you know it's uh that part of it was an amazing discovery for me as I was writing the book because I thought &quot;Wow God has been there the entire time.&quot; Efron Grant CBN News coming up a look at the split that rocked the United Methodist Church and the impact of the breakup 3 years later welcome back to the broadcast here in the US the Supreme Court ruled 9 to nothing that a Catholic charity cannot be required to pay unemployment taxes when other religious groups are exempt wisconsin state officials argued the organization didn't qualify for an exemption because its day-to-day work doesn't involve religious teachings but the high court sided with Catholic Charities ruling that the state violated its first amendment guarantee of freedom of religion well George it's been three years since the United Methodist Church split since then 7,600 churches in the US have left over issues of sexual orientation and ordination cbn's Paul Patit looks back at one of the largest church breakups in American history and the subsequent impact on both sides 2022 was was easily the most difficult year of ministry reverend Clark Atkins pastor's first church in Sylum Springs Arkansas one congregation that decided to break away from the United Methodist Church there's some members that are missing that aren't here um but it does feel renewed it feels more joyous three years ago the Global Methodist Church a theologically conservative alternative to the United Methodists officially launched with just a few dozen congregations today it oversees more than 4600 churches worldwide most of which split from the United Methodists the Global Methodist Church really offered um the closest thing for our theology and the culture of our church at the heart of the split differences over same-sex marriage and the ordination of LGBTQ clergy tracy Malone is president of the United Methodist Church Council of Bishops there's no longer the the fighting um there's no longer um I would even say the distraction um around the differences particularly related um to human sexuality but for Reverend Atkins and many others the issue wasn't simply about sexuality i I knew about um bishops that were were violating the discipline and I thought that's just inexcusable dr daniel Bennett teaches political science at John Brown University and wrote an easy citizenship embracing the tension in faith and politics he says the church divide reflects broader shifts in the country this is a really good example of these cultural expectations and changes in our culture and social environment than seeping into congregations it's not like churches have been driving these conversations in in our broader culture i would argue it's much more likely that it's culture that are shaping some of these conversations in the churches in the years since the split First Church has seen significant growth we saw immediately in the first year um an increase in worship attendance of about 15% another 13% the year after i think this year we it was over 10% the first 10 minutes in that sanctuary you feel it oh yeah it's it's a totally different atmosphere than when it was a a supper club that wasn't working and the growth isn't just local reverend Atkins now oversees 300 disaffiliated churches and he says they're witnessing an overall rise in attendance baptisms and professions of faith and the United Methodist Church is also moving forward in May it unveiled a new mission statement love boldly serve joyfully and lead courageously it means that it embraces and includes people of every age nation race gender and walk of life the church's inclusive approach like a new queer theology course has led to a rise in LGBTQ leoty applying for ordination they are wanting to be a resource to clergy and leoty to help them understand um what it means to be queer and whatever that theology is around um queerness this kind of thing absolutely uh makes me uh relieved that we did leave for First Church the decision to leave the denomination came after a series of meetings prayer and votes um and some congregations are still recovering um just from the pain that they experienced um but I would say now that we are on the other side of this affiliation um there is a greater sense of of unity and a greater um focus on our disciplehip church has gone through a lot um I've I've seen a lot of growth um but I can say that the spirit of this church is probably the healthiest it's been in a long time three years later churches on both sides are finding renewed purpose in the places where they feel most at home that's as a tale as old as the church itself in many respects uh there won't be one unified church until the second coming uh but hopefully we strive uh for that process of sanctification in the meantime in Sylum Springs Arkansas Paul Petit CBN News finally this week in a time when churches are closing Christian leaders from across Europe met in Berlin at the European Congress on Evangelism not just for a conference but for a wake-up call cbn's Brody Carter has the story [Music] [Applause] [Music] berlin is a city once divided by walls

And he just went crazy the easiest way to save money in our budget billions and billions of dollars is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts now here's what he's talking about elon Musk's companies got subsidies from the US government at least $ 38 billion in government help that's what Musk got his companies got $38 billion and Trump has threatened to cut that off but Musk was not deterred he asked Donald Trump to go ahead and make his day and after that came the big jab i mean jab is an understatement it was more like a fullblooded Mike Tyson punch let me quote from Musk's tweet donald Trump is in the Epstein files that is the real reason they have not been made public have a nice day DJT i'm sure you know the context jeffrey Epstein was a convicted pedophile multiple reports have linked him to Donald Trump apparently they used to be friends american officials have have released documents about Epstein they have these are documents they've not released they have documents about Jeffrey Epstein the US media calls these Epstein files now Musk is suggesting that Trump features in those documents which is why the president has not released them and this is a massive allegation musk is linking Trump to a convicted pedophile how did Trump respond well he did not directly address the allegation instead this is what he said i don't mind Elon turning against me but he should have done so months ago this is one of the greatest bills ever presented to Congress so Donald Trump dodged the Epstein claim he redirected attention to his spending bill but Musk did not let up he reposted a right-wing ex account and look at what the post said that Donald Trump should be impeached and he should be replaced by JD Vance now Musk reposted that saying yes as a final salvo he also attacked Trump's tariffs he said they would trigger a recession later this year after that post it seems the referee rung the bell the online attacks have stopped in fact Musk also appeared to take a step back a random ex user asked Musk and Trump to cool off and Musk replied saying &quot;Good advice.&quot; So that's where we stand right now it's a bit like the eerie silence after a tragedy frankly this breakup was always on the cards you had two very strong personalities in the same room one the most powerful person on the planet the other the richest person on the planet both are known for their massive egos so the breakup was always coming what's surprising is how quickly it happened i'll show you a post by Elon Musk this is from the 7th of February this is what Musk wrote on the 7th of February i love Donald Trump as much as a straight man can love another man this was just a couple of months ago and now he's calling him an ingrateful liar neither man comes out as the winner here musk says Trump is on the Epstein list if true then why did Musk spend millions of dollars to get Trump elected is that not blatant hypocrisy as for Trump this is like a role reversal bullying people on social media was his superpower but Musk seems to have overtaken him as the owner of X Elon Musk wields a lot of power which is why even Republicans are not openly taking sides and Musk knows this he reminded Republicans that Trump will be will only be president for three and a half years but it goes to very special people but that he would be alive for 40 more years it was a real threat aimed at Republicans the question is what happens next here well no relationship is ever over with Trump almost all his current allies used to be his sworn enemies so the criticism is nothing new the difference is Musk took the fight to Trump he did not just criticize the policy he launched scathing personal attacks on the president will Trump forgive that or will it unleash a streak of vengeance both men were expected to have a phone conversation today but Trump says he's not interested he says Elon Musk has lost his mind so I guess two things are possible now either there will be a truce or there will be an escalation our advice maybe Trump and Musk should consider trading with each other isn't that how Trump solves all conflicts trade more fight less let's see if he takes that advice [Music] first post now available in nine languages on [Music] YouTube english 36ion French German Hindi Indonesian Italian Japanese Portuguese [Music] Spanish go to settings click on audio track and select the language of your choice be the first to know what's happening around you in your first language [Music] first post" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="A look into how and why international laws and principles are being applied and ignored in the Israel-Gaza conflict.&#10;&#10;The events of October 7 sent shockwaves across the world and brought to the forefront once again a conflict that has been ongoing for 75 years. The Israeli government’s response to Hamas’s attack was prompt – it embarked on a war of magnitude in Gaza, claiming it needed to take out Hamas and rescue the captives. At first, the consensus of Western powers seemed solid: Israel has the right to fight back against Hamas. But more than five months later, Israel’s military was facing criticism worldwide, including allegations that it is committing war crimes, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and even genocide.&#10;&#10;This documentary will explore whether Israel is breaking international law and, if so, why are Western powers, in particular the United States, silent.&#10;&#10;Edited by: Jameel Hodzic&#10;&#10;Subscribe to our channel http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe&#10;Follow us on Twitter   / ajenglish  &#10;Find us on Facebook   / aljazeera  &#10;Check our website:  https://www.aljazeera.com/&#10;Check out our Instagram page:   / aljazeeraenglish  &#10;Download AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile&#10;&#10;#aljazeeraenglish #palestine #documentary" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] it's an extremely cynical moment for international law it's an extremely devastating moment for the Palestinian [Music] people there are rules under international law and no matter which way you look at this Israel is in violation of those rules as of the 7th of October there is not one Norm of international humanitarian law that has not been violated I never imagined that in my lifetime I would see a genocide taking place in real time before my eyes the fact that it is being protected by most western governments takes it to a level that I just never imagined would be possible I come to Israel with a single message you're not alone you are not alone Canada will always be a friend of Israel and defend its rights including its right to [Applause] exist and Israel has a right to defend itself in fact it has the duty to defend its people as your friend we will stand with you in solidarity we will stand with your people and we also want you to win if one looks at our political leaders today and all of our mainstream politicians they are the most mendacious the most mediocre the least talented group of politicians that I can remember during my almost 60 years on this Earth it it is astonishing just How Deeply corrupt materially and morally they are because many of them be through donations to their political parties donations to them personally donations to their organizations like the labor friends of Israel the conservative friends of Israel the Democratic friends of Israel the Republican friends of Israel and the multiple and Myriad other organizations like that they provide an extremely good living for that person and for those political parties thank you for having me and uh I'm looking forward to having a thorough discussion about where everybody goes from here every day in the depth and bread of cooperation the West is intimately involved in Israel's genocidal campaign in Gaza for months we have seen us officials affirm time and again that there are no red lines for Israel using exactly that language uh when of course we know that international law draws many red lines and yet the US has come out in Stark opposition granting Israel full authority to proceed and to create As Much Death and destruction as it sees fit battle it's America's battle I'm shocked by the lack of action of the International Community I'm shocked by the hands raised by the US ambassador in the security Council voting against Asis fire vetoing Asis fire I'm shocked by the lack of action of principled States who need to take again a principled concrete stand against this aberration and start thinking of [Music] sanctions what we've seen is that the laws of war are used against weaker parties but if your ally is the United States and if your ally can veto any Security Council resolution and if your allies are the European States then the chances that the IC will bring you to Justice are very very slim the international court of justice is a court that renders guilty the losers in a conflict it is a court of the victors and a court that has double standards for the allies of the powerful and for those that it thinks of as its enemies The View that South Africa's submission to the international court of justice is some sort of anti anti-semitic screed and blood liel this is nonsense that you couldn't make up and the nonsense that is being enunciated constantly not just by the Israelis but that is then parroted by the US government the UK government the German government the French government Etc and this is being done to defend the indefensible to defend the slaughter of tens of thousands of innocent civilians to to defend attacks on Health Facilities on residential homes on places of worship on places of work we are seeing a genocide taking place in Gaza well truth the matter is if there weren't an Israel we'd have to invent one the truth of the matter is that I believe that you as I went home and said got in trouble it's the time but it's true you know you don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist you don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist it's the International Community and it's powerful member states like particularly the the us but in general Western countries which is still pilot and it's evident in The veto power that some member states can exercise within the UN three of those member states are from the West it tells us something no African countries has a VTO power in the United Nations system it's the entire system which is not fully representative of where the world is today but I would like to see this changing we need to think of better mechanisms not only inside the law but how the law is applied to ensure that there is no double standards so it's both a changing of the laws to so so that they uh address the current circumstances but also the institutions the judicial institutions that apply the law so that they don't apply it with double standards and we will continue to actively engage in the hard work of direct diplomacy on the ground until we reach a final solution the destruction of over 70% of Gaza the killing of over 30,000 Palestinians including 13,000 Palestinian babies and children the injuring of uh around now 70,000 Palestinians and the destruction of almost all of the civilian infrastructure in Gaza international law prohibits this completely we have to remind the world that there are at least in theory rules which Israel must abide by and which it is violating the IDF is doing anything they can in order to minimize the uh culties when it targets the the military targets but again we are in a war in a war civilians got H you will never see the IDF Target shoots down a civilian you will never see a group of children walking on the beach of Gaza and Israel Target them specifically or an old lady crossing the street and Israel shoots the old lady Israel does not Target civilians Israel targets military targets Israel targets terrorists and when these terrorists surround themselves with civilians with this little children with this old lady with this old people these civilians might get hurt but it's not on the fault of Israel it's on the fault of the one who surrounded himself with these civilians the one that use them as human Shields [Music] the argument of the human Shields of Palestinians in general being uh eager to sacrifice their own children as human Shields has been used and dismissed over and over the first one to dismiss this argument was Richard uh Goldstone the the head of the first Commission of inquiry over the first war in Gaza and it has been disproven over and over where is the evidence [Music] Israel's instruction to the Palestinians first to move South and then to move west and then to move north but basically that instruction which has displaced 1.8 million people tells the Israelis that any civilians that remains in that area or Israel assumes that any civilian that remains at that in that area is either a participant in hostilities and therefore can be killed or a human shield namely someone that is being used to Shield a legitimate military Target and that allows Israel to relax the repertoar of Le lethal violence that it uses against these people and in a court of law that can be used to justify the wholesale killing of civilians Israel does more than even it's required it drops fly uh over Gaza to tell the people to vacate the area it makes phone calls to residential um civilians to vacate the area uh Israel calls to vacate the area once Israel took this precautions it's allowed to take down the building [Music] if civilians prefer to stay they take the uh their own [Applause] responsibility this is a complete Distortion of international law if you consider also the fact that Israel is an occupier which I think is the relevant legal framing here Israel has obligations under occupation law um not only to end the occupation which has now been ongoing for 56 years but also to protect the occupied people and we also know that Israel has no right to claim self-defense in accordance with article 51 of the UN Charter with respect to attacks emanating from a territory that it occupies and this notion was upheld by the international court of justice in its 2004 ruling on the legality of the wall and so regardless of which way you look at this there is absolutely no legal defense to committing a [Music] genocide andal and Mazon and [Music] M we have the president of the state saying there's no innocent civilian or there's no uninvolved civilian in the Gaza Strip so these kind of remarks do point at it intent and the if if it gets to a court of law then these kinds of remarks become very important in terms of the genocidal aspect of this war a lot of people in Israel will not feel bad for the Palestinians but yet the leadership in Israel feels for the Palestinian people and they allow whatever the minimal uh humanitarian Aid to be provided to the population in Gaza [Music] [Music] [Music] the law does create a vision of a certain kind of justice that we want to Aspire for we want to Aspire towards a world where human rights for all are protected the immense scale of suffering in Gaza there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks which is what is currently on the table does human rights law give us the tools to achieve human rights I'm not sure because of the interests of powerful states because of the double standards that are applied in the international Arena and therefore if it gets to court often the human rights do not win the day and so we need to think of other mechanisms to achieve these human rights [Music] the problem is not the law the problem is with the enforcement of the law and in in the Middle East and in the global South I would say uh the problem is that law is closer to political convenience than to Justice as a European I'm very sorry to say 500 years of colonization has left a huge imprint in our DNA in general Western people are not able to assess objectively what is what is being done through the non-application of international law or through the discretionary application of international law it's terrible to see the dismantlement of international order premised upon international law piece by piece [Music] manen it's unclear absolute Victory will look like when you've destroyed already 70% of Gaza when the overwhelming majority close to 2 million Palestinians are displaced um it seems to me that absolute victory means the the total decimation of Gaza to the point that it's completely uninhabitable and the depopulation of Gaza which Israel has told us time and again uh in this current moment that that is their goal that their goal is the depopulation of Gaza and um the settlement of Gaza by Israeli settlers of course in total violation of international law Israel does not Bridge the international law Israel keeps strictly very very strictly all the rules of law according to the international law why a country should be above scrutiny I mean no one should be the international law is there to be applied universally and not just for cherry picking because this this forms as I often say human rights protection into protectionism and this is unacceptable for me the the idea that the law will lead to Liberation or emancipation or Palestinian self-determination is a fiction human rights is not necessarily the the tool I think the tool needs to be more political in the sense of divestments in the sense of sanctions in the sense of boycotts to use this kind of Arenal of nonviolent weapons to pressure Israel to bring about changee freeee [Applause] [Music] Israel about 12 or so years ago realized having been so close to apartate South Africa the very real threat that BDS posed to the existence of the Israeli State as a racist occupying State and they created a ministerial Department called the department for strategic Affairs specifically to counter the BDS movement and what was the strategy that they hit upon it was to ensure that any criticism of Israel any criticism of its occupation any criticism of its behavior in the occupied territories was made equivalent to anti-Semitism and they have been remarkably successful at doing that there is no other argument than accusing us of anti-Semitism so as to deflect the attention from what matters the most from what our analysis insists upon for decades now I'm not surprised that Israel recurs to any strategies it can to uphold its goals to reach its objectives but I'm surprised that International Community joins this action because today you are not just attacked by Israel for being an anti-semitic if you just ask for the application of international law to Israel Israeli actions it's many many Western countries who do so and they betray also what anti-Semitism has really been The Surge of anti-Semitism in the United States of America and around the world is sickening you know we see it across our communities in schools and colleges and social media they surface painful scars from Millennia to hate of hate to genocide of the Jewish people every time I get accused falsely accused of anti-Semitism I respond I don't stay quiet I don't get intimidated I become louder and louder and by doing so I think I also Inspire other people to do the same I'm Jewish my mother was one of 20 odd survivors of the Holocaust so to describe me as anti-semitic given my history of anti-racism and my work on genocide prevention my invoking of the Holocaust of which my mother's family were victims it's simply an absurdity the so-call Western world is prepared to sacrifice the entire architecture of international law that has been put in place post World War II specifically to prevent there being another genocide like the Holocaust we are prepared to rent all of that aunder so that Israel can continue to murder 247 Palestinians on an average day 48 of whom will be women and 117 of whom will be children we're prepared to throw it all out that's the point of Crisis that our politics are at now and it is up to all of us who recognize that to actually create a counternarrative to the nonsense that is spewed by our politicians to maintain their own place in this appallingly corrupt and malfunctioning political system we have we continue every single day to wake up and insist on freedom and life in the face of genocide and there's simply nothing more dignified that anybody can do in such a hopeless and desperate moment I don't believe it's going to be sustainable to continue to prevent Palestinians from their right to Freedom [Laughter] [Music]

          <attvalue for="7" value="rabbi David Feldman thank you so much for sitting here with us today and we're filming this interview at a time where student activists across the US are being arrested for their pro Palestine activism with claims that they're being anti-semitic what's your take on all of this well accusing people who stand up for the oppressed people who say something when they see crimes taking place uh this is not this is not anti-semitic you know doing what's right and speaking up for the press is not anti-semitic in any way um when these people when these students it's not only the students it's so many other people are being attacked with the with this false accusation of anti-semitism uh this is disturbing because in in the time as you say in the time that we we see this genocide going on in Gaza so many people tens of thousands of people are being mass murdered innocent people uh this is something that us people in the free world should say something this is injust this is unjust for the people of Palestine that that this voice is attempted to be silenced but it's not only doing injustice for the Palestinian people this is doing injustice for the Jewish people as well because when you conflate Judaism and Zionism you conflate anti-Zionism with anti-semitism you're making a statement as if all Jews support all what's going on and as if all Jews are accountable to what's going on but we always need to know better than that and we try to educate people to understand that anti-ionism has nothing to do with anti-semitism because Judaism and Zionism are not the same judaism is a religion zionism is a political movement should never be conflated yes and New York is one of the hot spots shall we say of Judaism with over 2 million Jews living in this city and as you say some of them are anti-Zionist but meanwhile some of them are support the state of Israel and you know identify as Zionist and sometimes we see them confronting you because of your stance what's your take on them well f first of all as you say New York is a very good example uh yes there are a lot of Jewish people in New York many of them support Israel but there's a massive community who is anti-ionist and people might not know because the mainstream media would never show you that like for example there was a couple of years ago there was a huge mass uh anti-ionist rally a Jewish anti-ionist rally in front of the Israeli consulate on 2nd Avenue Manhattan and then CBS would announce that there is a traffic jam on Second Avenue and they would not say what the reason is in other words they purposely intentionally ignore what is going on so many people have no idea but there there is a massive uh religious Jewish anti-ionist community who are outspokenly uh against Israel um but but uh what's what what's important to understand is that these not not everyone comes out in each and every occasion as you say intimidation is massive uh pressure is enormous uh I I I always tell this story uh I had a very close friend of mine comes over to me once and and tells me I'll do everything I can to support you to support your activities but there's no way I can come out in person i run a huge business i come out in person they take a picture of me I close down the business the same day but uh but still the the anti-ionism is is is strong our communities are very strong and you can you can imagine if it wouldn't have been for those massive communities but that will be behind us we would not be able to be out there in these numbers and this uh so frequent and do so much yes you have huge numbers behind you but also we're seeing Zionist groups like Betar recently becoming more emboldened and seeking to confront you can you speak on the activities of Zionist groups such as Betar well Betar to begin with I'm not sure how large they are how strong they are uh they might be very uh uh wild they might be very uh aggressive uh we didn't see them in large numbers uh but yes they are very aggressive they're coming out uh in public intimidating harassing demonstrators happens to be peaceful demonstrators you know these these demonstrations taking place in New York City that that we all attend uh these are not dangerous demonstrations and uh these people will always claim that the pro Palestinian solidarity movement is dangerous uh and so on yeah and sometimes they approach you they tell you things like &quot;You should go to Gaza you won't be safe in Gaza.&quot; How do you respond to that oh that's that's that's a good point what they say is &quot;Yeah go visit Gaza.&quot; And they always they also say you know go to the Arabs they will kill you first and I always respond to that and usually these these arguments end up with nothing because they they they don't know what's going on whatsoever and and I try always to tell these people and people who who are willing to listen and some people are willing to listen and I tell them you know why are you so scared from these Palestinian people they don't hate you they don't want anything they just want their freedom we can live in peace with them we lived in peace with them before Zionism came they were always respectful for Jews and they still are but in the same time they are deeply upset and against the crimes being committed to Palestine which doesn't make these people anti-Semitic doesn't make these people dangerous for Jews while in the same time yes those people are vehemently opposing this uh occupation of Palestine now when when you find when you find people on the street uh protesting the genocide in Gaza this is not about protesting the Jewish people this is not about protesting the Jewish religion this is about crimes and they which which they are opposed to and we as Jewish people share their uh frustration and we share their pain of people who are disturbed when all of this is taking place what about what do you say to those who maybe agree with what you're saying but also say that um Jews Jewish people need a strong Israel to be safe this is this is one of the arguments that the the Zionists are using that uh Jewish people suffered in the Holocaust uh we were in we are in exile for the past 2,000 years it's about time for us to have a safe haven uh and most of the time this is being uh religion is being used into these conversations they are trying to use religion some concepts of the Jewish religion to justify this claim but what one needs to understand is basically two points first of all this is not Judaism according to Judaism we are forbidden to create this so-called safe haven for the Jewish people according to the very basics of Judaism there's a concept of Jewish exile which is a divine decree which we are forbidden to end by any physical means even if we find that this building is a safe haven would be in our favor according to our religion this is forbidden we accept the decree of God whether it is comfortable or it isn't we accept the word of God that we should not end this exile by any physical means and we leave this up to God for him to end our exile this is exactly what Judaism teaches us that it's only God god himself that will bring the ultimate redemption where all humanity together will serve the one God in peace and brotherhood zionism is forbidden safe haven is Zionism but I have to add this other point all of this would be true even if this would have been the safe haven for the Jewish people even if this would have been the favor of Jews um but it happens to be that the state of Israel is the greatest danger for the Jewish people while we lived in Palestine in peace it is the occupation of Palestine which has destroyed this peace and and in in addition we have to I have to add that coming back to the previous point even if this would have been in the favor of the Jewish people we should never oppress another people we should never harm another people because it might be in our interest certainly very interesting points you're making there philosophically and religiously very interesting arguments but uh Zionists often use religious arguments to justify the existence of Israel how do you respond to those claims and also uh Zionists equate Judaism together with Zionist Zionism and how what's your take on that zionists are conflating Judaism with Zionism because they need Judaism to support their movement of Zionism but what happens here is something very ironic and very hypocritical you have a movement of Zionism which is officially a secular movement it's not only secular because the founders of Zionism and the people to Zionists today are not only secular they basically many of them hate Judaism they hate God and his religion for example I have a friend of mine uh who grew up in Zionist education grew up in Jerusalem and he told me that what he was taught is that we the Jewish people have two enemies now guess who the two are in who the first is the first is the religious Jew and the second is the Arab now both of this is wrong the religious Jew is not is is is basically the Jew uh but this is how they hate religion the Jewish religion and they hate religious Jews and and and which which just shows you how far away they are from Judaism but that movement the movement of Zionism who is secular and who refuses to follow Judaism they misuse this very same religion they refuse to follow and they misuse it to justify crimes which are forbidden in this very same religion because killing and stealing oppressing an entire people all of this is forbidden in Judaism and as I said before the whole concept the idea of Zionism to build a sovereign homeland for Jews is in total contrast of Judaism now see seeing a secular movement misusing the religion doesn't make sense in the first place but what my response to those people is we can only explain and educate that while you are misusing the Jewish religion the Jewish religion in each and every way is in total contrast to this movement of Zionism and when we take a take a look at what's happening right now overall in the Middle East with President Trump taking office he ran as being a president for peace and he promised that he can bring peace not only to the Middle East but to Ukraine and many other regions how is your take on how his administration their policies have been so far and do you have hope for peace now I I I'm not a politician now i'm not sure exactly uh what can be done in each and every conflict around the world uh but when it comes to Zionism it comes to Palestine uh what we are presenting is we are presenting the view of Judaism of our religion and yes we do uh see the approach that our president of the United States has has taken uh we always say to politicians we appreciate when politicians or individuals extend the hand for the Jewish people we definitely appreciate but we try to educate and to explain that supporting Israel is not in favor of the Jewish people supporting Israel is is is doing so much harm to the suffering people of Palestine and so much harm for the Jewish people we do everything we can to explain to educate that Judaism is not Zionism and in this climate when some are afraid of speaking out as you said they're worried about losing their businesses how important is it for Jewish voices like yours to speak out for Palestine well it it is extremely important for us to speak up for many reasons first of all the people the oppressed people of Palestine deserve that people in the free world should speak up and without Jewish people coming out the rest of humanity is being intimidated of being anti-Semitic this is one of the reasons why it's so important for Jewish people to c to come out and to uh help people overcome this propaganda and and understand that this is a human uh cause this is a righteous cause this is a cause that uh needs to be addressed uh and we all share this uh this very important cause mhm and in addition to this this is so important because we have to break this stereotype people should should know that not all Jews take part in this no Jewish people who are right-minded people disagree with all of this the state of Israel does not represent us is certainly doesn't represent our religion if there is a group of people supporting these crimes you know that's that's their that's their own decision but this is not the voice of the entire Jewish people when you speak to Jewish people who are kind of on the fence they're not Zionists but maybe when they see you they see that there's an alternative path they can take can you speak to those conversations maybe not some who are set in their ways but some who you can actually change their perspective there there are many people especially since October 7th so many people are waking up so many people are seeing something new that they didn't realize until now you know until now everything was like okay but now they they are waking up to see that something is wrong and and these people are willing some of them are willing to listen in my experience the Zionist propaganda is so strong and so massive that even if you would find some people who are not supposed to be Zionist who people who in essence are not Zionists but the movement of Zionism has managed to confuse the masses the Jewish people are in danger it's those enemies of ours who seek to destroy us all and they want to drive us into the sea from the river to the sea people are so uh h um disturbed by this slogan from the river to the sea and I speak to people and I try to explain them what do you think is the second half of this slogan from the river to the sea kill all the Jews and people say yes people believe that from the river to the sea Palestine wants to see all Jews killed which is which is so ridiculously wrong it doesn't make any sense and I always explain to people Palestine doesn't want to see Jewish people dead they don't even want to see all Jews expelled from Palestine that's not what they are saying all they want is total freedom for their people and freed their land and we have we we spoke to so many uh political leaders of the Palestinian groups so many religious leaders so many individuals layman people nobody says otherwise but unfortunately people following Zionist propaganda are so misled to the point that they even lose their mind to be able to figure out what's in the best interest for themselves let's let let's put the oppressed people of Palestine aside which is something that everyone should think about but even for their own interest like they they are fighting for the Jewish people and by doing so they are endangering all Jews like by supporting what Israel is doing this is not in favor of the Jewish people but I'm pleased to see that people are listening and we we do this already for decades but especially since October 7th people are opening their minds and you know they see that they have to rethink what they were programmed until now and they slowly open their minds and can you give a bit of a more personal perspective your family ha uh escaped Europe back in the days they escaped genocide so being a sort of a survivor of genocide what kind of responsibility does that put on you on your shoulders to speak out when it's happening we always say it's because it's our communities who suffered in the Holocaust it's our families who suffered in the Holocaust that's a lesson for us that we should not want to see this happen to anyone when we are seeing what's happening in Gaza this reminds us of the stories that our elders told us just a couple of decades ago uh uh one a number of my teachers were Holocaust survivors uh and and you know they they they were telling stories terrible stories and unfortunately we we hearing similar stories now this is something that should the the the Jewish history and the Holocaust should be a lesson for Jewish people how to refuse this genocide taking place in Gaza so turning to the future of Jewish and Palestinian solidarity what do you need what do you think needs to happen in the US so that more Jewish people support the Palestinian cause like you do basically they need information they need education they need to uh realize not only that what's being done to Palestine is wrong but even more importantly they need to know that Palestine is not the enemy of the Jewish people and they never were uh there there's a massive propaganda that is ingrained in their minds from their very young age but this needs to be uh corrected mhm and once this will be corrected we can we can get quite uh we can proceed further and going forward some people are very unhopful for the future of Gaza what do you see happening now that the ceasefire has been broken again the Netanyahu government seems to be uh seems to want to keep pushing to exterminate the Palestinian people from the land what do you see happening i'm not sure exactly what's going to happen in Gaza i hope for the best but generally speaking with Palestine uh I I I I see I see a better future why because we see at least since October 7th even before people are waking up the general public is changing their views public opinion is shifting uh maybe we have to give credit to Netanyahu for waking up the people i always say uh it's so sad when we have to pay this terrible price for people to wake up so many people so many tens of thousands of people need to be murdered for people to finally wake up but this is what's happening but while they're waking up on one end but also on the other end here in the US there's a lot of crackdown against pro Palestine demonstrations as we mentioned earlier people are getting snatched of the street do you have any worries for you for your community because you're standing up for Palestine could something happen to you well it can happen it can happen but but to be to be clear here this is not showing uh that that it's not being successful on the other on the other way around we see this a success if there is no response to the pro Palestinian solidarity movement other than physically cracking them down then this is an achievement in other words there's no other uh reasonable response and how has this response been has there been threats against you against your community well we have threats from time to time we have physical attacks from time to time it's okay it's okay you know we we expect this to happen we expect that the other side is strong and aggressive uh but again this is encouraging because this is all they can respond with uh they have no logical or reasonable or religious argu proper religious argument to make so in the face of threats you're actually saying that this means that your activism is working because now people are getting worried and they're taking backlash against you but we're also seeing backlash to students such as the Turkish student who was recently arrested Romesa Mahmud Halil a student from Colombia who perhaps you demonstrated with very closely what's your message uh to these students out there who are maybe worried and who are looking for guidance on what to do in this time well all we can say is yes it's difficult yes it's challenging but in the same time we all of us know that what we are doing is right uh I cannot necessarily advise people exactly what to do what not to do that's the choice of the individuals uh in the face that we can face uh backlash but we are doing we are speaking up for humanity we are doing a righteous deed we please God by our acts and this is what needs to be done now who should be those doing it that's up to the individual and can you talk about a bit about your experiences when you went to Gaza or when you've been to other countries in the Middle East how were you received by the people there perhaps like you can explain it in a way for other Jewish people who've never been what would their experience be if they went this is a this is a very important question because our personal experience is shocking for general Jewish people we visited Gaza and this was after the beginning of the siege this was in 2009 uh Gaza is the most affected people from this conflict from this war and people were questioning before we went whether it's going to be safe because after all you know these people should uh be dangerous to people who harmed them but this wasn't the case they knew exactly who we are who we were they knew that we're not enemy they had no problem with us as Jewish people we visited we met Ism Khan who was the prime minister of Gaza at the time and uh he said to us privately in a meeting and then publicly in a press conference he said &quot;We have nothing against the Jewish people neither against the Jewish religion we are against the occupation.&quot; This makes simple sense i always take these stories back to our communities and I tell people Palestine is not dangerous to the Jewish people i visited Gaza i visited many other Muslim countries frequently I visit Muslim or Arab conventions and guess what i came home alive it's not dangerous at all people need to know this and people who only follow mainstream media or Zionist media generally speaking they don't have even a chance to interact with any Palestinian or Muslim to to have personal experience which is it's very unfortunate because their information is being built on fabricated propaganda versus facts on the ground" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="let's talk about why Palestinians in East Jerusalem are losing their [Applause] homes Jerusalem is a place unlike anywhere else in the world an ancient city that's considered holy in Islam Judaism and Christianity it's also home to Israelis and Palestinians who both claim the city as their Capital although Jerusalem's status has never been settled nor has the issue of a Palestinian State you have both Israelis and Palestinians that live within the a shared City but that city is not necessarily shared to the fullest extent East Jerusalem is the S side of the city that's considered Palestinian territory under international law but it's under Israeli military occupation and for years we've been seeing things like this Palestinian families being evicted from their homes their houses are getting BN down at the same time Israeli settlements are expanding with every eviction every demolition the space for Palestinians in East Jerusalem is steadily shrinking the Israeli government has often said these are just real estate disputes but when you speak to the people involved it's clearly so much more than [Music] that the Arabs that they say this is Palestine they lie the Bible says this land belong to the Jewish people there are so many layers to what's going on so we've come to East Jerusalem to help you get a sense of what's actually happening and why [Music] nura gate sublaban is taking us to the apartment where she was born and had lived her whole life until she was evicted in July 2023 she fought a long legal battle that went all the way to the Israeli Supreme Court eviction cases like noras are mostly being driven by Israeli settler organizations these are well-funded groups that promote Jewish settlement in Palestinian neighborhoods in nura's case a settler group obtained ownership of the proper and then built a case to kick Noah out even though she had what's called protected tency we'll explain that later to understand what's going on in case's like noras we need to take things back to 1948 after Israel proclaimed itself a state on land that had previously been Palestine under British control five Arab countries went to war with Israel and there was a massive displacement of people including more than 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes this was also a period when hundreds hundreds of thousands of Jews were being expelled from Arab countries the war ended with a set of agreements that divided the land between Israel and Arab controlled territories separated by what's called The Green Line Jordan controlled the West Bank Egypt controlled Gaza and Jerusalem was split in two Israel controlled West Jerusalem Jordan controlled East Jerusalem which includes the old city a waloff area where the main Rel religious sites are in 1967 there was another war and Israel seized and occupied more land including East Jerusalem and the West Bank but the 1949 green line still represents the internationally recognized borders of Israel so technically the green line runs through here dividing West Jerusalem and East Jerusalem but in practice you can see there's no actual separation here and Israel applies its own set of laws on both sides even though according to inter international law East Jerusalem is Palestinian territory under occupation so it's not considered sovereign Israeli territory and under international law the occupier is supposed to stick to certain rules thank you an occupying power is not allowed to apply its own legal system in the occupied territory un occupying power is not allowed to transfer civilian populations from their homes or to deport them Israel still continues to do that the wrong law is being applied and the wrong courts are being applied and it's through the Israeli court system that evictions are being enforced in East Jerusalem since 1970 it's estimated that more than 160 families have been evicted right now another 200 families around a thousand people are at risk the eviction process usually starts with settler groups obtaining ownership of a property where Palestinians live and there's one Israeli law that's really important here the legal and administrative matters law and essentially what it does is it affords land restitution rights to Jews who allegedly owned properties in East Jerusalem prior to 1948 what does that mean it essentially grants them the right to reclaim assets that they lost in the 1948 War now it is extremely discriminatory because there is no parallel legal mechanism for Palestinians who lost properties in the same War so if we go back to Norah's case an Israeli settler group was able to claim ownership of the apartment based on that law but Norah still had a right to live there because she had that protected tency we mentioned earlier it's a type of long-term lease that Jordan granted to Palestinian refugees while it was in charge of East Jerusalem after Israel took over in 1967 Palestinians like Norah's family were allowed to keep those leases but under strict conditions once settlers got the rights to no's apartment they spent decades trying to convince the Israeli courts that she'd broken those tency conditions and they finally managed to evict her in 2023 what we've seen is that over the years you have settler organizations or groups that have exploited and continue to exploit this 1970 law to acquire the rights or alleged rights to these properties and remove the protected tency from the Palestinian family they are radical settler groups that have a particular aim and goal which is to judaize or Israel eyesee Jerusalem it's not just these Fringe settler groups that are working individually and working by themselves they are aided and embedded by the state on all levels the Ministries the municipality and laws and courts are all instrumentalized in order to displace Palestinians as much as possible and H increase the number the Jewish population in Jerusalem this is a stated goal for Israel they are not shy about it especially in recent years as Israel's government has become increasingly right-wing and pro-settler politicians have been given senior positions people like itamar benir who became national security minister in 2022 he's a settler himself a member of the parliament and leader of a far-right party called Jewish power before he became a minister benir often came to the neighborhood of sh Shar to show his support for settlers he even set up a makeshift office right outside this house where the solemn family live recently a settler activist bought the rights to the solemn family's house and is trying to revive an eviction order from the 1980s that was never enforced and while Fatima and her family are fighting to stay in their home they also face harassment from settlers [Music] fore [Applause] [Music] most weeks there are rival protests in Shar between Palestinians and activists who support their cause and settlers Fatima is one of the regulars so is the settler trying to evict her yonatan ysf who's a member of the Jerusalem city council your house it's my house I because I buy from the people that they have documents that the this house belong to them I buy it and I have laws and according to the law this is my house I'm here because the Bible says this area all the land of Israel belonged to the Jewish people but today Jerusalem is important to Muslims to Christians to so many millions of people very important but it's belong to the Jewish so you've got settler groups pursuing evictions of Palestinians through Israeli courts that's one pattern playing out another is the way Palestinians are getting squeezed out of East Jerusalem through restrictions on construction and the demolition of homes that the Israeli authorities classify as illegal it comes down to the rules that Israel imposed after 1967 about how land is allocated and who can build what and where only 13% was zoned for Palestinian construction and residential development but those areas were already built up so there's no real space for new houses and building anything like an extension for a growing family requires a permit from the Jerusalem municipality the process can take years it's expensive and applications are very often rejected so many Palestinians build anyway without permits at least a third of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem don't have the right permits and are therefore considered illegal by Israel which puts all those Homes at risk of demolition Arya King is a prominent settler activist who's now a deputy mayor of of Jerusalem Arab are not above the law Arabs if they want to build legally they can build legally so one thing is having the option to build another thing is being granted the building permits and you know several organizations say that just doesn't happen for Palestinians Arabs should not come and cry why our house is being demolished when they choose to build illegally but they choose not to build with a permission because because they save time they save money and they don't pay tax it's not as if Palestinian families want to go and build illegally or unlawfully according to Israeli law it's that there is a near complete inability to obtain these these building permits the rate of approval is very very low compared to what is being built and what is being approved for Jewish Israelis you can see just the Stark the Stark disparity between that so just to give you an idea of where everything is up there is the old City this entire area is a Palestinian neighborhood of silwan you can see just how close everything is over on this side are several ongoing eviction cases and then down here this entire section is subject to an Israeli demolition plan it's called al-bustan and the Jerusalem municipality wants to redevelop the area and create a Biblical themed Garden that would link up to other religious and archae ological sites nearby there are more than a 100 houses here and most of them are considered illegal because they don't have the right permits even though Palestinians own the land like nidal Al rajabi who's got a demolition order on his house he sees the garden plan and all the technicalities around building permits as a pretext for something [Music] bigger [Music] fore so across East Jerusalem Palestinians are fighting to hold on to their homes and neighborhoods at the same time there's more money and more land being allocated for Israeli Jews to settle here 12 Israeli settlements have been built in East Jerusalem since 1967 over the years they've expanded and become established residential areas with lots of amenities like parks and schools it's been a while since any new Israeli settlements were built but that's now changing we are along the southern perimeter of East Jerusalem what we're seeing right now we're seeing a lot of the construction of the foundation and infrastructure on the area in Gat Matos Gatos is slated to be the first new settlement in East Jerusalem to be built in the past 20 years we're talking about thousands of housing units that are designated for Jewish Israelis um even though it is is surrounded by Palestinian neighborhoods you actually have basically a spotting a series of different settlement plans that are along the southern perimeter you see if you kind of connect the dots how it creates this entire wedge of Israeli settlement building you cut off East Jerusalem from the southern West Bank there is then no territorial contiguity necessary for a viable Palestinian state with a capital in in East Jerusalem that idea is Central to the so-called two-state solution that was agreed 30 years ago as the basis for Peace So a Palestinian State alongside Israel with East and West Jerusalem becoming their respective capitals global leaders still cling to the idea but in practice any kind of peace process has been dead for years and what's happening in East Jerusalem helps to confirm that so what's written here [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="What made you stop hunting them? Over the years I watched the forest shrinking. I realised if it continued then it would disappear and leave me with no income. So I’ve become a conservationist. The indri have become like family to me. Have people's attitudes towards the indri changed over the years? People used to think on the indri as a source of food. Now they are more aware of its rarity and it’s become a symbol of conservation for this country. Without Joseph to help us it would have been impossible for us to get near the indri. But this group is so used to him that they're not frightened. Indeed, it seemed to me that they almost welcomed his company. Thanks to him, I now had a chance for the very first time to get really close to them. They could easily collect these leaves from the trees themselves, but they seem to choose to take them from the hand of a human being. Well, that was an astonishing experience. 50 years ago I spent days and days and days searching the forest for these, following the noise, but now this group is so accustomed to seeing people around that might have been right close up to them. Something I have never believed could have been possible. The British resident in the Galapagos claimed that he knew from the shape of a giant tortoises shell which island it had come from. If it had a rounded front, it came from a well-watered island where it fed on lush ground plants. Where as one from a dry island, had a peak at the front which enabled it to reach up to higher vegetation. Were these tortoises, each on their separate islands, different species? And if so, was each one a separate act of divine creation? The differences that Darwin had noticed amongst these Galapagos animals were of course all tiny. But if they could develop, wasn't it possible that over the thousands or millions of years, a whole series of such differences might add up to one revolutionary change. On his voyage home, Darwin had time to ponder on these things. Could it be that species were not fixed for all time but could in fact slowly change. Our story begins with a tantalising glimpse of something very special, a cub just 10 days old. Wild cubs as young as this have never been filmed before. For their first six weeks, most cubs usually hide away in their dens, hardly glimpsing daylight. These are unusually adventurous. They seem totally unaware of the dangers. Although their eyes are just opening, they won't see clearly for another six weeks. They’re the mother's first litter, and they're going to be quite a test for her. The tigers must pick them up by the scruff of the neck. It's a delicate operation, a little too much pressure, and she'll hurt her cub. She can bite with a force of nearly 500 kilos, but this requires the gentlest touch. Tigers usually have two or three cubs, four are quite a handful and these already seem more challenging than most. The ratio between the sexes among newborns is usually equal. True to form two of these cubs are male and two a female. It will be rare indeed for all four of them to reach maturity. Many dangers lie ahead. At this size they make a snack for even the smallest predator. Their mother must make sure that everyone is accounted for. With two back in the den and one on its way, there's only one straggler left to worry. The cubs contact cry make sure he's not forgotten. As long as the cubs call their mother is compelled to keep retrieving them, but this would try any mother's patience The young Cubs life is very precarious. Had the mother been away hunting at a moment like this, the outcome could have been very different. She’s clearly going to be a devoted mother, but she still has a lot to learn, this is not the way to do it. Filming such behaviour is unprecedented. It gives us an extraordinary opportunity to follow these cubs as they grow. Its always seemed to me that fossils are some of the most romantic things on this planet. I mean if you came across a pebble like this for example, and you just happen to knock it with your geological hammer which happened to be around at the time, but if you just hit it with a hammer and split it and it opened like that, wouldn't you think that was remarkable? And that hasn't seen the light of day for 400 million years, and you're the first person ever to clap eyes on it. Isn't that the most romantic thing ever? I've certainly found it so. Where I lived in Leicester when I was a boy, I wouldn't find trilobites like that. But you did find things like this, this actually comes from Kimmeridge, but they’re ammonites and I collected them like mad, I would be off on my bicycle and sitting around in disused iron quarries just knocking rocks. And they come in all different kinds and sizes. And actually this particular piece is rather interesting. because if you turn it over, you see the outside of the shell of a simply enormous one. But these others somehow or other got stuck inside it. So fossils for me have always been thrilling. And I don't make programs out of some kind of proselytising view that people ought to be interested in. I do because I'm interested in them, and it gives me a huge pleasure. And I think other people can get pleasure from it too. An egg whatever it shape is an excellent life support system. But paradoxically, its success will ultimately depend on the ease with which it can be broken. The time comes when a chick must break free. Some species invested time building up large yolks. Their chicks will emerge fully feathered and ready to search for food. Others have not made that investment. They will have to spend their energies over the next few weeks feeding naked and defenceless chicks. But how do the chicks break out from the cramped confines of the egg? How come the shell that's been strong enough to protect the chick from the outside world, be also weak enough to allow the chick to break it? The first breath of fresh air outside the egg. A captive bred jungle fowl chick emerges. It's the climax of the eggs existence. The shell may look the same as when the egg was laid, but out of sight it's been changing. It's been getting thinner. The chick has been absorbing calcium from the shell into its own bones, making itself stronger and the shell weaker. Not only that, but it also used the shells calcium to create a tool to help it break free. A hard, jagged tip on the end of its beak, an egg tooth. The chick couldn't have broken free without it. Even so, he can still take hours, sometimes days, to hammer its way out of a shell This egg and this newly hatched little chick, are part of a clutch that was laid on the ground between 21 and 26 days ago, and they are just now hatching. This one is only about half an hour old. And this one is just beginning to peck its way out. And as they do, they communicate with one another, and the sound of a little chick encouraging that unhatched chick to break its way out the egg. So that within an hour or so the whole clutch is hatched and then they can run away as a little group and find safety. But what of the other woodland birds i was watching? The tits are breaking out of their shells into the British spring. They're naked, blind and hungry. But outside the woods are filled with food. And the parents careful timing has paid off. They took account of the weather and changed their behaviour and won. Each element of the egg combined to create new life from the nutritious yolk to the defensive albumen, to the protective shell. Nature’s most perfect life support system has served its purpose. Broken by the life that it sustained. Every new arrival is a confirmation of a complex efficiency of a seemingly simple egg. As with all forms of life, what we see are the success stories, the adaptations that work. So it's little wonder that we think of eggs as being perfect. But of the 10,000 different species of birds, that exist in the world today, there are still hundreds whose eggs have never even been described. When it comes to the most perfect thing in the universe, there's still much magic and mystery to explore. I'm on my way to the west of the island where a few small patches of that ancient forest still remain. These strange, beautiful trees baobabs are fire resistant and too big to cut down. So in many places they are the only remnants left of the original forest that once covered this land. It would have been difficult for a creature the size of an elephant bird to live without vegetation of some kind, and today, even the smallest of animals are struggling to survive here. One of those that have managed to do so is the tiniest of all known lemurs, It's called Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, and it was only discovered ten years ago. Melanie Dumhann is part of a team of scientists who are studying the animal, trying to work out how to protect it. Oh. It's tiny, tiny. Tiny, tiny. Just only 30 gram bodyweight. Yeah, smallest primate. Smallest primate in the world. Big eyes, small ears. Very big eyes. Yeah. And a wet nose. Yeah. Yeah. Melanie and her colleagues catch these lemurs and tag them to build up a picture of their behaviour, essential knowledge if they're to be properly protected. And how long will he have been in there now? A few hours. Is that all? So we collect him at night, you know, he stays in camp and sleeps in there, and then release him. And you've caught him how many times? Maybe around 20 over three years. So he's accustomed to it. He's accustomed to it And do they travel very far? They travel very far. Really? They have like three hectare home range. So that's quite a bit for an animal like that. Certainly is, yeah. Yeah. They might even run like five kilometres a night. Really? Yeah. An animal like that. I think that's amazing. Amazing. Yeah. OK, let's see him go. It’s coming. Come on. Come on, little one. That's it, thats it. You're off. The work Melanie and her team are doing is vital for the survival of this little lemur. It's also revealing just why it is that this tiny creature lives here and nowhere else. This particular liana belongs to a species that only grows in this patch of forest. And on it and on no other kind of liana lives this little insect, it's a bug which feeds by sticking its mouth parts into the liana and sucking out the sap. It then digests what it wants and excretes the rest as honeydew, a sort of sugary liquid. And it's that honeydew, that sugar that Madam Berthe’s lemur needs in its diet. So Madame Berthe’s lemur is only found in this particular part of the forest because of this insect and this liana, which just shows how complicated ecological connections can be and how much you have to know about an animal if you're really going to conserve it. Several troops of ring-tails manage to make a living in these highlands. Some of the luckier ones occupy a more sheltered valley where a few trees have managed to take root. Morning fog condensing on leaves is an important source of water. although the mornings still have a chill to them, life here seems more relaxed. But also more crowded. Pied crows need to be moved on, not least because there are some vulnerable arrivals in the troop. Almost every female is carrying an infant, an indication that life is comparatively easy up here. With more protection from the elements and a little more food, this troop is particularly large, and can devote plenty of time to their social lives. One female even has twins. A rare event amongst ring-tail lemurs and a direct result of a good food supply. But this valley troop still has to work hard to collect food in this broken landscape. Few lemurs are such good rock climbers. There's a real bonanza at this time of year. While some gather canopy fruits, the mother of the twins stays lower and gathers fresh leaves. The young are born during the fruiting season when demands on their mothers are heaviest. After such a heavy meal, the troop head off in search of their next course, a daily dose of dirt. Eating soil is thought to help with digestion, but it also provides minerals and even helps the lemurs to cope with troublesome gut parasites. A tree trunk is an extraordinary piece of biological engineering, it's packed tight with hundreds of metres of very thin tubing called Xylem. It's filled with water. And if I use this apparatus with a probe which goes into the trunk there, I can actually hear the water passing along those tubes. That low rumbling sound is actually the movement of the tree trunk in the wind. Those gurgles, that's the sound of the water traveling up towards the leaves. It's a process called transpiration. And it's particularly important in spring when the nutrients which are dissolved in the water, traveling along the tubes are needed to kickstart growth. If you cut a section of a tree trunk, you can see the pattern of concentric rings and each one of those rings represents one year of growth. In the paler part of each ring was laid down at the beginning of the year when conditions were good and growing was fast. The darker part was when growing was slowing down towards the end of the year. And indeed each ring can give you an indication of what the weather was like during any particular year. The broader the ring, the better year it was for growing. Counting the rings can tell you the age of any particular piece of wood. This is a section of an oak branch and it took 25 years to grow. This part of a trunk, 95 years old and this great tree is certainly a century or more in age. During all those years its leaves were sucking carbon from the atmosphere and storing it in this enormous trunk. This highlights the importance of the seasonal forest. Its trees are vital allies in the fight to control carbon in the atmosphere." />

          <attvalue for="3" value="The Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990) stands as one of the most complex and devastating conflicts of the modern era, driven by deep-rooted sectarian tensions, political power struggles, and major foreign interventions. This video explores the origins of the conflict, from Lebanon’s colonial past and demographic imbalances to the fragile National Pact power-sharing system. As the country’s Muslim population grew and Palestinian refugees poured in following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and later the expulsion of the PLO from Jordan, internal divisions deepened. By 1975, religious militias, economic disparity, and competing ideological movements exploded into a full-scale civil war.&#10;&#10;The video also examines how the conflict evolved into a regional crisis, with direct interventions by Syria, Israel, and Iran, and the emergence of Hezbollah. We delve into major turning points such as the Israeli invasion of 1982, the Sabra and Shatila massacre, and the Taif Agreement of 1989 that ended the war but entrenched sectarianism. Despite post-war reconstruction, Lebanon remains plagued by unresolved grievances, weak institutions, and ongoing external interference. With keywords including Middle East conflict, sectarianism, civil war, Hezbollah, and peacebuilding, this documentary provides essential context for understanding one of the most pivotal and enduring crises in international relations.&#10;&#10;VIDEO CHAPTERS&#10;00:00 Introduction and Titles&#10;00:41 Complex Civil Wars and Lebanon&#10;01:13 Lebanon: Location and Population&#10;01:57 A Brief History of Lebanon&#10;02:38 The Emergence of Political Tensions in Lebanon&#10;04:52 The Start of the Lebanese Civil War&#10;06:30 Foreign Intervention in the Lebanese Civil War&#10;08:26 The End of the Lebanese Civil War&#10;10:04 Lebanon Since the Civil War&#10;11:21 The Impact of the Lebanese Civil War&#10;&#10;SUPPORT THE CHANNEL&#10;If you like my videos, please subscribe or become a Channel Member.

          <attvalue for="7" value="The Lebanese Civil War was one of the  most complex conflicts of the modern era. Lasting for 15 years, it claimed at least 150,000  lives and displaced over a million people. And even today, its effects are still being felt. But behind it lay an extraordinarily  complicated web of religious tensions,   political rivalries, and foreign interventions. So what exactly caused the Lebanese civil  war, and just how was it eventually resolved? Hello and welcome. If you're new to the channel,  my name is James Ker-Lindsay,   and here I take an informed look at international  relations, conflict, security, and statehood. When we think of civil wars, we often imagine  two sides battling for control of a country. But whilst some civil wars may indeed  involve a relatively straightforward   struggle between two opposing forces,  many aren't nearly so straightforward. Instead, they can involve a wide array of internal  and external factions, all battling for power. One of the best examples in modern international  relations is the Lebanese civil war. Indeed, it's a testament to the  extraordinary complexity of some conflicts. Lebanon lies at the eastern  end of the Mediterranean Sea,   approximately ten and a half  thousand km or 4,000 square miles. Its immediate neighbors are Syria to the  north and east, and Israel to its south. With a current population of around 5.7  million, at the start of the war in 1975   the number of inhabitants lay around  2.7 million and was highly diverse,   with almost 20 different recognized  ethnic and religious communities. In addition to Maronite Christians and Sunni and  Shia Muslims, these included Druze, Armenians,   Alawites, Jews, Palestinians, and  numerous smaller Christian sects,   including Greek Orthodox, Copts, and Protestants. Lebanon has an exceptionally long and rich  history that spans thousands of years. In ancient times, the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans,   and Arabs all contributed to the country's  diverse cultural and religious heritage. Then in the early 16th century, it  was conquered by the Ottoman Empire,   marking the beginning of  400 years of Turkish rule. This lasted until 1920, when Lebanon  came under French rule following   the disintegration of the Ottoman  Empire after the First World War. However, 20 years later, this also  came to an end as France came under   Nazi occupation during the Second World War. Lebanon declared independence. At the heart of the new  state was the National Pact. This divided power between the dominant  religious groups in the country. Based on the 1932 census, which  showed a slight Christian majority,   it stipulated that the president  would always be a Maronite Christian,   the prime minister a Sunni Muslim, and the  speaker of the parliament a Shia Muslim. But while the pact provided a framework  for cooperation, problems gradually   emerged as the Muslim population increased and  demanded a greater share of political power. Additionally, another crucial factor now emerged. In 1948, Lebanon sided with  the Palestinians and other   Arab nations to attack the new state of Israel. However, when they were defeated, tens of  thousands of predominantly Muslim Palestinians   fled into Lebanon, further destabilizing the  delicate religious balance in the country. The first sign of trouble  came in 1958, when tensions   erupted between pro-Western Christian  factions and pan-Arab Muslim groups. Although the crisis was resolved through  US intervention and a short-lived United   Nations peacekeeping force, it was a crucial  sign of the country's escalating differences. By the 1960s, Lebanon was facing real problems. As the power-sharing system devised 20 years  earlier no longer reflected the country's   population, the Muslim communities,  particularly the Shiite population,   felt increasingly marginalized in a system  that cemented Christian political dominance. At the same time, significant economic  disparities also fed broader social tensions. While the Christians were seen as wealthy,   a substantial part of the Shiite  Muslim population lived in poverty. Meanwhile, the Palestinians  became a significant problem. Although Palestinian militants based in Lebanon  had long staged attacks on northern Israel,   this escalated dramatically in September  1970 when nearby Jordan expelled the   Palestinian Liberation Organization,  the leading Palestinian armed group. As the PLO now moved to Lebanon, this  further destabilized the country. As a result, by the mid-1970s the  situation had become precarious. Aside from the growing demands for  political, economic, and social reform,   the steady erosion of state authority  and the shifting demographic balance   all contributed to a profound  mistrust amongst the communities. As religious factionalism grew  and tensions escalated between   the Christians and Palestinians,  various armed militias now emerged. Ultimately, the turning  point came on 13 April 1975,   when Palestinian militants attempted  to assassinate Pierre Gemayel,   the leader of the Kataeb, or Phalangist  Party, the main Christian militia. In response, militants murdered  27 Palestinians traveling through   a Christian neighborhood in  the country's capital, Beirut. From there, things rapidly escalated as  the Lebanese National Movement, the LNM,   which comprised primarily of leftist  and Muslim factions, allied with the   PLO to oppose the Christian-dominated  Lebanese Front, led by the Phalangists. As the communities put up barricades to  seal themselves off, Beirut was quickly   divided into Christian and Muslim sectors  along the heavily fortified Green Line. In the months that followed,  things rapidly deteriorated. As the government's authority  collapsed and the national army   split into Christian and Muslim  factions, the militias expanded. In addition to the PLO, the  Phalangists, and the LNM,   at least a dozen other Christian groups emerged  alongside Sunni, Shia, and Druze armed groups. But as complex as things were, the situation  was about to become even more complicated. As the civil war intensified, what started as an  internal conflict soon drew in outside actors. In June 1976, Syria invaded, sending  in tens of thousands of troops. But while Damascus insisted that its  intervention was to restore order and   prevent a Palestinian-Muslim victory, which  many feared would prompt an Israeli invasion,   the Palestinian attacks on Israel  continued over the following decade. As a result, on 6 June 1982,  Israel finally invaded,   pushing northwards to the outskirts of Beirut. This prompted one of the worst atrocities  of the war, when Christian Phalangists,   supported by Israeli forces, attacked  two Palestinian refugee camps,   slaughtering up to 3,000 people,  including women and children. But while the Israeli invasion eventually  forced the PLO to withdraw from Lebanon,   it also marked the start of the  involvement of another new actor. Seeing an opportunity to take on its archenemy   and extend its influence over  the country's Shia community,   Iran sent thousands of troops to Lebanon to  arm and train a new Shiite militia, Hezbollah. Meanwhile, broader international efforts  to stop the fighting had little effect. This was graphically highlighted in October  1983, when Shia militants bombed the French   and US military contingents serving with the  so-called Multinational Force, leading to over   300 deaths and eventually forcing the mission  to withdraw from the country the following year. I hope you're finding this useful. If so, please consider giving it a like   and perhaps subscribing to the  channel if you haven't already. It all really helps. Thanks so much. And now, back to the video. By the end of the 1980s, Lebanon had  become a quagmire of competing forces. Indeed, throughout the war, it's estimated  that over 100 different factions emerged. To make matters even more complicated,  many of these would shift their positions   according to developments on the ground,  often forming alliances with other militias   that had seemingly opposing religious,  political, or ideological leanings. However, amidst the chaos,  things were beginning to change. After nearly a decade and a half of fighting,   it was increasingly clear that none of the  factions could secure an outright victory. More importantly, the Christians—once the  dominant force—were steadily losing influence   as Muslim militias controlled  large swathes of the country. Likewise, the international context was shifting. Against the backdrop of the end of the Cold War,  international pressure for a deal began to grow. In October 1989, the parties signed the National  Reconciliation Accord, commonly referred to as   the Taif Agreement, brokered by Saudi Arabia  and supported by the United States and Syria. This established the foundations  for national reconciliation by   redistributing political authority. In addition to diminishing the  power of the Christian president,   it ensured equal representation for both  Christians and Muslims in parliament,   alongside the gradual dismantling  of political sectarianism. More broadly, while it  affirmed Lebanese independence,   it also permitted Syrian forces to remain  in the country for a transitional period. While the agreement ended the  civil war, like many other   peace deals it encountered significant  challenges in the years that followed. For instance, in March 1991, an amnesty law was   passed pardoning all political  crimes committed during the war. Although supporters claimed that it was  essential for peace and reconciliation,   it meant that those who committed  atrocities would never be held accountable. Then there were also broader  issues regarding implementation. Although the accord called for the militias to  disarm, and most complied, Hezbollah refused,   arguing that it was still fighting  the Israeli occupation of the south. However, even after Israeli troops eventually  withdrew in 2000, Hezbollah continued to oppose   Israel, leading to another brief Israeli  intervention in 2006, and another in 2024. As for the Syrian troops, they remained  in Lebanon until 2005, when they were   forced out by a popular anti-Syrian uprising  that erupted after the assassination of the   former Lebanese Prime Minister, Rafik Hariri,  which many felt was carried out by Damascus. Although it should be pointed out that a later UN   tribunal concluded that there was no  direct evidence to support this claim. All told, the human cost of the  15-year civil war was enormous. Estimates suggest that 150,000 people were killed,   300,000 injured, and over  a million people displaced. All this in a country with a  population of fewer than 5 million. In addition, the physical destruction was immense. By the end of the conflict, large parts  of Beirut were little more than rubble,   especially along the Green Line. But while all this eventually led  to a massive reconstruction effort,   the war's lasting impact on Lebanon's  political landscape has been profound. While ending the immediate conflict,  the Taif Agreement has been criticized   for perpetuating the religious  divisions it was intended to address. Even now, deep distrust remains  between the various communities,   hindering efforts to build  effective state institutions. Likewise, efforts to implement  reforms have repeatedly stalled,   as rival political leaders prioritized  their own interests over national stability. And external forces, including Israel, Iran,   and Syria, have continued to influence  developments within the country. And it's for all these reasons that  the Lebanese civil war remains one of   the most prolonged, devastating, and  complex conflicts of modern times. Of course, Lebanon was just one of many conflicts  that have shaped modern international relations. Here are some videos on other wars  that have also had a profound impact." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="with Donald Trump back in the White House many are questioning whether the age of liberal democracy is coming to an end so what does a second Trump term mean for the United States over the next four years and what impact will its foreign policy have on the Middle East this week on upfront I ask those questions to peler prizewinning journalist and former War correspondent Chris Hedges Chris Hedges thanks so much for joining me on the front yeah Mark thanks good to see you uh now we are now officially at the beginning of the Trump Administration part two uh this is a president who has previously threatened to deploy the military against what he described as radical left lunatics he's told supporters that they might not ever need to vote again after his victory uh this is somebody who called for mainstream media Outlets to be investigated for treason uh what do you see as some of the most significant challenges that the United States is going to face over the next four years well you just named him except everything was put in place by the Democrats uh to begin with uh the party of censorship is the Democratic Party The Party of war is the Democratic Party The Party of mass surveillance is the Democratic party the party that turbocharged neoliberalism uh whether it was NAFTA the destruction of the welfare system the deregulation of the FCC uh the tearing down the firewalls between investment and Commercial Banks glass seagull is the Democratic Party all he has to do is flip a switch and he has an authoritarian State including of course all the executive orders those those pred Frey orders this is interesting because there are a lot of people watching who would see the policies you've laid out uh as the product of Republican administrations they'd say you know the shrinking of the government uh the expansion of the military that's Reagan's stuff they'd say you know Mass criminalization you know it happens because of Republican efforts to change the status quo they they would look at all these policies and say hey Democrats were complicit but this is rooted in republicanism no it's rooted in Jimmy Carter Jimmy Carter began it uh Reagan picked it up uh but uh the most seismic damage was done under Clinton perpetuated by Bush Obama and everyone else and what you had was essentially the merger of two parties into one party uh and that's why with the rise of what my friend Glenn Ford used to call Trump's white man's party uh you have so and you had a transformation which was the Clinton Administration was pivotable where the the the Democratic party transformed itself into the Republican party and the Republican party was pushed so far to the right it became insane and cultish and TR you have to think of trump as a cult figure not as a political figure uh and uh and so uh no the Democratic party is as or more complicit and then with the breakdown of the Republican party and its transfer of its Allegiance to Trump you saw the establishment wing of the Republican Party merge with the Democratic party Liz Cheney I mean Harris's vapid celebrity filled issueless campaign uh was you take it no prisoners today was promoting her endorsement by Dick Cheney a war criminal who left office with a 13% approval rating I mean it shows you how utterly out of touch the Democratic party has become but let's say the rule class I mean they live in an echo chamber which is perpetuated by the media so they actually don't have a clue about number one the damage that they've inflict their whole uh I mean 30 million Mass layoffs since 1996 and I I know half of my family comes from rural Maine I've seen what NAFTA does their reaction is not one I embrace but I understand the desperation the anger the legitimate anger uh the towns that like where my grandparents are from in Mechanic Falls main the bank is boarded up I mean I remember as a boy they were never made a lot of money but my grandfather worked in the post office and we deconstructing all of these institutions that once he had a pension he had a stable income that's vanished it's gone and the Democratic party is as complicit let me pause you for a second I want to drill down on some of these things you said a lot of really important things one of the things you you just talked about was an out of touch Elite uh we're certainly seeing a growing concentration of wealth and political power uh among a very small group of people uh I think most notably of the fact that Trump has assembled the richest set of advisers and cabinet members in American history they're worth a collective $450 billion and of course there's increased corporate influence uh and billionaire influence over the Democrats the Republicans over the whole political scene uh how how much of that context uh is important for understanding the future of American democracy is American democracy uh under threat because of this stuff under threat does it exist Mark I don't think it exists it's a veneer it's it's the end of the Roman Empire you have the symbols the iconography and the language of a democracy but internally corporations and oligarchs have seized all the levers of power I looked at this election as a battle between corporatists and oligarchs corporatists the Democrats they want something very different from oligarchs corporatists want stability they want decorum the kind of decorum that Obama had or bush had or as Bush was an idiot but at least he had some you know they could clean him up a little bit uh and Biden you know whatever his cognitive failings were uh they they because they want stability especially in terms of trade agreements because they make investments overseas takes a while for a return on a profit corporatists want something different from oligarchs oligarchs are about chaos they're about as Steve Bannon said deconstructing the administrative State why because it is a pure form of roner capitalism and by that I mean that they make their money by setting up toll booths Amazon you know all of these digital media platforms it's it's not about producing goods and uh the more that the state is deconstructed that's why they want to abolish the Department of Education everything that we need need as a civil society becomes privatized and you see it in uh I wrote a book called America the farewell tour begins in Scranton Pennsylvania where everything the sewer systems privatized the parking authority is privatized the electricity is privatized and of course they've jacked up the rates uh and the services are not very good and they want to privatize the post office uh so we can have a dysfunctional post office like the UK which is privatized and so that's what oligarchs want and the oligarchs have won they won and uh but that's what this battle was about in in terms of if we if we strip away its uh you know the the kind of trivia or the uh cultural differences between the two parties that at its core was what it's about and so we have as you point out I mean we have now an oligarchic system but as Aristotle wrote once you create an oligarchic system with those kinds of inequities then you our only two choices are tyranny or revolution you you you you talk about people choosing fascism uh people or the conditions being set for people to almost have no alternative choice and you've written about this this idea you wrote an article in fact that I thought was super interesting uh how fascism came uh now that term itself uh has it roots in melini's authoritarian rule in during World War One uh I think of brutal oppression I think of uh the crushing of descent uh is it not hyperbolic at this moment in history to say that that's what we're facing here well every fascist system has its own peculiar characteristics so you mentioned musolini that was rooted in ancient Rome and the glory of Augustus and all this whereas German fascism was rooted in tonic myths and uh Spanish fascism under Franco was something different uh Robert Paxton when he writes his book The anat of fascism he calls the clan the most authentic fascist movement in American history and and again Paxton in the book says that it won't come with Jack Boots and the swastika it will become with the Christian cross and mass recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance and I certainly came away after spending two years with a Christian right with a belief that these people that they had politicized and used uh Christianity to build a native fascistic movement uh of course grounded in white supremacist um and uh and and you've seen uh Trump has no ideology he's just a grifter but he has filled that ideological void with these figures like Mike hakabe uh you know who who calls the West Bank Judea and Samaria or uh the his un Ambassador who said you know they they suddenly US foreign policy is rooted in biblical myth but that's where we're headed um and so yes I see it as especially as the system disintegrates and in terms of voting for well I mean any totalitarian movement is grounded in magical thinking and and when the real world becomes so honorous so oppressive so exploitive uh and you engender that kind of Despair and all the writers of totalitarianism ground the rise of totalitarian movements Hannah Aaron fritzer all of them in despair which is what's happened to significant part of the country then you reach out for Magical thinking that's what Trump offers he he you know none of it is coherent but fascism is not really a coherent ideology thwe in his book male fantasy talks about how it's really at its core about hyper masculinity if you look at Trump as a cult figure in Margaret singer's book Cults and our Miss uh it's about endowing your cultish leader with omnipotent power to do anything let me push back a little bit because I I hear this a lot and and I don't disagree that there's a cultish uh t to much of what we see in in the Trump rhetoric and the rhetoric of his followers but sometimes I worry that using the language of cult makes it seem as if his followers are misled that they have the world wrong uh and that they're always operating against their interests what do you say to the person who says well look yeah that might be true in part but Trump is also advancing policy initiatives that actually are in line with their ideology whether it's the anti-lgbtq stuff whether it's the anti- Dei stuff uh there are people who fundamentally believe in what Trump is selling and they're not they're not being they're not being uh misled they simply believe things that are in line with his movement well th those are the cultural uh kind of targets that uh have been picked out to uh I think mendaciously explain the Despair and the economic am miseration that these people live in the the problem is Walmart the problem is Goldman Sachs the problem is City Bank the problem is but those people are not mentioned you're mentioning undocumented workers you're mentioning GB tlq you know people but let's be clear let's go back to the Democratic party that they abandoned the working class and they spoke in this kind of you know scolding uh virtue uh signaling wokeness uh rather than being rooted in uh the class war that has now largely been finished but the class class war against the Working Poor and the working class which they were part of so you have a reaction to uh this uh you know political correctness because it was used to demonize A working class that was you know being pounded to death and so yes there's a there's a reaction but none of it's dealing with the actual structures of power none of it's dealing with the reality of why they are where they are so yeah they all hate immigrants the way in Nazi Germany they hated Jews or the way in when I was in Bosnia the serbs hated the Muslims and the croats hated everybody and so uh yeah but that's that is about transference it's about the demonization of the other um so in that sense Trump is a complete grifter um like all demagogues is that what you mean when you talk about the failure of liberalism you you said recently fascism is always the bastard child of a bankrupt liberalism is that bankruptcy about abandon the working class yeah it's more than that but it is largely about that I mean I wrote a book called death of the liberal class and takes 250 pag why has liberalism failed uh I would go back to the Cold War uh so what you did is uh you created the Cold War liberal the Cold War liberal was used to eviscerate the left and remember with the breakdown of capitalism in the 1930s you had powerful especially Union movements the old CIO the wobblies the Communist party which we've written out of our history um we were just just talking about the great WB de Boyce and he was persecuted and stripped of his passport and arguably America's greatest intellectual I would say so um uh the uh the the the Distortion of liberalism and when Chomsky writes about liberalism correctly he says liberalism is allowed to exist within a capitalist order because it's a safety valve it urates the suffering enough to allow capitalism to go forward which is what FDR did FDR was pressured into the New Deal reforms by the left and that's not conjecture because I've read his private letters to his brother where he says if we don't push through these kinds of reforms including imp providing employment for 12 million Americans public works all this social security 8 hour workday all of that was being pushed by R sit down strikes radical unions and he said if we don't carry out these reforms we will get Revolution those are his words that was the fear the Spectre of the 1917 Revolution Loom large even in the 1930s over the Western world uh and that liberal class has been destroyed it was used uh to eviscerate the left the Cold War liberal and eviscerate and destroy those liberals especially with McCarthyism in the 50s and Ellen shreer has written some very good books on this um and so uh that creation of the foe I would call it the faux liberal the clintons are kind of classic figures like this where on the one hand they are the engine the political engine behind corporate oppression and on the other hand they're they're holding up you know their kind of you know pronoun uses and all their woke garbage uh you say woke garbage there are people who are going to hear that because you know that language of wul has been appropriated by the right in very particular ways to deny the legitimacy of uh lgbtq Humanity to deny the legitimacy of affirmative action efforts or integration efforts or you know the the language of woke itself has been sort of I mean you you hear Elon Musk using that word does it worry you to use that kind of langage no because what was wokeness wokeness was the corporations love it they love it you know so you know what is wokeness a woman CEO no it's about empowering workingclass women it's a complete inversion do you see wokeness as a kind of superfici superficial approach to dealing with identity politics or do you see identity politics itself I see identity politics is furthering the goals and the rapaciousness of the corporate State they've embraced it I mean you had years ago when AIDS you had what was it Bennington or I don't know which one one of these big abber I don't Calvin CL you know they had a HIV positive models I mean they obviously obviously I'm all for inclusion and respect and all that kind of stuff but wokeness in the hands of the ruling class has been used as a cudle to ass essentially uh punish and scold uh the the working class A and also about elevating their own but is it just the working class I mean it seems like it's also an attempt to hold uh the powerful accountable to whole corporations accountable for not for not being diverse not come on Mark we saw we saw that ad for the CIA you know what am I I'm a trans binary and I can torture people in Guantanamo too I mean you know who cares whether uh you know the people bombing uh the the Israeli Air Force pilots bombing Gaza in a in in the genocide are gay or trans or women who cares I mean it's it's it's it's superficial in a sense that it doesn't deal with the mechanisms of repression which for you are always economic they're primarily economic yeah I mean there the I mean the distortions within American society you can't maintain a democracy if you destroy your middle and working class you can't it's impossible and that's what we've done and so now we are facing the Spectre of this you know rolling kind of fascism and you're right people vote for it people vote for it out of Rage out of anger out of desperation uh I I don't I don't uh forgive some of the you know views of my relatives in Maine uh but at the same time I don't demonize them U it it's mostly based on ignorance um but I I don't I but but the the people I can't forgive are the people like Elon Musk or Trump I mean I mean let's be clear I mean these people are racists to the core I mean you know they they don't even try and hide it that much and they're also misogynists and everything else so uh it is it's a fail it's it's decoupling of ourselves from economic Injustice and look this is what the all the great even Martin Luther King at the end you know there will be no uh civil rights until they economic rights and he's killed marching with the garbage workers in Memphis I mean so and of course everybody and the Liberals all walk away from him I mean it's fine if you want to integrate Georgia cuz nobody can afford to eat where we eat in Manhattan so we don't care um but as soon as you talk about economic Justice they went for the door and King was as you know of course a very lonely figure at the end and a very courageous my amazing figure but very lonely because of that economic component is key and it's key to overcoming everything you and I care about and that's and and and building a system of justice but if you extract that drive for economic Justice then it becomes a kind of Boutique activism let me ask you something I want you to put your your Christian hat on for a minute you're actually ordained as a presbyterian Minister I don't that's not I don't make that public too much but it's all right your father was a minister I me you deep roots so um Trump's uh Victory rally there was a prayer said and it struck me and I immediately thought what would Chris Hedges say the person uh reading the prayer said president Trump we set the name of the Lord upon you and we declare that no weapon formed against you will prosper that every tongue that rises up against you in judgment will be condemned and if God be for you who can be against you and I said wow I've heard that that prayer a lots of times I've heard that scripture from Isaiah a lot of times in the black church and other churches didn't expect it to hear it said over Donald Trump when you hear it what do you make of it idolatry Malik worshiping the feet of Malik it's idolatry it's heresy it is it's the sacralization of human and political power which is probably the greatest sin any religious institution can make look the mega churches work like this and I learned this from Hannah Aon you have the and they have much better seats than we do in the Presbyterian Church they're comfortable they kind of recline they got nice music I mean nice it's all cheesy and lights and uh make you feel good but that is the the form of Indo what she calls indoctrination and all fascist movements do that they bring you into the warm embrace um I mean that's the propaganda sorry then they move you to the back room for indoctrination I went to both so I went to these prayer meetings and one of the things I saw in these prayer meetings was the the pain on the part of family members who had quote unquote been saved and their family members who weren't and and and they they occupy these mega churches occupy all your educational time your religious time your social time your leisure time whatever it is they are the and they demonize the children who aren't quote unquote especially if they're gay so my friend Mel White who uh founded Soul Force he would go down ordained minister he would go down to the steps of these mega churches and hold Memorial services for the the young gay people in that church who had committed suicide and he accused them of murder and it is murder so you know it it's their propaganda I I mean I I dug deep inside to this Leviathan called the Christian right call that I call American fascists and and Christian nationalists right I mean yeah the're complete nationalists and you know what they are is the ger they are are are essentially equivalent of the so-called German Christian Church established under the fascist in Germany where on one side you had the Christian cross and the other the Nazi flag and let's be clear mark this church is bankrolled by the very billionaire class that we talked about why because with magic Jesus you don't need labor unions with magic Jesus you don't need health care because magic Jesus is going to give you a Cadillac and and make all your dreams come true and then and that is that shift from a reality-based world into the world of magical thinking and once people shift into that world of magical thinking you can't reach them through rational argument it is that going to come through the Trump Administration 2.0 even more yeah that's these are the people who won they just won they won the first time too but yeah but Trump was totally unprepared unfocused he didn't now he's got Heritage 2025 I mean you've seen from you know they now they're organized I mean Trump is a very limited intellect very limited figure he's uh he's a Carnival Barker um and he he you know his his first Administration was dogged by one crisis and resignation I mean it was just chaos yeah that's different this time church and state the First Amendment ostensibly protects us from the mixing of the two there's a separation of church and state at a moment where you're saying the Christian right is overtaking the executive branch is the separation of church and state under threat um I I don't I I just I I kind of balk at calling them a church I there political movement I mean when I wrote my book I I was very upfront about who I was where I came from I graduated from Divinity School and what was fascinating is none of these people ever wanted to talk about the Bible with me because they don't know it they know those it's a kind of selective literalism where they know those passages that butress the ideology but they don't know the Bible well those ideologies that are shrouded in religious language will those things uh overtake other people's freedom this time around yeah of course because that's that's the fear is suddenly people's feelings about I mean the first week we see executive orders that define gender and sex in very particular ways that align with their Thou shalt Nots um how much of that are we going to see I mean as much as they can get away with I mean they they want to create a quote unquote Christian Nation uh they want to go back to you know it's this kind of fun it's a fake fundamentalism but you know the foundational ethics the quote unquote founding fathers I mean I I when you said that this was the greatest concentration of wealth and billionaire class I'd love to look back at the first the George Washington administration and all the slave holders and count up how much money they were worth because it was a pretty significant part of the economy that's that's that's an interesting point let let me pivot because I I have to talk to you about Gaza for all the reasons it's something you pay careful attention to uh you spent a lot of time uh obviously in Gaza during the seven years that you reported for the Middle East uh and this past uh this past summer you were in the West Bank yes uh writing your forthcoming book which is called a genocide foretold reporting on survival and resistance in occupied uh Palestine uh first I guess what do you make of this ceasefire and particularly the idea that uh president Trump played a pivotal role in making it happen Optics he wanted uh pause I mean I think the CE far it'll probably extend a little bit beyond that but it's really uh a pause in bombing for the presidential inauguration uh it will last I mean look you know the history of the Middle East pretty well too but every agreement Israel has ever made with the Palestinians has done in phases uh that whether that's Camp David whether that's Oslo whether it's all the ceasefire agreements and Israel gets What It Wants in the first phase and then violates every other phase that's a pattern they've never broken it so they want the hostage they want two things they want the hostages as many as they can get back and they want to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia and the so-called Abraham courts once they get that is I mean netan has already said it and the uh Trump's special Envoy the Middle East has already said it uh that if they quote unquote violate the Palestinians the agreement then the Mass Slaughter will begin and of course as soon as uh the Mass Slaughter was paused in Gaza they turned on the West Bank especially Janine so particular yeah they not done I mean you know anybody who thinks that their campaign of eraser and dispossession of the Palestinians is it's uh it we've and we've seen these kinds of pauses before so I think that I was you know I've been I worked a lot in Gaza I have a lot of friends in Gaza some of whom are dead some of whom got out and some of whom we had heard from from weeks they're probably buried under the rubble I mean I think for a lot of us who spent time there it's been really difficult emotionally to watch this live stream genocide and not just the indiffer of the United States but complete complicity um the fact that people could vote for Harris or Biden I mean that's you know genocide is not normal governance I mean do do we have any moral line left I mean and I want to get your thoughts on uh the end of the occupation um the end of aparte and whether those things can actually be achieved uh not too long ago we spoke to Rashid KH who who uh is Professor Meritus at uh and he stated that Israel's connection to the US and Western Europe uh is fraying every day and that Israel is becoming inre increasingly isolated uh on the global stage he said sooner or later public opinion is going to have an impact and it's going to uh cause support for Israel to stop do you agree with that position yes but it might take a generation a generation sure because this old older generation still has a falty to Israel that the younger generation including Jews do not I mean I was in a lot of uh students for justice in Palestine meetings and campuses across the country and what 30 40% of them are Jewish so uh yeah it's it's it's terminal but it's I know Elon Pape the great Israeli historian has talked about I think at 1.3 years I don't think it's that quick I think that these I think that's why I was surprised some people were saying we're a few years away from the ter you're like a generation away yeah yeah because that next generation isn't going to have that kind of loyalty now that's why Israel is investing so much of its capital in the Christian Christian Zionist in the Christian fascists because they have this warped perverted biblical view of Christ returning and the Rapture which isn't even in the Bible and I mean at its core if you really examine it it's pretty anti-semitic but they I think even Israel has realized that uh the the younger generation of Jews are a lost cause uh and so they're they have wedded themselves to the Christians zist people like Mike hucke who's about to become the Ambassador or the UN Ambassador Ian she they're not alone I mean they're so uh but that's a that's a naked kind of fascism we didn't get into Israel's distortions itself it is uh it is a Proto fascist system yashu libowitz you know the great Israeli philosopher kind of saw it coming um they're all the Heirs of Amana when I worked in I I lived in Israel when I worked in Israel the party was outlawed Mar these this radical racist Rabbi these people I mean benir I think was at kahana's grave on the anniversary of his death not long ago so uh there's a there's a and you know Netanyahu is not stupid Netanyahu he's pretty evil but he's not stupid he said everybody thinks the world is moving towards a kind of Enlightenment no that's why he builds relationships with orbon and others he said no it's moving towards this kind of uh authoritarianism and we're comp we're we're than we're what's coming next and he may not be wrong um so uh Israel's you know becoming I'm talking even for Israelis in a very despotic place people who have the courage to decry the genocide and the occupation are uh Paras Gideon levies and airas and these amazing journalists from atis I mean they have become total outliers within their own Society you talk about journalism uh you were the Middle East bureau chief of the New York Times of for several years and of course you quit because they repr maned you well no I I didn't quit they they keep reminding me when I see them what they do is suddenly the you're the Middle East be chief for the New York Times it's like the old Soviet party where you get to stand up you know with all the other old people and look at the MayDay Parade or whatever and then you suddenly find yourself in Tajikistan so you're on night rewrite I mean they put you in a dead end and they knew I'd leave so but I ran into the ex executive editor a couple years ago de mckenny ran across the room and said we did not fire you okay but okay so so you you were not fired I want to clear that up for your New York Times viewers fair enough fair enough but what whatever experience you had there it was in direct response to your opposition to the Iraq War um also Palestine you know and Palestine because I had taken vacation time and written a magazine piece in Harper's called a Gaza diary and the times went epiplectic and when that was published I was told you will never report from the Middle East again so it already been banned from the Middle East I opposed the Iraq War and that was it from that moment until now do you see any different uh tenor in newsrooms do you hear any different sensibilities from the journalism world uh has coverage changed on the Middle East since that time yeah it's worse far worse worse yeah how so well look at the reporting on Gaza look at the reporting on the student protests you know they go up to Columbia and race off to the hell house and talk about how you know Jewish students quote Jewish students saying they feel uncomfortable well you know what it's a genocide you know perpetrated by the Zionist project that you support so maybe you should feel uncomfortable you see that is worse than say 1982 during The Invasion or of Lebanon or or in the early 2000 yeah yeah the whole I mean you know we don't have time to critique the New York Times which was always an elitist publication beholden the centers of power never good on Israel uh but the space is shrunk because that's commercial because the you know they've lost so much advertising uh their digital subscription s don't they they bring in significant Revenue but digital subscribers are very fickle about cancelling so uh yeah there's less I mean there was spay I worked for them for 15 years I mean I was a management headache but but uh that space is shrunk and shrunk and shrunk and they cater for commercial not for journalistic reasons to uh they they've siloed themselves and they cater to a particular demographic they're far more obsequious to that demographic than they were when I work there I got to ask you one more question uh given what we're facing are traditional forms of protest or dissent enough uh or does the scale of the crisis the intensity of the suffering people are experiencing right now does it demand a more radical response than what what we've traditionally done yeah it Demands a more radical response because we have to destroy the system we have to destroy the ruling class and the only mechanism we have to destroy the ruling class is by uh disrupting economic social and political life uh that comes through Mass mobilization primarily through Labor and especially through the strike um we have to rebuild militant labor movements that shut the country down uh that's the only way out of this um and and the oligarchs have understood this for a long time it's why they have made war against organized Labor uh for a long time only 11% of us Workforce is unionized but we have to regain that militancy we have to understand who our enemy is and that if we don't break the back of that Enemy enemy things are going to get worse and worse and worse and we have to understand the only Power we have is collective uh and it will require sacrifice and I mean we had the bloodiest labor Wars of any industrialized country hundreds of American workers were killed thousands probably tens of thousands were blacklisted uh you know Joe Hill you know all this you know that we got to look back because the capitalist class uh you know they're they're going to use every vicious mechanism they have uh because it's all and you saw the way you know they essentially made it impossible Bernie without that corporate money Bernie Sanders would have run against Trump the first time around and he I believe he would have won um but they destroyed it they destroyed that possibility so we are you hopeful that we're close to that moment are we on the precipice of a radical U moment of resistance are we on the verge of toppling power no because the left has been so decimated so we don't have the left we have in the 30s Europe went one way fascist we went another way which was quasi socialist but our left has been so decimated and destroyed I fear that we don't have the forces of resistance uh that can uh you know create the kind of space and social equality and Liberty that uh is is should be fundamental to an open Society so no I'm actually very pessimistic um however um you know that's right fall back on my religious tradition where it doesn't matter I mean you come out of the black prophetic tradition uh you know boy if anybody understood the world around them and the forces against them it was was the the you know Black America and the black prophetic tradition but they fought anyway uh and they fought anyway because it it wasn't finally what they achieved empirically it was who they were it was their own dignity and we have to protect our own dignity the soul is real and if we don't stand up against these rapacious forces of radical evil our soul will die and we may not win but we must save our soul Christopher Hedges thanks so much for joining me thanks Mark" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Chinese soldiers preparing for battle. This is what Beijing wants to show the world. With each military drill, China is drawing ever-closer circles around Taiwan. China has a clear goal: to gain control over the island. China will surely be reunified. Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that? Yes. That’s the commitment we made. The United States is building up its military presence in the region. And is practicing how to sink Chinese ships. We're not going to come to an agreement over Taiwan. Wait for the unification to be achieved. Peacefully, I hope. Not peacefully, I dread. But why are these two superpowers so fixated on Taiwan? What's in it for China and the U.S.? And how do people in Taiwan feel about it? It's Taiwan's location that makes it a geopolitical flashpoint. Taiwan has 23 million inhabitants – and its main island lies only 130 km away from China's mainland. These tiny islands right off the coast are also under Taiwanese control. And Chinese military drills around the whole of Taiwan are getting bigger and more frequent. In recent videos released by China's People's Liberation Army, Beijing has threatened to encircle the island. It sees Taiwan as part of its territory and says it's ready to use force, if necessary, to get it back. We'll talk more about the history and Taiwan's status later. For now, you need to know that in the late 1940s, there was a civil war in China between Communists and Nationalists. The Communists won and took control of mainland China. And the Nationalists fled to Taiwan. That laid the groundwork for today's tensions. The U.S. has an ambiguous policy towards Taiwan. Since the late 1970s, it has recognized Communist Beijing as the only legitimate government of China. But it has informal ties with Taiwan and is seen as the island's protector. Okay. Let's go back to the map to understand why the U.S. and China can't quit Taiwan. In some ways, Taiwan's strategic importance is about three chokepoints around the island. To the west, there's the Taiwan Strait. It's a key trade route for both Beijing and Taiwan – and also for everybody else. Almost all the world's biggest container ships pass through here. To the north, the Miyako Strait. It runs between Taiwan and these Japanese islands. And in the south, the Bashi Strait. It runs between Taiwan and the Philippines. For China, these two straits on either side of Taiwan are key strategic gateways to the Pacific Ocean. Taiwan is in the middle of the Chinese coastline, which is very important. This is Victor Gao. He is a former Chinese diplomat and vice-president of the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing think-tank some say is close to the Chinese Communist Party. Taiwan Island faces the Pacific directly, and if Taiwan is occupied by a foreign country, for example, it interrupts the continuity of the Chinese coastline and also prevents the Chinese access directly to the Pacific Ocean. The U.S. says it has no troops permanently stationed in Taiwan but the island plays an important role in U.S. strategy. To understand why, let's look at the military bases in the region. Here are some of China's main naval bases close to its coast. And the U.S. has some of its key bases in South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. If you connect the dots, you'll see the U.S. bases form a chain. Taiwan sits at the heart of what we call in the United States the 'first island chain'. David Sacks is an expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank in New York City. In the past, he worked at the American Institute in Taiwan, which serves as the de facto U.S. embassy on the island. If you look at the first island chain, these are all formal treaty allies of the United States, or close partners, in the case of Taiwan. And with that the way it is, the United States can project power close to China's shores, protect its allies and its interests. Conversely, it's very difficult for the Chinese military to project power outside of the first island chain and threaten the United States physically or our interests in the Indo-Pacific. To strengthen this 'island chain', the U.S. is expanding military cooperation with Japan and the Philippines, which are also wary of what they see as China's expansionist goals. For example, just last year the U.S. gained access to military bases in the north of the Philippines. Right next to the Bashi Strait, one of those Chinese gateways to the Pacific Ocean we mentioned. Here you can see American and Philippine troops conducting exercises in the waters nearby earlier this year. They even sank an old Chinese-built ship that the Philippine navy used in the past: a clear message to Beijing. And obviously, China is not happy about the U.S. 'island chain' strategy. Come on! We are not living in the 19th century. We are not living in the imperialist century. Using this outmoded way of thinking as if you can set up a chain to block, for example, China from accessing the Pacific Ocean, is ludicrous. Beijing is rapidly modernizing its navy, in part to be able to break through the chain of U.S. allies. For example, with the 'Fujian' aircraft carrier. Here it is on sea trials earlier this year. It's China's third aircraft carrier and the biggest ship in the Chinese navy. The number one objective here is to keep the United States out of the region during a conflict. So, what we call 'anti-access/area denial': Prevent the United States from being able to defend our treaty allies and partners. So to sum up: Taiwan's location makes it essential to both sides as they try to gain the upper hand in the region. But the rivalry is also about money. Big money. Economically, the small island also has an outsize importance for both China and the U.S. – even though neither officially recognizes Taiwan as a country. Both China and the U.S. have significant trade links with Taiwan. And much of that business comes from just one company: TSMC – Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. It produces microchips. Taiwan makes 90 % of the most advanced ones in the world. Both the U.S. and China are dependent on them. And so is everybody else. There's a good chance TSMC's semiconductors are in the device that you're using to watch this video right now. They are in new cars, fridges, and fighter jets. Everywhere. They're needed to develop new AI models. And U.S. leaders worry that losing Taiwan to China could permanently shift economic tides against them. We don't assume that a region under Chinese hegemony would be open to U.S. trade and investment. I think that China would reorder the region. They want the United States to basically supply them with raw materials that are turned into manufactured goods in China and then sold all over the world. And there isn't really a role for the United States or other industrialized countries in that. The Chinese economy is already larger than that of the United States if we use purchasing power parity. China produced more than 30 million cars in 2023. The Americans probably produced less than half of that. So why should anyone believe, they can have some benefit of picking a fight with China? No, there is no benefit. China does not look at Taiwan from an economic or commercial perspective. So why is Taiwan so important to Beijing then? To understand, let's dive back into history. China lost control over Taiwan during what it calls the 'Century of Humiliation' – these caricatures of China being carved up by various foreign powers might explain why. From the mid-19th until the mid-20th century, China was plagued by invasions and internal disputes. This is important, because that notion of humiliation still plays a big role in Chinese state ideology even today. In 1895, Japan took Taiwan from China and made it a colony. After World War II, the Allies forced Japan to give it back. But at the time, China was in the middle of a civil war: The government of the Republic of China, or ROC, was led by Nationalists under Chiang Kai-Shek. Mao Zedong led Communist forces against them. In 1949, the victorious Communists marched into Beijing and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland. The defeated government of the Republic of China fled to Taiwan. That's why there are two governments that call themselves 'China': one on the mainland, the People's Republic of China, or PRC. And on Taiwan, the Republic of China, or ROC. The PRC government in Beijing sees Taiwan as a breakaway province and says there is only one China. Even though they have never actually been in charge in Taiwan. Most of the world accepts this One China policy, including the U.S. They don't recognize Taiwan as an independent country. Wait. So why is the U.S. supporting Taiwan then? There is also a history to that. After the Civil War, the U.S. initially saw the Nationalist government in Taiwan as the only real China, rejecting the Communist government on the mainland. U.S. soldiers were even stationed in Taiwan under a common defense pact. The change came in the 1970s. The U.S. sought closer relations with Beijing. That meant closing the U.S. embassy in Taiwan and pulling out U.S. troops. Still, informal ties persisted, like that de facto embassy. And the U.S. still guarantees to sell Taiwan weapons. But they have a deliberately ambiguous policy on whether they would defend Taiwan. It's meant to prevent China from invading and Taiwan from declaring independence. But that strange limbo has been the status quo in Taiwan for decades. And it's created realities on the ground. Taiwan developed from a Nationalist authoritarian regime into one of the strongest democracies in the region. There are elections, a free press, and civil liberties. Taiwan was first in Asia to legalize same-sex-marriage. This year a progressive party was reelected for a third term, vowing to maintain that tense status quo. DW's Taiwan correspondent Yuchen Li can give us a sense of things on the ground. Here in Taiwan, the atmosphere is very different from what you might read in the headlines. The tension has become part of daily life. One key reason is that people in Taiwan have been living under the threat of the Chinese Communist Party for many decades. The majority of the Taiwanese prefer to maintain the status quo with China, but how to do so is a rather polarized debate. If China wants to bully us, at least we still have the U.S. and Japan. They are our friends. I've always been skeptical of America. But we have no choice, if we can't get stronger or have enough forces. It's tricky. We should have a friendly relationship with both of them. It's always been like this. Ever since the founding of the country, we've been caught up in this drama. But one thing is clear for many Taiwanese – Taiwan's voice is usually drowned out. Amid the U.S.-China rivalry, many feel that Taiwan is only 'a pawn' in the game, and no matter what comes next, the island should have the right and autonomy to decide its own fate. But there is one more factor that stands in the way of that. Taiwan represents something for both superpowers. Taiwan has embraced the U.S. worldview, which promotes democracy and capitalism. China is a one-party system and a socialist market economy. And a major Chinese Communist Party narrative centers on Taiwan. Remember the Century of Humiliation we mentioned, when China lost Taiwan? Well Chinese President Xi Jinping sees bringing Taiwan back into the fold as an important step in overcoming that humiliation. This is part of the so-called 'national rejuvenation', a revival of the Chinese nation as a great power. With Xi Jinping, I think, you did see some impatience. Xi Jinping has clearly put himself forward as a leader of, you know, world historic importance. He views himself in a very similar way, I think, to Vladimir Putin, that he's just not a run-of-the-mill leader. He's transformative. No one, no country, no single human being will be able to block the peaceful reunification of China or the non-peaceful reunification of China. So, we should all call on the United States: &quot;Don't play with fire!&quot; But for the U.S., supporting Taiwan also means keeping up key alliances in the region and promoting democracy. If China were to invade and annex Taiwan, we would see that democracy extinguished, and it could send chilling effects to democracies around the world. You would have deep questions being asked in South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines on whether they can rely on the United States for their security. Because of where Taiwan is and what it represents, neither China nor the U.S. isable back down. And the rest of us are stuck watching the superpower rivalry play out." />

L’attuale conflitto è solo l’ultima parte di un intricato gomitolo di eventi, incontri, accordi e conflitti: la questione israelo-palestinese. Per spiegare e capire i motivi della guerra è necessario tornare indietro e ripercorrere la storia. &#10;Partiamo da una premessa fondamentale. La guerra nasce da una questione apparentemente semplice: due popoli rivendicano lo stesso territorio. Gli ebrei israeliani ritengono di avere il diritto di controllare la Palestina perché è il luogo di nascita del popolo ebraico; gli arabi palestinesi sostengono che abitavano lì prima degli ebrei israeliani e che ne stanno venendo cacciati con la forza.&#10;In questo video non prendiamo alcuna posizione nei confronti della questione, ma proponiamo una spiegazione degli eventi per capirci qualcosa in più e farvi una VOSTRA opinione sul conflitto.&#10;&#10;00:00 La spiegazione della questione israelo-palestinese&#10;01:31 Perché c'è una guerra tra palestinesi e israeliani &#10;02:45 Le origini del conflitto e l'inasprimento nel 1948&#10;03:08 La Palestina sulla cartina geografica&#10;03:50 Le differenze religiose e storiche tra i due popoli&#10;05:38 Il sionismo in Palestina&#10;08:37 La nascita dello Stato di Israele&#10;11:01 Nakba e guerra del '48&#10;12:05 La linea verde e la spartizione del territorio tra Egitto e Giordania&#10;13:05 La guerra dei sei giorni 1967&#10;14:02 La spartizione successiva del territorio dopo gli anni '80&#10;14:26 La nascita di Hamas e la prima intifada&#10;15:25 Striscia di Gaza e Cisgiordania&#10;16:15 Attentati e seconda intifada&#10;18:31 Le divisioni interne a Israele&#10;19:20 Le alleanze internazionali&#10;&#10;CREDITS &#10;Government Press Office (Israel)&#10;Chamboz&#10;DYKY Mohigan&#10;theodor&#10;ארכיון קיבוץ גת&#10;Great Brightstar&#10;Bolter21&#10;hanini&#10;US National Archives&#10;Zvikorn&#10;Visma&#10;Soman&#10;Abarrategi&#10;National Library of Israel&#10;ארכיון גן-שמואל&#10;ברקאי וולפסון&#10;רענן כהן  IDF Spokesperson's Unit&#10;Israel Defence Forces&#10;International Solidarity Movement&#10;Fars Media Corporation&#10;Council.gov.ru&#10;U.S. Department of State&#10;Peter Fedynsky&#10;Avi Ohayon&#10;&#10;I NOSTRI VIDEO CONSIGLIATI:&#10;   • Perché in Iran protestano e hanno pochi di...  &#10;   • Più di 220.000 militari in 170 Paesi: ecco...  &#10;   • Perché la Svizzera è neutrale?

          <attvalue for="7" value="Questa è la questione israelo-palestinese un intricato gomitolo di eventi incontri accordi guerre e per quanto chiunque di noi possa provare a srotolarlo tornando indietro nel corso della storia c'è sempre qualcosa ancora più indietro non solo se si vuole raccontare la storia in tempi precisi srotola per l'appunto si rischia di perdere la complessità del tutto Ecco perciò la prima cosa che vorrei che vi portaste a casa da questo video è che la questione israelo palestinese è super complessa per quanto uno si possa impegnare non riuscirà mai a raccontarla in modo completo Poi c'è una premessa Se cercate un video in cui si prende una posizione netta nei confronti della questione israelo-palestinese in cui si privilegia l'uno o l'altro non è questo il video che state cercando Non Guardatelo Se invece cercate una spiegazione degli eventi per capirci qualcosa in più e farvi una vostra opinione siete nel posto giusto Ah e se dovessi commettere degli errori o delle dimenticanze scrivetelo nei commenti Assolutamente ma vi prego con educazione di odio ce n'è abbastanza in giro e io sono un essere umano e quindi posso sbagliare cominciamo ragazzi su Spotify e su tutte le altre piattaforme di Streaming audio è uscito il podcast specifico della serie geopolitics dove approfondiamo Tra le altre cose proprio la questione israelo palestinese Quindi mi raccomando se volete seguirci Magari solo ascoltarci ci trovate anche lì Grazie mille e torniamo a noi la guerra israelo-palestinese nasce da una questione apparentemente semplice due popoli rivendicano lo stesso territorio gli ebrei israeliani ritengono di avere il diritto di controllare la Palestina perché è il luogo di nascita del popolo ebraico gli arabi palestinesi sostengono che abitavano lì prima degli ebrei israeliani e che ne stanno venendo cacciati con la forza la cosa incredibile è che si tratta di due popoli fratelli la cui origine comune viene fatta salire addirittura ai racconti della Bibbia ebrei e arabi Infatti sono detti popoli semitici deriverebbero da Sem uno dei figli di Noè e si sarebbero divisi in seguito gli arabi avrebbero avuto origine da Ismaele figlio di Abramo gli israeliti invece da un altro figlio di Abramo Isacco e in particolare da suo figlio Giacobbe soprannominato proprio Israele già da questi racconti che ovviamente prendiamo per quello che sono racconti si capisce però che stabilire chi abitasse prima in pales chei abbia il diritto di star lì lascia un po' il tempo che trova E comunque lasciatemelo dire la storia è un continuo susseguirsi di migrazioni guerre conquiste a conti fatti il pianeta Terra è Brutale dirlo ma è vero è di tutti e non è di nessuno quanto a quello che viene chiamato conflitto israelo-palestinese Beh è iniziato nella prima metà del 900o e si è inasprito dopo la fondazione dello Stato di Israele nel 1948 l'unico tentativo serio di raggiungere la pace è avanzato nel negli anni 90 è fallito per comprenderne le dinamiche però bisogna inquadrare territorio e protagonisti e fare qualche passo indietro nella storia la Palestina è una regione geografica di circa 28.000 km qu come Piemonte e Valle d'Aosta messi insieme che confina con Egitto Giordania Siria e Libano il territorio è desertico per circa il 60% della sua estensione e il fiume Giordano è la fonte d'acqua più importante insieme al lago di tiberiade e al Mar Morto Fin dall'antichità è stato un territorio di passaggio tra il Medio Oriente l'Europa e quindi è sempre stato desiderato a livello strategico e commerciale in aggiunta oggigiorno sono stati scoperti i vari giacimenti di petrolio e gas naturale al largo delle Coste Mediterranee in Palestina perciò la guerra purtroppo è una costante da millenni non un'eccezione e lo è stata anche per motivi religiosi la città di gran lunga più importante Infatti è Gerusalemme sacra per ebraismo Cristianesimo e Islam A proposito è proprio la religione Una una delle differenze più ovvie tra ebrei e arabi questi ultimi Infatti a partire dalla metà del vio secolo dopo Cristo hanno abbracciato come religione l'Islam diventando per la maggior parte musulmani Ecco però attenzione Non tutti gli arabi Sono musulmani i due termini non sono sinonimi gli arabi sono un popolo i musulmani sono tutte le persone seguaci dell'islam in Palestina ad esempio vivono più di 100.000 arabi cristiani peraltro ad Arricchire il quadro ci sono anche numerose persone di origine Slava provenienti dall'ex Unione Sovietica e tanti altri gruppi etnici un'altra grande differenza tra ebrei e arabi è la diversa storia che li contraddistingue come popoli intesi in senso ampio gli arabi si sono Espansi dal Settimo secolo dopo Crist fino a creare un impero vastissimo e a esportare la propria religione a milioni di persone la loro è una storia di conquiste ma anche di diffusione di cultura e scoperte scientifiche gli ebrei invece hanno quasi sempre dovuto lottare per la propria sopravvivenza e sono finiti dispersi in tutto il mondo facendo grande fatica a integrarsi con i popoli che li hanno ospitati ma venendo contemporaneamente spesso segregati o discriminati fino al drammatico Apice del genocidio di massa messo in atto dalla Germania nazista e dai suoi alleati Italia compresa poco prima e nel corso della Seconda Guerra Mondiale la Palestina o solo alcune sue parti sono passate di mano tantissime volte nel corso della storia Elencare tutti i popoli sarebbe lunghissimo ad esempio israeliti e babilonesi Macedo Romani Bizantini e arabi fino all'espansione dell'impero turco che controllò la regione dal 1516 fino al termine della Prima Guerra Mondiale Eccoci così arrivati a tappe forzate al periodo clu tra 1800 e 1900 abbiamo una situazione in cui la maggior parte della popolazione della Palestina è di origine araba ma c'è ancora una ridotta quota di ebrei che però sono dispersi in gran parte in giro per il mondo e qui dobbiamo introdurre un concetto fondamentale che si sente spesso il sionismo sionismo è una parola che deriva da Sion Zion in inglese che è il monte dove è stato fondato il nucleo originale della città di Gerusalemme il sionismo è un'ideologia propagandata a partire dalla fine dell'800 dallo scrittore attivista Theodor hersel che poi è diventato un movimento politico e sociale alla base c'era la volontà che gli ebrei Dopo secoli di dispersione e persecuzioni dessero vita a una società ebraica all'interno di uno Stato indipendente in cui emigrare da tutto il mondo neanche a dirlo il territorio prescelto per questa operazione alla fine fu la Palestina considerata da sempre dagli ebrei la Terra promessa e soprannominata terra di Israele in termini concreti il movimento sionista prevedeva che la Palestina fosse colonizzata progressivamente dal punto di vista agricolo e per farlo cercava da un lato denaro e dall'altro voleva ottenere un documento internazionale ufficiale che autorizzasse il tutto Detto Fatto attraverso l'istituzione di specifici fondi per finanziare l'acquisto di terreni e grazie a una una serie di pressioni e accordi internazionali il movimento sionista diede vita al progetto in questo fu facilitato da alcuni fattori alcuni purtroppo drammatici ne elenchiamo alcuni anzitutto l'arrivo di grossi flussi di denaro dagli ebrei che vivevano in Europa e in America permise agli Ebrei che emigravano di avere soldi per acquistare i terreni In secondo luogo alcuni periodi di carestia e crisi economica misero in ginocchio molti arabi palestinesi e li costrinsero a vendere tutti o parte dei loro beni poi dal dal punto di vista internazionale alla fine della prima guerra mondiale la Palestina finì sotto il protettorato del Regno Unito E quest'ultimo non disdegnava la Creazione di uno stato ebraico alleato in prospettiva in un contesto prevalentemente arabo e musulmano e quindi agevolò il movimento sionista infine il tragico aumento di atti discriminatori e persecutori contro gli ebrei nel corso del 900 con l'apice della shoa portò tantissimi ebrei a cercare rifugio proprio in Palestina queste altre condizioni permisero agli ebrei di crescere progressivamente nella regione se nel 1922 costituivano l'11 per della popolazione della Palestina e gli arabi invece il 78% nel 1947 Erano passati al 32% contro il 60% arabo Ovviamente un simile processo creò grande tensione gli arabi Infatti vedevano i territori che abitavano fino a poco tempo prima essere progressivamente colonizzati senza poter intervenire e così sia sul loro fronte sia per contrasto su quello ebraico nacquero organizzazioni paramilitari per contrastare la controparte che diedero vita ai vari scontri primi scontri dopo la Seconda Guerra Mondiale il Regno Unito lasciò la patata bollente in mano all'onu la neonata organizzazione delle Nazioni Unite che nel 1947 votò a maggioranza la risoluzione 181 secondo cui la regione palestinese sarebbe stata divisa in due stati lo Stato di Israele in mano ebraica e lo stato di Palestina in mano araba andiamo però più nel dettaglio perché in questo caso è essenziale il 55% del territorio della Regione palestinese tra cui l'area più fertile sarebbe finito in mano agli Ebrei che però costituivano solo il 32% della popolazione dell'area la parte restante il 44% del territorio sarebbe diventata la patria ufficiale della componente araba pari però al 60% degli abitanti in quel momento infine Gerusalemme e Betlemme avrebbero assunto il carattere di zone internazionali e qui la domanda sorge spontanea come mai la risoluzione non sembra equa per vari motivi ne elenchiamo anche in questo caso alcuni anzitutto molti paesi soprattutto occidentali avevano l'interesse che esistesse uno stato ebraico in un'area come il Medio Oriente a maggioranza araba e musulmana In secondo luogo in molti stati varie persone di origine ebraica ricoprivano posizioni influenti avevano quindi una buona capacità di fare pressioni politiche gli stessi ebrei in Palestina D'altra parte per quanto in minoranza e erano un gruppo più coeso ricco e potente rispetto agli arabi palestinesi divisi in molte fazioni diverse senza un senso comune di appartenenza e quindi erano più capaci di far sentire la propria voce infine durante la Seconda Guerra Mondiale il mondo arabo quanto meno i suoi vertici diciamo si era schierato in buona parte con la Germania sostenendo più o meno apertamente la shoa e quindi alla fine della guerra fu considerato sostanzialmente una fazione sconfitta D'altro canto va detto che questa vicinanza tra mondo arabo e Germania dipese anche da importanti e mancate promesse territoriali fatte da Regno Unito soprattutto e Francia al mondo arabo durante la Prima Guerra Mondiale negli anni successivi quindi di nuovo situazione complessa a ogni modo come potete immaginare gli arabi palestinesi perdendo gran parte del territorio in cui vivevano rifiutarono la risoluzione 181 dell'ONU mentre gli ebrei la accettarono dichiarando ufficialmente la nascita dello Stato di Israele nel 1948 la situazione non poteva che sfuggire di mano già nei mesi tra l'accettazione della risoluzione e l'indipendenza di Israele gli ebrei espulsero centinaia di migliaia di arabi palestinesi dal territorio che ormai consideravano proprio oppure In molti casi furono gli stessi arabi più o meno forzatamente ad andarsene Fatto sta che questo processo in arabo chiamato nakba cioè catastrofe fu segnato da scontri e numerose vittime e provocò un disastro umanitario tutt'oggi irrisolto la migrazione forzata oltretutto aument di numero dopo la proclamazione di indipendenza di Israele questa Infatti fu considerata come un atto di guerra dai paesi arabi intorno alla Palestina che si erano riuniti da poco in un'organizzazione chiamata lega araba contingenti militari di Libano Siria Giordania Irak ed Egitto insieme agli arabi palestinesi attaccarono così lo Stato di Israele su più fronti contemporaneamente ma incredibilmente Israele li respinse e Annette parte dei territori occupati durante il contropiede pass passando così dal controllo del 55% del territorio palestinese al 78% ecco attenzione Il 22% del territorio non finì nelle mani degli arabi palestinesi ma fu spartito tra Egitto e Giordania l'Egitto tenne la striscia di Gaza una fascia Costiera di circa 360 km qu di superficie più o meno quanto la provincia di Prato che prende il nome dalla città di Gaza la Giordania invece si prese la cosiddetta CIS Giordania un territorio di circa 5000 600 km qu poco più della Liguria a ovest del fiume Giordano e si spartì con Israele la città di Gerusalemme la parte Ovest finì in mano israeliana e quella est per l'appunto in mano Giordana A proposito se doveste sentire parlare di linea verde in riferimento alla questione israelo-palestinese si tratta proprio della linea di confine tra questi territori che ho appena nominato linea che attenzione a quei tempi fugo riconosciuta legittima dall'onu la guerra del 19 48 aimè fu solo il primo di tanti conflitti tra questi però quello che ha portato in sostanza la situazione attuale è la cosiddetta guerra dei 6 giorni del 1967 c'era sempre più tensione le truppe dei vari paesi della regione si erano ammassate ai confini il canale di Suez era stato chiuso alle navi israeliane e Israele temendo un imminente attacco al proprio territorio invase i paesi arabi confinanti e in 6i giorni li sconfisse conquistando la striscia di Gaza la Giordania la città di Gerusalemme la penisola del Sinai e le alture del golan Attenzione però l'ONU in questo caso dichiarò illegittime le conquiste ma Israele rimase dov'era Come si è evoluta da allora la situazione la penisola del Sinai è stata restituita all'Egitto in seguito Agli accordi di Cem David negli Stati Uniti mentre le alture del golan sono e rimangono tutt'ora sotto occupazione militare israeliana e stanno venendo pian piano colonizzate Ok ma tutto il resto Beh dalla metà degli anni 80 Israele si rese conto che doveva trovare un compromesso con gli arabi palestinesi soprattutto col loro più importante organismo politico di rappresentanza cioè l'olp l'organizzazione per la liberazione della Palestina l'olp nel 1988 arrivò a dichiarare l'indipendenza dello stato di Palestina e quasi un centinaio di stati membri dell'ONU lo riconobbe anche se tutto rimase praticamente solo su carta contemporaneamente in una parte degli arabi palestinesi stavano però crescendo posizioni più estremiste che scoppiarono nella cosiddetta prima intifada una sollevazione Popolare che portò a boicottare prodotti israeliani a barricate fino a scontri armati e Chi fu il protagonista nell'organizzazione delle rivolte hamas una nuova organizzazione politica e paramilitare considerata oggi terroristica Tra gli altri da Unione Europea e Stati Uniti nei 6 anni di rivolta neanche a dirlo Purtroppo ci furono numerose vittime soprattutto da parte araba finché fu evidente che bisognava arrivare a un cessate il fuoco e ancora una volta ci pensarono gli Stati Uniti a Oslo nel 1993 vennero firmati degli storici accordi che prevedevano un riconoscimento reciproco da parte di Israele e Palestina e l'istituzione dell'autorità Nazionale palestinese in sigla ANP una sorta di braccio operativo dell'OLP a cui concedere progressivamente la sovranità sulla striscia di Gaza e la Cis Giordania la striscia di Gaza fu così progressivamente abbandonata dagli ebrei israeliani che tuttavia ancora oggi tra le altre cose hanno il controllo dello spazio aereo delle acque territoriali dell'anagrafe dell'ingresso di merci e persone e del sistema fiscale in CIS Giordania invece si formarono tre zone alcune aree furono cedute al controllo arabo palestinese in altre gli arabi palestinesi ottennero il controllo civile Ma gli ebrei israeliani mantennero quello militare e tutto il resto rimase sotto il pieno controllo israeliano Insomma c'erano ero stati dei passi avanti e sembrava si fosse finalmente sulla strada giusta ma come sapete questo processo che avrebbe dovuto portare a una pace definitiva è clamorosamente Purtroppo naufragato nonostante gli accordi di Oslo infatti gli ebrei israeliani Hanno continuato a colonizzare la Cis Giordania e ad appropriarsi in maniera più o meno lecita di interi quartieri della città di Gerusalemme prima in mano agli arabi palestinesi quest'ultimo processo è stato in qualche modo sostenuto dalla decisione degli Stati Uniti nel 2017 di considerare Gerusalemme la capitale dello stato d'Israele il processo di colonizzazione sionista ha quindi scatenato le frange più estremiste degli arabi palestinesi in particolare di hamas così già a partire dagli anni 90 si sono verificati alcuni attentati suicidi contro gli ebrei israeliani fino a un'escalation con più di 100 attentati nei primi anni 2000 quando è addirittura scoppiata una seconda rivolta una seconda intifada che ha provocato migliaia di morti soprattutto arabi palestinesi di fronte a questi eventi Israele ha innalzato due lunghissimi muri per contenere la Cis Giordania e la striscia di Gaza segregando però la popolazione nella striscia in particolare le condizioni di vita prima di questo conflitto in corso erano drammatiche con una densità abitativa elevatissima dei tassi di povertà e disoccupazione superiori al 50% acqua in gran parte contaminata e luce elettrica disponibile solo poche ore al giorno queste condizioni hanno appunto come abbiamo detto prima portato all'emergere e poi agevolato organizzazioni come hamas responsabili sì da un lato di politiche di assistenza alla popolazione locale ma anche di attentati e attacchi missilistici diretti contro Israele attacchi a cui lo stato ebraico Ha sempre risposto a tono con bombardamenti che hanno spesso causato ahimè Vittime Civili Anche perché a volte sono proprio i membri di amas a nascondersi apposta tra la popolazione inerme Insomma ragazzi alla fine è sempre la popolazione a farci le spese da una parte e dall'altra in Ces Giordania la situazione invece è diversa dopo una guerra civile in interna tra gli arabi palestinesi scoppiata dopo le elezioni del 2006 vinte da hamas la Ces Giordania è rimasta sotto la gestione dell'autorità Nazionale palestinese e in particolare del partito Fatah più moderato Ma con uno scarso consenso guidato da Mahmoud abbas detto Abu mazen nel 2012 però la NP è quantomeno riuscita a ottenere per la Palestina lo status di Stato osservatore dell'ONU il che significa che può partecipare alle assemblee Generali dell'organizzazione delle Nazioni Unite ma senza votare Ecco abbiamo visto la parte arabo palestinese ma dall'altro lato Israele non se la passa meglio negli ultimi anni gli israeliani sono tornati più volte al voto e adesso sono guidati da un Governo guidato da Netanyahu con una maggioranza abbastanza risicata e con posizioni sempre più estremiste e autoritarie rispetto al passato Inoltre la popolazione è incredibilmente divisa tra cittadini laici sostenitori del sionismo ebrei ultraortodossi e comunque un 20% di arabi che vive in Israele ma con sempre meno diritti nel 2018 infatti è stata deliberata una legge fondamentale dello Stato che non definisce più Israele una democrazia ma lo Stato nazionale del popolo ebraico che ha tolto all'arabo lo status di seconda lingua ufficiale e che ha legittimato La colonizzazione di stampo sionista ora se tutto questo quadro interno non bastasse c'è poi il quadro geopolitico internazionale esistono paesi che sostengono e finanziano Israele come gli Stati Uniti d'America che hanno favorito negli ultimi anni Nel 2020 i cosiddetti accordi di Abramo tra lo stato ebraico e alcuni paesi arabi come Emirati Arabi Uniti e Bahrain e ci sono paesi che invece sostengono la causa palestinese e in particolare Sono alleati di hamas come l'iran il Qatar o hezbollah un'organizzazione politica e paramilitare libanese Insomma Direi che possiamo fermarci qui D'altro canto stiamo pensando proprio a dei contenuti specifici e più approfonditi su vari argomenti ad esempio sulla striscia di Gaza e la storia di hamas sulle divisioni interne ad Israele e sulle alleanze internazionali quindi mi raccomando continuate a seguirci ragazzi Spero che questa ricostruzione vi sia piaciuta e di avervi anzitutto trasmesso la complessità della questione se dovessi però secondo voi aver commesso errori o dimenticanze gravi Mi raccomando segnalateli con educazione nei commenti ampliando voi la narrazione Grazie mille di averci seguito e vi aspetto sempre qui su geopop le scienze nella vita di tutti giorni Ciao" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="one of the first things Israel did after Hamas burst out of Gaza killing over 1,400 Israelis and taking around 200 hostages was bomb two Syrian airports Syria said Thursday that Israeli missiles had targeted airports in Damascus and Aleppo confused yeah well it's confusing Syria's a long way from Gaza Hamas doesn't have a base in Syria and Syria isn't really in a position to threaten Israel very much it's barely functioning after more than a decade of Civil War so why bomb these airports it's because they're used to supply the most powerful unofficial military force in the world Hezbollah now Israel's confident that they can defeat Hamas but h esbah is a whole different matter and they're allies of Hamas if Hezbollah joins Hamas it'll be a nightmare for Israel so in our third episode on the Israel Gaza War who is hezb how did they form it turns out it's because of Israel and an eerily similar conflict 40 years ago has Israel learned anything since then I'm Matt beon and this is if you're [Music] [Applause] listening the story of the birth of Hezbollah is one that begins not in Gaza not in Israel not even in Iran but in [Music] Lebanon lebanon's geography is in comparison with other Middle Eastern countries extremely strange in a region dominated by wide open desert expanses 81% of Lebanon is covered by mountains about the same proportion as Switzerland and Nepal but aside from providing good skiing conditions these mountains have had an interesting effect on lebanon's population see mountains keep people apart and over thousands of years the people living in The Valleys of Lebanon have developed incredibly diverse cultures it's the most religiously diverse country in the Middle East by far more or less evenly balanced between Christians and the two major branches of Islam Sunni and Shia most Muslims around the world are Sunni and Shiites are often marginalized only 15% are Shiites and Iran is the only Muslim country led by a Shiite the Ayatollah heni sunnis and Shiites do not always get along historically the division between sunnis and Shiites has led to intense conflict which is at times erupted in war but in Lebanon the mountains have separated these groups you have to be a lot angrier to attack someone over a mountain than across a plane this has maintained a centuries long balance a balance they now attempt to reflect in their Politics the president of Lebanon is always a Christian the prime minister is always a Sunni Muslim the speaker of the house is always a Shia Muslim there are quoters for how many MPS each sect gets it's all based on what the population of each group was the last time they held a census which was in 1932 they're worried that a new census will change the ratios so they just don't do censuses you count can't be wrong if you never count this is how it was for decades there were a few exceptions but mostly there was Harmony in [Music] Lebanon but in the 19 7s something rapidly changed Palestinian refugees pushed out by civil war with Israel and with nowhere else to turn began arriving in enormous numbers in Lebanon Palestinians are a human being and they are living in Lebanon because of Israel and because they have been driven up by force almost all Palestinians are Sunni Muslims and this began to upset the balance On's balance between Christians Shiites and sunnis now began to tip rapidly towards the sunnis before long Lebanon erupted into a horrific Civil War and just to make things worse as Lebanese communities attacked each other a group of Palestinians called the Palestinian Liberation Organization or PLO started using Lebanon as a base for attacks on Israel prime minister ban claims more than 150 Israelis have been assassinated on the country's northern border during the last 12 months by PLO guillas in southern Lebanon by 1982 Israel decided it was time to end it they would go all the way to the Lebanese Capital Beirut and take out the PLO once and for [Music] all it was the beginning of lebanon's hot dry summer when Israel invaded the speed and savagery of this latest Israeli offensive into Lebanon has shocked countries around the world the Israelis swept through southern Lebanon towards the capital Beirut where the PLO leadership was helded up remember there was also a civil war going on and now Israeli tanks were on the city's doorstep people ran for cover every time they heard the Israelis overhead usually crowded streets were deserted the people are terrified the effects of the invasion were horrific Lebanese civilians and Palestinian refugees were killed on mass as Israeli forces swept through the country what started out as a punitive raid into Lebanon four weeks ago has turned into what some are calling the brutal final solution to the Palestinian problem they reached Beirut and put the city under siege blockading food water and electricity and flattening apartment buildings with air strikes and artillery fire at the very center of this Siege was the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organization yasa Arafat Arafat said the Palestinians would fight to the last bullet appearing to relish such a prospect he urged the Israelis to attack saying his men we're ready he knew that he was Israel's Enemy Number One and that his life was at risk Arafat is a man constantly on the move he knows that much of West Beirut is under direct observation by the Israelis oddly enough he didn't seem all that put off by the spies and the air strikes as the city became a war zone Arafat seemed to be in his element you Arafat toured besieged Beirut with a smile on his face kissing babies cracking jokes as he visited the men fighting on his side one of the reasons he's popular with his Fighters is that he makes periodic inspections like this one he even looked like a rockar the Australian women's weekly published an article about how much he resembled Ringo Star as bombs rained down on Beirut and Israeli troops drew the net closer and closer around him he happily gave interviews and talked about how much he was looking forward to becoming an engineer once the nation of palestin was established and he could go home to Jerusalem I would like uh to work as an engineer it is my professional despite Israeli spies on the ground calling in air strikes directly against him and Arafat stayed alive if the Israelis invade West Beirut what will your troops do what do you expect me to do the scene in beut was extremely similar to the one we're seeing today in Gaza Israeli tanks waiting at the gates to a city destroying neighborhoods with air strikes trying to eliminate a Palestinian group today Israeli forces were still poised AR sign Beirut ready to deliver the final death blow to the Palestine Liberation Organization Israel's International allies watched on in horror as The Siege dragged into a second month finally they'd had enough the US President Ronald Reagan sent in Team America to end the siege the government of Lebanon has requested and I have approved the deployment of United States forces to Beirut as part of a mational force Arafat without his headscarf and thousands of PLO Fighters left Beirut on ships having withstood the Israeli seed for 10 weeks he called it a victory heralding a new dawn in the Arab world and left to set up new operations in Tunisia now you might be thinking okay interesting story but what does any of this have to do with Hezbollah and I would agree it is an interesting story and I would tell you that the time that I'll tell you about Hezbollah is now if you know anything about Hezbollah it's probably that they're backed by Iran so let's talk about Iran shall we Iran is a middle eastern superpower with a massive population like Lebanon it's mountainous and has a long history and strong culture but it's the black sheep of the family it's never really fit in the Islamic revolution in Iran Depends for its momentum on regular expressions of unity the leaders of the newly formed Islamic Republic of Iran watched the attack by Israel with interest and they saw an opportunity you see Finding allies is kind of difficult for them they were Shia Muslims Hardline Islamic fundamentalists and Persians and most people in the Middle East and none of those things but there are Shiites in Lebanon and they were Mighty annoyed with the Israelis so Iran's powerful revolutionary guard Corp got to work uniting Shiites who do not like Israel who live in Lebanon into one group and they gave it a name Hezbollah the party of God the most fanatical of Lebanon Shiite Muslims are now firmly openly and successfully established in Beirut ahood Barack a top Israeli military official who went on to become the Israeli Prime Minister later said when we entered Lebanon there was no Hezbollah we were accepted by perfumed rice and flowers by the she in the South it was our presence there that created hisbah hisbah has undergone a massive transformation since the siege of Beirut they started off as a fairly typical terrorist organization for 8 years They carried out bombings kidnappings and hijackings it was hisbah that destroyed the American Marine Barracks in Beirut killing some 240 people and producing scenes of the most awful Carnage they were famous for running through the streets covered in blood after conducting a ritual which involves cutting your head open with a sword and then hitting the wound over and over with your hand unlike most Palestinian terrorists who prefer to get away hisbah welcome death and this makes them more dangerous once the Lebanese Civil War ended in 1990 Hezbollah gave themselves a bit of a makeover the Muslim fundamentalist group Hezbollah has had unexpected success in the country's first general election for 20 years with funding Direct directly from Iran they spent big to build the support of Shia communities the party of God has CED the people lavishly in the runup to lebanon's elections it's built new mosques funded schools and Clinics and handed out cash to the needy since 992 they've won seats at every Lebanese election since 2012 they've had seats in cabinet a hisbah MP has been the sports minister of Lebanon for most of the last decade hisbah also owns a radio and TV station they provide social services and run a tourism operation we like it here very much it's peaceful but one aspect of Hezbollah hasn't changed since the very beginning they've been devoted to the elimination of the state of Israel it's something symbolized in their logo an arm holds a machine gun in the air officials say that is a threat to Israel the machine gun for for Israel and will continue to be M for Israel for this they have a military week and they are a real and terrifying threat to Israel armed by Iran they are said to be the best equipped non-government military force in the world their military Wing is apparently more powerful than the Lebanese Army thanks to lebanon's geography Hezbollah is apparently kind of like an iceberg you only see the very tip this is Hezbollah territory it's covered in deep valleys perfect for waging Guerilla war and deep caves perfect for housing Fighters and arms for four decades now they've been attacking Israel with rockets and raids Israel has struck back against Hezbollah gorillas in the latest round of tit forat attacks in southern Lebanon Hezbollah sits there in its Mountain Fortress Loom in over Israel's northern border like a giant Dam that could burst at any moment and flood into Israel and that's what Israel's worried about that's what Israel's allies and even some of its enemies are worried about if the damn bursts it would significantly escalate the scale of the current War but Israel's prime minister warned Hezbollah and it sponsor Iran not to get involved if Hezbollah decides to enter the War they'll be making the biggest mistake of their lives and hit with unimaginable Force since the Hamas attack in early October skirmishes have begun at the foot of the mountains hez blah has fired Rockets Israel has responded with air strikes Israel bombed the airports in Syria which are known to be part of the supply chain from Iran to Hezbollah so why hasn't Hezbollah launched an attack what what are they waiting for well the thing about a dam bursting is it takes a while for the dam to fill up again for the Iranian backers hesah is most effective as a spectre a threat they do not have the strength to defeat Israel and they may be defeated themselves and then the threat's no longer there but Hezbollah should also serve as a reminder for Israel the current Siege of Gaza is incredibly reminiscent of the failed Siege of Beirut 40 years ago her military armor continues to pound away at the strongholds of the 6,000 strong PLO Force trapped inside the city the group they were trying to eliminate escaped and as an unintended consequence Hezbollah an even more dangerous group arose that unintended consequence is still looming down on Israel from the Lebanese mountains what will the unintended consequence be be this [Music] time" />

and you shocking sharks and just whatever crazy thing pops into his mind he thinks Trump should be mocked not feared the fascist depend on fear the fascists depend on us going back but we're not afraid of weird people if they go low we'll come too you ruined more models lives than bulimia this battle over civility in American politics has been going on for decades but can the low road lead the Democrats to victory in November I'm Matt Bon and this is if you're listening I have been told I have one small thing they would like me to do and that's to introduce my husband President Gerald Ford this is former first lady Betty Ford speaking at a big event at the Museum dedicated to her husband in Michigan but following her introduction the man coming to the stage is clearly not her [Applause] husband it's heavy Chase he's tripping over things he's poking himself in the eye with his glasses thank you very much well I'm here Chevy Chase does a few more stumbles who no problem absolutely fine no problem there before the real Gerald Ford comes on stage to interrupt him with a big smile on his face the real President Ford steps up to the microphone then checks his name tag and says I'm Gerald R Ford the event was organized by Ford to launch his new book humor and the presidency and if you want to understand the power of humiliating humor in politics you can learn a lot by looking at the relationship between these two men President Ford and Chevy Chase see Chase became a household name by making jokes about Ford on Saturday Night Live and these jokes had basically destroyed Ford's political career hello hello Ford is still the only President never to win a national election he came into office in 1974 after the Watergate scandal exposed both president Richard Nixon and his vice president to be Crooks the new president needed to be a good dude the search was less for an imaginative achiever than for a stolid party man whose record would withstand the closest scrutiny Ford had been in Congress for 24 years and was known as unusually nice honorable and trustworthy he'd been a star football player in college a lineman tasked with defending the quarterback while he makes the play I'm a team player but during his career in politics he'd also gained a reputation for being a bit dumb the New York Post called him America's pet rock but that wasn't all a close Nixon a recently remarked that Ford was not real bright and his modest intellectual prowess has made him the butt of some Savage cracks Detroit mayor Jerome kaver once remarked that poor Jerry had played football too long without a helmet and Lyndon Johnson who regarded Ford with less than a steam observed that Ford couldn't find his ass with both hands Johnson also said that Ford was so Dum he couldn't fart and chew gum at the same time which the papers sanitized to walk and chew gum that's where that phrase comes from all of it was actually quite unfair Ford was quite a thoughtful man and I think much Dumber people have been the president though I won't name them but the thing is all of those mean jokes they told voters something about Ford that was funny and felt kind of accurate and when Ford became the president his actions seemed to confirm them right as the public was getting to know him for President Ford the year seemed full of snags in June he fell down the plane steps on arriving in Austria later that same day he had another fall but was caught by the Egyptian president AIDS explained that Ford had a long-term knee injury from his football career but that wasn't going to stop Chevy Chase I do have two major announcements to make uhoh in the first ever season of Saturday Night Live Chase played forward as a clutz an idiot an embarrassment and now for my second announcement live from New York it's Saturday it's pretty unlucky to be a President Who falls over a lot the same year that Saturday Night Live starts up it became a national joke Ford was too dumb to be the president by the time the 1976 campaign kicked off any mistakes he made that might have been forgiven in another candidate just confirmed what voters knew about Ford he was a dummy like in the presidential debate when he seemed not to know where the Soviet Union ended and Europe began there is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under aort Administration the Soviet Union clearly already dominated Eastern Europe for candidate to slip up like this might not have mattered too much but for a guy who many already thought was dumb it mattered a lot he narrowly lost the election and went into retirement and that's why I was interested in President Ford as a cautionary tale about what happens when you're running for president and everyone is ridiculing you but what happened next is kind of remarkable it's how you get Betty Ford putting on her best straight face to introduce her Pratt falling fake husband Chevy Chase had injured himself so badly during one of his Ford sketches that he became addicted to prescription painkillers he checked himself into rehab at the Betty Ford Center set up by the former first lady during his time at the center he became friends with Betty and Jerry Ford a friendship which lasted long after he checked out of rehab with Chase's support Ford began writing and talking about the effect of humor on the presidency political humor has always been part of our culture to challenge the self-righteous and to ridicule the unjust I've read Ford's book on this subject he admits to feeling very hurt by the jokes that Chevy Chase made at his expense even if he seemed to take them well in public but while the gist of the book is that presidents have to employ humor to stay sane the point he keeps coming back to is this there's a line between humor and ridicule Chevy Chase can cross it but presidents can't humiliation is below the office of the presidency you want to take the low road look for another job anyway with that in mind Donald Trump is here tonight in 2012 President Barack Obama roasted businessman Donald Trump during the White House Correspondence dinner Trump had been spreading a conspiracy theory that Obama wasn't really born in America as a way of dipping his toe into politics testing the waters for a potential presidential run obviously we all know about your credentials and breath of experience um Obama riffed on a recent episode of Trump's TV show Celebrity Apprentice for a bit and then said and so ultimately you didn't blame Little John or meatloaf you fired Gary buy and these are the kind of decisions that would keep me up at night Trump grinned and waved at Obama while the president mocked his lack of expertise and his gy Casino magnate image well handled sir well handled it was widely reported that he was humiliated by the experience but I don't think he was It was a he encouraged it he reveled in it Trump has always been the human embodiment of the phrase any publicity is good publicity and yet he is acutely aware that there is power in humiliating people he has an unbelievable skill for finding the thing that is most vulnerable about someone's personality and attacking it nasty guy now I know why he doesn't have one endorsement from any of his colleagues the front runner for the 2016 presidential election was former Florida Governor Jeb Bush or As Trump called him low energy Jeb Bush this isn't a criticism of his policies or of his record as Governor it's an observation about his demeanor hello I'm Jeb and the thing is Jeb Bush kind of was low energy please clap and then there was Senator Marco Rubio or As Trump called him he's he's a little l d d l little little Little Marco and the thing is Marco Rubio is a bit short and he'd been photographed wearing big Cuban heels he was a little bit little one by one he cleared the board of all of his Republican opponents Jeb Bush expected to win G right we're all G I miss him I'm like Lonely no I'm lonely there was only one opponent left and then of course we have crooked Hillary crooked Hillary F Hillary Clinton's response I don't respond to Donald Trump and his string of insults she wasn't going to stoop to his level he can say whatever he wants to say about me I really could care less now Clinton may have been to the Gerald R Ford School of political humor humiliation is below the office of the presidency but Ford's experience at The Ballot Box is maybe more instructive than his book like with Jerry Ford everyone thinking he was a bit dumb everyone started thinking that Hillary Clinton might be a little bit crooked and some of the most memorable moments of the campaign just made it worse I opted for convenience to use my personal email account the Clinton campaign claims the emails were leaked by Russia Chelsea Clinton's $3 million wedding was paid for at least in part through the Clinton charitable Foundation FBI agents have known about the emails for weeks but only informed the director a few days ago ignoring the nickname did nothing it lingered crooked Hillary which is a very accurate description oh she's as crooked as they come folks just take a look she's as crooked as they I don't care see I can say things now Donald Trump does this on purpose he's not lashing out uncontrollably it is a clear strategy my wife said to me the last debate she said will you do me a favor be presidential don't be so vicious don't be so hard don't call him little Marco don't call low energy Jeep be nice I said but if I'm nice I'll be presidential but I'm going to lose right it might not be presidential but the low road led him from the audience of that correspondence dinner right up to the Oval Office it's a lot easier to act presidential than to do what I do but if that's all it took for him to win to think of something both cuttingly mean and a little bit true about your opponent surely someone would have been able to to do the same to Donald Trump by now right so why has this never worked in Reverse I think there's a few reasons for this for one the high road isn't a very funny place the nicknames people have tried on Donald Trump suck no one up here is going to call you Donald Trump anymore we're going to call you Donald Duck yeses another reason is Donald Trump was one of the most famous people in the world even before he ran for president when he started his campaign 9 2% of Voters already had an opinion about him that's the highest familiarity rating for someone who's not already the president in the history of US elections people already knew who he was and their opinions haven't changed feelings might be stronger now but very few people who disliked him in 2015 now like him and vice versa criticism against him hasn't really cut through because it hasn't told the voters anything new about him all along the Democrats have been hesitant to stoop to the level of name calling and personal attacks uh he loves giving people nicknames usually derogatorily but uh uh I do have a nickname I want to give him former president former president Donald Trump nice one sleepy Joe but all of that changed a few weeks ago when this guy came along I just have to say it you know it you feel it these guys are creepy and yes just we to as hell that's what you see that's what you see Minnesota Governor Tim Waltz exploded onto the national scene and became kamla Harris's running mate with a simple observation that Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance have unusual opinions taking away reproductive freedoms Banning books raising the price of Inland insulin trying to hurt labor unions nobody's asking for that weird crap no one's asking for it Tim Wall's reputation and public Persona is that of a stereotypical normal Midwestern dad winning big dad energy okay his whole stick is that he is normal and he's saying that his opponents are weird no one can picture them in their own lives I keep I brought this thing up that Donald Trump tries to mock uh vice president Harris for laughing and I made the point you never see this guy laugh I mean I can't personally imagine Donald Trump cooking pasta or driving his kids to school or riding a bike I swear to you I will never ever ride a bicycle it's so simple but then again it always is Hillary is crooked Joey is Sleepy Jerry Ford is dumb Trump is weird bing bing [Music] bing the question obviously is whether it will work Nobody Knows the answer to that but after 9 years of arguing that Donald Trump is dangerous that he is unfit for office a threat to democracy it is at least different I think I'm entitled to personal attacks I don't have a lot of respect for her they're hoping that it will attach a Vibe of weirdness to Trump that he can't shake off and it's already getting under his skin she actually called me weird he's weird it was just a sound bite and she called JD and I weird he's not weird Gerald Ford would not approve but us politics has changed a lot since saying someone can't fart and chew gum at the same time that's hardly a sick burn these days maybe the high road is just less important than it used to be approval ratings for presidents of both parties have been in the negative for most of the last 20 years people kind of hate the president whether he's acting presidential or not so why not take the low road you go person woman man camera TV Donald Trump's very very large Brain I'm not a big fan of shocky the late great Hannibal lecta he'd love to have you for dinner" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="in June 1989 something incredible and extremely memorable happened in Iran but it barely made news headlines in the west because it happened on the same day as the tianan Square massacre in Beijing but once you see this event you're never going to forget it on the 6th of June 1989 a helicopter was approaching the paradise of Zara Cemetery in the southern suburbs of the Iranian capital Iran on board was the body of the supreme leader of Iran two Iranian people this day is the day of great sadness we have lost a great leader and we are all mourning for such a great man an estimated 10 million Iranians in Black Funeral dress clamored to catch a glimpse of the body of their supreme leader Ayatollah rahah Ki his supporters gathered like tiny insult covering every stretch of ground as far as the eye could see several people were crushed to death in the hysterical crowd which was standing outside in 40° heat the helicopter seemed safer than going by road but then it landed almost on top of the crowd the mobs swamped the helicopter after touchdown hysterical mourners pulled the coffin from the helicopter and began parading it around the site the crowd was in a frenzy the body fell out of the coffin in the melee the body of the spiritual leader of Iran was mauled and appeared to drop to the ground the burial shroud he was wrapped in was torn off and came apart as mourners tried to grab bits of it for themselves in the chaos some people fell into the empty grave officials fired warning shots to get the crowd to move back they stuffed the body back into the helicopter and announced that the burial was cancelled the helicopter took off with people hanging onto the bottom of it and trying to pull the supreme leader back out as the helicopter flew away the body was partially hanging out the door many hours later the helicopter returned the funeral casket was enveloped by soldiers but finally Ayatollah heni was found his resting place to stop people digging up the body the guards used a crane to build a pyramid of shipping containers on top of the grave thousands kissed the containers some passed their children up to the guards so they could kiss the containers closer to the center of the pyramid it was one of the largest Gatherings of human beings in history and probably the most chaotic funeral ever caught on film his son ammed says Ayatollah H is on his way to heaven it's been a rough trip so far this funeral was for a man who had led his country for just 10 years not long for an Iranian leader 10 years in which hundreds of thousands of of young Iranian men had been killed in a war 10 years which had seen a 60% drop in GDP per person 10 years which had seen Iran become a global Pariah virtually friendless in the International Community and yet Millions were hysterically grieving his death mourners beat their heads in distress distraught to see the last glimpse of the man considered almost to be a prophet such is the power of a revolutionary leader or more specifically a revolutionary idea this is our third episode about the history of the escalating conflict between the US and Iran you can go back if you want to hear more but today the story of raahi and how his revolutionary idea changed the course of Middle Eastern history and is still affecting us today I'm Matt bevon and this is if you're listening 1960s Iran was a place that was changing very quickly thanks to the policies of the Sha Iran's King of Kings he has tried to reshape Iran virtually overnight into a modern industrial capitalist State while at the same time preserving the unquestioned authority of the ancient Persian kings the Sha a man installed by the British and kept in power by a CIA Le coup in 1953 was rapidly westernizing his country with American help even so most Iranians were devout followers of a subset of Islam called TWA shiism more than 90% of Iran's population of 35 million belong to the shate branch of Islam they believe that the 12th Iman a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad has been in hiding for 1200 years waiting to return at the end of time and create an Islamic caliphate on Earth for 1200 years most twers believed they should just sit tight wait for the 12th Imam to return and follow the five pillars of Islam that all Muslims learn as children to be a good Muslim you have to believe in Allah and believe that Muhammad was the last prophet and you have to fast in the Ramadan and then you have to pray five times a day and you have to give charity to the poor and um you have to go to Haj in to Mecca so sit back follow the pillars of Islam enjoy a modern westernized Iran and wait for the imam's return but a man named rahah H had other ideas Hai was a religious leader a teacher and a scholar who had gained a big enough following to be given the title of grand Ayatollah by 1964 he was well known across Iran as the instigator of a number of big political protests Iran sheras and the holy city of K were the scenes of the most violent disturbances Street B battling in which 20 were killed and hundreds injured you see heri had a very big very revolutionary idea what if instead of just following the five pillars of Islam and waiting for the imam's return to create the new caliphate we just start creating the caliphate now prioritize political activism even over the traditional Five Pillars don't separate church and state Let the church run the state by the rules set out in the Coran Islam is not only a religion but a total system derived from the Quran and the traditions of the prophet in the Quran a clear guidelines for every aspect of personal social and political life westernizing the country was not his idea of how to build a caliphate the shate leaders known as the mullers believe that the Sha's great plan for a modern western style Nation built on the oil wealth is not only a waste of time but it's also morally wrong the protests continued the Sha sent in in the Army Ki was arrested briefly jailed and then put under house arrest Ayatollah Ki has become a symbol of political opposition in a nation where political opposition has for many years been brutally suppressed now the Prime Minister Hassan Ali manur who was in charge of running the government for the Sha called Ki in to ask him politely to stop he asked to stay out of politics and go back to being like every other cleric focus on the Five Pillars wait for the 12th imam's return hum refused repeatedly the Prime Minister flew into a fit of rage shouting and yelling and finally he marched Up To Hai and smacked him across the face Hai was taken to the Tyran airport and put on a plane to Turkey he had been exiled 2 months later the Prime Minister was assassinated by supporters of Ki don't slap a guy with hundreds of thousands of fanatical followers now the old saying of out of sight out of mind really doesn't apply to revolutionaries plenty of revolutions have been orchestrated by people in Exile Vladimir lenon overthrew the Russian Zars in a revolution and did it all from Switzerland in fact it can be an advantage when someone's in your country you have some kind of control over them you can silence them but if they're outside your country it's much harder so ayat Ed as loud as he could from his bases in Turkey Iraq and France the ayat recorded antisha sermons onto cassette tapes which were smuggled into Iran and played in mosques he did interviews with International TV and radio stations which were then broadcast into Iran in his surprisingly calm tone of voice he railed against the Shar of Iran the king of Saudi Arabia the dictator of Iraq and of course the Zionist state of Israel as we discussed in the last episode the Sha thought that he had a special connection with his people and that just about everyone loved him Thea has conceded that perhaps 1% of the people might oppose him turns out it was a little bit more than that some recent reports have labeled the Sha's opponents as conservative religious Fanatics others have described them as revolutionary extremists the Sha himself has called them Islamic marxists Communists revolutionaries religious conservatives throw in workers students business owners their ultimate aims may be dissimilar but for the moment they have won catch cry the Sha must go but they all agreed they wanted the Sha gone when the demonstrators sh death to the Sha their next cry is usually Long Live Ki in October 1977 K's oldest son Mustafa died in an Iraqi jail humi blamed the death on the savak secret police saying that that they had murdered his son now the Sha has a military government a seriously disrupted economy and a nation at the brink of Revolution Memorial services to Mustafa Ki turned into deadly protests the Iranian Revolution had begun with soldiers firing indiscriminately into crowds of demonstrators leaving hundreds dead and many more wounded it was really only a matter of time before the Sha was forced out the priests have armed the mobs pistols and petrol bombs are the new symbols of power in Iran in February 1979 the Sha fled and a plane arrived in tyan carrying the country's new leader home from 16 years in Exile the holiest of men the Ayatollah Ki The Alliance of Democrats Communists and clerics who got together to oppose the Sha disintegrated and the clerics took charge now K and the Quran rule where once the Sha claimed to be United with his people Iran's 500y old monarchy was Swept Away in favor of a theocracy under the eye of the clerics a unique hybrid constitutional model was created the country would have regular elections a parliament and a president like most democracies around the world but a top that would sit a supreme leader an Islamic cleric who gets to decide who can run for office which of the government's policies can be implemented and how to use the country's resources under Islam oil like all natural resources is god-given and God controlled the supreme leader is appointed for Life by a council of clerics is in charge of the Armed Forces and cannot be disputed the constitution of the new Islamic Republic of Iran was more liberal than many expected women and some religious minorities had far more rights in Iran than they did in Saudi Arabia and other Arab monarchies but despite the appearance of modernity the regime was just as brutal as the Sha Islamic justice as interpreted by Ki will cut off the hands of those who disobey the reported savagery of the secret police has not died with the secret policeman Ki ordered a purge of the top levels of the military justice system and secret police with thousands publicly executed to make way for the new incoming clerical Elite Ki was officially named as the Imam a title previously reserved in Iran for the 12 descendants of Muhammad humi didn't just change the trajectory of Iran's future his vision of Islam had a ripple effect across the Middle East the incredible success of his Revolution triggered copycat actions from people in other countries who wanted to accelerate the rise of a global caliphate an uprising began in Saudi Arabia an American Military Base was bombed in Lebanon the president of Egypt was assassinated and H started encouraging followers living in neighboring Iraq to overthrow the country's dictator now the dictator of Iraq was a cool nice guy with a cool nice mustache who would never ever dare to cause any problems for the West Iraq's president Saddam Hussein Saddam Hussein Saddam Hussein Saddam Hussein it's unclear how much us involvement there was in saddam's decision to invade Iraq but what is clear is that once he did invade the US was all in the Iraqis began the war eagerly and with confidence that they could route an enemy already weaken from the revolution of the ayatollahi and purges within the armed forces the United States government had invested a lot of time and effort in keeping the Sha in power and now the Sha was gone and the Ayatollah had more than 50 American hostages in the US Embassy in tyan they wanted Saddam to topple Ki it was a war in which most outside has predicted a quick Iraqi Victory followed by the destabilization or overthrow of Iran's fundamentalist Islamic regime it backfired spectacularly far from undermining the Iranian Administration the war with Iraq served to strengthen the regime nothing galvanizes a population like an invasion just ask Ukraine Saddam quickly realized that he was fighting an uphill battle and tried to find a way out but humi wouldn't let him Ayatollah Hai declared there was no question of compromise the fighting would go on until the last Iraqi was driven from Iranian soil after 8 years and at least a million deaths heni agreed to end the fighting the Border was unmoved a year later heni was dead and given what may very well be the most extraordinary funeral in history that war is known as the Iran Iraq war but it's not a great name for it it was really just the first phase of a war against followers of K's idea of a global Islamic caliphate being established today rather than at some time in the distant future and extreme islamists have taken up that fight it's not fought in the Iranian mountains it's fought by iran-backed groups like Hamas in Gaza and Israel Hezbollah in Lebanon and the houthis in the waters of the Red Sea the houthi say this latest attack is in response to American British aggression Ayatollah H's Legacy is complex he overthrew the increasingly despotic sha when most thought that was impossible but then he instituted a regime that was just as brutal and corrupt which has been forced to quash multiple uprisings against it from the people it oppresses now Iran is isolated corrupt economically desperate and in a permanent Cold War which is now getting hotter by the day" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="with the hunt for the fugitive gathering pace the man in question was desperate for a deal as jolo's phone calls to the malaysian government continued he turned on one mdb's partners in the middle eastern capital abu dhabi i'm still very very close to abu dhabi they are most concerned about the because i think that's something they believe is tougher to manage massive kickbacks flowed from a deal jolo brokered between one mdb and an abu dhabi government investment fund chaired by sheikh mansour the brother of the crown prince in 2012 the abu dhabi fund guaranteed 1mdb bonds of the 6.5 billion dollars raised more than 2.5 billion was siphoned to offshore companies for the personal benefit of jolo najib his family and abu dhabi officials abu dhabi they have admitted to they have admitted to nothing but when jolo unleashed on abu dhabi he claimed complicity and corruption at the highest level the reality is people did take money the discussion that i left off with them is is look whatever i settle with the doj that is used to pay 1mdb bonds you all should match the same amount which is probably close to a billion dollars their position has been looked as abu dhabi inc we're not going to do that so i think they're managing that quite carefully recent u.s department of justice court filings reveal the 700 million mega yacht that jolo rented to show rosmah her pink diamond was owned by a company controlled by none other than sheikh mansour and had been bought in part with 1mdb money the abu dhabi royal and united arab emirates deputy prime minister did not reply to our questions about receiving 1mdb funds i've actually asked the current malaysian government to actually pursue the matter because approximately 160 million dollars of 1mdb money was used to pay for the past the huge mega yacht that part of our money should be returned to malaysia [Music] it's about how each deal changes a community a country and a world by 2016 china was about to become entwined in the 1mdb global financial scam jolo's investment company jinwal capital in hong kong and another business consulting firm in shanghai gave him a strong base in the communist state the last we know where he is he was in china we knew that he was negotiating with the companies involved in one of the mega projects in malaysia with jolo's help najib's government fast track contracts with giant state-owned companies including china communication construction company or cccc for massive infrastructure projects worth more than 30 billion dollars the highlight across country railway we have always claimed even before we won government that the contracts were inflated double the actual value of the project where the excess would then go towards various needs including paying for 1mdb debts as well as perhaps some pocket money for jolo i'm not it going to think the initial idea was you know there was some intent that at least uh if local contractors made like a substantial margin then you know a portion of their profit could be used to acquire certain assets but keeping the money trail hidden from growing international investigations proved a challenge back in 2016. again jolo turned to his friends in the middle east this time in kuwait enlisting the help of sheikh sabah jabba mubarak al-sabah a member of the royal family and son of the country's then prime minister and promoted an eight billion dollar joint venture between the gulf state and china seemingly as a smoke screen to channel excess money from inflated chinese contracts in malaysia from 2016 to 2017 hong kong subsidiaries of the chinese conglomerate cccc transferred more than 1.2 billion dollars into company accounts controlled by shakespeare almost 50 million dollars of this was used to pay for jolo's mounting legal fees and maintaining his assets so so he has had these pockets of funds being transferred and parked in various entities across the world paying money on his behalf to allow him to continue to to have a global presence without being found then more than 600 million dollars were siphoned through a maze of shakespeare's personal and company accounts back to 1mdb to pay off a fraction of its debt now standing at a massive 15 billion dollars [Music] neither cccc nor sheikh zabar responded to allegations of their involvement in the 1mdb scandal [Music] in his 2018 conversations with the malaysian government jolo was very careful not to implicate either kuwait or china in his backdoor scheme to repay 1mdb debts in fact he appeared to be acting in the interest of china i think the east coast railing is the most important it was like presidency's biggest one the one rook program in asia but i think the chinese position is i understand that the current government may need to adjust pricing and so on so forth but i'm but the fugitive was perhaps well placed to understand china's concerns he was still operating businesses there and said he was calling from there you know i'm not sure i guess what the concern is you know with respect to hong kong and macau whether it's because it's a china thing you all don't feel comfortable you know with uh meeting these locations that's you know my question today as it relates to jolo is if he is indeed in china what's in it for them [Music] china might have got involved in some of jolo's schemes and might very well be protecting him because of information he now has about their participation china is a signer on uncac the u.n convention against corruption and yet they completely ignore the rules interpol has placed a red notice for jolo to be arrested the united states has a warrant for his arrest the u.n convention against corruption should have some penalty by the end of may 2018 jolo was feeling the heat and he wanted malaysia to know it he warned their negotiations for the speedy return of assets was seriously in jeopardy one thing to consider and this is for you to report after the leadership too okay yeah yes the longer we take the more difficult it becomes what's in the u.s criminal suit any negotiation you know is going to be very challenging yeah and he claimed he was starting to feel pressure from najib's camp najib's youngest son ashman who was on the mega yacht in 2009 as the first 1mdb scam was being planned was barraging him with text messages at 11 30 am he just sends me a message don't trust anyone from the other side a deal will be proposed but it's a trick the former prime minister's u.s legal team was also unsettling him pian's lawyer he talks to my u.s lawyer very very often now we don't fully trust them but we think their information is accurate najib's u.s legal team was also acting for his stepson having received some 248 million dollars from one mdb risa aziz spent it on high-end real estate and kick-starting a movie career producing the hollywood blockbuster wolf of wall street was all this legal absolutely not like jolo he now faced civil forfeiture cases in the us and will become the subject of a criminal investigation we think that in an effort to get rizza off the hook and potentially the prime minister and first lady of the book we have been crafting this narrative trying to build the blame on me jolo also claims najib's u.s lawyers which included a former attorney general john ashcroft were furiously lobbying congressmen and even the cia it's getting me very worried because the more active they come i'm just worried it gets way more complicated for everyone i'm always disappointed when a former attorney general or someone else is knowingly representing a foreign kleptocrat but as far as what jolo is saying [Music] i can tell you even though millions are spent on lobbying efforts i don't see that they're successful but where those minions were coming from was clearly irritating jolo i think the important one to find out is actually who is cunning their legal bills because i can tell you from someone that is facing all these things they cost a lot of money so i think if the [ __ ] source is chopped off you know [Music] lobbying campaign went beyond the us pushing authorities in the uk to investigate mahathir's global assets they refuse to tell us who but there's a very influential british individual who has been in touch directly with the british prime minister the same british individual has met the number three person at scotland yard and they discussed potential special operations being conducted to gather data on the market and global assets but back in malaysia mahathir and his government seemed unperturbed we haven't made no deals with criminals now actively in pursuit of jolo they issued an arrest warrant and interpol red notice against him and when the fugitive next called he'd aborted a meeting in macau with malaysia's 1mdb investigators but i told them yesterday he claimed he'd been forced to flee from his safe haven in china to the united arab emirates because of the whole you know war of arrests and you know effectively basically the uae folks just didn't think it was safe so i've just gotten into dubai the reality is you know uh i'm in the uae they are like ultra paranoid now so i think it's going to be challenging for me to get any clearance to me having seemingly dodged malaysian authorities he was now suggesting he'd merely borrowed money from one mdb i don't believe there's any wrongdoing but you know irrespective of that all these ultimately world loans [Music] without you know being prosecuted i mean it starts out with like there was no wrongdoing if there were no wrongdoing people wouldn't be giving back the assets right there would be no assets to be seized i mean it's comical it's like if i keep saying the lie maybe somebody will believe me [Music] mahathir's administration definitely wasn't buying it it's only fair that everyone's everything [Music] okay it's very unlikely that the interested party yourself in particular will be dissolved from any further action it's very unlikely because the public will not accept that i'm sure you are very well aware because in malaysia we do not have plea bargain yeah okay okay no in malaysia no no the bad news got worse for jolo days later his malaysian passport was cancelled so too was the sinkits passport he bought in 2011 but unbeknown to authorities he still had others including a cypriot passport soon came a call from his lawyer robin rathmaul from the global firm cobrand kim [Music] joe provided you guys with a potential way forward with a holistic settlement and there were various offers to meet with joe our biggest piece of leverage right now is that you don't have joe so we can't proceed with this unless we are satisfied that on your side the good faith is that you're not using this whole whole thing is really just a if you like a smoke screen to try and arrest joe and the discussions became even more tense are you maintaining the position that there is no situation in which [Music] okay robin i'm sure you know for the fact he cannot walk away yeah he cannot walk away either he's going for a long time or slightly less that's only his two options yeah okay well that's very clear i mean look obviously i would say to that at the moment [Music] most jurisdictions are are not even going to listen to to that sort of bargain at least here in the united states you know we we basically do not bargain with fugitives the fugitives legal representatives are well paid for their advice in late 2019 alone cobrae and kim received more than 1.5 million dollars from the kuwait royal sheikh sabah for legal and pr services for jolo just eight months later sheikh zabar was arrested for his suspected involvement in the 1mdb scam even with the law firm i mean you don't have a complete anonymity to not know the source of the funds that you're being paid because ultimately if the law firm is knowingly taking in that money and then using those funds to hire the pr firm my next question would be are they guilty of money laundering you know because they're they're making it appear like legitimate funds when we put the former fbi agent's question to cobra and kim the firm didn't respond in early august 2018 jolo's equanimity was the first asset returned to malaysia malaysian police have filed the first set of criminal charges against jolo the next few weeks and months would see jolo charged with money laundering and bribery in both malaysia and the us najib who was facing more than 40 criminal charges was bolstered his new defense he'd been scammed by jolo it's just ridiculous i mean you know any simple person that looks at the facts is going to be able to tell what exactly happened so don't try and start you know telling telling everyone that you know you don't know anything which is absurd the last jolo recording is from late november 2018. once again he promised a complete list of all the assets bought with 1mdb money i can do something up in terms of better depth on the but he never delivered and the man who stole billions claimed he was struggling to be honest like it's a very different situation i think you know when we last spoke i think you know it's quite stressful you know because you know we kind of pay our legal fees it's racking up and you know we don't want this issue to drag on i think the malaysian government is the military government so so at the end of the day hopefully like many many years leave that you know it would be safe for us to go back to malaysia so i think you know ultimately we don't want to be seen as you know doing anything that is bad for malaysia less than 18 months after this final call mahathir's coalition government collapsed leaving open the possibility of najib and his cronies returning to power for jolo i'm sure his long-term thought is maybe the people that were involved in this scheme with him will once again become in a position of power and he'll be able to go home and not face prosecution there and not face the risk of being extradited to the united states but for now jolo remains on the run and on the move despite arrest warrants and interpol red notices in september 2019 he reportedly flew to kuwait then two months later we can confirm he traveled again this time on a previously undisclosed passport from the caribbean nation of granada aboard a gulfstream leader jet he flew from bangkok to dubai stopping for three days in india's ahmedabad on the way when and how he entered thailand is unknown the only way that can happen is through extremely high level government assistance from you know hunting for one individual if they do have the full resources of one or more governments to assist them on maintaining their their status as a fugitive it's difficult you know it can be difficult to get them but not impossible malaysian police accused china of harboring the fugitive and obstructing his arrest [Music] the communist superpower strongly denies it's protecting him but sources in both malaysia and macau have confirmed that jolo has been residing in a macau villa owned by a high-ranking chinese party official and businessman since at least february 2018. he still finds himself in a position where he's useful to certain people in positions of power whether that's strictly money or if it's continued contacts but all of that usefulness is perishable and he's a he's a pretty young man so uh he's got a long way to go to keep himself useful malaysian and united states authorities are still actively in pursuit of the fugitive i'm pretty sure that people who don't want to be incriminated would want him out of the country but we want him back the people of malaysia want him back in malaysia to face justice" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="- The Mossad has executed some of the most audacious spy missions on earth, going deep undercover into hostile territory, catching terror masterminds who seem untouchable and duping militant groups into buying rigged electronics through a ruse so elaborate no one suspects a thing until they explode without warning. The Mossad waits until terrorists feel safe, and then it reminds them that they aren't. - We are a global production company. We write the screenplay. We're the directors, we're the producers. We're the main actors. The world is our stage. - So how has the Mossad managed to take down some of its most elusive targets? Successful spies are masters of tradecraft. Strategies that help them gather intel without getting caught. It can take months or even years. But a good spy is patient. A good spy can wait over a decade for the payoff, and then when the target least expects it, the Mossad sends a little message. We're watching. We're waiting. There is no escape. No one is out of reach. Not even a ghost. Even when he was alive, Imad Mughniyeh was a ghost. And not the friendly kind. He'd always been extreme. As a teenager in Beirut, he controlled a savage gang that prowled the streets enforcing Islamic law, mostly by beating up drug suppliers and female escorts. But he had bigger ambitions. By the time he turned 21, he was second-in-command of a new shadowy terror organization, Hezbollah. Within months of assuming the position, he masterminded two blasts that claimed hundreds of lives. - 191 Marines dead in the explosion at their headquarters at the Beirut Airport. - He oversaw some of the most barbaric abductions the West had ever seen. And his reach extended well beyond his home turf. Mughniyeh ruthlessly targeted Israelis and Jews around the world. Israel had to eliminate him. But Mughniyeh was crafty, really crafty. All Israel had to identify him was one washed out photo. For over 20 years, no spy agency could catch him, not even the Mossad, which employed some creative strategies to lure him out of hiding like assassinating his brother, another Hezbollah operative. Mossad waited for Mughniyeh at the funeral. But Mughniyeh was too crafty to show up. His brother was buried without him, and the Mossad seemed to be out of luck. He was a ghost, a puff of smoke that no one could pin down. Until Hezbollah made a mistake. In 2004, Israel took out Ghaleb Awali, a senior Hezbollah commander. In a touching show of sentimentality, Hezbollah's propaganda department memorialized him in a short film. Bad move. Because the Mossad got their hands on the video, analyzing every frame for new information. They didn't expect to spot a ghost on camera, but there he was, standing next to Hezbollah's leader, Imad Mughniyeh in the flesh. It was the first sighting of Mughniyeh in decades. Now, Israel knew what he looked like, and they knew that if he was near Nasrallah he was probably somewhere in Lebanon. Where? And how would they get to him? As they pondered ways to reach Mughniyeh, Mossad pulled off a huge win. They hacked into the Iranian government system, which kept files on its allies and proxies, including Mughniyeh. And that's how the Mossad found out he'd been living in Damascus under an assumed name since 2006. It was the breakthrough they'd been waiting for. It was also a problem because Syria was a target country, an enemy state where undercover operations are especially dangerous. Organizing an assassination attempt would require lots of reconnaissance trips into Syria. But Syrian security was vigilant and sophisticated, and everyone knew what they do to a captured Israeli spy. It was too risky for Israeli agents to make the trips into Damascus. So the Mossad did something highly unusual. They ask the Americans for help. But the CIA has a strict policy of not picking fights with neutral countries. And at the time, Syria and the US had diplomatic relations. They couldn't just carry out an assassination on Syrian soil willy-nilly, or could they? Turns out they could. The US had their own reasons for wanting Mughniyeh gone, including the fact that he'd been sending men into Iraq to carry out strikes against American troops. So the CIA agreed to help under two conditions. One, the Israelis could target Mughniyeh and only Mughniyeh. That meant that if anyone else was in the vicinity, the whole operation was off. And two, US agents would help find Mughniyeh, but the Mossad would be the ones to take him out. The Israelis agreed. It was time for an exorcism. As American agents tailed Mughniyeh, they found the pious family man had a weakness. Syrian security services had supplied him with three women to be his special friends. He would drive to see them on his own, a surprising lapse in security for someone who was otherwise totally obsessed with staying out of danger. Because Mughniyeh was no dummy he knew he was a target, and he and his bodyguards were careful to check often for detonators inside and under his car, but they didn't think to check the case holding the spare tire in the back of a slick silver SUV. Bingo. This was it. If the Mossad could get some kind of blast material into the tire cover, Mughniyeh was going down. For months, Mughniyeh had a constant tail, watching and waiting for the right moment when his car was unattended. One night, while Mughniyeh was getting cozy with one of his lady friends, Mossad agents swooped in. They exchanged his tire cover for a new one, which had a special device that would eliminate Mughniyeh without causing any other casualties. The weapon was ready. Now they just needed everything else to fall into place. For weeks, Mossad operatives waited on edge. They almost detonated the charge 32 times, stopping at the last minute when Mughniyeh got into his car too quickly or when he got too close to another person. They didn't forget their agreement with the CIA. The target was Mughniyeh and only Mughniyeh. The 33rd time was the charm. On chilly February evening, Mughniyeh left the meeting with Syrian intelligence and other Hezbollah officers alone. This was it. As they drew closer to his car, the agents detonated. Mughniyeh was finally gone. After 30 years, they'd gotten the ghost. This wasn't Israel's first time executing a daring mission in enemy territory. They'd done it before and they would do it again, but the results would bring some unanticipated scrutiny. Dubai is the so-called playground of the rich in the Middle East. It's home to some eye-wateringly tall skyscrapers, improbable indoor ski hills, and the pristine turquoise waters of the Persian Gulf. It's also where some of Earth's most notorious militants conduct their business. Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh was one of these militants. Israel had wanted him for two decades, ever since the '80s when he and an accomplice had kidnapped and murdered two Israeli soldiers. Mahmoud was cold as ice. He admitted that his only regret was that he hadn't shot the gun himself. 20 years later, Mahmoud was coordinating weapon shipments for Hamas, running the network that moved Iranian weapons into the Gaza Strip, weapons that Hamas used to attack Israelis. It was time to get rid of him. The question was where and how? Mahmoud spent a lot of his time in countries like Syria, China, Iran, and Sudan. Not exactly Israel's buddies, but Mahmoud was a frequent flyer to another destination, Dubai. In 2009, the Emirati government was none too friendly to Israel. Dubai was risky, but it was the best of bad options. Tons of foreigners passed through the Emirate, which meant Mossad operatives could easily pose as tourists. And Dubai security wasn't as sophisticated as Iran's or Syria's. The Israelis figured that no investigation would get very far. Mistake number one. In 2009, Mossad deployed a hit squad to spy on Mahmoud and learn his habits. They entered the UAE undercover using false identities and foreign passports, passports that in some cases belonged to real people who had no idea that the Mossad had borrowed their documents. A few months later, they broke out those same foreign passports and returned to Dubai, this time to eliminate Mahmoud by poison. The mission was a failure. All the poison ended up doing was making Mahmoud feel a little unwell. The good news was that he never realized it was the Israelis that were the source of his illness. The bad news was that he was still at large and the Mossad was determined that the next time they tried to eliminate him, nothing could go wrong. So in January 2010, Israel's hit squad landed in Dubai for the third time, using the same foreign names and passports as before. Mistake number two. The hit squad wasn't sure where Mahmoud would stay, so they broke into small teams and checked into different hotels. Some paid in cash, but other agents paid with debit cards issued by one specific company, a company that was run by an Israeli. Mistake number three. Because the team was scattered around the city, they had to communicate with each other in real-time, so they used cell phones. But cell phones are very easy to track. So they didn't call each other directly, instead, the agents called a central switchboard in Austria, which connected them automatically to each other. Mistake number four. Any well-trained spy knows the part of successful tradecraft is switching up their look, new wigs, different hats, glasses, and even a costume or two. The hit squad had this technique down pat. They came prepared with disguises. Some posed as tennis players. One guy even entered a bathroom bald as a cue ball and left it with the head of luxurious hair. But even if they could evade the attention of other people, there were silent eyes watching them all the time. Dubai's hotels were absolutely chock-full of security cameras. Cameras that saw and recorded everything. Mistake number five. Just six hours after Mahmoud landed in Dubai, the hit squad broke into his hotel room. It took 20 minutes to accomplish the mission. After locking the room from the inside, the hit squad hightailed it outta the hotel and onto the flights. Mahmoud lay in bed after what looked like a heart attack. At first, the hotel security officers who found him thought they had just stumbled on a random tourist who had the misfortune to croak on vacation. The authorities didn't know it was Hamas' weapons guy. They only knew Mahmoud under the false name he traveled under. His body went to the morgue, and nobody thought about it again. Until Hamas started to get suspicious. You don't just ignore Hamas when they call. So when Mahmoud stopped picking up his phone, they knew something was off. One of their agents searched police stations and morgues until he found Mahmoud. And now the Dubai authorities were in for a nasty surprise. That random tourist not actually a tourist. That heart attack wasn't a heart attack at all, but the work of the Mossad. Dubai Security Services were furious at Hamas for using Dubai as a base for illegal activity, and at the Mossad, which had just assassinated someone in their city. They scoured airline passenger lists, looking for anyone who had traveled to Dubai around the same time as Mahmoud. A series of foreign names kept appearing and reappearing. Authorities crosschecked these names against hotel guest lists. And those silent eyes, Dubai's huge network of security cameras, gave them another piece of the puzzle. The faces of the agents. With the names of the agents in hand, investigators looked at data, a lot of data. Data like debit cards that were traced back to a company headed by an Israeli, phone calls that were all mysteriously routed to the same switchboard in Austria. Information that made it glaringly obvious that a group of people seemingly scattered around Dubai had actually acted in unison. Dubai's lead investigator was able to cobble together all the security footage to retrace the footsteps of the hit squad, almost to the minute. This grainy, silent movie wasn't gonna win any Oscars, but the evidence was irrefutable. Dubai wasn't the only angry government. Had the Mossad used real passports or had forged them? To the countries involved, it didn't really matter. They felt manipulated. And Israel couldn't afford to alienate their allies. The diplomatic fallout from this episode was intense. - France condemns this assassination. Murder is no way to carry out international relations. - The Dubai passports incidents also constitutes a clear and direct breach of confidential undertakings between Australia and Israel dating back some years. - On paper, the mission was a success. They'd eliminated Mahmoud temporarily interrupting Hamas' flow of weapons, but the operation was a bust. The Mossad had burned a number of agents and exposed its tradecraft secrets, which weren't even that sophisticated to begin with. It was a mortifying episode, but a useful one, because Israel learned a lot about what not to do. And though it took over a decade, they eventually put those lessons to good use. Remember this video from June 2024? I'm not a betting guy, but I'm willing to put money on the fact that over the next few years, Israeli secret agents are going to go on some pretty wild missions. After all, the Israeli government has vowed to take down every single person who planned the attack of October 7th. Turns out that was a pretty safe bet. Here's the story of how a broken air conditioner almost foiled Israel's operation to get rid of a top October 7th Mastermind. Ismail Haniyeh had been involved with Hamas since he graduated from university. By the time the terror group wrested control of the Gaza Strip in a bloody coup, he was in charge. For a decade, he ruled Hamas with an iron fist. But by 2017, he traded the Gaza Strip for Qatar, one of the richest countries in the Middle East. As millions of Gazans struggled to put food on the table, Haniyeh lived in the lap of luxury with a net worth of $4 billion. What a leader, right? As for why Haniyeh was enjoying the good life in Qatar, well, it's complicated. Qatar has hosted Hamas' leadership since 2012 at the request of the United States, which wanted an easier way to talk to the terror group. Israel agreed to respect this arrangement. That meant attacking any Hamas operatives on Qatari soil was absolutely out of the question. And Israel was not about to repeat the Dubai debacle and risk alienating its most important ally, the United States. If they were going to get Haniyeh, they'd have to wait for him to leave Qatar. Problem was, Haniyeh spent most of his time in Turkey, Russia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, highly dangerous countries for Israeli operatives. And when he was visiting Iran, Haniyeh wasn't exactly couch surfing. He stayed in one of Tehran's most heavily guarded hotels, the guest house of the Islamic Republic's notorious military, the IRGC. The IRGC is powerful, dangerous and sophisticated. But even they weren't immune to Israel's tradecraft. In May 2024, an unexpected event sparked one of the Mossad's most ambitious assassinations. On a cool spring day, Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi's helicopter unexpectedly crashed into a remote mountainside. No one in Israel or most of Iran was shedding any tears over Raisi. He was a monster, responsible for executing several thousand political prisoners in Iran. But right away, Israel realized they had a golden opportunity. The helicopter crash meant Iran would hold the state funeral, and shortly thereafter, the inauguration of a new president. And as a key figure in Iran's terror proxy network, Ismail Haniyeh would undoubtedly attend both events, which left Israel with just weeks to plan the assassination that would finally take Haniyeh out. Someone working for the Israeli smuggled the device into the IRGC guest house carefully positioned in Haniyeh's room. Some news reports say the device was placed soon after Raisi's crash, while others claim it was placed a couple months later, just moments before the detonation. We still don't know who or how or when, but we do know this, as the inauguration festivities wound down and Haniyeh made his way back to his room, a team of agents was waiting on tender hooks for go time. And then, the AC broke down? July in the Middle East is hot. Even the bad guys need to stay cool. So when Haniyeh left to get his air conditioning fixed, the team feared he was switching rooms. A twist of fate which would have led to a very different ending to this. But after a while, Haniyeh came back, but he didn't have long to enjoy the room because in the early hours of July 31st, 2024, a boom shook the IRGC guest house. And the man who had mastermind of the 10/7 attacks, the man responsible for tens of thousands of de*ths was finally gone. But the w*r was far from over. Since that horrific day in October, Israel had been fighting on multiple fronts. At first, they focused on Hamas, but as Hezbollah rockets reigned down on Israel's northern communities driving 60,000 Israelis from their homes, it was clear that the situation couldn't continue. It was time to take down Hezbollah. Back in 2014, Taylor Swift had just dropped her hit single, Shake It Off. Russia was hosting the Winter Olympics. And Israel, usually known for its high tech, was in the business of making clunky walkie-talkies for a very special customer. That customer was Hezbollah who were in the market for walkie-talkies for their fighters. They're the perfect method of communication on a battlefield, instant and secure. So Israel seized on the opportunity. Their plan was simple. Copy a popular Japanese design Hezbollah liked, replace some of the battery components with tiny blast devices, and convince Hezbollah to buy them. Easy-peasy. Using a complex network of shell companies, Israel sold 16,000 walkie-talkies to Hezbollah operatives. And then, for 10 years, they sat back and waited. Like KGB sleeper spies from the Cold War, the walkie-talkie seemed innocent. In reality, there were deadly weapons ready to activate at a moment's notice. Fast forward a few years, a female Mossad agent had a bright idea. Why not do the same with pagers? Rig some unassuming looking pagers, and voila, you have a handheld, remote controlled, exploding device. Pagers are the dinosaurs of communication devices. For the most part, they're a museum piece. - That belongs in a museum! - But for a terror group like Hezbollah, pagers had a lot of appeal. Pagers don't have much function other than receiving a message. But their limited utility also means that they can't be electronically hacked, perfect for a group that doesn't wanna be tracked. Initially, the Mossad said, nah, not enough people in Hezbollah were using pagers to warrant the effort it would take to make and distribute them. But over time, Hezbollah's higher ups were getting antsy about using cell phones, which could be hacked and tracked. It was too big a risk. So Israel jumped. They even got a team to flood Arab social media with fake news. about Israel's amazing ability to hack cell phones, trying to fool Hezbollah into looking for more secure alternatives like pagers. The Mossad knew that Hezbollah would be suspicious of new technology companies trying to sell them products. So Israel had to work within their existing supplier system. But the suppliers couldn't know either. Everything had to seem above board, which meant Mossad had to go deep. Hezbollah got its devices from a Taiwanese technology company. So Israel set up a shell company based in Budapest, which bought a licensing agreement from Gold Apollo to manufacture a new line of beepers. This new product line was bigger, more rugged and more durable, and it came with a little surprise embedded in the battery. - What a surprise. - Israeli engineers spent months testing and tweaking the pagers, which were designed to maim rather than kill. The blast radius was tiny. Only the person carrying the beeper would be injured. It was the most targeted attack the world had ever seen. The Mossad left nothing to chance. They tested which ringtones would be most compelling and how long it would take for someone to check their beeper after being paged. To convince Hezbollah that the pagers were a worthwhile investment, Israel tapped again into the power of social media, creating slick ads that played on YouTube. Even legitimate customers were interested, but the Israelis dissuaded them by quoting absurdly high prices. Of course, these customers had no idea they were really talking to the Mossad. Meanwhile, the sales team made Hezbollah an offer they couldn't refuse. The first batch of beepers were free, and they'd offer a discount if they bought in bulk. Hezbollah fell for it, hook, line, and sinker. By the fall of 2023, they'd handed out thousands of pagers to their operatives, but Israel was on borrowed time. One of Hezbollah's top technicians was starting to get suspicious that the walkie-talkies Hezbollah had bought 10 years earlier might actually be incendiary devices. He was asking one too many questions. So Israel shut him down permanently with an airstrike. And mid-September 2024, the now or never moment came. Israel's military intelligence learned that Hezbollah had asked Iran to examine the pagers, worried they might contain explosives. It was time to act. Five days later, in the middle of the afternoon, an encrypted message went out to the rigged pagers triggering the hidden detonators. Seconds later, a wave of explosions sounded all across Lebanon. The country was in shock, but Israel wasn't done yet. A few days later, they activated the walkie-talkies. 10 years of waiting were over. Hundreds of Hezbollah's fighters were taken out of action. Their communications network was shattered. And in one of the biggest blows to the terror organization, Israel capitalized on Hezbollah's weakness to finally assassinate its elusive leader, Hassan Nasrallah. It was the stuff of spy thrillers. So unlikely, it seems impossible. But that's the Mossad's MO, they have to remain adaptable, they have to think outside the box, they have to strike when they're least expected. Not every mission succeeds, but when they do, they remind Israel's enemies that Jews fight back, and that the Mossad is always watching, working overtime to protect their tiny nation." />

          <attvalue for="3" value="The International Criminal Court in The Hague wants Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrested for alleged war crimes in Gaza. But international justice works differently to other forms of justice—it relies on everyone opting in. More than 20 years into its existence the court is yet to convict any world leaders of anything. As the first fugitive from the ICC who is also an ally to Western countries like Australia and France, this case is one that could make or break the court itself.

          <attvalue for="7" value="if the prime minister of Israel comes to your country would you arrest him that's the question that dozens of governments around the world are wrestling with at the moment after this announcement last month the international criminal court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister yoav Galant for alleged war crimes in Gaza this technically makes Netanyahu a fugitive from International Justice the icc's prosecutor urging the more than 120 countries who are members of the court to cooperate with the warrants Australia is among them so would you arrest him already multiple Nations have said they will follow their obligations for arrest including the Netherlands Ireland and Canada Australia hasn't gone that far issuing a vague statement saying it respects the independence of the Court a vague statement we love those but there are plenty of countries around the world that absolutely would not arrest him like the United States we fundamentally reject uh the Court's decision to issue arrest warrants for senior uh Israel officials and yet here's the tricky thing would those countries that wouldn't arrest Netanyahu be happy to arrest this guy the international criminal court has accused Vladimir Putin of being responsible for the forced deportations of children following his invasion of Ukraine and has issued a warrant for his arrest for war crimes yeses tricky one huh but well maybe not for you but it's clearly tricky for some France for example says it would absolutely arrest Vladimir Putin if he was to visit Paris but Netanyahu maybe not so what's that about the idea behind the ICC is that the world needs an independent International Court to prosecute war crimes genocide stuff like that crimes so horrific they harm not only their victims but Humanity itself the international Community kind of agrees on this idea but agreeing on a universal approach to justice that could actually address these crimes that part is harder is it really Justice for example if some countries can just opt out why is it that until now anyway the court has failed to convict any world leaders of anything and what does that mean for Netanyahu and his allies I'm Mat B and this if you're listening okay uh I'll I'll come back to war crimes in just a minute I promise but just quickly I have a short survey about the show and it would be really helpful to us if you did it it's not about promoting something we're literally just trying to make the show better next year it's how we know if we're on the right track or if we're doing something that annoys you there's a link below in the video description and on our website thank you okay now war crimes captured at last one of the world's most feared and Elusive dictators in the middle of 1997 an extraordinary event took place at a jungle clearing in Northern Cambodia after 18 years in hiding these first pictures show an aging ill and abandoned despot communist dictator Paul pot orchestrated the genocide of around a quarter of cambodia's population before being overthrown in 1979 he and his supporters retreated into the jungle for 18 years until suddenly after years of diard loyalty his followers seem to have turned against the man who engineered the horror of cambodia's Killing Fields in an extraordinary trial at his jungle base on the Thai Cambodia border whole pot is publicly humiliated and denounced looking for laor and occasionally disinterested popot sat in a wooden chair on a dirt floor as local villagers en chanted denunciations condemned for treason and genocide this court sentences pulpot to life imprisonment the trial wasn't the result of a sudden change of heart but a power shift his supporters wanted to come out of the Jungle but to do that they had to purge their genocidal leader now he's appeared it's hard to see cambodians or the world letting him die peacefully in the jungles of Northern Cambodia and yet that's exactly what happened less than a year later popt died of a heart attack while under house arrest it was more punishment than some dictators get but one afternoon of jungle shouting followed by a few months of house arrest hardly seems like justice being served for genocide that was certainly the opinion of the UN Secretary General at the time Kofi and Anne today a man is more much more likely to appear before a court if he kills one person then if it kills 100,000 the case in example is Cambodia this question of how to achieve anything close to justice for the killing of thousands of people was a question the world had been asking long before Paul pot but it was always solved with an ad hoc solution Reinventing the wheel after each genocide and there's something else that these tribunals had in common they happened after the event when those on trial had lost power take World War II after the war International military tribunals were set up in occupied Germany and Japan officials from both defeated countries were prosecuted convicted jailed and executed for war crimes and crimes against humanity including the genocide of 6 million Jews in the Holocaust but the winners of the war the Allies weren't interested in investigating the war crimes they themselves had committed while every leader wants the other guys to be prosecuted for war crimes very few leaders want to risk being prosecuted themselves and so when the prosecutions of Germans and Japanese were complete the courts were disbanded but in the 50 years that followed crimes against humanity kept on happening at the end of the second world war and following the exterminations of the Holocaust we all said never again this should never happen again but it has in in the 1990s an attempt was made to do something that had never been tried before investigate and prosecute crimes against humanity while they were happeny on uh May 22nd I presented an indictment for confirmation against sladan movich and four others charging them with crimes against humanity this temporary tribunal was set up by the UN Security Council but the big news was that mosovich was the sitting president of Yugoslavia at the time Yugoslavia had previously been a Federation of six Multicultural republics including mosovich homeland of Serbia and the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina throughout the 1990s the Federation had been collapsing and the dominant ethnic groups in several republics had been trying to push other cultures out if you're going to tidy up the map in an ethnic way with the type of intermingling that history is as has created in Europe you can only do it in one way and that is getting rid of people the results were horrific these wars we've seen tend to have a level of atrocity that is quite extraordinary so the tribunal had heard evidence about these atrocities and sent out a lot of arrest warrants including the one for mosovich but it had no power to enter Yugoslavia and capture people it means Mr mosovich faces arrest if he travels outside Yugoslavia the wasn't a lot of optimism at the time that mosovich would ever face Justice ravan kadic and general ratam ladic charged nearly 4 years ago for war crimes in Bosnia have yet to be prosecuted very pessimistic feels very 2020s but let's just jump forward to the night of March 31st 2001 it's quite a wild scene in Bel tonight I think it's chaotic by this time mosovich had lost power but he was still living in the presidential complex millions of yugoslavs still supported him but the International Community was demanding Justice and it was willing to cut off Aid to mosovich successes if they didn't arrest him the Yugoslav government is hoping to secure a billion dollars in reconstruction Aid and without America's support it knows it's unlikely to get it finally the new leaders were turfing him out the police arrived at the presidential residence where Slobodan mosovich is still living at around 7 in the evening they were met by several thousand Pro mosovich demonstrators the police were there to arrest him but he wasn't coming out formal charges have now been laid and police are now trying to remove him from the presidential residence earlier rumors around the house suggested that mosovich was threatening to shoot himself as the police tried to smash their way in through the front windows of the house mosovich called into a radio station on his mobile phone absolutely I'm just sitting in my house drinking coffee with friends with a lot of citizens around has so that is the truth I want to send regards to your audience the eyes of the world on them police demonstrators and mich's bodyguards settled in for a Siege this wasn't just about mosovich this was about the entire idea of international Justice the experiment in Yugoslavia and a similar tribunal in Rwanda were being held up as examples of what was needed after crimes against humanity were committed on a massive scale but the argument went that setting up a new Tribunal for every new genocide was too timec consuming so they were used as models for this the agreement to set up the world's first permanent war crimes tribunal was greeted with cheers and from some delegates tears of relief that agreement led to the creation of the international criminal court oper ating from the hag the court will deal with genocide aggression and crimes against humanity as well as war crimes and yet there was a very serious question about whether or not it would actually work international law relies on countries agreeing to be part of it and the list of countries signing up to be within the Court's Jurisdiction had some very conspicuous absences like China Russia India and the final document was opposed by the us because of fears that its troops in the world's hotspots could become the target for politically motivated charges but these weren't the only Skeptics it seems to me impossible that an Australian government could by a treaty uh subject its own citizens to the jurisdiction of a non-australian court it's already drawing Fierce criticism for being undemocratic and unaccountable the United States has said that the risk is too great to take that's basically what they're saying and I agree with that 100% as the bgrade police Poli tried to push their way into the presidential Villa and mosovich sipped coffee with his friends the founding members of this new court were trying to convince the rest of the world that the whole thing could really work the Americans were supportive of Prosecuting mosovich specifically so if this whole thing went well maybe they would change their mind about the international criminal court well we've always said that Mr mosovich ought to be brought to Justice 26 hours into the standoff after finishing his coffee and threatening to kill himself and his family mosovich surrendered as he did his distraught daughter fired five gunshots into the night sky which I am reliably informed is a very subbian thing to do eventually mosovich was extradited to the icc's headquarters in the ha yes Mr mosovich I consider this tribunal false tribunal and indictments false indictments but the trial dragged on for 4 years and before it was complete it ended very suddenly the first head of state to be put on trial by the world and he died alone in his cell it was a heart attack a predictable one he'd been having heart problems for years back home in Belgrade Bells rang as a mark of respect there were extremely mixed feelings the victims felt robbed of Justice his supporters thought that he'd been murdered the government which had allowed him to be extradited was disappointed with the whole Saga calling it an expensive circus with insignificant Witnesses by the time of mich's death in 2006 around 100 countries had signed up to be part of the international criminal court most of the NATO countries all of the European Union many of the commonwealth countries Great Britain France Germany Canada New Zealand and slightly later than a lot of our friends Australia but Russia India China and America still refuse to be part of it the US's attitude to international law for the last 50 years since the UN was created is that International laws for everybody else and not for us I mean we've got the US Constitution we got the Bill of Rights we don't need international law and that's pretty much what the international criminal court looks like today with a third of UN member states still refusing to sign up the Court's Jurisdiction is extremely weird the court can only prosecute people who are citizens of its members States or who have committed alleged crimes in the member states or if the UN Security Council refers a case to the ICC and it's up to the member states to arrest people who've been indicted by the court of 67 indictments over 19 years nine people have been given prison sentences five trials are ongoing 30 people are fugitives the others are dead or just had the charges dropped there have been ations made that the ICC has a racial bias with most prosecutions focusing on African conflicts despite all of this the existence of the ICC has given at least the illusion of international justice but that has become more complicated recently when two friends of the Pod became International fugitives for only the third time in the history of the international criminal court a serving president has been targeted by an arrest warrant the international criminal court has accused Vladimir Putin of being responsible for the forced deportations of children following his invasion of Ukraine and has issued a warrant for his arrest for war crimes Ukraine had invited the court to investigate crimes that had happened on its territory since 2013 ke estimates that more than 16,000 children have been illegally moved to Russia or Russian occupied territories while there are many allegations of war crimes in Ukraine this is the one that the ICC prosecutor Kim Khan feels is most likely to lead to a conviction it is forbidden by international law for occupied powers to transfer civilians from the territory they live in to other territories children enjoy special protection under the Geneva Convention the ICC can investigate Putin it can issue a warrant for his arrest but then their execution depends on International cooperation Russia obviously won't arrest him and neither will friendly country like China or Belarus who haven't signed on but what if he travels to a country that has as an IC member Mongolia was obliged to arrest Vladimir Putin when he touched down instead he's been given the red carpet treatment there is absolutely no penalty for ignoring an ICC arrest warrant that's not great and there's also no penalty for just bailing out of the agreement altogether that's the move that former Philippines president Rodrigo dette pulled when the ICC started investig ating him for crimes against humanity committed during a drug war president duterte is rejecting the investigator's Authority in the country citing the fact the Philippines had cancelled its membership in 2018 I mean if that's true it seems like a pretty serious loophole you can't investigate me I quit it's now seemingly up to dte's successor as president to decide whether the IC can investigate or prosecute him we've done a whole episode epis on this by the way the story of that relationship is actually wild but now there's also Benjamin Netanyahu Israel is not a member state of the IC but Palestine has been a member since 2015 and last month the ICC accused Netanyahu and the former Israeli defense minister yoav Gallant of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war in Gaza the arrest warrants issued say the pair used starvation as a weapon of War it said they directed attacks against civilians deprived them of basic supplies such as food and water and inflicted great suffering upon people who needed medical treatment Netanyahu reacted angrily what in God's name are they talking about in the H he personally attacked the people who issued the warrant including the ICC prosecutor who's trying to extricate himself from sexual harassment charges and by biased judges were motivated by anti-semitic sentiments against the one and only je estate Netanyahu is the first Western Allied leader to be subject to an ICC arrest warrant Israel's allies around the world are wrestling with what to do if he wants to visit them France nonsensically says that they would arrest Putin but wouldn't arrest Netanyahu this of all the responses really shows you that this is a system that is very broken courts are supposed to be independent and the ICC may be independent at its heart but it's totally powerless to do anything without the cooperation of the rest of the world and the rest of the world isn't independent at all world leaders get to decide if they recognize the Court's Authority they get to decide if they'll arrest people or not the ICC is an idea that a lot of people around the world want to believe in but like so many other well-intentioned International bodies it's hamstrung by politics it's been more than 25 years since Kofi and said this today a man is more much more likely to appear before a court if he kills one person than if he kills 100,000 and since then very little has changed [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] at this point in time all of you at least most of you have heard the statement Gaza is the biggest open prison in the world so today we're going deep into that story the story of the Gaza Strip its history its people its borders and who benefits from you thinking that it's the biggest prison in the world the Gaza Strip is a small piece of land on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea a borders Egypt on the Southwest and Israel on the East and the north people have lived in Gaza for Millennia but for for today's purposes were focusing on the history starting in 1947 in 1947 the entire land is inhabited both by Arabs and Jews and controlled by the British Empire it's already riddled with violence fueled by competing National aspirations then the UN proposes the partition plan a two-state solution with Jerusalem as its International City the Palestinians were to receive the Western Galilee the Samarian Highlands and the coastal plains south of jof including the Gaza Strip Jewish leaders accepted this plan reluctantly of course and the Palestinians along with the Arab countries around them opposed any partition leading to a Jewish State igniting the 1948 War following Egypt into war were Iraq Jordan that back then was known as trans Jordan Lebanon and Syria the Egyptians attack from within Egypt and this is important to note from Egypt they washed through the Gaza Strip and then up the coastal plains toward Wards Tel Aviv and with much effort this wasn't at all an easy battle the young state of the time pushes them back to the Gaza Strip establishing that first sliver as we know it today at the end of the war Gaza was occupied by Egypt what's interesting is they never annexed the Gaza Strip it forever remained even under Egyptian control an area controlled by military governance but not fully citizens or people with full rights Egypt maintained control over for Gaza for 19 years and in that 19-year period it's not like everything is peaceful in the Gaza Strip there's a ton of refugees that have sort of come in the Gaza Strip there's a lot of violence and they're under military control but not only that there wasn't no fence back then so those communities in the Gaza Strip continuously throughout the period go out and murder Jewish communities that border them in 1967 the 19-year control of the Egyptians in the Gaza Strip ends with a Six-Day War what was that war a quick reminder it's this incredibly Swift six day battle where Israel quadruples its landmass in a strategic attempt to push hostile forces further away from its borders and to gain some strategic depth this is when Gaza first came under Israeli control over the years tension between Gaza and Israel continued to rise but in 1993 things seemed like they could change for the best with the start of the Oslo Accords finally the time is approaching when there will be safety in Israel's house when the Palestinian people will write their own destiny so sidebar what are the Oslo Accords the Oslo Accords were a series of agreements starting in the early '90s that were supposed to gradually bring together the Israelis on the one side the Palestinians on the other side with the ultimate goal of having two states one Jewish State called Israel one Palestinian State called Palestine the Gaza Strip was part of that agreement the first Sao Accords is basically this general statement of we accept your existence as a people which sounds basic to us today but back then there was a lot the next set of Accords was 1995 and they go way farther into detail of where the borders are going to be what the future Palestinian state is going to look like and again all of this encompasses also the Gaza Strip at the same time as Israel government and the Palestinian leadership are negotiating there are extremists on both sides who are strongly opposed to these Accords in Israel an extremist murders are then prime minister isin in the Palestinian side you have the Hamas and the Islamic Jihad Palestinian terrorist organizations who do everything they can to stop the Accords and what does everything they can mean it means they're murdering Israeli civilians in the streets of our country in 2000 we have this big attempt to jump start the oso Accords in which the US of course the Israelis and the Palestinians come together in Camp David in the US to try and rekindle this ongoing discussion UD Bak is our prime minister at the time he shows up with whatever mandate he had from the government and Y Al Palestinian leader shows up and for whatever reason he can't or will not move on with the Accords if you look at the big picture timeline of history that last Camp David meeting is sort of the last ditch attempt attempt to restart the oso Accords after that we really never have an effective one in fact the Palestinians start what we now call the second intifada in late 2000 which is a 5year ongoing terrorist attack on the heart of Israel it was suicide bombers blowing up on buses in cafes in malls across Israel that is the reality I grew up to as a teenager the Palestinians did everything they could to sabotage the peace Accords and on the Israeli side our population strongly lost faith that there's a chance to really reach meaningful peace of the Palestinians many years down the line we find out that arafat's second in that was marketed as this Grassroots movement wasn't as spontaneous as it was pegged to be in fact it was meticulously planned by the PLO by the Palestinian Authority to sabotage the peace with Israel so how is all of this related to the god of strip and today's topic let's go back to the Gaza Strip so from the 9s through the early 2000s Gaza has a mix of Palestinian cities which are the vast majority of the population in Israeli communities that are spread out on the coast on the Eastern side and in the north of the Gaza STP in the absence of Peace negotiations with the Palestinians and in response to the ongoing threat of terrorism in 2005 the Israeli government led by Ariel Shon does something that no one has ever done in history we decided to pull out of the Gaza Strip with no agreement with no preconditions with nothing just with a point to stop the violence to stop the terrorism every Israeli Citizen and Soldier are pulled out of the Gaza Strip till the last one it's important to know that this was not easy for the Israeli people in fact till this day the 2005 disengagement from the Gaza Strip is considered to be one of the most divisive events in Israeli history till this day people talk back to that event as one of the causes for our current political conflict no more Israelis inside the strip no Israeli military presence the Israeli Gaza border crossings were to be used only for the passage of goods Aid and individuals with permits from within Gaza into Israel or Goods into Gaza control of the Gaza Egypt border was handed over to Egypt and the expectation was that this move on our end would allow the Palestinian in the Gaza Strip to finally have the peace to have the freedom that they wanted to have the control of their own land and to finally move away from violence so Israel withdraws from the Gaza Strip in 2005 leaves behind the Palestinians who a year later 2006 have national elections the Hamas wins they don't win all the votes but they win enough to overthrow the fat the PLO and they don't do this in the Democratic way they violently and murderously throw them out of the Gaza Strip there have been no other election since in Gaza so the Gaza Strip was now under Hamas control which openly called and still calls for the destruction of the entire state of Israel we continue to give them water we continue to give them electricity we continue to have tens of thousands of Palestinians work inside of Israel and the violence continues from the Gaza STP again and again and again the Israeli Gaza border has been the crossing point of numerous terrorist attacks abusing Israel's permits coming into the country to kill soldiers and civilians alike and the communities along the Israeli side of the Border have become so accustomed to the rocket attacks from the Gaz inside that everywhere you look you'll see bomb shelters with a hostile entity along its border Israel resorted to tightening the Border points between Israel and Gaza saying if you want open passage at least recognize our country's right to exist since 2006 that has not not yet happened I think if there was anyone who had any doubts about how much of a necessity having a strong border with the Gaza Strip is those doubts disappeared on October 7th with a vicious attack of the Hamas against the innocent civilians of Israel there's this claim that's constantly made that Israel is the one that controls all the entry and exit of the Gaza Strip but that's of course not true Israel controls the Eastern side and the northern side bordering with Israel but they have a whole big border that borders with the Egyptians and that border is controlled by the Egyptians since 2005 so who benefits the misleading statement that Gaza is a prison controlled by Israel there are ulterior motives at play here Hamas are a terrorist group that is part of Iran's Network it's Iran fighting through Hamas attacking Israel the biggest victims of the Hamas actions and the Iranian government behind them are the Palestinian people living in the Gaza Strip if you've seen any of the footage coming out of the Gaza Strip lately it's impossible not to feel empathy and compassion for the people of that strip the Hamas took the water pipes that were donated and they used it for Rockets they took the fertilizer meant for building the land and used it for explosives they took the construction materials continuously brought in to build tunnels to attack Israel because the Hamas policy has been destructive and devastating to the people of the Gaza Strip that is the reality of what's happening on the ground so where does this all leave us what do we do with all this information we have to understand how important it is to have a strong border between Israel and the Hamas in the Gaza STP the people of Gaza deserve a peaceful life they deserve Prosperity they deserve quiet as do the people of Israel and with Hamas control of the Gaza Strip that's simply never going to happen if Gaza is a prison then Hamas are the prison guards" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="if Israel hypothetically decided we want to be in full compliance with international law what would it have to do in general there needs to be an end to racial discrimination and the domination by one racial group over another from the river to the sea taking center stage today is Ralph Wild a professor of international law at University College London he is probably best known for serving as senior counsel and advocate to the League of Arab States before the International Court of Justice wild argued before the court that Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territories is illegal and must end immediately ralph Wild thank you so much for joining us on Center Stage you argued in front of the judges of the International Court of Justice on behalf of the Arab League that Israel's presence on Palestinian territory is unlawful and must end immediately and that legal presentation got quite a lot of attention online it was described in some corners of the internet as a master class so we'd like to get the benefit of that for people who don't have a grounding in international law but who still want to know what the law says and what the law doesn't say can you sum up your arguments before the ICJ for us so the question that the court was addressing ended up being focused uh on the situation uh of the territories uh captured by Israel in 1967 which is of course only 22% of Palestine so within that uh limited framework the issue was what are the legal consequences of Israel's presence in that territory so we're talking about the Gaza Palestinian Gaza Strip and the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the court was considering is the presence in and of itself lawful does Israel have a legal right to even be there and also in the way Israel conducts its presence the way it behaves in Palestinian territory including the way it treats the Palestinian people is that lawful and the court determined uh uh that in the negative on both questions that Israel has no legal right to be there in the first place and must therefore withdraw and also that the conduct of the presence the conduct of the occupation is also violating international law so the opinion of the ICJ was that Israel and Israelis cannot be on Palestinian land that's right illegal on the land occupied since 1967 which is not the entirety of Palestinian land yes is that now binding international law that everyone must respect it was already the position in international law um the court was interpreting the existing law and determining what that law means so it amounts to an authoritative determination of what that law means by the uh the most distinguished uh jurists uh globally i want to make sure I get this right the binding versus non-binding because when I interview people who speak in defense of Israel and I bring up this advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice invariably they tell me &quot;Oh that's not minding.&quot; Yes the inference being it doesn't need to be respected well the law needs to be respected the law that the court determined uh uh the meaning of which the court determined in the advisory opinion needs to be uh complied with you opened your presentation your statement by saying &quot;Palestinians have been denied self-determination through and I quote a more than centurylong violent colonial racist effort to establish a nation state exclusively for the Jewish people in the land of mandatory Palestine.&quot; When you say racist is that a legal determination or is that a political statement in international law uh racial discrimination is unlawful and in general and then the uh a particular regime of uh domination by one group over another in a system of government and authority uh on the basis of racial domination is also unlawful as apartheite you use the word apartheite yes in your arguments the court in its advisory opinion did not what is the finding there the court uh clearly established that there was a violation uh of the relevant areas of international law uh without expressly referencing a partite as a a violation but nonetheless uh covering that uh without mentioning it in terms likewise when it came to um aggression in my reading of the opinion they did call it discrimination though discrimination and then they didn't specify whether it was racial religious or ethnic but in the way I read the opinion it's one of those three it's relig discrimination on one of those three grounds so the the the way that we can understand the court's decision is based on the arguments that were put before it which were all rooted in not only uh religious um discrimination which is also um uh the the situation but also discrimination on the grounds of race now if I try to cross-examine you I'm not going to be very successful i'm not a topflight international lawyer but what I can do is I can I I have read Israel's uh legal arguments that were put forward by uh Israeli the Israeli ambassador it's one-sided because it overlooks well dominating the other the Palestinians are not occupying uh Israeli land so uh the the by definition if the court's going to be considering the question of domination it it isn't going to be need needing to address any issue of the other side peacemaking has been scuttled on various occasions by the Palestinians themselves irrelevant to the issue of whether Israel has a right to dominate the Palestinian people it's a nonsear that's a uh introducing a consideration that has no bearing on the question of whether one uh racial group has a right to dominate another israel has a duty to protect its own citizens again uh irrelevant to the question of occupying Palestinian territory yes a duty to protect but not a duty to protect which involves the indefinite subjugation of an entire other of the racial group israel has valid long-standing historical ties to the land no legally no legally no i mean that's the claim it it doesn't have any legal foundation in in the League of Nations um uh uh covenant that was part of the Versail treaty the Palestine mandate um uh was supposed to be provisionally recognized as an independent state a state for everyone a single state for all the people on that land not a state for a particular racial group so the idea and Jew Israel is a a Jewish state by definition and there is no legal basis for a specifically Jewish state on that land in international law what is or would be Israel's strongest argument before a court of law for what to dominate the Palestinians to there is no argument for for for committing genocide i mean what what would be the what needs to be justified these come up often when I interview people who speak in defense of Israel let me let me Okay self-defense self Thank you okay you took the words out of my mouth this is the first thing that comes up yes so so let's go back to 1967 so why is Israel there there was a war between Israel and three of its uh uh neighbors israel started that war and it was a war started preemptively uh illegally because states cannot uh uh use force lawfully in non-immed immediately imminent anticipatory self-defense as a result of that illegal war Israel captures the territory it has no right a state has no right to retain control over territory simply for security purposes and the right of self-defense therefore is inapplicable to that kind of action states have to deal with security threats nonforcibly when it comes to the extr territorial use of force unless they are at risk of an actual or an imminent attack and Israel was not in 1967 it used force anyway and of course the clue is in the name it was over in six days there was no longer any threat in so far as there was a threat it was it was removed at that through that action well they they of course would disagree that there was no longer any threat but what about in the context i don't think Israel would disagree that after the six- day war there was no then immediate threat of attack from the three Arab states so Israel should have withdrawn at that moment on the seventh day there should have been a retreat because there was no legal basis to maintain the control over the West Bank and the Gaza Strip what about in the context of Gaza today and I'm taking you beyond obviously uh the the remit of the ICJ's advisory opinion but Israel today yes says more than ever that it is acting in Gaza in self-defense following the attacks uh by Hamas in Israel on October the 7th so Israel has been using force in Gaza since 1967 continuously and on on uh the on October the 6th two years ago Israel was already exercising military authority over Gaza and as I say illegally in that situation when a state is using force illegally if there is violent resistance to that illegal use of force the state's use of force does not somehow then become lawful as a means of defense to that defense there is no defense against defense if Israel hypothetically decided we want to be in full compliance with international law what would it have to do in general there needs to be an end to racial discrimination and the domination by one racial group over another from the river to the sea it needs to be a the return of all of the Palestinian people who were forcibly displaced and and have been displaced from that land um over for for a century um that that's also a legal require displaced since when you're talking 1948 or 1967 no return since even before 1948 certainly from uh you know the Nakba and 1947 1948 and onwards a legal right of return uh in international law that is vested in all of those people and their descendants the the remaining uh uh non-Jewish Palestinian people who were not forcibly displaced in 1948 uh but who are treated in various ways as secondclass citizens within Israel around 17% of the citizenry of Israel um that's unlawful and that illegal discriminatory treatment that constitutes apartheite needs to end there needs to be equality and then when it comes to the extension of Israeli rule into the remaining 22% of mandatory Palestine the West Bank and including East Jerusalem and and the Gaza Strip there needs to be a complete withdrawal immediately um uh the removal of all settlements and settlers and the provision of compensation to the Palestinian people for all of the um uh the harm that they have suffered um since 1948 this part gets lost u in discussions about the advisory opinion it does mention compensation in so far as it addresses the occ uh the 67 onwards yes the requirement of compensation as well as withdrawal so land that has been taken again according to international law as it is laid out in this advisory opinion land that has been taken from Palestinians by Israel since 19667 needs to be returned to them and where that is not materially possible they need to there is no excuse for not um uh returning uh the control of the land so Israel doesn't have the option to maybe uh withdraw from some of the land and retain some of the land and then just provide compensation that's not uh ac legally permissible what I mean by compensation is compensation for all of the other loss suffered by the Palestinian people as a result of the unlawful occupation there are 15 judges at the International Court of Justice that um rule were that rule on these opinions 15 judges had to decide say yay or nay essentially they could provide a dissenting voice but my point is this decision was not close it the judges were overwhelmingly yes um in favor of saying that Israel's presence in Palestinian territory is illegal and must end this was not close it was not and likewise there was an overwhelming uh support in the UN General Assembly affirming the the the finding of the uh um the ICJ uh in all key respects so the UN General Assembly which represents all the countries in the world one country one vote passed a resolution at the UNGA demanding that Israel respect this advisory opinion and that means demanding that within a year Israel leave Mhm occupied Palestinian territory cease all settlements and remove all settlers that was voted in September of 2024 so we're we're about The clock is ticking yeah the clock is ticking nobody thinks this is about to happen and there are no signs that this is about to happen states were also told in the advisory opinion and in the general assembly resolution that the illegality uh involved in the occupation has important consequences for them because of the fundamental nature of the rules of international law that are being violated in international law in a decentralized legal system where there is no global sovereign who can enforce uh the law unlike in a national legal system the role of individual states becomes much more important as agents of enforcement if you are any third party not Israel any other country in the world yes whether it's the Fiji Islands France or Venezuela how are you supposed to put yourself in compliance with that opinion and with international law first and foremost they must take positive steps in so far as it's possible to bring the illegality to an end and then they also have negative obligations uh not to recognize the illegal situation and also not to provide any aid or assistance to it concretely what does that look like positive steps to bring the situation to an end would include sanctions against Israel aimed at influencing Israel's behavior uh non-recognition involves uh states uh uh for example uh not doing anything when it comes to their diplomatic relations with Israel uh which involves expressly or implicitly um uh recognizing not only that Israel isn't sovereign over this territory but even that Israel doesn't have any right to be there in the first place so states should not be engaging in diplomatic relations with Israel and so that includes for example uh the current practice of affirming that somehow a right of self-defense would justify Israel's continued presence any state who affirms that position is violating the duty that they have not to recognize the validity and the legality of Israel's presence in that territory but you're not saying that countries for instance are required by international law to shutter their embassies in Israel that's not what we're talking about they should not have uh embassies uh or any diplomatic representation to Israel on occupied territory for example in in East Jerusalem they shouldn't even have diplomatic premises in Jerusalem at all because the status of Jerusalem as a whole not just East Jerusalem but also West Jerusalem still is to be uh determined and Israel is not sovereign in West Jerusalem hence most states who recognize Israel as a state do not have their embassies to Israel in Jerusalem even in West Jerusalem because of that legal requirement that they cannot recognize uh a an invalid claim uh to sovereignty over that city what's international law good for if it doesn't protect people from abuses and doesn't work in the way it's supposed to or was was invented and was dreamed of so it's a limited system the new and the importance is not to make overblown claims for its potential but not to throw the baby out with the bathwater and say that it is worthless the better approach is modesty in the expectations um one has for um the significance of international law which I think then should have consequences in terms of um the extent to which time and effort should be spent uh utilizing um legal avenues of redress as opposed to other avenues which may include forcible revolutionary avenues news explain actually in international law um the Palestinian people have a right to resist a right of uh to defend themselves from their uh uh subjugation and oppression and to do so violently if necessary people are not of course cannot be expected to um simply put faith in a system that is not protecting them and be prevented because of the existence of that system the ability to take matters into their own hands including through violent means so that's the challenge if global society wishes to promote peace then it has to enable justice you're saying if international law isn't strong enough or effective enough in guaranteeing people's rights people will fight for those rights international law permits that actually so for example if we think about another situation the right uh of self-defense that a state the people of a state might have so if we think about the discussions around uh for example Russia's uh uh war in Ukraine um international law permits the rise of self-defense if the situation is dealt with peacefully and through the application of international law then of course the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian state would not have a right to use uh force against Russia the same logic applies to a non-state self-determination uh uh grouping of people the Palestinian people in an analogous situation so there is an argument that Israel makes and the US sometimes makes it too you're not going to like it which is in essence international law is getting in the way of resolving the Israel Palestine conflict it is because it is getting in the way of diplomacy politics and dealmaking and that's where a solution is going to be found in those arenas not in international law so says Israel so stop the lawsuits and engage in dealmaking yeah but I think the question is what is international law preventing when it comes uh to to the issue of um ending the uh uh subjugation of the Palestinian people nothing but what international law is preventing is for Israel um stealing more of Palestinian land and that's why Israel doesn't like it people within Israel or supporters of Israel are against international law because international law is against um Zionist domination uh on a on a racist basis of the Palestinian people and the theft of Palestinian land so of course they're against international law when it comes to deal making when we drill down on the question of these supposed deals what they usually involve is a further loss of um the land of of the uh the um the 22% of Palestine that was left after the proclamation of the state of Israel in 1948 that Israel somehow wants even more of that land like extending from 78% into some of that 22% and the idea idea being that the Palestinian people in rejecting that are somehow impediments to peace did you have any strong personal or political views about Israel Palestine before you became invested in this um as an international lawyer i think I approached the situation with an open mind but also perhaps with a um a fairly typical European bias through my ed the education that I'd had which had not taught me anything about the situation um and and in general or indeed it's more specifically the British role in it whereas I had been taught about the shower about the Holocaust and um the onesided nature of my education I think led to a situation where I um had to educate myself and what I uncovered was shocking in terms of the uh consequences for the Palestinian people of the establishment of the state of Israel and the role of the UK in that and the role of other western states in supporting it ever since ralph Wild thank you

attempt to curb miners access to pornography unsurprisingly this law hasn't gone down well with mainstream porn sites and just a few days prior Pornhub along with its sister sites Uporn and Red Tube blocked access to their websites within France in protest so in this video we thought we'd take a look at France's new anti- porn law and whether it will actually [Music] work never miss an episode and always feel in the loop by subscribing and ringing the bell let's start with some context a few years ago several scandals most famously the French Bukaki criminal investigation drew the public eye to the malpractices in France's porn industry and concerns of serious sexual and physical abuse of performers in 2022 a French Senate report titled Hell Behind the Scenes was prepared for the French Parliament which alerted the government to systemic abuse in the industry this report also argued that children were heavily exposed to pornographic content and called for better age regulation for context with around 5.5 million pornographic websites operating in France alone the average age of access to pornographic content for the first time in France and in most of Europe is around 13 years old although according to some experts some children are starting to consume pornography as young as 8 and in the last decade the number of users younger than 13 accessing this type of content has been increasing unsurprisingly the French public aren't too pleased about this according to a survey of French citizens from 2023 seven in 10 people reported they would be completely in favor of tougher age restrictions in comparison less than one in 10 respondents reported being quite against or very against a law blocking websites that don't enforce age restrictions for pornographic content as such decreasing the exposure of minors to pornographic content became a key priority for French legislators at the start of 2020 speaking at UNESCO's celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Convention on Rights of the Child French President Emanuel Macarron backed the idea of age regulation saying &quot;We do not take a 13-year-old boy to a sex shop not anything goes in the digital world.&quot; Then in July 2020 the French Parliament approved a mandatory age verification control on porn sites in an attempt to prevent access to children under 18 following the UK's lead unsurprisingly though asking users to just tick a box saying they're over 18 didn't really work so in 2023 the French government passed the so-called siren law which introduced a new double anonymity system for context this is a two-step age verification process that would require users to identify themselves with an official document like a credit card or some form of ID on a third-party platform which would then validate their age and keep the pornographic platforms from seeking users information and data then the pornographic website would be able to grant access to the user without accessing personal names or other identifiable data the French Parliament said that all porn websites operating in France would be under legal obligation to implement this system by the 7th of June 2025 and that the French media regulator ARCOM can request that porn sites be blocked and issue fines if it finds their checks are lacking in reaction to the restrictions a handful of sites began legal proceedings to avoid its application in fact in 2024 four major porn sites were blocked in France after they refused to comply with the age verification law most recently in anticipation of the June the 7th deadline in protest the parent company of Pornhub Alo decided to completely stop operating in France on Wednesday the 4th of June French visitors to major adult sites like Pornhub Uporn and Red Tube were greeted not with explicit content but with a message from Alo denouncing the government demands that they verify users ages for their part Alo and other critics have four main complaints first they argue that it poses a risk to data privacy taking particular issue with the requirement for a third-party platform to verify users identities alo and others to be fair argue that outsourcing age verification to external platforms could expose personal data to hacking leaks or malicious misuse which could have disastrous consequences in the form of blackmail embarrassment or even targeted advertising based on sexual preferences second Alo maintains that the responsibility for age verification should not rest with adult websites they argue that the financial burden of implementing and maintaining these costly age verification systems should really be on the tech giants like Apple Microsoft and Google and for the age checks to be implemented at the device level essentially Alo's argument here is that if your phone can recognize your face to unlock itself it will be better at knowing if you're old enough to access a porn site third Alo and others argue that these bans could open the door to broader internet censorship last year ALO actually argued that a similar law introduced in Texas infringed on adults constitutional rights to access protected speech but the fourth and perhaps most popular argument against these sorts of laws is that well they just won't work these laws can be easily circumvented with virtual private networks or VPNs which allow users to mask their location and pretend they're in another country these are cheap easy to use and widely available even to miners this makes bypassing national restrictions extremely trivial and we can already see this unfolding nordvpn have reported 170% usage increase in France since Wednesday and within half an hour of Alo suspending its websites protonvpn saw registrations increase by a,000% similarly there's a risk that banning mainstream porn websites could push people towards unregulated darker parts of the web which could ultimately make things worse nonetheless despite these apparent risks neither France's communications watchdog Arcom nor the French government have been put off with the French Minister for Gender Equality posting Olivoir on X in response to the news that Pornhub was pulling out of France claiming there will be less violent degrading and humiliating content accessible to minors in France and well in their defense while there are clearly privacy and censorship related risks to any sort of online ban this doesn't imply that France should just give up on the law entirely especially given the widespread consensus in France that porn is too accessible for minors rather it just means that the French government should be especially cautious about how the law is implemented to best mitigate any risks it's also worth remembering that when critics of online regulation warn about slippery slopes the slippery slope fallacy is just that a fallacy similarly while it's true that there are easy ways around it this doesn't invalidate the law either no public policy or law is 100% effective we have laws against murder for instance but murders still happen and this doesn't mean we should give up on laws against murder this law isn't going to make it impossible for miners to access porn but as long as it makes it sufficiently more difficult such that fewer minor see porn then the French government can claim some success if you want to know more about this topic there's plenty of other outlets reporting about it online unfortunately though it's sometimes hard to tell exactly which way these outlets lean politically making it difficult to understand exactly how your view of world events is being biased by the sources you're reading that's where this week's sponsor Ground News comes in their website and app developed by a former NASA engineer allows us to pull back the curtain on media bias and have a look at exactly how each story has been covered for instance this story about Pornhub exiting France has been covered by 138 different sources we know that around 19 of these have been reported by the left and 18 of these have been reported by the right that's not all though ground News has tons of genuinely useful features take their blind spots feed for instance this shows you the stories under reportported by one side of the political spectrum or the other for example if you lean left you probably missed this story on a recent report that claims white British people will be a minority in 40 years here at TLDDR News we think that ground news is an incredibly useful tool for our current media landscape one that's constantly trying to attract your attention and sway you towards or away from certain political viewpoints so having a tool that helps you spot this and helps you take action really is a gamecher if

          <attvalue for="7" value="joining me now is author Gideon Levy he's a world-renowned columnist at Harets the uh Israeli paper that is famous really it has taken a very critical line against the Netanyahu government particularly over the war in Gaza now but of course Mr levy has been writing about this for a very long time uh thanks so much for speaking to us at Worldview thank you for having me it's always nice to meet you uh you're there in Tel Aviv now in your latest column in the Harets you've asked a question of why even though many Israelis are against the war uh why they don't feel the pain of Palestinians in Gaza and you've made a very strong statement you said even though Israel has now committed a thousand October 7ths uh in just the past few years what is your sense of uh a the situation in Gaza today uh because of course we see a lot of the videos um and what is the support for the war inside Israel as about the situation in Gaza I think that both of us cannot imagine ourselves what does it mean to live now in Gaza those are walking dead people i talked to some of them but very very few of them we we cannot imagine it and we better don't imagine it because I don't I don't think many people went through what they are going through it must remind me from the worst times of history the starvation the children the the destruction you see the images of destruction it's it's really outrageous and the fact that the world is still silent and it is silent is condemning but not taking any measures to stop it is really astonishing astonishing now to your question look something happened in Israel on the 7th of October besides the crimes of the 7th of October israel got to the notion that after the 7th of October Israel has the right to do whatever it wants no limits no borders not legally not morally we have the right to do whatever we want because what they have done to us the second thing that happened after the 7th of October is obviously the feeling that all the embassy told the Palestinian people even by the peace camp was finished no more i mean it's almost illegal and for sure immoral in Israel to pay some kind of empathy some kind of mercy some some kind of humanity toward the people of Gaza it is immediately labeled as treason and those two things together with the unbelievable betrayal of Israeli media which does not show Gaza to the Israelis because they don't want to see Gaza you will be astonished to see how little any Indians saw more of Gaza than any average Israeli and this also enables the Israelis not to know and they choose not to know and to continue to feel good about themselves they still think that everything we do in Gaza is self-defense all together is a very very depressing picture because humanity is finished any kind of solidarity with the real victims and the people of Gaza are the biggest victims right now is off the table and the future looks very dark right well you know you have spoken about of course the suffering inside Gaza what we saw in the last few weeks uh was a statement by uh Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that he was now preparing for military control of Gaza uh first time since Israel pulled out in 2005 that announcement apart from the increase in bombardment of Gaza in the last uh week or so uh seems to have led to a shift on the part of three leaders who have so far been much more supportive of the Israeli position the leaders of United Kingdom France and Canada do you think this uh you know their statement together their uh threat of sanctions against Israel saying we will no longer turn a blind eye to what Israel is doing do you think it uh marks a turning point in the in the kind of idea that Israel still had support uh and do you think it'll make a difference no declaration will make a difference no declaration will change the policy of Israel the only thing that can change the policy of Israel will be measures actions and the world until now is just talking and Israel learned to live with condemnation and to ignore them as long as it is not being followed up by real measures like for example toward Russia a few weeks after the invasion to to Cremier as long as it's only talking it is with very little influence add to this the notion that most of the Israelis believe that the whole world is in any case anti-semitic that the whole world in any case doesn't like us so why would we care they all I mean it's their fault not our fault they are the anti-semites we are the moral people with the most moral people immoral army in the world right netanyahu in fact accused Macron the French president of speaking for Hamas absolutely macron who is really very devoted to find a solution is labeled as as a pro- Hamas anyone who dares to criticize Israel anyone is immediately labeled as anti-semite and uh you know words will not change it the only way to change it is taking actions by this I don't want to undermine those declinations they are showing a new tone in Europe they might be followed up with actions they might it might be a beginning of a new game but we have to see if it will be followed up with actions or it will remain as a hollow lip service right um you make a a fair point that eventually there has been criticism before the declarations don't necessarily translate to action that'll change uh the course inside Israel what about the domestic uh criticism of the war uh in Gaza which seems to be increasing you know so far we had seen most of the columnists apart of course from you and and others in in the haretss itself uh speaking really about the hostages that the hostages must be returned and for that criticizing the Netanyahu government but recent columns we have seen for example by former prime minister Ahoud Olmat um General Yar Golan's comments about the killing of children in Gaza uh I think former prime minister Barak has been critical as Well do you think that changes something internally in Israel because somehow Israeli politics does seem a little more difficult to uh you know is it seems a lot more complex when you're watching it from the outside it is not I I'm sure Indian politics is much more complex than Israeli politics but we will not make the comparison now in any case look there are two camps in Israel one camp will follow Netanyahu blindly and automatically no matter what he does this camp is quite solid the coalition a very fascist coalition is quite solid and it can and might continue until the next elections in two years there's another camp which is vocal which is devoted which is demonstrating day after day week after week but they have only two goals unfortunately so one goal is obviously releasing the hostages the other goal is getting rid of Netanyahu the goal of becoming more moral the goal of saving the children of Gaza the goal of saving the the last remains of Gaza is not one of their flags and therefore I'm so reluctant about them now which camp is bigger hard to say they are both solid and big i guess that if there would be elections today Netanyahu wouldn't win by all means not but you know uh even the alternatives right now you mentioned some names but the alternative is not promising ending the war the alternative is not premise promising ending the occupation of the apartheid so yeah things will be better after Netanyao but not good enough sure um finally the third poll as it were of uh you know international uh support or otherwise of um uh of Israel is always if you look at the world divided over the issue but there's always the US unequivocal support for Israel and yet we see US President Trump making statements uh he's you know almost uh threatening Mr netanyahu when it came to plans to strike Iran because there's a deal going on between the US and Iran uh and negotiations for that do you think the US is in any way withdrawing its support to Israel how is that ran uh over there because we are dealing with Donald Trump so it's very hard to foresee it can be one day can be one day like this and one day like this one day he supports Putin and to and today he's already cursing Putin one day he's insulting Zalinski and tomorrow Zalinski might become back an ally very hard to tell but it is a turning point and this is maybe the most important question right now what will the American administration do because would he like this war to end it will be within days israel is totally depending now on the West on the United States also on Europe but first of all on the United States like never before because of Israel becoming gradually a pariah state the dependence is much stronger in the few allies that Israel still possesses and therefore if there will be a shift in American policy this will be really a new scene a new era because until now for decades as you rightly said Israel had more or less a card blanch to do whatever it wants there were no limits attacking conquering nuclear weapons everything was allowed if America will change now Israel will face a new challenge which it never ch faced before sure you know in in the columns that you spoke about as well and there's a constant question what happens on the day after the day after Israel's bombardment of Gaza ends what is the plan for there and a large part of that is what is going to happen with uh the neighboring countries Egypt other Arab uh neighbors as well do you think uh that is something that Israel is is is working on right now are there contacts that might lead to meaningful uh cooperation in the future after everything we've seen in Gaza you know I ask because in India of course um India has been fairly muted on the issue partly because of India's own connections with Israel historical connection with Palestine but in particular in recent times India's hopes have been pinned on the India Middle East Europe economic corridor that goes through Hifa uh so many have asked is it is there a point in in thinking about such a project if the future of Israel's relations with neighboring Arab countries is never going to be fixed what are your thoughts first of all it's not about my thoughts about Netanyahu's thoughts and he was very clear he's he has a plan and the plan is as he phrased it to destroy Gaza to destroy Hamas which means to destroy Gaza and then to go for the Donald Trump's plan which is transferring 2.3 million people out of Gaza it is a plan it is a plan of crimes against humanity and crimes of war it is a plan which will never work but that's the plan anything else starts and ends with the question who will replace Hamas in Gaza the question that you raise must come only after solution for Gaza the Arab states not only Arab states by the way yesterday the prime minister of Indonesia was very clear about having diplomatic relations with Israel first time in history the biggest Muslim country in the world if only Israel will recognize a Palestinian state so the horizon is there israel is missing all those opportunities and there is no plan because first of all we don't know what to do with Gaza there will be no Gaza without Hamas unfortunately and if it will be a Gaza without Hamas it will be a Gaza of anarchy there's no substitute nobody prepared a substitute to kamas and therefore we are stuck with this war and all those big plans and dreams I must say must be postponed or even cancelled forever you know you spoke in India about uh six months ago and you had said that you are you no longer think that a two-state uh solution is possible explain that explain why you think that's not possible because that's still what everyone including the US including India including the Arab states are insisting upon it the two-state solution is the best solution two peoples are struggling over one piece of land both of them deser deserve self-determination let's share the land and two between the two peoples and create two sovereign independent states there's only one problem and this is the fact that the settlers did anything they could and succeeded to sabotage any potential for this in the West Bank in the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem occupied East Jerusalem there are 700,000 settlers Jewish settlers most of them are very extreme radical right-wingers part of them very violent and above all they represent the strongest political group in Israel without their evacuation there is no room for a Palestinian state their evacuation looks to me like a mission impossible i don't see who is going to do it no Israeli leader will be able to evacuate 700,000 settlers some of them are really powerful and violent it it might bring a total civil war here if someone proves me that the two-state solution is still possible I'll be the first one to sign on it but we have also to prepare ourselves to the scenario in which maybe I'm right and the two-state solution is not achievable anymore because of the settlers we cannot just say okay so the two-state solution doesn't work as it didn't work for the last 55 years yeah it's not that we didn't try the fact is that we are far from it than ever but we have to prepare a plan B and my plan B is obviously the one democracy the one state solution between the river and the sea one person one vote democracy as any other democracy in the world india is one person one vote israel should be one person one vote no matter what is your national or religious background that's the vision time will show all right um and and your sense of where uh IMC will actually go is it even a possibility if Israel remains on the route if Israel remains on the route it's going to a very bad place it will become an apartheite state it is already but a officially aparttheite state with a official apartheite system a pariah state totally isolated some kind of Iran or no Korea with very little embassy from the world and very little support this can end in a very tragic way that's the last chance for Israel really to change the roots but right now there's no one to lead it all right we we do ask uh in India many times about international conflicts of these kind does India have a role according to you does India have a role first of all in the first of all every country in the world has a rule because I believe that only by international pressure things will change israel will not change by itself forget about it israel will not wake up one morning and say the war must end because it's very brutal and barbaric the occupation must end because it is an apartheite system and so forth and so forth it will not happen by itself it will happen only with the intervention of the international community and the international community india has one of the strongest actors players with very good ties with both sides I must say and someone who has such good ties can influence the question is if India like any other country is ready to take measures not only to talk with talking we are fed up i mean everything was said everything was threatened everything was condemned it doesn't change anything does India is India ready to even sacrifice some shortrun interests of India in order to get to a solution and to really try to influence Israel to put an end to this crazy crazy war first of all that's a question that Indians should ask themselves sure uh Gideon Levi you're always so straight direct uh and you have remained in in a sense critical of the government many always ask how does Haretss do it uh if Israel is such a restrictive country and and the government has put so many strictures on people um uh and there is such widespread support for the war in a sense or uh uh you know the the unwillingness to criticize the war how do you do it it's not very pleasant but it is possible first of all I'm privileged to be a Jew would I be in a Palestinian I would be in jail long time ago Secondly I'm privileged to work with Har which is still a very respected platform in Israel and Harets gives us the full freedom of speech the government until now try to touch Har but only through economical measures not through censorship or things like this this is still far away even though it can happen very they just need to change some legislation and they think about it so nothing should be taken for granted but right now I'm very grateful for being free to express myself having the platform having the support and yes most of the Israelis don't like what I say I'm banned on Israeli TV now for many many months ever since the war started that's not a I mean I'm not the victim of this war obviously and yes I'm very grateful but I don't take it for granted it might change as as journalists shouldn't uh but Gideon Levy thanks so much for speaking to us of course Gideon Levy is the author also of the punishment of Gaza that's about a previous uh Israeli uh campaign there um but for the moment that's all we have time for thanks so much for joining us thank you so much for having me" />

saw a rag tag bunch of militants flood through literal holes in the wall and threaten Israel in a way it hasn't been threatened before I'm Matt Bon I'm a little bit Husky and this is if you're listen it was October 1973 in London and an Egyptian man named Ashraf marwin called a meeting marwin was well connected he was the son-in-law of the previous Egyptian president and now the top Aid to the new president bit of a nepo baby what is bosses in Egypt didn't know is that he was also a spy marn's meeting was with the head of the Israeli spy agency mad you see Egypt was planning to attack Israel and marwin was giving Israel a warning they had 18 hours before Egypt and Syria would invade but the Israeli were a little bit sick of marwin you see he'd warned mad twice before that war was imminent both times it had been a false alarm thousands of troops had been mobilized for nothing it was a classic boy who cried Invasion scenario and now marwin was telling them that the war was going to kick off again this time on yum kapor the holiest day on the Jewish calendar a massive national holiday in Israel news of the invasion was slow to reach the top levels of the Israel government time was wasted and Israel was not prepared but marwin was right the war's outbreak took the World by surprise Egypt and Syria launched a simultaneous surprise attack Egyptian forces are at present engaged in military operations it caught Israel off guard and led to thousands of casualties the armies of Egypt and Syria are still battling with Israeli troops on the Sinai Peninsula and the Goan Heights it was seen as the biggest intelligence failure in Israeli history that is until exactly 50 years and one day [Music] later Israel's main method of Defending themselves from Hamas is to literally contain them in the Gaza Strip no one goes in and no one goes out without the express permission of the Israeli government to achieve that they've built what they refer to as the obstacle from a distance it looks like a fence but it's so much more than that the fence is 6 M high and under it is a deep underground concrete wall which will be very difficult to Tunnel through but that's not all that bario is not standing alone and it won't stand alone it's part of a cocktail the main ingredients of the cocktail are a concrete wall and two fences but it's the garnishes that are really interesting remote control drones remote operated cameras remote operated gun turrets with AI assisted targeting remote seismographs to detect any digging nearby it's all Wireless with solar panels and battery backups to save it from power outages it can be operated from a central location and doesn't need thousands of troops patrolling up and down the Border it's 65 km long and gives Israel confidence that they can decide who comes to their country and the circumstances in which they come on top of that Israel's installed the high-tech Iron Dome missile defense system which can automatically detect rockets and shoot them out of the sky Israel is very proud of it the military says hundreds of rockets have been intercepted so far and in any case the Israeli government was increasingly convinced that Hamas was less extreme dream now and weren't as much of a threat besides they were trapped behind an impregnable Ultra Hightech border fence and so Hamas slipped down their priority list a long way down with their new sense of security the Israeli government focused on expanding and protecting settlements on the West Bank now it's crucial to understand what a settlement is if you look at the West Bank on a map it looks like a kidney bean but if you look at it properly it's actually more like a piece of Swiss cheese the Palestinians live in the holes the cheese bits are controlled by Israel on nearly every Hilltop around here are Israeli settlements gated communities of Jewish residents in the middle of the land Palestinians want for their future state so pockets of Palestinians surrounded by Israelis this has not yet led to peace and Harmony and so the Israeli security Services have been deployed to keep the peace Israeli soldiers occupy more than 60% of the West Bank there are checkpoints patrols military posts and noo zones throughout the whole area we'd save a heck of a lot of money if we could disand if we could disband the Army it's there to protect us according to international law these Israeli settlements are illegal I believe in the right of the Jews to reestablish our home homes in our villages in areas which were for thousands of years uh part of the Jewish history one of the long-term residents of these settlements is itamar Ben who has been making news for decades as a member of the radical Jewish kak movement branded a terrorist organization by the US government he's been arrested hundreds of times and spent more than 9 months in jail benav is an ultra Nationalist and a violent activist a convicted criminal with a WRA sheet that includes inciting racism and supporting a terrorist organization go home anti his politics are so extreme that he was disqualified from compulsory military service for years he had on his wall a photo of Jewish terrorist Barak Goldin who killed 29 Palestinians and injured more than 100 in 1994 in court he likes representing himself he's done this so often that judges started suggesting that he probably should just go and study law to give himself a better chance once he became a lawyer he specialized in defending Israeli Jews accused of hate crimes and terrorism he was elected to the Israeli parliament in 2021 that didn't stop him from getting out into the streets to to defend the rights of Israeli settlers in October last year he was filmed at the sight of a violent clash between settlers and Palestinians in East Jerusalem as he's pulled away from the scene by police he urges them to shoot Palestinians who throw stones then he reached under his suit jacket and pulled out an actual handgun and started waving it around that's at the time he was a minor party backbencher prone to trolling and don't we all know and love those guys but the following month he got a massive promotion Benjamin Netanyahu desperate for Coalition Partners signed a deal with Ben gavier in exchange for his party support Ben gavier would become the minister for National Security in charge of keeping Israelis safe and protecting them from Hamas but he had other things on his mind Benjamin netanyahu's six term as Israeli Prime Minister has been dominated by right-wing parties in his Coalition that want to Annex the entire West Bank just days into his tenure Ben gav decided it would be a good idea to go and visit the AL AXA mosque at Jerusalem's Temple mount in Israeli politics this is the equivalent of waving a gun around in the street for extremely complicated reasons that go back literally thousands of years is Israeli leaders visiting the mosque tends to make many Muslims extremely angry and has on several occasions in the past led to violence a surprising Unity ticket formed with Hamas the United Nations and the United States government asking benier not to do it Hamas called it provocative the UN and US said it risked inflaming tensions and the Israeli opposition said it risked the nation's security and the safety of its citizens keep in mind Ben is the national security minister the Temple Mount is open for everybody Muslims Christians and yes also Jews we make it clear to Hamas we don't give in we don't surrender we don't blink sure I mean what are they going to do about it right the Israeli government meanwhile ramped up the establishment of settlements in the West Bank benav personally ordered several unauthorized Palestinian homes to be bulldozed to make room for more settlements with that violence increased around the settlements as well according to the United Nations 2022 was the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank since they began recording fatalities in 2005 2022 was bad but 2023 has been worse Ben has expressed little interest in doing anything about this what he's very interested in doing something about is attacks on Settlers the Palestinian gunman shot dead seven people near near a synagogue in a settlement in East Jerusalem except now he's not waving his gun around he's encouraging Israelis to arm themselves I want weapons on the street I want Israeli citizens to be able to protect themselves benav made Law and Order in the West Bank his top priority deploying more troops and police to defend settlers and raid the homes of suspected terrorists it's one of a series of Israeli raids that have killed dozens of Palestinians in the last month alone with the high-tech but lightly manned Gaza border fence Israel's strategy was based on the idea that they would deploy troops there if they were alerted that something was coming picking up warnings was vital so were there any warnings [Music] well 25 days before the attack Hamas released a video of their Fighters training for a massive assault on the border Defence and Israeli Army Camps the video was highquality propaganda of what looked like a very well equipped operation with drones flying around and large groups of well-armed men moving quickly through a training course I've watched the video of this rehearsal and video of the actual attack and they're difficult to tell apart aside from the blood in the real version this is the kind of thing that should have triggered an alarm in Israel I mean Israel has spy agencies surely they would hear or see something concerning and then send troops and guards to the fence to deal with it and yet it seems that the system didn't really work the thought of 2,000 Hamas terrorists overcoming a multi-billion dollar security system I don't think was on anybody's radar screen in terms of possibilities so so the propaganda video from Hamas was warning number one 10 days before the attack came warning number two the Egyptian intelligence agency which is now a friend of Israel called Benjamin netanyahu's office to tell the Prime Minister that Hamas was planning something unusual a terrible operation and yet it seems this was ignored too six days before the attack the Israeli National Security advisor Zaki HBY was confidently telling the Israeli Defense Force radio station that Hamas had pivoted to a position of unprecedented restraint three days before the attack Egypt called to warn Netanyahu again according to Egyptian officials Netanyahu wasn't concerned and was more focused on the West Bank Netanyahu denies that he ever got a call itar benier began planning another another visit to the alaxa mosque when Israeli officials went to bed on the 6th of October exactly 50 years after the Yum kapore War Began they slept soundly with no clue of what was going to happen in the morning it started at 6:30 small drones packed with explosives flew out of Gaza they flew directly to their targets the mobile internet Towers which enabled the entire Gaza border security system to operate and the observation towers with AI targeted machine guns they dropped explosives on the towers taking them out they also dropped explosives on the tanks stationed along the border the billion dooll remote control defenses were offline paragliders took off covered by rocket fire and flew over the fence attacking any troops nearby then then Hamas Fighters charged at the fence with bulldozers explosives motorbikes and trucks they were able to drive right up to it and take it down the fence no matter how many senses at the end of the day it's effectively a metal fence right the militants attacked the headquarters of the Israeli border security operation they killed the soldiers inside many of whom were still in bed for the entire morning they rampaged almost unchallenged across Southern Israel before the Israeli Defense Force was able to arrive and fight back 1500 Hamas Fighters were killed which is an extraordinary number and it's indicative of how big an operation this obviously was from hamas's perspective in the days after the attack Hamas gloated about how successfully they'd fooled Israel they've openly said they wanted to lull Israel into a false sense of security something which appears to have worked perfectly you got to call spade and Spade and this was a massive costly failure and Israel knows that it was a failure almost identical to the 150 years beforehand Hamas has specifically cited increased settler violence and itamar Ben's visits to the alaa mosque as their reasons for the attack which they called operation alaxa flood benav hasn't accepted any responsibility despite the fact that the border of police are his responsibility as the minister of National Security he says now is not the time for investigations but it does seem that his role in this debacle has been noticed he's been excluded from the war cabinet formed by Netanyahu and opposition parties to deal with the current emergency it's worth noting that in 1973 Israel did eventually win the Yon kapore War we'll see if the parallels continue

          <attvalue for="3" value="Support our work: https://democracynow.org/donate/sm-de...&#10;&#10;Fatma Hassona, the 25-year-old Palestinian photojournalist and subject of the upcoming documentary film  &quot;Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk,&quot; was killed with her family Wednesday by an Israeli missile that targeted her building in northern Gaza. The strike occurred just one day after she learned that the film centered around her life and work had been selected to premiere at the ACID Cannes 2025 film festival. Director Sepideh Farsi remembers Hassona for her talent, integrity and hope. &quot;I can't tell you how devastated I am,&quot; says Farsi. She shares that Hassona had joyfully accepted the invitation to Cannes but had emphasized her desire to return to Gaza and remain on her family's land. Farsi adds that there is a chance that Hassona's building had been targeted, &quot;given the high number of journalists and photographers in Gaza who have been killed by the Israeli army.&quot; In tribute to Hassona's work, we play the trailer to &quot;Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk&quot; and share a selection of her photography and poetry. &#10;&#10;Democracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on over 1,500 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

          <attvalue for="7" value="this is democracyow democracynow.org the Warren Peace Report i'm Amy Goodman fatma Hassa was a 25year-old photographer and artist from Gaza who documented the devastating impacts on Israel's war on Gaza she's also the subject of a new documentary called Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk on Wednesday morning Fatima was killed along with at least nine members of her family in an Israeli air strike on her home in northern Gaza fatima was killed a day after the documentary was accepted at the Can Film Festival this is part of the trailer of the film where are you now this is my neighborhood no one live here or here or there or there there's no one when the war started on October 7th I was traveling around the world presenting my last film that talks about a war I've personally experienced as a teenager in Iran i decided to go to Cairo in order to cross through Rafa but I couldn't because all the roads to Raza were blocked instead I started filming Palestinian refugees who were just arriving from Gaza through one of them I came to know Fatam i'm a photographer yes I saw I saw your photos meeting her was like a mirror held in front of me that made me realize how much both our lives are conditioned by walls and wars part of the trailer of the new documentary Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk we're joined now by the film's director Sepida Farsy awardwinning Iranian filmmaker who's speaking to us from Paris sepida welcome to Democracy Now our deepest condolences uh on the death of Fatma Fatma Hassona who you were introducing the world to even further in this new documentary can you tell us who she was what she did and how she died hi Amy um I'm so devastated it's really hard to I can't believe she's gone i don't know uh how to talk um I met her a year ago as as um you heard in the trailer sorry and um take your time i know how unbelievably horrifyingly difficult this is as I watched your documentary I mean the time you have spent with her on um over Zoom trying to talk reconnect reconnect the fear every single time you reached out to her that this might be the last conversation is just that is um the feeling you have throughout this documentary is will Sepida reach her again and what an unbelievably radiant smile Fatima in describing the most difficult situations that her family was in and the number of people of that have died around her um that is what infuses the entire documentary yes she was um exactly as you described her Amy um a solar person you know radiating very brave resilient young also hopeful sometimes in despair but generally very strong uh optimistic and and and very with huge integrity um when I um of course throughout that year it was a year of of connections on and off and and very often as much as we could um many times I feared for her life every day I wrote to her if I could not if she couldn't connect at least we would exchange some texts and audio messages and and photos anything we could and most of the time we we we would connect to talk and I would film the video calls and and yes every day and every night I feared for her life and and somehow by the end of this period and when the selection was announced and I had started the you know I told her two days ago just a day before she left us she was killed um that the film was selected she was immensely glad i said do you accept to come she said &quot;Yes on the condition that I go back to Gaza afterwards I want to be there the Israeli occupation wants us to leave i do not want to leave i will keep my land and my house like the other Palestinians.&quot; And but we were trying to get her out at least for the film's presentation and a day after I just learned the news it you know I I I can't believe it i can't tell you how devastated I am and we lost a great person um Khan put out a statement um is it pronounced acid the acid team yes that said about Fatma Hassuna after she was killed her smile was as magical as her tenacity bearing witness photographing Gaza distributing food despite the bombs mourning and hunger we heard her story rejoiced at each of her appearances to see her alive we feared for her they said so if you can tell us how she came to pick up her camera and one of the just so poignant through this documentary is we meet one by one even your surprise in meeting her family members who happen to be in the space she's in wherever she manages to connect to you we meet her brother we meet her dad um we look at them looking at you who is uncovered um a woman um speaking to her in Paris or wherever you are but she all her life has only been in Gaza yes exactly this was a big thing for me also and for her i shared it with her in the sense that I I had many moments of doubt of feeling guilty of doubting whether or not I should ch you know um exchange and and and share with her all of my travels and my adventures what I was up to and at some point I thought that it was my way of contributing to giving her something she didn't know yet because she she never had a chance to be out of Azan and the first time we met she was telling me &quot;Oh you're from Iran one of the cities I would love to see is Tehran.&quot; And I told her &quot;I cannot go back to Tehran myself.&quot; And she's like &quot;Why?&quot; I said &quot;Because of political reasons.&quot; It was such an absurdity to her she couldn't even imagine how other people than Palestinians could be locked out of their country whereas these people are locked in their country and cannot go out i mean it was such a contrast between what I was living and she was living and and and we put up with it and we built the whole film and our relationship around this discrepancy of our experiences and and um I think that was one of the points that it was very rich in our exchanges that I do not believe in God and she did and I am in exile and she was stuck in her country and so it was um even more you know um moving I think for me and I I believe for her as well she she the first time I told her &quot;You're so young you're my daughter's age.&quot; And she said &quot;Oh you could be my mother.&quot; You know it's like and she was so spontaneous so generous uh and so systematic in her documenting the genocide also and in her vision of what they were going through such a clarity um despite her young age and or because of her young age I don't know maybe we're showing her photographs by the way as we talk to you um I want to ask you how you met but can you tell us how she died first this week i still keep asking myself the question whether there was a link between the film selection in K and a day later just a day later her house being hit well the house was hit by a bomb was people say it was targeted i I I do believe that it's could be the case given the high number of the journalists and photographers in Gaza who've been killed by the Israeli army so I think this one time um it could be one of these cases i of course I do not know more than that i would love to an investigation to be done to to find out because she was so dear to me and to many of us but uh the fact is that the bomb was um lounge on our house and the house the whole house was destroyed she and nine other members of her family uh including all those whom I knew um died i I'm trying to learn the might be that her parents or one of the two parents are still alive badly injured i'm still looking for news i do not know but for sure the number of death is 10 and the injures injuries um 11 and um I will never know I think un until we do an investigation uh why that house was hit and Sepita how did you meet Fatma um as I explained in the trailer and the beginning of the film I u at some point touring the world with my previous film the animation the siren i um I was following the news of the war of course um on Raza and u to begin with October 7th and then all that unfolded afterwards and a piece of that puzzle was missing well you see my cats who's in the film sorry she's she's always in the image um that a piece a big piece of the puzzle was missing for me and and that was the Palestinian point of view and the Palestinian narrative and at some point it became so unbearable to me that I decided to go to Gaza to through Rafa so I went to Cairo to pass through but it was already too late plus I have a French passport born in Iran it was not possible and so I started working with Palestinian refugees in Cairo and through one of them I was introduced to Fatim online and that's how it started i was and it was immediate and talk about why she first picked up this camera i mean unbelievably dangerous her she has died with so many members of her family but other members of her family like her grandfather her uncle also died while she was alive in this last year and a half i think part of the Palestinian destiny or the Gazawi destiny is that they knew there's this fatality i would refuse to accept it but I think they had this you know when she says in the film she says they cannot defeat us because we have nothing to lose it's it's so enormous to hear it it takes time to take it in and to realize what she means now I realize what she meaning i mean of course you have your life to lose but I think there's this fatality they're prepared for um so yes she had lost 13 members of her family if I remember correctly in January 2024 already um she told me about them one by one she named them um and their ages and all in the film in um several times and um despite that she uh would not give in give up taking photos and documenting and that was essential to her writing also because she was also a poet as you said uh but photography I think was her main um and most serious activity i did ask her whether she would like to continue music because she also sang uh and writing and she said no photography is the most important for me and she herself described her camera as a gun she said &quot;You know like the sniper who ups the gun and shoots I lift my camera and I shoot a photo.&quot; And it is essential to document this war and the genocide and she kept saying that all the time so I I think it was very important to her that her photos and her work generally texts also would remain and be relayed and uh shared with um larger audiences and that's what I will be trying to do by all means do you have her poem in front of you that you could read i can find it oh we're talking to Sepid Deaf Farcy the award-winning Iranian filmmaker she's based in Paris her new documentary film Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk um features Fatma Hosana who died this week uh she told Fatma the day before she died in Israeli air strike with its believed nine members of her family that the film had just been accepted at the Khan Film Festival and she wanted her to be there did you find the film the poem yes this is one of her poems the man who wore his eyes i don't have a CV to recognize two eyes mysterious and I believe I do not have a story one clear for a stranger to believe it and he believes I have no physical characteristics complete to fly outside of this gravity and I believe maybe I'm ushering in my death now before the person standing in front of me lifts his sharp sniper ruffle rifle and it ends and I'm done silence are you a fish i did not answer when the sea asked me i didn't know where these crows came from and pounced on my flesh would it have seemed logical if I said yes let these crows pounce at the end on a fish she crossed and I did not cross my death crossed me and a sharp sniper bullet i became an angel for a city huge bigger than my dreams bigger than this city i became a poet we're ending the show i want to thank you so much we'll post the poem online sepa de Farci the awardwinning documentary filmmaker Fatma Hassuna the subject of her film has been killed" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="this is democracy Now democracynow.org The War and Peace report I'm Amy Goodman we're continuing this holiday special with tanassi coats author of the new book The Message democracy Nows Juan Gonzalez and I interviewed him on October 8th one day after hundreds of activists rallied in Union Square in New York for a jewish-led vigil on the first anniversary of October 7th to mourn Israelis and Palestinians who've been killed and to call for an end to the Israeli massacre in Gaza after the vigil I spoke to Ava borgart a spokesperson for the group if not now right now people are wearing signs that say no us money for bombs um and talk about the motto of this October 7th vigil so the motto is every life a universe and it's it's from piku nefes which says that to destroy a life is to destroy an entire world and to save a life is to save an entire world and our government is not treating every single life as a universe they're treating Palestinian lives as less sacred how did you get so involved with this issue I got involved through the Ferguson Uprising and I was watching black and Palestinian activists trading tips on Twitter about how to deal with tear gas and it became clear that it Palestinians in the West Bank are facing a military charged with policing and black Americans are facing a militarized police force and um that was my entry point where I said I need to organize my community which was unable to or which was limited in being able to show up for the Civil Rights fight of our time for the black lives matter movement because they were upset about the messaging for a free Palestine in those protests and so I've spent the last 10 years of my life working on building the movement of Jewish Americans who are calling for equality Justice and a thriving future for all no matter where people live that's Eva bergart of the group if not now one of hundreds of people here in New York City and Union Square for two large rallies on the anniversary of October 7th Our Guest today is tanassi coats the prizewinning journalist and author of the new book the message in part about a visit he took last year organized by the uh Palestinian the Palestine Festival of literature pal Fest uh to the West Bank um and Israel um talk about this whole journey you took you were part of the palfest and then you also stayed yeah and I guess to be honest my my journey began 10 years ago when I when I published the case for reparations um and there was a section uh again as a as a writer as a journalist you always trying to make people feel things make things real and there was a section where I offered an analog uh for reparations for how I could possibly look and it was um from uh West Germany to the state of Israel and I need to be very specific about that not to Holocaust Survivors but to the state of Israel itself and um that part of that essay came under quite quite a bit of critique and uh what became clear to me was deservedly so um it took 10 years is for me to get it fixed because writing takes a long time you know um but I but I knew I had to like that I was going to have to go at some point you know I knew it wouldn't be enough for me to you know appear to Rally do a slogan whatever and long story short um I began talking to palfest in 2016 finally got there in 2023 uh just in time for the message uh I spent 5 days with them uh mostly traveling through the occupied territories and through East Jerusalem as a Palestinian would getting a sense of of of what their daily was U and then the next 5 days I spent mostly in the company of a group called breaking the silence uh former IDF uh veterans who are against the occupation uh and I saw the country largely through the views of in Israeli how they move through the through the world how they move through Jerusalem how they move through the roads um but I also again you know spent a lot of time actually talking you know more to Palestinians um it was revelatory it was I don't think the average American has a real sense of what we're doing over there and I emphasize what we're doing because it's not possible uh without American Support I have heard people say over and over again that there are great evils happening in the world um States across the world perpetrating evils against uh uh whole groups of people why pick on Israel and the thing I say is I'm an American this is the thing that we have our fingerprints on those Bombs Over Gaza the planes that drop bombs on Gaza uh the plaques that I saw for instance in jerus all of that is America and we are going around the world propping ourselves up as the font of democracy we are going around the world propping Israel up as the only democracy in Middle East this is a deep deep fiction a very very dangerous fiction um that must be addressed and that's what I tried to do in the book you WR in the book uh quote it occurred to me that there was still one place on the planet under American patronage that resembled the world that my parents were born into can you elaborate yes and I think I talked about it the last time I was here actually um these are the words I have even now and they are probably insufficient to what a Palestinian uh would offer who experiences this but the words that come to me are segregation um when you are on the West Bank there are separate roads there are roads for Israeli settlers and citizens of Israel and there are roads for Palestinian Ians these roads are not separate and equal these roads tend to be separate and unequal it tends to take longer to get where you want to go if you're Palestinian uh if you enter a city like herin for for instance herin is quite literally segregated there are streets that Palestinians cannot walk down there are streets that you know Israeli settlers are giv complete and free movement of moving throughout the West Bank in general they there are checkpoints everywhere for Palestinians uh these checkpoints are sometimes normal checkpoints that they know are there some times checkpoints appear out of the blue with they which what they call Flying checkpoints your basic movement is constantly imp parallel the justice system which is deeply familiar for African-Americans here is quite literally segregated there is a civil justice system that the minority of Israeli settlers as Israeli citizens enjoy and then there is an entirely separate justice system that uh Palestinians on the West Bank are subject to you can be arrested for instance um as as an Israeli Citizen and you are you know uh do all the due rights that we are familiar with you have to be told what the charges are Etc if you are arrested as a Palestinian you can just be taken in another political context we would call those hostages because nobody has to say why you're taken nobody has to say what you were taken for nobody has to inform your family you are under the jurisdiction of the of of of of the military it has been this way since 1967 and the word we use for that is occupation which is a kind of uh uh deeply um vanilla word that does not actually describe what is going on how a country that maintains this this uh separate and unequal system how a country that that does not even allow the quote unquote Palestinian citizens of the state full equality with its Jewish Israeli citizens is allowed to refer to itself as a democracy is a mystery to me and the closest analogue I can think of is the time in which uh the United States of America referred to itself as a democracy even as it was disenfranchising whole swats of black people in the southern states and so when I say Jim Crow when I say segregation that is because that is the period that immediately comes to mind for me talk about being stopped by an Israeli soldier Tanashi oh well we stopped all the time to be clear you know because we were on the roads we were constantly stopped you know um I was you know you just kind of got used to it after a while which was also weely familiar but I think the instance you're referring to is when I was in Hebron um which is a you know a flasho for anybody that that that that's been over there um I was walking down the street attempting to uh patronized a Palestinian uh vendor uh and a guard IDF uh guard or IDF Soldier stopped out he was young enough to be my son uh stopped out and asked me what was my religion um it was clear that I had to State my religion in order to pass when I told him that I was not religious he asked what my mother's religion was when I told him my mother wasn't particularly religious he asked what my grandmother's religion was and this is a very very important thing because when you start asking what my mother and grandmother's religion is you are referring to something Beyond do I accept Christ as my you know personal savior or what God I I pray to you are asking a a deeper question about my ancestry and it became clear that if I did not give the right answer to that question I would not be allowed to pass I highlight this because when you hear Palestinian and Palestinian American activists make the charge of racism this is what they're talking about why does who my grandmother or my mother worship matter if we're strictly talking about a God not that it would be right even in that sense but when you hear the charge of racism this is what people are referring to tonassi this is a powerful book and you went on CBS This Morning recently to talk about the publication of it and I want to go to that interview on CVS this morning um The New York Times is now reporting CBS News has rebuked one of the morning anchors uh Tony deople uh over what he did in that interview to you and maybe you could also say to his fellow anchors as he dominated this CBS Executives said the interview fell short of the Network's editorial standards this is an excerpt of that interview I want to dive into the uh Israel Palestine section of the book it's the largest section of the book and I have to say when I when I read the book I imagine if I took your name out of it took away the awards and the Acclaim took the cover off the book The Publishing House goes away the content of that section would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist and so then I found myself wondering why does tanahashi coats who I've known for a long time r at his work for a long time very talented smart guy leave out so much why leave out that Israel is surrounded by countries that want to eliminate it why leave out that Israel deals with Terror groups that want to eliminate it why not DET anything of the first and the second antifa the cafe bombings the bus bombings the little kids blown to bits and is it because you just don't believe that Israel in any condition has a right to exist well I would say the perspective that you just outlined um there is no shortage of that perspective in American Media um that's the first thing I would say um I am most concerned always with those who don't have a voice with those who don't have the ability to talk um I have asked repeatedly in my interviews whether there is a single Network mainstream organization in America with a Palestinian American bureau chief or correspondent who actually has a voice to articulate that part of the world um I've been a reporter for 20 years um the reporters of those who believe more sympathetically about Israel um and its right to exist don't have a problem getting their voice out but what I saw in Palestine what I saw on the West Bank what I saw in hia in Israel what I saw in the South Hein Hills those were the stories that I have not heard so tanassi um you sitting on the set of CBS This Morning uh with uh the former football player now anchor uh Nate burlson Gail King very welln um both African-American anchors and Tony deople he dominated the discussion talking about your book belong could be found in an extremist backpack um talk about the backlash on this the aftermath of this and also who you felt was most wronged in this well it wasn't me I mean at that part I let me talk it was not me you know um it certainly and I don't know there was anybody on that set um look I think um there is a meta conversation that happens here uh where we end up because we're media where we end up talking about media and and media politics um but I do think it's really important to Broad the frame from the few people that that were there and talk about um what was actually excluded and who was actually excluded from that conversation by the very structure itself I just don't want to lose sight of that um I don't really have a problem with a tough interview you know I knew what I wrote you know I knew I'd be confronted I you know was he rude was he aggressive you know like I can't really get into that like it's not really something that I think too much about the question I would ask though is how often on CBS on NBC on ABC or or any major news organization do you see someone who is a defender of the Israeli state project get confronted in that kind of way um get uh given a tough interview in that kind of way when was the last time you saw for instance a defender of Israel defender of Zionism uh confronted with the fact that major human rights organizations say that Israel is practicing a Pare how do you defend that when is the last time You' seen an interviewer how often do you see interviewers cuz don't want to say it never happens how often do you see interviewers say listen we have you know the former head of Human Rights Watch that says you are practicing genocide right now in Gaza how do you respond to that how often do you how often do you say that how often do you see how do you define yourself as a democracy when fully half the people under your rule are not equal there is no problem with confronting me you know I would like to see some other people confront it and the second part of that is who gets to do the confront in the first place I have said and I will continue to say I am a little uncomfortable with this role and a little uncomfortable with with the publicity not because I feel like I I do not know but because I feel like there are people who are going through this experience and who have gone through this experience who know so much more who are completely out of the frame and those are Palestinians and Palestinian Americans so it's not just the issues that I raise in the confrontation the question I was I would ask is you have to imagine a world where a Palestinian amican journalist could be on a mainstream show like CBS This Morning and confront someone who wrote a book that say defended Israel or defended Zionism with that kind of aggression it's fine if I get it but I want to live in that world too you know and that really is you know like one of the things I was really really trying to get at in the book in the message you know it's it's the questions we ask it's the stories we get to tell and the stories that we don't tell and perhaps most importantly it's who gets to tell them who doesn't and I just I I really feel this passionately this is not about me this is not about Tony this is not about Gail this is not about n we're going to be fine it's the people who are invisible it's the people who were not in that set you know on that set to begin with who are not part of that conversation and and tassi this this criticism that you were sufficiently taking into account that history uh when the reality is here we are on the anniversary of the October 7th uh attacks uh and very little discussion is occurs about what was Gaza like before October 7th of last year and uh and and how were the the the residents of of Gaza being treated essentially in an open air prison yes no I I I I completely agree look I I I you know I I love that um the young lady who was saying uh earlier in the lead in every life is a un i i i Tru truly believe that and so you know as I've said before like there really is no part of my politics that has the ability to look at October 7th and not mourn the death the massacre uh the the atrocities you know perpetrated I just wish that some of my countrymen especially my countrymen especially Americans who are responsible for this who are propping this up had that same sort of compassion and that same sort of energy for October 6th October 5th Etc you know this kind of abstracting events outside you know of of of their historical context is really necessary to the political order because it allows us to justify ourselves and not have to think harder and not have to ask you know much deeper question you really have to be able to hold both you know and I know that that sounds a bit cliche but I I I I truly do believe that you have to you know believe in this idea that I actually just heard today that every life is a universe I you know I think that's really really beautiful articulation you know um and that has to be true for all life that has to be true on October 7th you know and loudly said but it has to be true on 654 321 also uh and also I wanted to go back for a second because we are we are running out of time and ask you about sry my answers are so long yeah about President Trump and in the coming upcoming election uh the great surprise to me all these these years now is the enormous support that Donald Trump still has on among huge swats of the American public to what do you uh attribute this Darkness there's a darkness in all of us I mean this is um this is not new you know I mean and if you if you just took American history from the perspective of an african-amer and I suspect the the the from the perspective of the indigenous people of this continent what what they would tell you is there is nothing new and people using power and people using you know the worst tropes in the world to win and to to to dominate for any black person that you know grew up in the south from I don't know 1876 to 1964 and probably Beyond I'm being very conservative by saying that this is what politics was like this is this is just what we you know grew up under and so I I think maybe we thought or we allowed ourselves to believe that somehow you know we had escaped the gravity of history but no people no country escapes the gravity of History we live within it we we we are part of it and so you know I I think it's a very very dangerous thing that our leaders led us to believe um in 2016 that this was like a thing that could not happen in in America you know whereas had we looked at history from another perspective we would know that this actually very American you know that doesn't make us you know inhuman or somehow demonically evil you know on the contr it just makes us human it means that we're subject to you know the darkness in our souls like any other group of people would be tassi I wanted to go to that point you say of who gets heard um we were at the Democratic Convention everywhere we were interviewing people saw you in the background we were interviewing the delegate from what uh Michigan from Florida from Connecticut who unfurled a banner in the Florida delegation that said stop arming Israel um you were there as we were interviewing them in the hallway uh when we were outside when they were about to begin the sleep in overnight demanding that kamla Harris allow a palestinian-american to speak you were there uh and then the next day um and you wrote a piece and Vanity Fair about your experience of Palestinian Americans place under the Democrats big tent the looking at the uncommitted movement and their unsuccessful efforts to have such a speaker this is rura Roman of the uncommitted movement she's a Palestinian American Georgia state representative this is part of what she would have said if she was chosen for 322 days we've stood together demanding to enforce our laws on friend and foe alike to reach a ceas fire and the killing of Palestinians free all the Israeli and Palestinian hostages and and to begin the difficult work of building a path to Collective peace and safety that's why we are here members of this Democratic party committed to equal rights and dignity for all what we do hear Echoes around the world they'll say this is how it's always been that nothing can change but remember Bonnie Lamer shun for her courage yet she paved the way for an integrated Democratic party her legac lives on and it's her example we follow so that's Georgia state representative Ru Roman and um needless to say uh there was not a Palestinian American Voice on the stage last night um kamla Harris uh did an interview with 60 Minutes at least they played it last night um this is what she had to say about Israel Palestine when we think about the threat that Hamas Hezbollah presents um Iran um I think that it is without any question our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks now the work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing Pursuit around making clear our principles which include the need for humanitarian Aid the need for this war to end the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages and and and and create a ceasefire and we're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and and in the region including Arab leaders that's Democratic Presidential nominee Kam haris speaking on 60 Minutes last night uh as we wrap up you were just talking about Trump talk about um what the position of the Biden Harris Administration is right now they did hold two separate um uh commemorations yesterday President Biden was at the White House and he lit a candle and also I think crossed himself right after and um uh kamla Harris the vice president the Naval Observatory planted a tree a pomegranate tree well and you know that that's good and appropriate you know um like I said you know we we don't want to uh have a politic that um does not take life serious and does not take loss of life serious um on the larger question and maybe even as an extension of that but we have to take all life seriously I don't think we're doing that um this is morally untenable what I saw was and this is the first time I've ever said this or put this in this Frame and maybe you know the uncommitted delegates understood this um there was as much a moral gap between what I saw in Chicago that is to say to go on stage and promote these values of diversity Humanity big tent and to exclude um the people whose families are being bombed right now as it was in the early 1960s and you know before when the Democratic party you know claimed to be for the Working Man and the working person while millions of workers all through the South were effectively in a system of indentured servitude and they refused to give those people political representation it is a gigantic moral golf um that is trou disappointing heartbreaking and deeply deeply personally upsetting tanassi coats author of the new book the message that interview was

          <attvalue for="7" value="democracy depends on a free press please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org/give we begin today's show with the escalating feud between President Trump and Elon Musk the world's richest man who up until just recently was a top presidential adviser and Trump's top political benefactor the fight could have broad implications for Trump's presidency the Republican party and many government programs including NASA that rely on technology from Musk's various companies the feud became public Tuesday when Musk called Trump's so-called big beautiful budget bill a disgusting abomination because it'll increase the federal deficit by $2.5 trillion the tension then escalated considerably on Thursday during a meeting with German Chancellor Friedri Meritz a reporter asked Trump about Musk's comment this is part of his response but I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here better than you people he knew everything about it he had no problem with it all of a sudden he had a problem and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV mandate because that's billions and billions of dollars and it really is unfair he knew it better than almost anybody and he never had a problem until right after he left and if you saw the statements he made about me which I'm sure you can get very easily it's very fresh on tape uh he said the most beautiful things about me and he hasn't said bad about me personally but I'm sure that'll be next but I'm I'm very disappointed in Elon i've helped Elon a lot the feud then spilled into social media with the two billionaires launching personal attacks on their own social media platforms musk on X and Trump on Truth Social at 2:37 p.m thursday Trump wrote &quot;Elon was wearing thin i asked him to leave i took away his EV mandate that forced everyone to buy electric cars that nobody else wanted that he knew for months I was going to do and he just went crazy.&quot; At 3:10 p.m Musk wrote &quot;Time to drop the really big bomb real Donald Trump is in the Epstein files that's the real reason they have not been made public have a nice day DJT.&quot; Then Trump wrote &quot;The easiest way to save money in our budget billions and billions of dollars is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts i was always surprised Biden didn't do it,&quot; Trump said musk responded by threatening to decommission the Dragon spacecraft used by NASA musk also appeared to back the impeachment of Trump and took credit for Trump winning the presidency trump ally Steve Bannon went further calling for Musk to be investigated and deported he also called for Trump to seize Musk's company SpaceX to talk more about the fracturing of the Trump Musk relationship and what this could mean for the Republican party we're joined by Quinn Sabodian professor of international history at Boston University working on a book about Elon Musk titled Muskism he is author of Hayek Bastards: Race Gold IQ and the Capitalism of the Farright as well as Crackup Capitalism: Market Radicals and the Dream of a World Without Democracy professor Sodian welcome back to Democracy Now were you shocked by what you saw happen yesterday i mean who knows they could be holding a joint news conference soon and announced they're back in love yeah I mean they are people who always have their eye on the bottom line but they also are obviously titanically sized egos and I think that more than anything this is just a sign of uh how dangerous it is to put you know billions of dollars even the lives of astronauts the whole future of the American economy and the political scene in the hands of two sole human beings when you said threaten the lives of astronauts explain Well the Dragon uh unit that you mentioned is the only way for the astronauts in the International Space Station to get to and from um where they are now so were he to decommission it it might literally mean that they would be stranded out there kind of gravity style um so this is just one of the examples of many of the offloading of core government functions onto private service providers that Elon Musk has been so masterful at playing that we feel uh more and more exposed to from the uh the use of Starlink satellites in the field of battle in the Ukraine to the use of that same internet uh connection as leverage in his battle with the Brazilian government i feel like over time we'll only realize more and more how much we are at the mercy of someone who is acting with total impetuousness and sometimes not even with his own self-interest in mind let's go from the threat uh to lives in space to hear on the ground that Elon Musk taking on the budget calling it an abomination um when Trump said he knows that um the budget bill better than almost anyone else inside and out uh Musk's response was that is false i never saw it it was passed in the middle of the night um can you talk about the significance i mean this is the guy in charge of Doge how many thousands of jobs have been lost um and yet at the same time now he's viciously attacking the budget that was so narrowly passed and it could threaten its ultimate passage i mean I think it's worth sort of returning to the question of why Musk got involved at all with Trump right what he was doing with this Doge project and I think it's uh possible to kind of split it up into three categories i think first of all he was doing a kind of a bear hug strategy so I think especially on the trade war and his many many interests in China you know he has a a gigafactory there that has capacity to make a million Teslas a year he wanted to get out in front of any possible excessive economic nationalism that might be rolled out and then I think he was kind of making a hail mary move that you know he hadn't really clicked with the Biden administration and this could be a chance to maybe use a window of opportunity to boost his own aspirations especially in artificial intelligence where he was being outpaced by people like Sam Alman and Open AI and then third I think you could see it as a kind of moonshot strategy where I think he was trying to really even more plug in his own services especially SpaceX to in fact not only get to the moon but divert the whole project towards Mars so there was a lot of reasons why Musk would want to be involved but from Trump's point of view he's never really been a fiscal hawk right he's always actually run against austerity in certain ways and run against this mainstream obsession with the debt ceiling and the deficit that has so defined um uh GOP politics for the last couple decades so it was always kind of an odd fit and it's not surprising in that sense that Musk now feels that this budget is you know not hard austerity enough for his liking it's telling for example that he's posted multiple Milton Freriedman memes over the last couple of days sort of implying that this problem of runaway debt inflation should be top of mind at all times for the government but Trump has always profited by playing fast and loose with that kind of ideology and uh the question is why now has this led to a snapping point for Musk and I think there's a keep going if I could just say I think there's a a couple of things there i think um Trump invokes the EV mandate and that is a serious issue right what that is it needs to be broken down is the capacity of California to enforce a move towards electric cars over time a part of which is a regulatory credit system that allows um normal ice uh internal combustion engine vehicles to buy credits from electric vehicle manufacturers and this is now 40% of Tesla's net income in the last year it's went up a billion dollars in the last year alone and if that gets killed it really does kind of kill Tesla's margin and I think that Musk is starting to feel the heat from Chinese producers like BYD battery producers like CL and I think he sees here maybe the possible demise of the Tesla brand as he is hated more and more from both sides of the spectrum so there's reasons as he returns to his businesses to start to sweat about what he's actually signed up for um uh how about what this highlights around a rift within the MAGA movement and where JD Vance uh fits into this the vice president well it's always interesting to ask what exactly was going on with Doge right i mean if you want to get into the real kind of dangerous liaison sort of cortisanship I think that was happening inside of the White House it it seems that based on reporting Steven Miller was kind of stage managing along with his wife a lot of what was happening with Doge and if you look at what actually came out of Doge and this is a good time now for us to sort of do a autopsy or post-mortem on it as it winds down really he said he was going to do two trillion cut two trillion in cuts out of a $6 trillion budget very unlikely went back to 1 trillion scaled it back to 150 billion what did they end up taking out i mean it's basically culture war stuff right i mean it's ways to trigger the progressives and the libs get rid of US aid attack uh NE funding arts funding science funding um education energy these ended up being big wins not really for Musk's own bottom line cost cutting mentality but very much for the um culture war being waged by people like Miller and JD Vance and Russell VA at the office of management of budget so there is a way of looking at this as having been a success from their point of view they were able to use the credibility of Musk as a kind of supposed um you know brilliant Edison-like inventor and wonderful um you know efficiency creating cost cutter to actually get to some of their political goals but they never could bring that big number down why because entitlement spending still dominates um the state spending in the GDP and when you come close to that you come close to the kind of beating heart of the social contract and we saw the town hall meetings we saw the anger when things started to um encroach on the questions of social security and Medicaid and for me that was a very telling moment and it was one that I think took Musk by surprise too he's not used to the idea of needing to engage with a kind of consent and legitimacy mechanism where people feel like they paid into something and should now get something back he's used to interacting with a Twitter fan base a set of really boughtin Tesla investors for whom you know he always walks on water and he's a god reincarnate and when he just was confronted with the anger of average people who want to make sure that they can pay for their next meal um he didn't know what to do so I think that there's a kind of a there's a way to see this as a victory for the national conservatives they got to do some of their their um their easy wins against the pro progressives and the libs and now they're able to keep the door open for more protectionism and expansion of of spending as we see in the so-called big beautiful bill um finally does do you think Musk has access to all of the private information that his Doge um army downloaded from all the agencies is that possible i am not a a software programmer or I do not know how databases work that well but it seems at least likely that um part of what they were doing there when they were converting things done in old programming languages and updating them was also you know harvesting a lot of that data for use for we don't know what um feeding the machine of Grock or XAI is the most likely answer and finally let me ask you Steve Bannon who's on the anti-Musk side of the MAGA rift has been calling for Trump to nationalize Musk's businesses and for him to be deported right i mean uh Elon Musk comes from South Africa yeah i mean this actually isn't the harshest thing that Bannon has ever said he referred to Silicon Valley as an aparttheid state a few months ago um the idea of nationalizing SpaceX is an interesting one it would certainly run against the core um privatization ethos that Trump and the former GOP has been following for decades and decades so far I would chalk that up to just um saber rattling rhetoric

pastor preaching on Sunday morning suddenly faces a gunman hear about his miraculous survival and building a blueprint for the future how young Christians are responding to the call to care for the Earth not only on Capitol Hill but also in neighborhoods across the country welcome to Christian world news I'm Brody Carter filling in for George and Wendy We Begin by taking you to a Russian controlled part of malova where very few foreign journalists are allowed cbn's George Thomas however obtained rare access to the transnistria region despite moscow's heavy hand a remarkable Christian Revival is underway there here's George's exclusive report getting to transnistria is no easy feat cbia news began the 5,000 m Journey from the East Coast stopping first in the tiny former Soviet Republic of moldova's capital chis now from there we drove along moldova's Southeastern border where Moscow has recently stirred up political turmoil we made our way through several Russian checkpoints to transnistria's cap Capital tasp where a huge statue of Lenin adorns the Town Square why did God call you to transnistria why yeah uh I don't know maybe because I'm um stupid enough the Lord put a burden on Yuri semenuk's heart to move his family to this volatile region in my heart I really uh I love people I like a that is my passion serve to people I love God and I want to do something for him like all my life and after a while God told me Yuri I need you in one place that name is transnistria in 2000 Pastor Yuri his wife and three children decided to move from their home country in neighboring Ukraine to transnistria the first seven years of their ministry as a missionary family were not easy I was targeted by governments policemen KGB and gunst the worse of course that is gers because they tried to kill me they tried Kidnap My Children once I was kidnapped but praise God God let me escape this home video from May 2000 shows Simon O's first foray into preaching despite ongoing threats he continued to openly share the gospel often taking his message to areas controlled by gangs some gers they became Christian they became Evangelical their wives became Evangelical so they hated that why they tried to stop us in 1990 transnistria broke away from mova to establish its own government currency and statehood and while it's not recognized by the International Community the Breakaway territory became economically politically and militarily dependent on the Kremlin Russia has some 2,000 troops stationed here moscow's agents soon began harassing pastor seuk but he was undeterred each morning I wake up and I I tell to myself Yuri you're still alive and you have one more day to preach gospel one more day you can do something for God's Kingdom from those humble and at times nerve-wracking Beginnings Church of Christ savior today is the largest congregation in transnistria oh we have unbelievable Revival so we're still alive 24 years later on the mission field we are still alive each Sunday hundreds pack the church with many hearing the gospel message for the very first time seuk says the secret to the church's growth is simple we love God we try to be very obedient to his words and to his spirit and because we love people we do everything what is possible to help people [Music] baptisms are a regular occurrence and during the week Church of Christ savior holds several youth programs for different age groups parents also get their Ministry time and when folks can't get to church members often hit the streets of teras pole and neighboring cities holding Evangelistic rallies Sanuk says the church often reports signs wonders and miracles following the preaching of the gospel for example it's Can it can be cancer and cancer has disappeared or somebody has a problem with the vision God fix their Vision uh death people can hear I believe all this power in the gospel and all these Miracles happens because people preach the gospel that and God equip us for gospel to preach gospel make disciples meanwhile cbn's orphans promise partners with Church of Christ savior to run their School of Life project here in transnistria each week young people attend various classes including computer skills sewing photography English math and discipleship classes through super book some of the [Music] mothers take dance singing and cooking classes run by orphan's promise volunteers many who attend cannot AFF for to pay so offens promise holds the classes for free in seo's church school of life we use the basement rooms and children they listen What's happen on the first floor when we have youth ministry teenagers Ministry Sunday Ministry and because the town they join to the they just come to the sanctuary and they join to the church and after a while their parents join to the church so by that relationship with orphan promise we expand kingdom of God while the majority here would rather be part of Russia Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has many residents concerned that war could soon be on their doorstep as well Sanuk isn't afraid he plans to stay despite fears of conflict we know our calling God tell us we have to preach gospel and make disciples so nothing change war or not war doesn't matter what kind of situation around we have the same Colony all the time George Thomas CBN News teras po transnistria up next a gunman enters a Pennsylvania church and points that firearm straight at the pastor now he's telling his story of miraculous [Music] survival welcome back to Christian world news here in the US churches have seen a significant surge in violence one report shows a 700% increase in attacks and closures recently Millions watched that shocking video of a man aiming a gun at Pastor Glenn Germany during a Sunday service miraculously that gun jammed Pastor jermany spoke with CBN Charlene Aaron about the moment and needing to protect houses of worship and God I truly believe that it's more than just a act of violence on May 5th at Jesus's Dwelling Place Church near Pittsburgh a man aimed gun at Pastor Glenn Germany as he led worship he talked about the stunning now viral attempt during an appearance on cbn's prayer link only thing I see is the barrel of the gun and at that point I just natural instincts kicked in You Know cover up Duck run and try to get out of the line of you know the gunfire when the man pulled the trigger the gun jammed cuz I was just trying to get out the way but after the fact of you know once the police had apprehended them then we was sitting around and somebody say he pulled the tricker I'm like I didn't pull and they like yeah so we had to pull out the video tape and listen to the and re look at it and that's when cuz I was miked up dur the time and the two mics next to where I preach are on to and so at that time you can it picked it up and it went click Deacon Clarence McAlister then took action and helped tackle the gunman I just um jumped um over to the um it's a little banister we have there you know what I mean grabbed him you know I mean kept his arms down to his side so he wouldn't be able to me man manuver a gun at all you know what I mean turn him around and sat him down God's miraculous protection at work and that was nothing but an act of God you know what I'm saying because the simple fact that to be honest with you if anybody don't believe that that gun was working 30 minutes before he came to our facility he already killed somebody a pastor for nearly 30 years Germany says he's now witnessed God's faithfulness on a level he never imagined God had promised that he'll be a protecting hedge of Bas you know he had promised to ministering angels of violence and so the enemy tried to attack but at the same token God Blocked It While many connect mental illness with the gun debate Pastor Germany admits spiritual forces were also at work saying the suspect revealed that voices urged him to kill the pastor I believe that the enemy was using a vessel because that's what the enemy have to use they operate on the natural even though they're spiritual so he needed a vessel in the natural to carry out his will and someone who don't understand the ways of God or who haven't been free from sin who has no power over voices as we do as Believers he just submitted into the voice that he Hur while threats against houses of worship are not new violence is on the rise shootings at churches more than doubled from 2022 to 2023 since the attack Pastor Germany's church has put new security measures in place we're working with a group out of Florida they're really doing a fantastic job and they are really you know taking the first initiative in helping us solve this problem you know you want people to be able to come in relax so but you want someone there in place because the simple fact that this can happen at any time and you just want people to feel safe that includes watching and praying you really have to keep be focused on the people that enter your church especially if you don't know them meanwhile Bernard poite has been charged with criminal homicide for the earlier shooting death of his cousin while polite also faces charges in the church incident Pastor Germany has extended forgiveness toward the man there is no sin Beyond God's Redemption it don't matter what someone done it can always be forgiven Charlene Aaron CBN News well this week the Southern Baptist convention America's largest Protestant denomination voted to oppose invitro fertilization or IVF as medical reporter Lori Johnson explains a growing number of Christians have deep concerns about the procedure while many Christians leave embryos created during invitro fertilization our human life some disagree about whether the practice should be changed or avoid it altogether the concern is the morality of creating dozens of embryos per patient implanting only some and either destroying the others or saving them for future implantation which often doesn't happen it has a mortality of about 5% in the deth process and uh it's also we have millions of Frozen embryos in storage now that uh it's that's just a whole another matter and it's I think a tragedy but it doesn't have to be that way if I were advising a Christian couple that was looking at IVF and felt that this was something that the Lord wanted them to do I would say that one thing that they would request of their Physicians would be that all created embryos be implanted that means creating no more than four embryos we aren't in a position to decide uh which embryo is going to survive and which embryo is not only God can decide that some such as the Catholic church say the practice should be avoided altogether the IVF industry it feeds this cultural entitlement that we have to Godlike Powers over life and death and that's that that sense of entitlement is precisely what has fueled the abortion industry others say IVF should be regulated we don't really have an objection to uh invitro fertilization at all as long as it's conducted in a way that um shows respect for ethical and moral considerations as long as it's couples that are Desiring to have a child you know we we support that meanwhile faced with infertility Amanda and Ryan Visser rejected IVF for themselves I do have an ethical issue with um with creating lots of embryos that you don't intend to use but adopted the Frozen embryos someone else no longer wanted which became their twin Sons you know even in the freezer they weren't dead so I look at that I go well there's human life even at a microscopic level so while the debate continues over how or whether to regulate IVF more Americans are becoming educated about the process as well as the Alternatives Lori Johnson CBN News well coming up young conservatives heaing the biblical command to care for God's creation they're at work on Capitol Hill and in communities across the [Music] country welcome back as the climate change debate heats up a team of young conservatives is building a blueprint for the future that group is working to make an impact on Capitol Hill it's also encouraging Grassroots cleanup campaigns in neighborhoods our goal is just getting young people involved getting young people outside and showing them how beautiful it is clean air and water are important to Danny Lindsay a self-proclaimed conservative and Florida's state director with the American conservation Coalition the group encourages conservatives to join the climate conversation while also leading cleanup initiatives and restoration efforts in their own neighborhoods being the Christian broadcast network I'm sure you guys know God calls us to be stewards of the earth um and that's something that conservatives should care about a lot of conservatives are Christians and we want to show them God's beautiful creation a recent poll finds that 81% of young Republicans under 35 see climate change as a serious issue and want to take action the bigger Gap in conservation attitudes exists between political parties with data showing Democrats is three times more likely than Republicans to participate in those activities Benji backer is working to change that in this era of political tribalism that I think we're all fairly sick of even if we're just sick of one side of it you know there is a there's a reality that the left has controlled the narrative on this for a very long time after headlines of 2023 being the warmest year on record to the high sea levels and ocean temperatures backer and his Coalition want Common Sense solutions to protect the planet climate change climate change climate change the radical vers radical approach we've witnessed our entire lives hasn't gotten us anywhere and it's actually set us back this shouldn't be about politics this should be about our planet since 2017 40,000 members have joined some 150 chapters of the American conservation Coalition Nationwide instead of being angry on social media or blocking traffic or throwing tomato soup at Priceless paintings what if you clean up your backyard what if you take people in your community on a hike what if you get your Church to do a cleanup in addition to Hands-On efforts Coalition president Chris Barnard says the organization has helped pass major legislation and is also pushing the country to make smarter decisions when it comes to energy instead of doing fossil fuels in China instead of getting our uranium fuel from Russia we need to be producing here in the United States because we can do it cleaner than anyone else and we do do it cleaner than anyone else but we also have a moral obligation to our own National Security to take some of that back in backer's new book the conservative environmentalist he questions the Biden administration's Green New Deal pointing out the highly debated $93 trillion legislation would only reduce carbon emissions by 4% according to its own statistics he also offers that Partnerships between energy companies and environmental nonprofits could be a way for America to engage in diverse energy production without fin financially burdening future Generations the environment is so much bigger than just environmental politics it's about our national security it's about our economy it's about our neighborhoods it's about our quality of life while his group operates in all 50 states backer sees Florida as a prime location for conservationists to make a significant impact some of the most groundbreaking research that drives policy and conservation change comes from right here in sunny Florida at the Hub SeaWorld Research Institute that shows you how busy we are that the samples just like scientists here lead Dolphin Research and rescue programs along with habitat Restoration in the Indian River Lagoon which spans 40% of Florida's East Coast we need to go from the bottom up we need to protect the habitat for the fish so that the fish can be healthy and so that the Dolphins have enough prey um we see decreased body condition in dolphins in the Indian River Lagoon across the board over 90% are underweight Hub Sea World research provides crucial data to lawmakers wanting to shape policies for protecting natural Spaces by partnering with the ACC they hope to bolster even more support from future conservationists while Dolphins might not be the issue in your backyard environmental leaders emphasize getting involved in your own Community send a message that makes a difference it's all connected we can't solve the Dolphins problems without thinking about how this affects the entire ecosystem so that's why it's kind of a daunting problem that is how you're going to really make impact and change if you take care of your local environment and helping nonprofits whether it's Hub seaw World Research Institute or whether it is in your local municipality that's really where the difference comes in and that's how you could solve these bigger problems is by helping local well conservationists tell me that this work isn't rocket science they believe it's harder than that because it's not just ecological it's also political economical and biblical to Steward the Earth and everything in it but they tell me this is a puzzle that we can solve if we do it together and

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] hi everyone welcome to the 700 Club israel has taken a historic step to protect itself from future terrorist attacks and prevent the creation of a Palestinian state right on its borders hamas has reportedly rejected the latest ceasefire offer from the United States that allows Israel to continue to expand its military offensive in Gaza chris Mitchell brings us the story from Jerusalem israeli troops push further into northern Gaza warning civilians to get out of harm's way us Envoy Steve Witkov's ceasefire and hostage deal would reportedly lead to Hamas freeing 10 of the remaining living hostages in the first week of the 60-day ceasefire in exchange Israel would free more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners a major sticking point hamas wants guarantees israel won't return to fighting after the ceasefire but Israel's prime minister says he wants the fighting to resume and continue until Hamas is eliminated in Gaza meanwhile the Israeli government has made an historic decision to approve 22 new communities in the biblical heartland of the Jewish nation Judea and Samaria also known as the West Bank this will help block Palestinians from forming a state in this area and according to Defense Minister Israel Katz it also provides a buffer for the nation security as he put it Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria serves as a vital security barrier for Israel's major population centers we must do everything in our power to expand and reinforce this protective shield it was the first volley in the government's effort to head off another unilateral move for a Palestinian state by some Western powers including France next month France's president at a summit in New York City will push for most of the world to altogether recognize a Palestinian state israeli foreign minister Gedon Sar warned that such a declaration would reward the Hamas terrorists who committed the October 7th atrocities he added &quot;Unilateral moves against Israel will be met with unilateral Israeli measures we will not get any dictates from outside with regard to our national security.&quot; This fits with the foreign minister's statements this week that if outside nations push to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state in Judea and Samaria Israel will respond by declaring sovereignty over more and more of the area all right Chris Mitchell joins us now from Jerusalem a lot to talk about chris how does Israel approving these new settlements help block the creation of a Palestinian state well one of the main things is this uh Andrew it actually creates facts on the ground it it strengthens Israel's claim to the land and what will happen is that more Israelis will be moving and living in Judea and Samaria uh and it would make the withdrawal that happened 20 years ago uh unlikely what happened 20 years ago Andrew is uh what's called the Gaza disengagement uh Israel unilaterally pulled out of Gaza and five communities in northern Samaria that was uh that was as we see right now we see the effects of what happened uh Gaza became one of the biggest terror bases in all of the world and so this is designed to help prevent a Palestinian uh state it's really a strategic shift really historic move uh Andrew away from a two-state solution and the next step as we mentioned in that report maybe declaring sovereignty over Judea and Samaria so what are Israel's biggest concerns about a potential Palestinian state well one of the main concerns Andrew is security and they looked at what happened after the disengagement in 2007 as I mentioned what Gaza became the biggest terror base in the world and then we had tens of thousands of rockets since then and then of obviously what happened on October 7th a Palestinian state would be in the heart of Israel and it would be close to Tel Aviv the Bengorian airport and Jerusalem and people are concerned it could be another terror base uh we also see a terror hub so to speak in places like Nabis and Janine and we also see that after October 7th many of the Palestinians in Judea and Samaria they actually supported October 7th and they believe that if you look at places like Palestinian Media Watch which monitors Palestinian media uh there's really anti-Semitic anti-Israel uh anti-Jewish propaganda almost every day so this marks uh no more uh going back to the Oslo style negotiations and a belief for many that this is really the land promised in the Bible to the Jewish people all right Chris let's talk about the war in Gaza there's a new way to distribute humanitarian aid to the Palestinians there what impact does that have on Hamas well it's a major impact Andrew and actually this is a dramatic uh development and what it does is it bypasses the ability for Hamas to steal the humanitarian aid uh and feed their own terrorists and then actually they often sell it back to the population and they've been doing this since the beginning of the war so what this new humanitarian effort which is called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation it really undermines Hamas's control over the population hamas is warning the people no don't go to these areas and get the humanitarian aid but many are ignoring Hamas uh and so Hamas wants to stop in any negotiations wants to stop this because it really represents a threat to their control uh and to their authority and weakens them dramatically all right Chris while I have you let's talk about another layer in all this there ongoing reports of worries in Israel about a possible Trump administration nuclear deal with Iran what are those concerns Israel has well here uh over here Andrea they don't trust Iran uh Iran violated the uh 2015 JCPOA that was an agreement that was designed to limit Iran's nuclear program and uh over here they believe that a bad deal by the US and Iran would allow Iran to continue to enrich uranium and they believe over here that Iran is committed ideologically and theologically to nuclear weapons part of their belief in the return of the Shiite Messiah the Mahi and they believe diplomacy really is not going to stop Iran uh and while this window continues there seem to be going towards a nuclear weapon an existential threat to Israel all right Chris always appreciate your great reporting thanks for being with us today thanks

          <attvalue for="7" value="News Nightly. It all adds up as Pope Leo the 14th nears one month leading the global church. We examine the connection between the papacy and mathematics. Cause for concern. A prominent pro-lifer is arrested for speaking out against the transgender movement. Her husband gives us an update. Back and forth, President Trump and Elon Musk continue their disagreement on social media. We're at the white House. Plus, remembering the longest Day veterans gather in France on the 81st anniversary of the D-Day landing in World War two. These stories and more tonight. &gt;&gt; From EWTN Global Catholic Network. This is EWTN News Nightly. &gt;&gt; Thank you for being with us tonight. Our top story. We are closing in on one month since Pope Leo the 14th began his pontificate. The last several weeks have seen joy, celebration and hope during this new moment for the church. The first pope from the U.S. First appeared on the loggia of Saint Peter's Basilica back on May 8th, following his election during the conclave. Since then, the Holy Father has been carrying out. His papal duties as he begins his pontificate, providing some early clues along the way to what his ministry will look like. Joining us now to discuss this some more is EWTN news vice president and editorial director, as well as the author of the new book, Leo The 14th Portrait of the First American Pope. Doctor Bunson, thank you so much for being here. &gt;&gt; Privileged to be with you. &gt;&gt; Nearly a month into this papacy. What has stood out to you the most? &gt;&gt; Well, first, it's almost astounding that it's a month into this papacy, right? We were all there in the square of Saint Peter, and we witnessed his election. And now here we are weeks later. But I think we can look at this from two directions. The first is from the Pope himself. He has settled into this pontificate with such remarkable ease and grace. But the word I would use is encounter. He has really been very deliberate in the way he's having encounters with the faithful of Rome, whose bishop he now is. He went to, for example, the Saint John Lateran, and was on the loggia there and had this encounter with them. So he's really been reaching out to the world. The other way of looking at it is how the world has reacted to Leo, right? We looked at the astounding numbers of his page at Pontifex on X. I think it's now at almost 19 million followers. Yeah, just truly remarkable numbers. So it's not a honeymoon. It is a fact that this encounter on the part of Pope Leo reaching out to the world and the world is very much responding, and you can see that with the enthusiasm of the crowds. Yes, he's a new pope. Yes. You're going to have that natural enthusiasm. But there is something very winning, something very authentic about him that we saw on that first day on May 8th. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. We're seeing that enthusiasm, and we've heard a few of the homilies at this point, including a very powerful, powerful message on marriage and the family just last weekend. What have you noticed in his speaking style so far? &gt;&gt; He's speaking style is very easy in the sense that he's very relaxed in his delivery. He's comfortable joking in multiple languages, which is itself impressive. His general audiences are notable because he does this. The summary in English, in English by himself. So there's that. So there's more of that direct connection with English speakers around the world. But there's also in him, as I was saying, this ease. It's a testament, I think, to the fact that as a missionary, he is adaptable to so many different circumstances. And but he's also able to adapt himself to the situation in which he finds himself. &gt;&gt; And let's talk about appointments. He has made several appointments in the last few weeks, some at the Vatican and some of the diocese's right here in the U.S. What do you take away from these selections? What can you tell us about this? &gt;&gt; Well, the first is that he seems to be very focused on there's a classic term in Catholic social teaching, subsidiarity of keeping things sort of local. So, for example, we saw him promote an auxiliary bishop in San Diego to that see, in succession to Cardinal Robert McElroy, who was moved to Washington before the passing of Pope Francis. He has done a very similar thing in Thibodaux in Louisiana. He's promoted from within in Newark, and even in some of his Vatican appointments, he sort of stuck with this structure that exists. For example, his recent appointment of Monsignor Renzo Pecoraro to succeed the somewhat controversial Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia as head of the Pontifical Academy for life. He was chancellor there for a number of years, appointed by Pope Benedict XVI. So Leo, for the moment at least, is sort of promoting from within, but relying on that local experience. &gt;&gt; Sure. A lot to pay attention to. Doctor Matthew Bunson, thank you for that. We'll be coming to you for the latest on Leo as we move along in this papacy. Thank you so much. &gt;&gt; Let's keep praying for our new Holy Father. &gt;&gt; Let's do it. Coming up later in the newscast, we learn more about how Pope Leo's background in math could influence his pontificate. The social media feud between President Donald Trump and billionaire businessman Elon Musk could have wider implications. Musk worked side by side with the president to cut government waste and abuse, but their fallout threatens key government programs. White House correspondent Oan Jensen begins our team coverage. &gt;&gt; Own mark on this Friday. It's not clear tonight where their relationship stands. They're being urged to make peace now. Musk has been critical of the big beautiful Bill and their social media spat even nearly rocketed into space. President Donald Trump today waved to reporters while on his way to Marine One, headed to new Jersey. Although President Trump recently praised Elon Musk in the Oval Office for his controversial cost cutting measures across government. &gt;&gt; Elon gave an incredible service. Nobody like him. &gt;&gt; The two started fighting over future funding and spending. President Trump writing the easiest way to save money in our budget billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts. That would include the money spent on Musk's rocket company. SpaceX used to take astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station for NASA. Musk responded by saying SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately. But Musk later accepted online advice to cool off and take a step back, posting he wouldn't withdraw the Dragon capsule back on Earth. The Wall Street Journal reporting that Tesla vehicle President Trump bought earlier this year. He now may sell it or give it away, and asked whether the social media falling out will impact Doge efforts in the future. Peter Navarro, the president's trade adviser, told reporters. &gt;&gt; No, no, look. &gt;&gt; Waste, fraud and abuse, unfortunately, is alive and well in America. And the Doge folks here, they're good folks. &gt;&gt; Navarro, who was once ridiculed by Musk, did not want to answer multiple questions about him. As for Musk's departure. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm not glad. Or whatever it's people come and go from the white House. He was a special government employee with an expiration date. &gt;&gt; Now, President Trump spoke out on network TV, saying he's not particularly interested in speaking with Musk at the moment, and repeated his claim that Musk has lost his mind at the white House. Owen Jensen, EWTN News Nightly. &gt;&gt; Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Republican leadership is trying to present a united front amid the feud between President Trump and Elon Musk. Could it impact getting the one big, beautiful bill across the finish line? Let's check in with Capitol Hill correspondent Erik Rosales with the latest Erik. &gt;&gt; Hey good afternoon Mark. Good evening. Republicans certainly didn't need this headache. Even House speaker Mike Johnson is involved trying to douse the political flames. He called Elon Musk several times yesterday, but says the billionaire never picked up. Instead, Musk returned political fire not by phone. But as Owen mentioned during his own communication platform. Now, Republican Leader Steve Scalise tells me it's nothing more than a temporary distraction. &gt;&gt; It's unfortunate, but I think a lot of people said they knew it was inevitable, you know, and here we are. I mean, it's going to play out. But look, Donald Trump has got a strong vision for the country. He was elected to deliver on all these things that he's doing. &gt;&gt; Other Republicans are also downplaying the spat. &gt;&gt; You know, they're having a lover's quarrel. They can work it out. Do you think they can work it out with no problem. We'll see it, won't we? Stay tuned. &gt;&gt; Democrats are using this as a political platform, saying the one big beautiful bill is on shaky ground. &gt;&gt; They're going to have some issues. I think the likelihood of it passing drops, but it doesn't mean it won't pass. I think it might look kind of different, but time will tell how much of an impact it will have. It doesn't help. &gt;&gt; The fact of the matter is, too much ego and too small space, and that makes things difficult. &gt;&gt; Amid the back and forth, some lawmakers say Musk and Trump are misusing their influence. &gt;&gt; They both have taken such extreme positions. And, you know, these they're men of great power that have tried to use that power not for the good of the people, but for their own selfish interests. And of course, when that happens, things explode. &gt;&gt; But most Senate Republicans remain optimistic. They plan to make significant changes to the bill starting next week. &gt;&gt; President Trump has the biggest platform on Earth, and the platform that he's advocating for is to prevent that $4 trillion tax increase to fund our military, secure our border, and strengthen Medicaid. &gt;&gt; While Democrats say this is more likely a reality TV show. &gt;&gt; It's definitely made for Bravo. I mean, this is like The Real Housewives of Foggy Bottom. I mean, it definitely is. It's the reunion show. I mean, Andy, Andy Cohen, if you're listening, you got to produce this reunion show. The seating chart of it, like where Stephen Miller is going to be seated, like it's going to be fascinating. &gt;&gt; That would make an interesting show. Well, another thing to consider, if the feud does consider what a continue that is. What effect could it have on the midterm elections later this year? Elon Musk has given millions of dollars to the Republican Party for numerous races, and recently he's pinned a new post on his ex asking if it's time to create a new political party, one that will, quote, actually represent the 80% in the middle. So the saga continues. Mark back to you. &gt;&gt; President Trump isn't just lashing out at Elon Musk over social media after today's jobs report pointed to a weakening labor market. Trump intensified his attacks on the head of the Federal Reserve, calling for interest rates to be slashed by a full point. Posting on Truth Social too late at the fed is a disaster. Europe has had ten rate cuts. We have had none. Despite him, our country is doing great. Go for a full point. Rocket fuel. According to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Economy added 139,000 jobs in May, compared with a downwardly revised 149,000 post in April. Despite the better than expected May figure, economists say revisions to prior data suggest job growth has shifted to the lower trajectory. Several are dead and dozens injured following a massive Russian air attack on Kyiv. Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky says Russia used more than 400 missiles and 40 drones in the attack. The barrage was one of the fiercest of the war and lasted several hours. The strike comes just days after the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, told President Trump he would have to retaliate for Ukraine's attack on Russian airfields. A solemn day in Normandy, France, as tens of thousands of people gather for the 81st anniversary of the landings at D-Day. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth lays a memorial wreath at the cemetery for American soldiers. A service at a nearby Catholic cathedral remembered the more than 4000 Allied troops killed on June 6th, 1944. The invasion helped turn the tide of World War Two and the defeat of Nazi Germany. We have a lot more still to come on EWTN News Nightly, including the church in the modern age. It is a top priority for the Pope, warning the world of the AI threat. Find out how the bishops of Maryland are helping him spread the word. And while enrollment in Catholic schools declines nationwide, one state remains the outlier. Find out what's behind the numbers. atholic bishops have issued a pastoral letter addressing the ethical implications of artificial intelligence. In it, they write, as AI technologies transform our lives, workplaces, relationships, and even our sense of identity, the church must be a prophetic voice calling the world to place the human person made in the image of God, at the heart of this transformation. Ginny Kraska is the executive director of the Maryland Catholic Conference. She explained to EWTN why the bishops tied the release of the letter to the Feast of Pentecost, which is this Sunday, June 8th. &gt;&gt; The Feast of Pentecost really symbolizes the church being empowered to go out and spread the gospel message in every language and every time and every culture. And that is what we are being asked to do right now. When it comes to AI. AI is basically this, this new language that we're being asked to interpret. And the church should and must have a role in interpreting what AI will look like and how it will be used in a in a way that is just and compassionate and really keeps us at the center of it. The respect for human dignity. &gt;&gt; Pope Leo the 14th has made curtailing the risk of runaway AI a defining mission of his pontificate. &gt;&gt; In our own day, the church offers to everyone a treasury of her social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defense of human dignity, justice, and labor. &gt;&gt; Switching gears, a pro-lifer in Belgium has been released after she was arrested yesterday for displaying a sign speaking out against the transgender movement. &gt;&gt; Because a man was harassing and following Lois everywhere she went, trying to stop us from filming. The police have now arrived. &gt;&gt; Lois McClatchy Miller was featured yesterday in a video on social media. In it, she and a friend are surrounded by police as she displayed a sign that reads children are never born in the wrong body. More than 1 million people viewed the video. Her husband, also a prominent pro-lifer, says this is a further indication of a lack of free speech in Europe. &gt;&gt; I would say to Europe, wake up, because this is really happening. And I would say to America that you have a really profound role as a country that really can have an influence if you really care for Europe and care for its people, you will take the sort of action necessary to make sure that we can preserve our basic freedoms. And that would involve things like sanctioning the politicians involved, sanctioning the authorities involved, and taking action really just to ensure that there is no chance that anything like this could ever happen again. &gt;&gt; Calum Miller also said his wife and the other pro-life advocate were initially charged with disturbing the peace. The last decade has unfortunately seen a decline in Catholic school enrollment in the U.S, however, one state remains an outlier. A new report by Step Up for students shows Florida is leading the way on Catholic school enrollment, while enrollment is down 13.2% nationally over the last decade, it is up 12.1% in Florida over the same span. More recent upticks come after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law, a measure which makes every student in the state eligible for a state supported choice scholarship. Joining us to break down these numbers some more is Tommy Schultz, CEO of the American Federation for children. Tommy, thanks for joining us. What stands out to you most when you look at these numbers from Florida? &gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Mark. Yeah, the numbers in Florida are staggering. And what stands out the most is that good politics, good policy that yields good results for students at the end of the day, like you mentioned nationwide, 13% decrease in the last ten years with Catholic school enrollment. Yet Florida, they've been pushing pedal to the metal school choice expansions for basically two decades. And governor DeSantis signed into law the big expansion that made every single family eligible for school choice funding in the state. And guess what? Florida is up 12%. Basically, ten years ago you had about 82,000 kids, and now in Florida, there's 92,000 kids enrolled in these programs. And it couldn't come at a better time to have this data that just was published, because Congress right now is debating as part of the big, beautiful bill negotiations, inserting school choice legislation into that piece of into the law such that all 50 states could have school choice. So when you see places like New York, 31% drop in Catholic school enrollment, Pennsylvania, 23% drop, Illinois 20% drop. You know, all these places that have had huge drops in Catholic school enrollment, partly due to government regulation, partly due to challenging financial dynamics, federal law that could get passed as part of the big beautiful bill here, maybe in the next month, could actually be a game changer. We could see Florida like trends in the rest of the country. &gt;&gt; Well, what kind of role could choice scholarships play in assisting Catholic school enrollment nationwide? &gt;&gt; Well, basically, like in Florida, you're eligible for about $8,000 per kid per year with state funding, essentially. So rather than your all of your taxpayer funds going into the public system, now, all parents just fully control their funding and for education in Florida. So if Congress passes a piece of federal legislation that says families will be able to control their child's education funding through a tax credit donation mechanism, that's going to be an absolute game changer for millions of families, particularly in places like New York or Illinois, that have had these 30 and 20% drops in Catholic school enrollment. So all of these Catholic schools that are obviously doing a lot of fundraising, and they're relying upon a lot of Catholic Charities to support students, particularly lower income students, middle income students. Now, we're every family could be theoretically able to control their child's education funding like we see in Florida, like we see in Arizona and other places. That is just a total game changer for families, and it could bring a lot of children out of poverty. &gt;&gt; Catholic parents and so many others are interested in this topic. Tommy Schultz, thank you so much for being with us. &gt;&gt; Thanks for having me. &gt;&gt; Up next on EWTN News Nightly. It's all coming together. Best selling author Rick Warren weighs in on the relationship between evangelicals and Catholics. Plus, a great addition. Learn more about Pope Leo and his background in mathematics. says Christian unity will be a major theme of his pontificate. Others are discussing this topic as well. A recent conference outside Rome focused on evangelization, and began the dialog toward the year 2033, which will mark 2000 years since the death and resurrection of Jesus. The non-Catholic speakers included the author of the best selling book, The Purpose Driven Life, EWTN Vatican bureau chief Andreas Donhauser has more from Pastor Rick Warren. &gt;&gt; Maybe you can tell us a little about why are you speaking at a Catholic conference about evangelization? &gt;&gt; Because no single denomination can complete the Great Commission on their own. There are 2.5 billion people in the world who claim to believe in Jesus Christ. Now, that doesn't mean that they are walking with him. They're, you know, working with him on a regular basis. But if you were to say, do you believe in the Trinity, father, son, Holy Spirit, oh, yeah. Do you believe Jesus is who he said he was? The Son of God? Yes. Do you believe he died on the cross for our sins and rose again? Yes. Do you believe he sent the Holy Spirit to start the church? Yes. Well, you're not a muslim. You're not a Hindu. You're not a Buddhist. Of the 2.5 billion people who follow Jesus in the world, they're not Muslims, okay? 1.3 billion are Catholic. Okay. So it's an enormous it's about half of the Christian church are Catholic. And so this is what I call the sleeping giant. &gt;&gt; But 2033 what is the objective there. &gt;&gt; On Pentecost Sunday, June 5th, 2033? That will be the 2,000th birthday of Christianity. It's the 2,000th birthday of the church. 2000 celebration of the resurrection. And so all around the world, Christians, every different tribe, for now, for probably about a decade, have been thinking, how are we going to celebrate the 200th birthday of Christ's Church, the body of Christ on earth? &gt;&gt; But don't you also find a lot of concern that people say, oh, you evangelicals, you just want to take over the Catholics or, oh, the Catholics, they just want to take us over or. &gt;&gt; No, it doesn't have any. It doesn't have anything to do with that. We're never gonna in John 17, which is Jesus last prayer before he goes to the cross. He's in the Garden of Gethsemane the night before he goes to the cross. And he is great prayer. There is the prayer for unity. It is still the unanswered prayer. Jesus. Twice in that passage, Jesus prayed, father, I pray that talking about his his followers, they will be one so that the world may know. And two verses later he says, I pray that they will be one, so that the world may believe the purpose for unity first. It's never we're never going to have cultural unity. We're never going to have structural unity. I don't even I think there's value. It takes all kinds of churches to reach all kinds of people. We're never going to have unity in doctrine, but we can all agree on one thing every Christian understands we're called to go. &gt;&gt; And so it's possible to pray together. I saw you praying with Archbishop Sinkiewicz with with other leaders of other churches. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And I pray with anybody who believes Jesus Christ is the Lord of my life. And these are brothers and sisters in Christ. &gt;&gt; We are in the jubilee of hope. We are. Francis called that out. What is your hope for this year but also towards 2033? &gt;&gt; Well, hope is the most important thing that we need. It's the last thing to lose. When you lose hope, it's over. And. And so what the world needs now is hope. Francis called it twice. He called it when we did the Year of Mercy. Remember when we did the Year of Mercy? Our church did the Year of Mercy? We're not a Catholic church, but we did the Year of Mercy. I thought, this is a great theme for the year. &gt;&gt; Pastor Rick, thank you so much for being with us, and thank you for your testimony. &gt;&gt; It's an honor, and I will just say we love EWTN. It's been a great ministry in my life. And I'll give you a personal testimony that when I lost a son, let's see, that would be now 12 years ago, 2013. He struggled his entire life with mental illness and in a fit of depression, he took his life and it was the worst day of my life. One of the things that helped me through was on EWTN. They were playing the Chaplet of Divine Mercy and the Chaplet of Divine Mercy ministered to me and to my wife. And just doing that, it was a healing balm in my heart. And so thank you, EWTN for all you're doing. &gt;&gt; Thank you for viewing. We know Pope Leo the 14th is a man of many firsts. First U.S born pope, first to hold Peruvian citizenship and the first from the Order of Saint Augustine. But there is one more first you can add to the list. During his studies at Villanova University, the Holy Father majored in mathematics, and he may be the first pope to have done it. While he did go on to study canon law, some excited Catholics are referring to him with a mathematical term of endearment Pope Pi EWTN News Eric Rosales sat down with the mathematician to learn more. &gt;&gt; And joining us now is Brad Jolley, who majored in mathematics and has even developed activities for Catholic students in Uganda. Brad, we're delighted to have you. First off, let's talk about the papacy and mathematics. It's not a connection that a lot of people make there, but there is a strong connection now with this Pope. And can you explain? &gt;&gt; Well, it's a pleasure to be with you, Eric. And I don't think that a pope necessarily has to be a mathematician, but I do think that a background in math can be very helpful to a pope, or really anybody who's trying to understand God. There's this misperception. Well, there's a misperception out there that math is only for practical purposes. And while you certainly can use math for engineering and architecture and science and medicine and other things that really contribute to human flourishing, there's so much more than that. I think a proper math education should also focus on the infinite, the good, the true and the beautiful, all of which can really draw us closer to God. And I know that my own understanding of physics and math was important in my conversion to the church. &gt;&gt; Oh, beautiful. Well, we'll get into that. Yeah, but I got to tell you, when you when you can't solve a math problem, you kind of look for other theories and things like that. A lot of rigor in math. And what do you think that this will help in the Pope's work, the Holy Father's work? &gt;&gt; Well, you know, I hesitate to make predictions, right? But my hope is that the Holy Father will use his math mindset and his ability to reason abstractly about whole sets of issues. And if you reason abstractly, you can often address many problems at once with very deep principles. So if the Pope can distill and communicate these deep principles in a way that really properly clarifies existing church teaching, I think that will bring badly, badly needed clarity to the faithful. &gt;&gt; Is that what helped yourself in coming to the Catholic faith? &gt;&gt; It really was. A lot of times people. They lay out objections to the to the faith. And I know I certainly did that. But when you understand things at a deep level, the objections really sort of fall away. &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of people shy away from math, my myself included. That's why I was a communication major. But no doubt it had a lot of bad memories, but a lot of therapy there. But how would you encourage them who are having trouble with math today? &gt;&gt; If you believe that the whole purpose of math is just to solve practical problems, you end up with what we have today. But if you believe that math education should be a response to the commands of Christ, that we're to love the Lord our God, our God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength and love our neighbor as ourself. Then you get a very different and more joyful and beautiful way to do math education. &gt;&gt; Well, Brad Jolley, thank you so much for joining us. &gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Eric. &gt;&gt; It all adds up, doesn't it? Well, we thank you for watching tonight. Remember, you can follow us on social media, Facebook and Instagram at News Nightly I'm Mark irons. Good night and God bless." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="we have come from India with a delegation of seven members of parliament and one ambassador uh and we in the seven members represent five political parties seven different states following our example there you are seven different states three different religions it's a diversity of India uh but we are united in the message we bring and that's what I'll be talking to you about in a minute uh our new ambassador has just presented his uh soft credentials this morning may I briefly present my colleagues mr bhuneshwar Kharita is a senior member of parliament from Assam in the northeast of India mr safar Ahmed is from Jharkand in the east as well taranjit Sandu is our former ambassador in Washington till last year on the left is ambassador Dhya then we have Tjas Surya who is a member of parliament from Bangalore to his left Shashank Manitraati who's a member of parliament from a state that has more people than Brazil does up with Pradesh I was trying to explain to actually to my barber today we were that India has about onethird of our territory but six times our people exactly I envy your lack of density and of course hundreds and hundreds of years of civilization before Brazil you don't know that is true sir very very proud to recognize that and finally uh Harish Balyogi who is from Andhra Pradesh uh as you know in the the southeastern coast so we we represent in many ways the diversity of India and the reason we have come is very much to um seek uh greater sympathy and understanding on the part of our friends um and also countries that are not necessarily our friends but you are in the high friends category uh for our situation in recent months in particular the really really serious attack on our country by terrorists in Kashmir in a place called Pelgam on the 22nd of April i must say that uh we saw the statement by Brazil we were also very touched by President Lula teleoning our prime minister personally to express his concern and condolences but as you know um in the couple of weeks that followed uh absolutely no action was taken uh to bring the perpetrators to Hilo even to look for them in Pakistan we we we have identified four of them they had crossed over from the other side but there's absolutely no effort made so finally we decided the government decided it had to send a very strong message and this is why on the 7th of May uh India struck nine terrorist bases i say this very carefully you know Selzo from your years at the United Nations and I think this is the first time I'm seeing you in an Indian capacity we have always met you as a UN official uh let me say that that here we are looking at uh organizations listed by the 1267 committee at the UN uh these are organizations uh whose uh terrorist standing is not in doubt they're also on the terrorist designate list of the United States government and their headquarters base in the United Nations also yes yes in the in the sanctions terrorist sanctions committee 1267 committee um so I just wanted to say that we chose targets very carefully where every one of them was clearly and explicitly linked to or the base of or the training camp of one of these prescribed organizations second we took great care to do so at night 10:05 to 1:30 in the morning to minimize any risk of collateral damage civilians and so on normal life was everyone should be asleep at that time and then we also explicitly avoided any Pakistani government target any civilian target and any military target so the whole idea was to signal we are not trying to start a war we are just conducting retribution for an act of terror which was a really vile act 26 people killed they singled out the men on the basis of their religion they shot them dead in front of their wives and children it was really horrendous and and it was meant of course to do the maximum possib possible damage to India to disrupt the Kashmiri economy which was booming to end the prospects of tourism flourishing in Kashmir tourism had gone up by 100 100% in the preceding 12 months to also uh perhaps create a communal backlash in India because these people said you know uh are you Hindu bang can you recite the first verse of the Quran then we despair And in fact they spared one man because he could recite and this was clearly intended to send the message it is our religion that is killing you and so the hope was that there would be a backlash back in India and the Indian people thank God uh had the maturity to stay united no no absolutely nothing like that there were heightened tensions for maybe 24 hours some some minor incidents in university campuses and so on but thereafter whole country rallied behind and in fact once the operation started you would be so impressed to see the the strength of opinion of all sections and in fact I'm proud to say that every one of our parliamentary delegations going around the world uh has this diversity of religion I mentioned Mr mr frazz Ahmed is from the Muslim community is strongly solidly with us we've had others uh leading uh voices from the Muslim community and of course the Kashmiri people the Kashmiri chief minister who was elected in an election with a a 64% turnout quite recently uh he uh has has been really exemplary in speaking up for for India and for and against the hateful terrorism but you see Sels you understand these phenomena so well i don't want to preach to somebody as knowledgeable as you are but this is a particularly troubling matter because it is about the use of terrorism as an instrument of straight state policy you know when we struck that those terror bases on the 7th as I said every one of those bases identified linked to terror next morning there is a funeral at one of his sites conducted by a person who's also named in the in the committee uh Hafi Abdul Rav who's uh an LE figure named in the United Nations sanctions committee he is conducting the funeral and look who's attending uniformed uniformed officers of the police and military of Pakistan these are all military officers and there a couple of police people senior officials this is what is going on in Pakistan this organization ation uh the le has created this front called the resistance front so-called we have been reporting about the resistance front to the UN sanctions committee time after time three times we've already given details they claimed credit for their for the terrorist killings the next day they repeated that claim and then when people realized the gravity of it their handlers in Pakistan got them to delete the claim but the claim is on record for a full 24 hours and what is deeply disquiting is when India encouraged our friends on the security council to mention the resistance front in the press statement that the security council issued the uh Pakistan government I'm sorry to say with the support of your friends in China took out the name so there is not even a reference to the I have many friends yes yes of course and we are we are also your friends but we are not on the council these guys are and neither are you these days which is our loss we have to change that situation sir uh both of us should be on the council together on a more durable basis but to come back to the story um so we we conducted this the Pakistanis was were told very clearly and the world was told this is a retribution not the beginning of a war if you leave this alone we will leave you alone pakistan instead chose to react with disproportionate artillery shelling on civilian areas they killed 19 civilians in one district alone punch in Kashmir the Pakistani army army this time official Pakistani army attacked us they killed 19 civilians they hit a seek temple a gurvara they hit a convent the convent of the karmalites of mother Mary they killed civilians in homes they killed traffic on the streets it was absolutely shocking at that point we also retaliated there was no declaration of war but we hit them back very hard the day after that they sent drones and missiles over 400 drones um came across our border and and they fired missiles i'm proud to say our air defenses proved equal to the task we in turn on the night of the 9th 10th of May uh hit 11 Pakistani military targets these were airfields of the Pakistani air force it was when more or less well we we we keep just to keep the calendar so the whole thing is 88 hours the entire conflict was 88 hours because once we hit these airfields and there are satellite pictures not just from us but commercially available satellite pictures showing craters in the main airfields of the Pakistan Air Force after that they asked for peace they said let's let's stop firing there was a call you see the hotline between the two directors general of military operations is always open so their director general called ours in the morning of the 10th of May afternoon at 3:30 a formal call was arranged they proposed cessation of firing at 5:00 p.m we agreed instantly and I I stress this agreed instantly point because our line had throughout been we don't want a war our line had throughout been that we as India are focused on our growth and development we have no wish to do anything but promote the prosperity and well-being of our people we do not want to be distracted by conflict and terrorism and war but you cannot think that you people can walk across your border and kill us and go away with impunity so the message was if they do that there will be reprisals there will be a price to pay but thereafter we are not interested in a conflict against the whole Pakistani nation and people with whom we have no quarrel now what happened as soon as this was proposed was that we stopped and though for a couple of hours there were some uh people on the other side who violated the agreement uh it subsided very quickly and now we have 3 weeks of pretty much calm on the border so the story is to that degree for the moment over it's a story of an 88-hour conflict but the larger lessons are what I wanted to talk to you about and through you I hope you will share uh our prime minister's concerns with President Lula because the truth is that that we really need understanding from our friends here this is not some random incident this is very very seriously part of an organized effort by elements within Pakistan to systematically undermine the Indian state it has begun at the end of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan when you had a whole bunch of mujahedin trained and ready to be unleashed somewhere with no place to go because the Soviets had left so they turned them towards India and Kashmir and from 1989 onwards we have suffered repeated attacks you yourself uh were in the UN when some of them happened uh you were also also very much aware I know both as foreign minister and as defense minister of incidents including the Mumbai attack in 2008 when 170 people were killed uh 2008 but it was 170 people killed and India chose not to do this but to take the peaceful route because the evidence was all available dossias were compiled one of the terrorists was captured alive his home address in Pakistan was known everything was identified western intelligence agencies not just ours had recorded the chilling voice of that killer in Pakistan the handler giving minute-by-minute instructions to the terrorists to shoot and kill each of their victims while the killing was going on the operation was being directed from Pakistan all this evidence was collected and we thought the government which was at that point my party's government Dr manm Singh's government thought that this convincing dossier will result in the end of Pakistani terrorism that the whole world will tell Pakistan not acceptable so on and so forth i'm sorry to say it didn't happen full dossas were given pakistan was put on the gray list of the financial action task force not one person has been prosecuted let alone convicted not one they made a token gesture of arresting one or two of the names that we had provided which were associated with the dispatch of this mission the most prominent of them was a character who has since fathered children while he's ostensibly under arrest who has since fathered children while he is ostensibly under arrest that is the kind of arrest that he is enjoying it's a joke the Pakistanis are not serious about terrorism and this is why time after you know the Pakistanis say let us have a neutral investigation there could have been no more neutral investigation than the one of 2008 practically half a dozen Western intelligence agencies had material that was shared and that was collectively presented to the Pakistanis we said here is all the material you need to prosecute these people and convict them in your courts they gave one excuse after the other but what is worse sir is the terrorist attacks continued there was one serious attempt made by this prime minister Narendra Modi to make peace with Pakistan which was in on Christmas uh December 2015 one 7 years after Mumbai he traveled to Pakistan for the birthday celebrations of the then prime minister Nawas Sharif whose granddaughter was also getting married on the same day so he attended both there was a lot of warmth expressed on both sides it was a very spontaneous gesture by the prime minister not a long planned visit um and yet within three weeks we had a Pakistani attack uh on an Indian air base called Patangot uh at that point the prime minister invited the Pakistanis to join the investigation you see I say all this because the Pakistanis are again telling everybody let's have a joint investigation we did a joint investigation of Patanote and what happened they said they went back to Pakistan and they said the Indians did it to themselves that was the last straw i mean we the betrayal the sense of of frustration in Delhi has to be imagined you are talking to a government that on the one hand is friendly to you but it is unable to control the elements within its own system that go out and kill with impunity mumbai was bad enough but the continuing series of attacks after that so after this 2015 betrayal the government decided they would now no longer um take this lying down there would be public retaliation and it would be physical kinetic retaliation so 2015 September there was a an attack uh in a place called Uri on the line of control with Kashmir we sent a surgical strike right across the line of control hit some people very hard there 2019 January there was a suicide bombing by terrorists from Pakistan 40 people killed in Kashmir this time we conducted an air strike in their western uh northwestern province of Khibar Funqua a place called Barakot the purpose again was to show the old restraints will no longer be observed they will now be open action and this attack was serious enough to warrant hitting Pakistan's heartland but only terrorist sites initially and I want to say once again if Pakistan had not chosen to expand the conflict we would not have hit Pakistani military facilities our message is consistent we are not looking for war we are looking only to send a message to terrorists but through them we want a message to be heard by those who are providing them safe haven by those who are financing them training them equipping them guiding them and sending them across the border and those are people in Pakistan in very quote unquote responsible positions who are doing this whether they're under the control of the civilian government is another matter we will not speculate on that but they are still happening they are still coming from that country and that country if it's not willing to curb them will have to face the consequences that is precisely where we are since and I seek your understanding for this [Music] [Applause]"

The conflict began when Musk criticised Trump’s tax and spending legislation, the “Big, Beautiful Bill,” calling it a “disgusting abomination” that would increase the national debt. Trump responded by threatening to cut government contracts with Musk’s companies and expressed disappointment over the billionaire’s opposition. Both exchanged personal attacks on social media, with Musk claiming he was never shown the bill and asserting that without his support, Trump would have lost the election. The dispute caused Tesla’s stock to plunge over 14% in a single day, wiping off $150 billion in market value, its largest drop ever. Meanwhile, former Trump aide Steve Bannon called for an investigation into Musk’s immigration status, intensifying the row further.&#10;&#10;ALSO ON THE SHOW:&#10;Trump and Musk’s Relationship Crumbles: From Bromance to Backlash&#10;ICE Officers Stranded in Djibouti After Deportation Flight Blocked&#10;Zohran Mamdani's Deewar-Inspired Message Shakes Up NYC Mayoral Election&#10;Tinder’s Height Preference Filter Sparks Discrimination Debate&#10;---&#10;&#10;Elon Musk | Donald Trump | Big Beautiful Bill | Doge | SpaceX | Tesla | Zohran Mamdani | Tinder | Firstpost America | Eric Ham | War | Geopolitics | Global Economy | Firstpost | World News | Latest News | Global News | International News | Trending News&#10;&#10;#elonmusk #donaldtrump #Doge #tesla #zohrahmamdani #tinder #firstpostamerica #ericham #war #geopolitics #economy #firstpost #worldnews #latestnews #globalnews #internationalnews #trendingnews&#10;&#10;Firstpost is an Indian news and media website.

the bromance between Donald Trump and Elon Musk is over the question now becomes how many others will this take down with them we got the latest on that and other stories coming up but first a look at

in Washington where the once strong bromance between President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk is now collapsing like a house of cards the political alliance between the president and the Tesla CEO exploded after President Trump threatened to cut Musk government contracts while the billionaire suggested the president should be impeached the hostilities erupted when Donald Trump publicly criticized Musk over his opposition to the president's tax and spending legislation known as the big beautiful bill but I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here better than you people he knew everything about it he had no problem with it all of a sudden he had a problem and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV mandate because that's billions and billions of dollars and it really is unfair within hours their relationship deteriorated in full view as both sides traded personal barbs via social media now the frictions between the two are brewing and with Elon Musk now denouncing the bill as a disgusting abomination claiming it would add to the nation's $36.2 2 trillion debt and to the surprise of many President Trump kept quiet saying he expected the Tesla CEO to turn against him even personally he said the most beautiful things about me and he hasn't said bad about me personally but I'm sure that'll be next but I'm I'm very disappointed in Elon i've helped Elon a lot moments later Musk responded by claiming he was never shown the actual bill and that it passed in the dead of night he also launched a poll asking if it was time to create a new party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle musk also exclaimed that without his support President Donald Trump wouldn't have even won the election without me Trump would have lost the election democrats would control the House and the Republicans would be 51 to 49 in the Senate president Trump then hit back on Truth Social saying that Elon Musk has gone crazy and that the easiest way to save money in the budget was to end the billionaire's government subsidies and contracts he further added that he was surprised that former President Joe Biden didn't do it and Musk called the president's remarks quote unquote an obvious lie and without proof said that the president was referenced in government documents on disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein he even went a step further and warned that the tariffs introduced by the president would cause a recession in the second half of the year the president then responded saying he wasn't bothered by Musk's turn but wished it had happened months earlier he reiterated that the big beautiful bill was one of the greatest ever presented to Congress meanwhile Musk whose space business is vital to US government missions said he would begin decommissioning Space X's Dragon spacecraft but then backed off the public feud even shook markets with Tesla's stock dropping over 14% on Thursday losing around $150 billion in market value its largest single day decline ever the spat also prompted reactions from other billionaires politicians artists and even industry experts with some calling for the two to reconcile steve Bannon a former top aid of President Donald Trump publicly urged the president to investigate Elon Musk's immigration status they should initiate a formal investigation of his immigration status because I am of the strong belief that he is an illegal alien and he should be deported from the country immediately with government contracts and political alliances now hanging in the balance the high-profile falling out could have wide ranging implications beyond the political field and staying with our lead story like I mentioned after a fullthroated war of words Donald Trump and Elon Musk once tighter than a Tesla charging cable seemed to be officially done with each other and the great tradition of political power couples gone rogue America's most unexpected bromance has hit the skids in less than a year but why from launching rockets to launching insults our next report tells you how their whirlwind partnership went from MAGA to messy grab your popcorn folks this isn't a policy update it's a political breakup of epic proportions ladies and gentlemen we regret to inform you that Daddy Trump and Daddy Musk are getting a divorce and no it's not amicable in a spectacle that could only happen in America President Donald Trump and space emperor Elon Musk have gone from bros to bitter foes in less than a year's time here's how their relationship went south it was at first a truth social post elon Musk who once claimed Trump lacked the character to run a lemonade stand let alone the country was soon smitten after a near deadly assassination attempt turned Trump into a political phoenix his name is Elon Musk he saved Musk leapt onto Trump's presidential campaign trail dubbed himself first buddy take over Elon yes take over and in return Trump gifted him the glamorous title of the head of government efficiency a role that sounds made up because it kind of was together they wowed to drain the swamp slash the budget and maybe launch a Tesla from the White House lawn if I Musk was spotted more often at Mara Lago and hung out on presidential phone calls trump and Musk became the ultimate power duo musk wasn't just a guest star in Trump's political reality show he had a recurring role as the head of the newly created Doge where he wielded a digital ads to slash federal budgets ruffle agency feather together they attended campaign rallies hosted Tesla expose on the White House lawn and even let Musk's son X wander around the resolute desk like it was daycare which is the bureaucracy musk advised on cabinet staffing weighed in on policy and was even part of high level calls with world leaders if that's not commitment what is but like all passionate flings reality soon crushed their honeymoon even romances have budget limits as DOA's aggressive cost cutting sparked lawsuits cabinet eye rules whispers grew louder that Trump wasn't keen on giving Musk an extension beyond his 130day tenure i give it to Musk made a gratefulish exit giving a farewell speech promising to remain Trump's unofficial adviser but the second Musk stepped out of the White House gates the gloves came off he started torching Trump's prized one big beautiful bill act on X calling it a poke stopped fiscal nightmare things escalated faster than a Tesla in ludicrous mode trump hit back on truth social claiming he fired Musk ripped away his precious EV mandate and that Musk had gone crazy a Bruce Musk clapped back with his post that read like breakup texts without me Trump would have lost this bill is garbage he posted on X from blood spattered rally videos to matching MAGA hats their romance had it all until it didn't within days the romance had melted down in real time and just like that it crumbled under the weight of bloated bills and bigger egos now they're back where they started trump yelling on Truth Social Musk Rage posting on X and the rest of us wondering how two of the richest and most powerful men on earth couldn't keep their political fling alive for even a year in the end the Trump Musk bromance was less house of cards and more the real housewives of the White House passionate chaotic and destined to explode america you've been through enough if either one of them rebounds with Jeff Pessos we object we now move to deportation drama in a bizarre and high-risk immigration twist three US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have been stranded in Djibouti alongside eight dangerous criminal migrants their unplanned layover follows a court order that barred the deportation of the convicts to South Sudan leaving both officers and detainees marooned under dangerous and deteriorating conditions according to the exclusive report by the New York Post the ICE officers and migrants are being housed in a conx shipping container on Camp Lemonair a US naval base in the East African country of Djibouti the base however sits in the line of fire with within range of rocket attacks launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen just across the Red Sea in fact Pentagon officials alerted ICE to the threat upon the team's arrival the conference room in which the aliens are housed is not equipped nor suitable for detention of any length let alone for the detention of high-risk individuals notably the room has none of the security apparatus necessary for the detention of criminal aliens if an altercation were to occur there is no other location on site available to separate the aliens which further compromises the officer's safety now the eight men in custody have been convicted of heinous crimes ranging from murder to sexual assault of minors armed robbery arson and gang related shootings yet due to a May 22nd ruling by the US District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston their removal was halted midair judge argued that the Trump administration had violated a March order prohibiting deportations to countries that were not the migrants native homelands insisting that each detainee must be given notice and opportunity to object uh recent recent months have seen you know South Sudan itself descend into a state of further you know escalation and conflict and and people in this region will not expect that the United States would actually be sending uh potential aliens that they uh deem to be unfit to stay in the United States to South Sudan this is may constitute actually a violation of international humanitarian law now only one of the eight alleged criminals is originally from South Sudan the rest hail from Cuba Laos Mexico Myanmar and Vietnam and according to the Department of Homeland Security all eight had final removal orders or the alleged criminals did not contest their deportation the ICE officers lack body armor or other gear that would be appropriate in the case of an attack meanwhile the ICE officers assigned to guard them are operating under extreme physical and environmental stress there are they are the only personnel authorized to escort the detainees to the bathroom and carry out patowns forcing a strict and exhausting rotation schedule in fact the team was not issued antimmalaria medication until more than 2 days after arriving in Djibouti leading to some to fall ill within 72 hours and burn pits in the area which are used by locals to dispose of waste have only added to the health risk through toxic smog exposure it is outrageous that this judge is putting the health and safety of law enforcement officers at risk for the sake of criminals now even though a solicitor general has filed an emergency appeal to the US Supreme Court seeking to overturn Judge Murphy's decision the ICE officers continue to remain stranded in a war zone adjacent camp surrounded by criminals with nowhere to go awaiting legal decisions that could take weeks hence this case is a stark reminder that sometimes justice and logistics collide in ways no one anticipates and now moving to New York where Bollywood meets ballots in a high stakes mayoral race zoran Mandini Mandani a Democratic candidate and current New York State Assemblyman is making waves with a campaign that's anything but ordinary with just two days left before the June 24 Democratic primary Mamani has rolled out a Hindi language campaign video inspired by classic Bollywood films aimed at energizing South Asian voters and standing out in a crowded field led by former Governor Andrew Cuomo the over two-minute video opens with Mamani speaking directly to viewers in Hindi saying quote &quot;This election is just 20 days away and the choice is between me and Andrew Cuomo this is all that Andrew Cuomo has to offer.&quot; End quote then immediately after the screen cuts to an iconic moment from a 1975 Bollywood super hit the war where a character lists off his wealth but before asking &quot;What do you have?&quot; Manny answers back with a conviction I have the people in fact in another creative moment he explains New York's rank choice voting uses five glasses of mut of buttermilk this one is me,&quot; he says pointing to a glass and then goes on to explain that when the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated the votes then move to the next choice until someone reaches 51% his message is clear vote for him and don't rank Andrew Cuomo at all in his Bollywood inspired pitch Mam Donnie also accuses Cuomo of accepting campaign money from Trump donors warning that if he wins not only will they control DC they will control NYC too now it's not just his pitch but even Mam Donniey's campaign promises are bold he's pushing a rent freeze free public transportation universal child care and affordable groceries he also highlights his grassroots momentum sharing that over $8 million have been raised and more than 600,000 doors have been knocked in the coming 20 days Mani could become the first Muslim and South Asian mayor in New York City's history in fact Congresswoman Alexandra Okaziocortez has endorsed him as her top choice for mayor a first generation Indian Ugandan American Mum Dani became a US citizen after 2016 during President Donald Trump's first presidency in 2019 he passionately supported Bernie Sanders campaign saying he was proud to finally vote in a US presidential election meanwhile Como who resigned in 2021 following a scandal is seeking a comeback his campaign is centered on improving city operations addressing mental health issues and combating anti-semitism in fact in a recent debate Mum Donnie called himself Donald Trump's worst nightmare to which Cuomo hit back saying and I quote &quot;Donald Trump will go through Manny like a hot knife through butter.&quot; End quote with New York streets buzzing with anticipation in the polls just days away one question looms large will voters choose a political comeback or a cinematic revolution we end the week on Tinder move over short king spring because summer just got a hot growth spurt tender is now letting users set hype preferences and yes the internet is losing its collective mind from cries of heightism to cause for a weight filter love in the digital age has never been so vertically selective as Tinder tests a height filter short kings are fuming tall folks are cruising and everyone else is just trying to swipe without a measuring tape here's more spring when flowers bloom allergies flare and the internet temporarily agrees that short men deserve love too but as summer creeps in with its sweaty promises it seems short king spring is being unceremoniously benched all thanks to Tinder's latest innovation a height filter tinder the app that once brought you biogeems like Just Here for Tacos or 6'1 is now testing a feature that lets gold and premium members prioritize matches based on how tall or tragically not someone is and it's got the online world standing on its tiptoes either in rage or amusement according to Tinder this isn't a hard filter but more of a gentle suggestion for the algorithm a guidepost they say still this preference has ignited a digital brawl over heightism inequality and naturally whether a weight filter should also be a thing science has long confirmed that height plays a major role in dating dynamics women reportedly prefer partners about 8 in taller while men lean toward being about 3 in taller than their significant other in other words even in love the metric system is optional but judgment is not now while Tinder insists that this is all part of their rebrand to appeal to Gen Z who according to their CEO are not a hookup generation a claim that's still being investigated while critics say this move feels more Black Mirror than warm and intentional especially when you consider Hinge and Bumble who already have similar filters hidden behind a payw wall social media didn't hold back some users demanded equality in the form of age and weight filters others simply called out the absurdity of it all and supported men a few brave souls tried to be voices of reason or at least sarcasm one ex user commented that since it's hidden behind a payw wall short men are safe some even brought race into the picture and then there was some sarcasm too now the real question is why are we doing this while some say the filter is a timesaver others fear it will turn dating apps into even more of a beauty contest only now judged by centimeters critics argue this will deepen the already wellestablished divide between society's tall dark and handsome darlings and the perfectly lovable 5'6 in mortals just trying to find someone to split a pizza with as for Tinder they say it's all just a test part of their mission to build smarter and more intentional experiences because what screams intention like paying to avoid the vertically challenged so is this the end of romance for the short kings will height filtered love lead to a better dating experience or just some digital heartbreak one thing's for sure in the world of online love standing tall might just mean surviving another update and if all else fails there's always the dog filter that's our show for today we certainly thank all of you for tuning in we hope you have a great weekend and we look forward to seeing you right back here next week thanks so much everyone for tuning in first post now available in

          <attvalue for="7" value="our next story is about America specifically America's debt it stands at 36 trillion that's the debt 36 trillion that's what the US the US government owes 36 trillion it's a ticking time bomb and according to the IMF it is ticking louder than ever the IMF as you know is the International Monetary Fund it has issued a direct warning the US must get a grip on its everinccreasing debt those are the words of Gita Gopinat the deputy managing director of the IMF and her warning comes at a critical time for the United States just recently they suffered a downgrade ratings agency Moody's has downgraded American debt earlier the US had a credit rating of AAA that's the gold standard AAA now they've been downgraded to double A1 and the reasons are the same soaring government debt rising interest payments and government spending without any checks like I said before the US owes $36 trillion that number is rising fast and instead of hitting the brakes the US is pressing the accelerator president Donald Trump wants sweeping tax cuts he is pushing a new bill a bill that is more than 1,000 pages long it is called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that is the official name the One Big Beautiful Bill Act it's so Trump it proposes a wide range of cuts to income tax economists say that this would widen the deficit this bill would decrease government revenue substantially by as much as over $4 trillion this is projected over a period of 9 years and the markets have already reacted to this stocks have dropped so has the value of the US dollar dropped this was during early trading today in fact throughout this week the markets have been wobbly investors are nervous not because of wars not because of another pandemic but because of America's own balance sheet the rising debt is the biggest cause of concern it entails the growing cost of servicing that debt higher interest rates mean higher payments right now the US is borrowing money just to pay the interest needless to say this is not sustainable some experts say it's worse than it looks billionaire investor Ray Dalio paints a grim picture he was among the few who had warned about the crash in 2008 and now Ray Dalio is concerned about America's rising debt he says the credit ratings only tell one part of the story the real danger is the falling value of the dollar it had a rough start in 2025 and in the last 5 months the dollar's value has fallen by over 7% if this trend continues investors would suffer more losses particularly those who bought US government bonds their returns would shrink and the US is not the only one here across the board debt levels are rising back in April the IMF had raised red red flags about this as well it said global debt is heading for dangerous levels in fact the IMF expects public borrowing to jump further and if this trend continues listen to this if this continues the world's debt pile would be bigger than the world economy by 2030 that is worse than the pandemic far worse than the 2008 financial crisis so the IMF wants countries to focus on reforms and reduce debt we want to see countries acting decisively on reforms so they they you know you you don't borrow your way out of debt you grow your way out of that so when countries have that growth potential uh enhanced then they can also reduce that vulnerability so which countries are vulnerable there's the US of course its debt levels stand at 123% of its GDP but some countries are doing worse than the US japan is at a whopping 235% of its GDP that is the debt level 235% of their GDP singapore 175% of the GDP greece 142% bahrain 141% and Italy's debt stands at 137% of its GDP so Japan's debt levels as a percentage of their GDP are far worse than the United States but there's a basic difference the US issues the world's reserve currency the dollar when the dollar weakens the world feels the impact a weak dollar means higher prices higher risk for global markets and less confidence for US in the US leadership the consequences are not theoretical they're already showing with ratings downgrades market volatility and growing global unease but the world's largest economy is not addressing any of these challenges it seems to be living in denial and right now it is adding fuel to a debt bomb a bomb that no one is trying to diffuse at first post we are choosing to hold on to accuracy that means we won't always be first we may not get you your breaking alert but what you will get is what we owe you and that is the truth verified checked and cross-cheed we rely on sources and verified ones after all that's what separates a journalist from a loudspeaker but sometimes even we miss a beat and when we do we will tell you like yesterday we ran visuals from a registered news agency that visual turned out to be fake so we are taking accountability and from now on we will cite the source of every visual every picture every video that you see on first post will have a source mentioned that is our commitment to you we will wait we will verify we will ask again and only then will we tell you no noise no panic just the facts because right now that is what the country needs most" />

and welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around the world China is facing criticism in Europe after China's ambassador to France questioned the sovereignty of former Soviet States under international law during a television interview the Baltic countries Lithuania Latvia Estonia condemned the remarks and summoned Chinese envoys to explain beijing's official position the Chinese foreign Ministry walked back the ambassador's comment saying quote China respects all countries sovereignty Independence and territorial integrity The Diplomatic spat comes as China is making headlines across the globe though maybe not so much in the United States for its diplomatic efforts in late February China released a 12 point peace plan to end the war in Ukraine on March 10th Iran and Saudi Arabia announced they would restore ties as part of an agreement brokered by China days later in mid-march Chinese president Xi Jinping hosted the Brazilian present Luis inacio Lula de Silva to talk about Ukraine trade and moving away from the U.S dollar Xi Jinping then met with French president Emmanuel McCall in Beijing during macomb's visit she spoke about the roles of China and France in world affairs the world today is undergoing profound historic changes as permanent members of the U.N security Council and major countries with the tradition of Independence China and France as promoters of the multi-polarization of the world and the democratization of international relations have the ability and responsibility to transcend differences adhere to the comprehensive strategic Cooperative Partnerships between China reciprocity development and progress practice true multilateralism and maintain World Peace stability and prosperity while in Beijing the French President Emmanuel macron suggested France and European nations should not become a vassal of the United States when it comes to Taiwan France supports the single China policy and the search for peaceful solution to the situation for that matter it's Europe's position it's a position so it has always been compatible with the role of an ally but it's precisely why I'm stressing the important of strategic autonomy Ally doesn't mean being a vassal um it's not because we do things together that we can't think alone that we're going to follow the people in that are the toughest in a country that's allied with us when we look at the facts France has lessons to be received from no one be either in Ukraine and saw hell or in Taiwan China's continued its diplomatic Outreach by offering last week to hold talks between Israel and Palestine to look more at China's recent diplomatic actions we're joined by Jeffrey Sachs director of the center for sustainable development at Columbia University and president of the UN sustainable development Solutions Network he's also served as advisor to three U.N secretaries General and currently serves as a sustainable development Solutions Advocate under Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez his latest article published is headline the need for a new U.S foreign policy Professor Sachs thanks so much for being with us all of the Diplomatic gestures of China you know the meeting with macron in Beijing with Lula in Beijing brokering this deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia now offering not only to negotiate between Ukraine and Russia but Israel and Palestine this hardly gets attention in the United States India but around the world the headlines are far more there are far more headlines about this talk about the significance of this and you if you see a direct parallel between all the Headway that China is making and increasing U.S hostility towards China thanks Amy very good to be with you and indeed this is a a crucial topic and as president Xi Jinping said in that meeting with macron this is a it is a historic Watershed that the world is living through right now uh what China is after if we view it from China's perspective is what was also said true multilateralism and what that means are true multi-polarity another term that they use and that means they don't want a U.S led World they want a multi-polar world and the basis of that is that the United States is 4.1 percent of the world population China is 17.5 of the world population China's economy is comparable to the U.S economy and indeed China is the lead trade partner for much of the world so China is saying we're there to alongside you we want a multi-polar world we don't want a U.S led world and while the United States sometimes talks about a rule-based order the fact of the matter is that the U.S Grand strategy if we can use that term of the grand strategists of the U.S state see our grand strategy in the United States as being dominance and I often refer to a an article that I think is very clear uh succinct and revealing by a former colleague of mine at Harvard University Robert Blackwell and esteemed ambassador of the United States who wrote in 2015 and I'll quote from the article since its founding the United States has consistently pursued a grand strategy focused on acquiring and maintaining preeminent power over various Rivals first on the North American continent then in the Western Hemisphere and finally globally well China doesn't want the United States to be the preeminent power it wants to live alongside the United States Blackwell writing in 2015 uh said China's rise is a threat to U.S preeminence and he laid out a series of steps that the Biden Administration actually is following almost step by step what Blackwell laid out already back in 2015 is that the United States should create quote new preferential trading Arrangements among U.S friends and allies to increase their Mutual gains through instruments that consciously exclude China there should be a technology control regime to block China's strategic capabilities a buildup of quote power political capacities of U.S friends and allies on China's periphery and strengthen U.S military forces along the Asian rimland despite any Chinese opposition this has become the Biden foreign policy China knows it China really is pushing back but what's very important and interesting to understand and we've seen it clearly in the Dynamics involving the Ukraine war most of the world also does not want the U.S as the as the the global preeminent power most of the world wants a multi-polar world and does is therefore not lined up behind the United States sanctions on Russia and so forth and this was also the message of President Lula visiting China saying to president XI ji ping we as Brazil also want multi-polarity true multi-polarity and we want peace for example in the Russian Ukraine war that is based on not a U.S perception of dominance say nato enlargement but rather a piece that reflects a multi-polar world this is real it's happening all over the world and the the fact of the matter is the reason why this is a historic Watershed is that the underlying economics and technological change have made it so the the U.S is no longer the dominant World economy and the G7 which is the U.S Canada Britain France Italy Germany and Japan is actually smaller than the brics countries in economic size which is Brazil Russia India China and South Africa so we really are in fact in a multi-polar world but in ideology we're we're in a conflict uh Jeffrey Sachs I wanted to ask about that uh you mentioned the bricks of the the uh the the brics bank that is now in China uh and the president Lula has named Wilma Rousseff as the as the head of the Brinks back its importance in terms of this multi uh multi-polarity of in the world economies the the the potential for even the creation of alternative uh of major currencies to the dollar as a result of the brics alliance the impact of that uh on uh world affairs this is a big deal and in fact the United States is withdrawing it doesn't know it necessarily our politicians don't understand this but our politicians are withdrawing from the world financial and monetary scene and opening up the space for a completely different kind of Interest international finance I'll give you an example the the U.S was the creator of the World Bank but now the U.S Congress won't put new money into the World Bank and because of that the world bank's actually a quite small institution's got a big name but it's a quite small institution in the financial scheme of things the U.S won't put more money in the Congress says no why should we waste our money internationally and so forth and we get a lot of hubbub about that so China and the rest of the brics say okay we'll make our own Development Bank and they establish the new development bank or sometimes called the brics bank based in Shanghai and that's just one of the institutions that is really changing the scene there's the Asia infrastructure Investment Bank aiib based in Beijing in fact there is as president Lula uh said and it's happening also in the context of the Ukraine war a move away from the use of the dollar which the United States has thought well that's that's our race in the whole you know that is our ultimate hold on things because we can use sanctions we can use our financial control to keep other countries in line but other countries are saying not so much will trade in Redmond B we'll trade in Rubles we'll trade in rupees we'll we'll trade in our own National currencies and they're quickly setting up alternative institutions to do this the United States doubles down we will confiscate your reserves we will if you don't follow and the other countries are saying you know if you want to go through the UN and get really multilateral rules or with you but but if you want uh to just impose the rules we won't follow along and so we have this very funny expression called a rule-based international order the United States government uses it every day but what does it mean who writes the rules and what most of the world wants in fact is rules written in a multi-polar or multilateral setting not rules written by the United States and a few friends and allies I wanted to ask you uh you've been an advisor to uh to the United Nations for uh quite often the issue of how much longer the permanent members of the security Council can keep the number to five because clearly Brazil and other countries of the global South have been saying the U.N needs to be reformed and countries from Latin America specifically Brazil and Africa should have representation on the U.N security Council permanent members yes you know the P5 the permanent five which is the United States China Russia France and the United Kingdom was the World War II Victor group in 1945. they wrote Into the rules of the UN incidentally that they would be the permanent Security Council Members and have a veto over any change in the U.N Charter so it's it's really a group that gave itself uh power that the other 188 countries of the world look on and say what is this we need change I I would say the country that is most amazed and frustrated by this in fact is India India is now the most populous country in the world the United States has 335 million roughly in the population uh Britain France uh roughly 60 million India 1.4 billion not on the security Council a nuclear power a world superpower the president of the G20 this year really not happy about that uh Brazil the large largest economy of South America similarly uh not on the security Council so this has been an issue for more than 20 years the P5 in various ways have blocked uh particular countries but added up the P5 have said you know what this is our club we want to stay as the permanent five but I think as we really face the reality of a it's not just a post-us dominated world but actually a post-western dominated world because it was the U.S as the dominant power among the so-called West which means the U.S Britain European Union uh and honorary Western membership Japan let's say but we're post-western as well as post-us indominance and these International institutions will need to change or they won't function in the 21st century and if they don't function it's actually a disaster for us if they didn't exist we'd have to make them because we need them to function so we also need to renovate them I wanted to talk about China negotiating these various agreements um let's turn to Brazil's president Luis enacio Lula de Silva speaking before his meeting with Chinese president Xi Jinping what does Putin want Putin can't keep Ukraine's territory maybe we don't even discuss Crimea but he will have to rethink what he has invaded also zielinski can't have everything he wants to demand NATO will not be able to set itself up at the border so this is something we have to put on a table foreign I think this war has dragged on for too long Brazil has already criticized what it had to criticize Brazil defends each nation's territorial Integrity so we disagree with Russia's invasion of Ukraine because it looks like um Ukraine is on the verge of a major counter-offensive against Russia and in order to do this needs massive support from Western countries meaning military weapons can you talk about what China's role is here the peace plan it has put forward but also these other deals that China is helping to negotiate like the success the successful rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran and then with their uh what they're suggesting about Israel and Palestine president Lula uttered in a few words the core of this issue that our most of our media dare not explain to the American people and that is the expansion of NATO this is a war fundamentally about the U.S attempt to expand a U.S military Alliance to Ukraine and to Georgia Georgia's a country in the caucuses also on the Black Sea the U.S strategy going back decades has been to surround Russia in the Black Sea with Ukraine Romania Bulgaria turkey and Georgia all NATO members surrounding Russia and its naval fleet in the Black Sea with a naval fleet that has been the Black Sea naval fleet of Russia since 1783. Russia has said this is our red line and it has said that for decades and it said this clearly in 2007 before George W Bush Jr had the I'll call it the harebrained idea to announce in 2008 and force NATO to announce that Ukraine will be a member of NATO and this is what president Lula was saying and what president what president XI ji ping of China has been saying we can't have a war that is essentially a proxy war between Russia and the United States over the expansion of the U.S military Alliance right up to a 1200 kilometer and more border with Russia which Russia views and I would say understandably views as a fundamental national security threat to Russia keep some space keep some distance that's president Lula's meaning that's what China means when it says in its peace plan we want a peace plan that respects the security interests of all parties what that is is code word for saying make peace end the war but don't expand NATO right up to the border the American people have not heard an explanation of this all along it's shocking to me because as a close Observer of this for 30 years this has been the Casas bellai and yet our newspapers won't even report the background to this but this is why China South Africa India Brazil are saying we want peace but we don't want NATO expansion as the meaning of so-called peace we want the big superpowers to give each other some space and some distance so that the world isn't on a knife edge that's exactly what president Lula was saying and it's exactly what the meaning of the Chinese peace initiative is is to say yes absolutely make peace protect Ukraine's sovereignty and its security but no to Nato expansion but the Biden Administration won't even discuss this issue that has been the major failing and the reason why we have not been able to get to the negotiating table in my opinion even when zielinski said in March 2022 maybe not NATO maybe something else Russia and Ukraine were close to an agreement and the United States into being with Ukraine and said we don't think that's a good agreement because the U.S neocon so-called have been pushing for NATO enlargement as the core of this issue but this goes back to the more General point for us which is that what is at stake in Ukraine and over Taiwan and many other issues from the point of view of China or Russia or other countries including Brazil now Saudi Arabia Iran and others is whether the U.S does what it wants to do or whether the U.S respects some limits based on what other countries say well this is what we think so that we need true multi-polarity not U.S dominance alone rules written by all of us not rules written just by the United States and Jeff sacks we only have a few uh about a minute left but I was wondering if you could comment on the the parallels between this expansion of NATO further and further uh East in Europe uh this year marks the 200th anniversary of the Monroe Doctrine of President Monroe declaring to all the European powers that the Western Hemisphere was off limits to them coming to attempting to move their forces and their militaries into Latin America and for these past 200 years Latin America has essentially been uh the major sphere of influence of the United States uh and yet here we are saying that Russia has no right to declare that it's immediate uh the countries in on immediately its borders uh cannot uh cannot uh welcome in uh NATO troops well yes a little empathy would go a long way would have spared us actually a lot of Wars but for Americans it would be useful to think suppose Mexico made a military alliance with China with the United States say well that's Mexico's right what are we going to do about it or might there be actually an invasion in short order or something like that I would strongly advise to China and Mexico don't try it at home don't experiment with this but the United States government refuses that empathy because in other words refuses to put itself in the position of the other side that's the fundamental arrogance of thinking that you determine the rules of the world the problem with arrogance is not only the comeuppance from it but you can't you stumble into terrible crises that you don't even understand because the United States has not been allowed the public has not been allowed to even think from the perspective of the other side so the analogy is is actually a very very clear analogy it is what China and Russia and others say all the time is why have those double standards why don't we actually deal with each other with mutual respect not with the rules that you write we want to thank you Jeffrey Sachs for joining us director of the center for sustainable development at Columbia University president of the UN sustainable development Solutions Network we'll link to your new article the need for a new U.S foreign policy uh Professor Sachs was speaking to us from Cordova Spain" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] the year was 1947 the British had packed up they left behind two independent nations in South Asia India and Pakistan both had to start from scratch new forms of government a new constitution a new leadership everything had to be created back then both Nations had the same goal to become a democracy but only one succeeded Pakistan's democracy remained a work in progress many would say it's beyond saving now no prime minister has ever completed their term in Pakistan none yet three generals have ruled for more than 8 years what does that tell you stability is possible just not for civilians tonight we'll tell you why why has Pakistan's democracy failed is there any way to salvage it time for a [Music] flashback think of democracy as a house and what does every house need a very strong Foundation that's where Pakistan missed the trick after partition they adopted an interim Constitution it was based on the 1935 government of India act a colonial law the actual Constitution was in the works Pakistan's Parliament got down to draft ing it but soon problems emerged one draft was submitted in 1950 by lakat Ali Khan he was Pakistan's first prime minister this draft had two main points equal representation for East and West Pakistan and Udu estate language both were non-starters in the East they had more population than the West so why should representation be equal and Udu was an even bigger no people in the East spoke Bengali for them Udu was not acceptable as state language so the first draft was rejected the second one was proposed in 1952 this draft called for two houses of Parliament but the rest remained the same so once again it was shut down then came a third draft in 1953 it was called the bogra formula this draft allowed seats based on population so East Pakistan would get 165 seats the West would get 135 seems fair right but this draft was not approved either because Pakistan 's politics was in turmoil by then in 1954 elections were held in East Pakistan the Muslim League Muhammad Ali jinna's party was routed their chief minister lost his seat so did every single minister so the Constitution was shelved again it took two more years to draft one finally Pakistan's first constitution was adopted in February 1956 it was enforced the next month now look at the Gap Gap Pakistan was formed in 1947 but the Constitution came in 1956 that's a gap of 9 years India's rule book was drafted in just under 3 years and remember India's Constitution is the longest ever so Pakistan Mr a trick there their leaders simply couldn't agree on most things what would be the state language how would seats be divided what rights would minorities get what form of Islam would be the state religion all these question questions remain unanswered and there's a reason why leadership vacuum Muhammad Ali jna was the founder of Pakistan the idea was to create a country based on his vision but jinna died in 1948 a few years later lakat Ali Khan was assassinated so Pakistan became rudderless and the same goes for their party the Muslim League it couldn't play the role of a Nation Builder most Independence parties do that like the Indian National Congress in India or the African National Congress in South Africa first they LED Freedom movements then they transformed into political parties the Muslim League could not do that especially in East Pakistan it was very different from the Western Wing different geography more people different culture different aspirations so Pakistan's democracy was set up to fail maybe better leadership could have contained these differences but that was never Pakistan's strength either way in 1956 the Constitution finally came The Next Step was a general election until then only provincial and indirect elections were held no Nationwide general election had been organized even the Constitution could not change that though in 1958 Pakistan's president took matters into his hands that's isander mza first he abrogated the Constitution then he declared martial law enter General Ayub Khan Pakistan's Army Chief back then during martial law he took charge he became the president of Pakistan Ayub Khan would rule until the late 1960s again no general elections it was a military dictatorship so why did he give up power well in 1965 he fought a war with India he tried to take the whole of Kashmir but Ayub Khan lost plus young pakistanis were growing agitated they were fed up with military rule so in 1969 he resigned and the next year came general elections Pakistan's first since Independence look at how long it took 23 years to hold the first Nationwide general election by then India had completed four the 1970 polls came with a surprise in West Pakistan the Pakistan People's Party won its leader was zulfikar Ali BTO he was allied with the Army but in the East it was awami League all the way they had the numbers to form the government not just in the East but for the whole country they had the numbers but BTO and the Army had other plans I'm sure you know what happened next Pakistan's Army tried to crush descent in the East India intervened and Bangladesh was born so the Pakistan Army was beaten and shamed it was the perfect chance for BTO he could have taken the country in a different direction built a strong culture of Civilian rule but he did not in 1977 elections were held again bto's PPP on one side a coalition of nine parties on the other the PPP swept the election but the opposition cried foul they protested they said the voting was rigged so BTO went to the Army and he declared martial law got opposition leaders arrested and once again gave the Pakistan Army an inn big mistake because in 1977 the same Army staged another coup and two years later buo was tried and executed what happened in the' 70s was a repeat of the 50s civilian leaders had the perfect chance but they failed and their failure allowed the Army to capitalize back to our story now the new dictator in Pakistan was General zul hak he ruled until his death in 1988 after that more elections followed this time the Army had a different role that of an orchestrator the generals would stay behind the scenes but their picks would win the election that's how Naas Sharif first came to power and since then we've seen one more CP when perves bhar ousted Sharif after that it's been back to orchestrate a mode and this short history tells you why Pakistan's democracy failed you can divide it into three reasons one the weak Foundation most democracies function because of rules and traditions and for that you need a constitution Pakistan was late in getting there reason number two the source of power think about how most leaders win elections by building a support Base by appealing to the public but Pakistan's leaders never tried that they found an easier source of power and that was the Pakistan Army so one military coup led to another and finally reason number three the nature of the society even today Pakistan is a feudal country the source of power is based in one Province Punjab Punjab makes up 54% of the national income employs 61% of all pakistanis and is home to 53% of the total population so if you win Punjab you win Pakistan of course this makes other provinces feel bad these are not excuses for Pakistan's politicians they must take the blame for this failure because democracy is like a good habit like being punctual or exercising every day no one is born with those habits they are developed through time and effort democracy is like that for countries you need to keep investing in it and with time it will become a habit but Pakistan's leaders never tried to cultivate this habit what's worse they got the country hooked on some bad ones [Music] what" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="people on the streets of European cities simply holding a Palestinian flag could be arrested i didn't believe we'd ever reach this degree of paranoia about simply standing up for the rights of Palestinian people joining center stage today is Jeremy Corbin one of the most polarizing figures in modern British politics throughout his political career from being on the political fringe to his tenure as leader of the UK's Labor Party and now as an independent MP Corbin has always campaigned for economic justice peace and a British foreign policy that tries to atone for its imperial legacy in this episode we discuss the price paid for being vocal in supporting and standing in solidarity with Palestine while Corbin also speaks about the future of Europe and how the continent may need to unite in the face of a US-led trade war jeremy Corbin welcome to Center Stage absolute pleasure to be here thank you for inviting me you've been an advocate for Palestinian statethood for decades what would you say the past 18 months have meant for that fight i think the past 18 months has been probably the worst time ever ever for Palestinian people and the loss of life in Gaza and increasingly in the West Bank and not forgetting the plight of people in the refugee camps has just been truly atrocious what it has done is awoken the rest of the world to the plight of Palestinian people so in a perverse kind of way it's probably meant that uh Palestinian recognition more universally is probably nearer now than it was but that's on the back of uh at least 60,000 deaths and the blockade of Gaza now gone on for over 50 days no water no food no power no medicines nothing for 50 days and so I find an element in my mind of disgust at the way in which the world's powers including Britain have continued supplying weapons to Israel knowing full well that they're in breach of international law and bombing civilian targets in Gaza you mention the position of the British government you've been demanding an inquiry into what you describe as complicity what would that inquiry achieve what would that investigation reveal would it bring justice the reason I put it forward is is this i was very involved in opposition to the Iraq war and we believed all along that the war was a illegal and based on utterly false information the allegations that Iraq for example held weapons of mass destruction and at the end of the conflict or we demanded a public inquiry and that inquiry took a long time and came out with a huge document which indicated deficiencies in the decision-making process false information and the inadequate legal advice and so what I've de demanded is now an inquiry into the British government's policy in relation to the supply of arms to Israel and diplomatic support they've given to Israel the reason I've done that is that um we've seen the case that South Africa took to the International Court of Justice and uh that court gave its opinion that acts of a genocidal nature are taking place the International Criminal Court followed that up with arrest warrants including three arrest arrest warrants but one particularly for Benjamin Netanyahu and yet throughout all this Britain continued supplying some arms to uh Israel um David Lami eventually said they were going to suspend some of the arms licenses 30 out of the 300 that Britain had at the time we still don't know what those licenses really are weapons were still being supplied and the Royal Air Force Base in Cyprus Acretier is also being used as a staging point and we also are aware that 15% of the total number of components of every F-35 jet are made in Britain they couldn't fly without the British parts they're still being supplied and um the government's response is that uh they abide by international humanitarian law but they can't upset the global supply chain of the F-35 because they don't know which parts go to which country i'm sorry that's just utter nonsense it's just nonsense they know exactly where every single one of those parts goes those industries are very well organized and very careful on their recordeping um and so since there's been no answer I've then um written to the prime minister publicly um and I've got the support of a lot of members of parliament of almost all parties in signing this letter demanding an inquiry um so far interestingly there's been no formal response which is interesting it hasn't been rejected now I'm not predicting that's all going to go through straight away it's not it's building up the campaign we need to know the truth and the people of Britain need to know that their country is complicit in this your position with regards to Palestinian rights has also meant quite a lot of political very aggressive political backlash for you um would you say your position was ever misunderstood or or or distorted distorted and grievously misunderstood um I've been to Palestine on nine occasions i've been in all parts of Palestine i've been in Israel as well i've been in Jordan i've been in the refugee camps it's not as if I don't come to this position without some knowledge on the ground of it all the most disgraceful accusations were thrown at me that um uh I held anti-semitic views i absolutely do not i work with many Jewish organizations that are also appalled to what's going on in Palestine the issue is human rights and justice and a humanitarian approach to issues around the world and uh last year uh the Labour Party decided that I wasn't apparently a fit person to be a member of parliament any longer was that hurtful yeah i joined the Labour Party when I was 16 i spent my whole life in the Labor Party i've held every position there is to hold in the Labor Party from a street collector through to leader of the party and for them the new leadership to then less than a year later after I'd stepped down as leader do that to me um did you think of giving up altogether no never never why would I give up it's not about me personally it's about the arguments it's about the issues and it's about the principles and I feel what we did in uh my constituency in Islington North last July was to show that there are people who are prepared to listen to a voice for justice and humanity and um we won that election i'm very proud of that result i want to go back to to the backlash because being critical of Israeli government policy these days can have very serious sometimes devastating consequences for everyone for people people have lost their jobs they've lost visas they've lost their freedom did you ever think that you would come to that no I didn't um not in the slightest uh I did not believe we'd ever get to the situation where people on the streets of European cities holding a Palestinian flag or anywhere else in the world America for that matter simply holding a Palestinian flag which is a UN recognized entity should we say could be arrested i didn't believe we'd ever reach this degree of paranoia about simply standing up for the rights of Palestinian people and so I think it's important that we all speak out on it and the demonstrations around the world have shown that uh despite what some of the world's media do despite what mainly Western European North American governments do the majority of the world's population are with the Palestinian people and through the progressive international we have set up the H group um of UN member states there's um nine joined initially led by um Brazil South Africa Malaysia um to adhere to the rulings of the ICJ and the ICC and form a group within the UN to push for that but what's happened now with South Africa the United States putting extraordinary tariffs on South Africa very very critical of the South African government on everything but really it's because of their attitude towards Palestine but isn't it staggering that you have to go and form a group of countries within the UN to actually follow the courts decisions it's like what does that tell us about global order and and international law what it shows is that the um powerful particularly the United States but they're not alone in this really do not want or like international law the US has never signed up to the international criminal court and I don't think it ever will but what it shows is something very dangerous about the idea of international law i mean I I was born late 40s i grew up in that post-war consensus period where international law meant something where the United Nations was seen as the great hope and uh we now see the United Nations underfunded inadequate and lacking authority and power to actually deal with things so the UN has not managed to bring about a ceasefire in Gaza or the West Bank has not managed to bring about a ceasefire in Ukraine has not managed to yet to bring about an effective peace settlement in Yemen Congo or Sudan and so is it losing its credibility it's it's lack of power lack of ability is a real problem so there's two factors I think we need to look at here one is what is influencing those governments think of how much money has been made out of Palestine Ukraine Sudan Yemen Congo by global arms companies all of which are based in Western Europe or North America don't think there isn't an arms industry pressure also in China and Russia but that's of a different order compared to that of the USA so that's part of it the other side of it which gives me some hope is the numbers of people that have been involved in publicly going out and demonstrating their support for Palestine in Britain I estimate more than a million people at various times in the past 18 months have taken part in public activities and support of Palestine that's a lot of people for a country that doesn't have a tradition of mass demonstrations and as you said in in um in a in a dark way this particular onslaught of Gaza has made more people aware of what the Palestinians have been going through for the past 70 plus years not only for the past 18 months exactly too much of it is put in the narrative it all started in October 23 no it didn't it's been going on for a very long time in various forms sometimes more vicious than others but it has been going on but I think where a lot of the global media have missed out is on what's happening in the West Bank at the same time gaza does get through the bravery of journalists such as in your channel do does get coverage whereas the West Bank basically until recently is not and so there is clearly an Israeli strategy of um destroying the Palestinian villages on the West Bank increasing the power of the occupation forces and of the settlement policy the ICJ rulings were not just about genocide they were also about the illegality of the occupation at all you mentioned the United States what do you think the return of Donald Trump will mean for this crisis but also for the future of Palestinians well I don't think the result of the US election would make much difference either way camela Harris had um very very pro-Israeli views also and she and the Biden administration of which she was part had supplied enormous numbers of weapons but she wasn't talking about developing a sea resort in Gaza right i guess Trump takes it a stage further and announces that he wants to expel the entire population from Gaza shift them somewhere else now that's got a complete kickback but the US economic power over all of the neighboring states is absolutely huge particularly the money they put in to Egypt and other countries is so enormous so Trump's election has been disastrous for the Palestinian people that's for sure what about more broadly the return of Donald Trump to the White House has meant that every day there are either new tariffs or antagonistic statements about several issues europe is in a very difficult position do you think there could be I don't know an opportunity here for Europe to stand on its own or will it have to align with US interests i think we're going to look back on this period of 2025 in years to come as been a period of sort of unbelievable levels of absurdity when the president of the US goes into the rose garden reels off a whole list of tariffs he's going to put on to places and um announced that this is going to make America great again in reality a tariff policy will do what uh damage supply chains damage US manufacturing capability lead to inflation and probably a depression in the United States but it will also actually realign the world's economies in a way that he doesn't want and probably couldn't have predicted and so the BRICS nations Brazil Russia India China South Africa and uh those that have more recently joined will become more important and will become a global source of trading and will build their own currency as well so do you think it will backfire yeah so the backfire is going to be that US influence in the world be much less now the question about Europe economically Trump is not really very interested in relations with anybody else is only interested in um in the US in to some well to a great extent and that means that Europe has then got to think a bit more about its role it's going to have to build a trading relationship with the southern countries and with those countries particularly Canada and Mexico as well as the BRICS nations rather than depending everything on trade with the United States the response so far by the European Union has been beyond disappointing it's been devastating where Ursan Leiden now proposes that Europe become a defense superpower spends more and more money on weapons and manufacturing weapons for what is it to continue a war the cold war with more with Russia rather than searching for a way to end the Ukrainian conflict or is it about interventions in Africa where you think strategically 20 30 50 100 years time the continent with the most mineral resources is Africa and that is why the interests are increasingly moving into military interventions in Africa so I think we need to look at this as a sort of global point you have been very critical throughout your career also of British foreign policy especially in the Middle East would you say the UK has had the opportunity to reckon with its colonial past or has it been playing imperial games by other means there's something in the European psyche in which the principle of empire has never gone away i give you an example whenever there's a crisis somewhere in Africa or anywhere else in the world and the European Union starts thinking well how will we we react to this crisis what do they do but reach for the former colonial power so if something happens in Nishair in Sagal Mali so on France France must deal with that mhm if it's Nigeria the British can do that it's like the colonial mentality has never gone away and in Britain uh I think there is still a huge imperial mentality in the thought processes within foreign policy in the processes within the military and increasingly um ever since Johnson changed the strategy which had been adopted for 50 years of ending the global role of Britain militarily britain now seems to think that by spending so much on defense we can have a global role and so this thinking has led to the government in the past month announcing5 billion pounds cut in disability benefits in order to increase defense expenditure so that means we are impoverishing people with disabilities retaining a benefit cap on the poorest children in our society in order to pay for more bombs and weapons europe is becoming more and more instead of the prosperous equalitydriven continent it was intended to be is becoming more and more socially and economically divided as we spend more and more on weapons of war and uh that cannot be good for the future going back to the situation in the Middle East right now the Israeli government has insisted that you will fight until victory seeing the pictures of Gaza today the levels of destruction are staggering unprecedented what will victory look like and I remember a joyous visit to a school in Jabilia refugee camp some years ago before the intensity of the fighting has got worse i remember meeting the children in the school and talking to them about their lives they showed me their artwork they read me their poetry and it was lovely visit i spent quite a lot of time there then we went onto the roof of the school and from the roof of the school you can see the fence you can see the machine gun imp placements you can see where they can't go and to the north you can see Ashcolon however these children were getting the best education that ENRA could give them and um they were full of hope and full of optimism that school is rubble what happened to children i had no idea and um I've been to the universities in Gassa City and so on all of that is now destroyed so even if there was a complete end to the whole conflict tomorrow you've got basically a 2 million people with no homes to live in no water no sanitation and uh a mental health crisis and so the trauma will never ever go away and uh it does require that uh Israel withdraws it does require that a huge amount of money is provided to the Palestinian people to rebuild Gaza in their image not Donald Trump and golf courses and resorts and all this nonsense gaza was traditionally a very productive place it was the home of fresh fruit home of vegetables delightful strawberries farming projects they were doing really well in Gaza and they were trying to make Gaza self-sufficient in fresh fruit and vegetables and so all that is now just destroyed and deliberately done by Israel deliberately financed and sanctioned by the USA and Western Europe we're coming to the end of this interview and I want to ask you about a look back at your career we're coming up to 50 years of of public service if I'm not mistaken you're going to give people my age next aren't you no no no i won't i I'll stop here but but I did speak to one of your constituents and and she volunteered in your campaign last year and she told me this he said the main impact of the Corbin era was that the thought of real change didn't seem far away mainly due to the fact that the man that was supposed to change everything for us was one of us and the whole movement was focused on the collective is that how you want people history to remember you i spent my life um obviously politically active and active in trade unions but also active in trying to ensure that people don't get forgotten and left behind but there are a huge number of people all over Western Europe that are looking for an alternative which is of peace which is of social justice which is of environmental sustainability which isn't the politics of condemning people all the time it's the politics of trying to include and inspire people and so um new political organizations are growing up all across Europe the future is in our hands it doesn't have to be run by the minority of global corporations it doesn't have to be run by the arms trade technology doesn't have to be our enemy it can be something that gives us opportunity and empowerment but above all why should we be destroying this planet condemning so many people to a life of the most desperate poverty and at the same time spending last year $2.4 trillion dollar on weapons of destruction all around the world come on guys we can do it differently and do it better that's my life's work and it's not stopped chair McCorbin

going to feed me for 2 days hammock the medical kit Compass fire box I don't go outside I'm like guys you guys should prepare you should I don't want to be that guy you know the weirdo preacher staying on the street corner fire pouch is not needed as well torch duct tape I don't want to be that dude I just like I told you so my wilderness belt might go to life when something does finally happen when it does collapse they're on their own a fire kit flick small handy personal [Music] s love with a crookie world and everything that comes with it I love when you they it won't you I once believe but I took it all myself with none of it I love when you take it so I got an emergency preparedness because I read a book uh 1 second after and in the book all hell broke loose because of an EMP attack so that's a electromagnetic pulse that detonates in the Earth's atmosphere and creates a blackout there was part in a book where the hero he realizes that he wish he would have gotten prepared more and I'm like well I don't want that to be me so I started preparing I am a retired New York City fireman I run a group here in New York City called The NYC Preppers Network it's City Preppers the disruptive event that could be happening guys I don't think every time Putin opens his mouth I get an influx of people joining and then nothing happens for a while and people drop out anyway guys this is the angry prer thank you for watching the biggest misconception is that we're all crazy or rather that we're all waiting for the apocalypse right and so clearly the apocalypse the end of the world whatever you want to call it if that does happen it doesn't matter how much prepping you do or how prepared you are for the situation it's the end of the world uh we're just ready for basic things like uh earthquakes tornadoes things of that nature maybe Financial collapse has any of these things happened yeah earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes bad winter storms the idea of the group is to get people reliant on themselves and not coming downstairs and stand on the line for water or food like we saw in Sandy and Irene so you don't want to be that person though everything was was in order imagine chaos and you have to wait online for an m box you are definitely undoubtedly going to get mugged before you get back home listen there are people who St started preparing because they thought the Walking Dead was going to happen you know one side of me says well if they got prepared because the a TV show good for them as long as they grew up I Was preparing for an EMP attack now I'm prepared for all of it right with the exception again for media decides of Texas smashing into us there's no preparing for that right uh maybe spiritually but not you know not supply wise my major concern is another depression that is going to to make the 1929 depression look like a walk in the park only 50 of them I guess joined the program I have a YouTube channel the angry preer it's not like I'm yelling at the people in the group like get it together you bag it's not like I'm doing that the angry prepper just came from a guy in a firehouse actually cuz he calls me angry and I couldn't use the black prepper cuz it was too on the nose and the chocolate prepper me and wife laughed at it the angry prepper just made sense I mean am I really angry probably there's a million things you could be angry about I mean listen nine times out of 10 I'm not I'm not walking around [Music] [Music] stewing the downside to being a prepper is especially people who have family who you know make fun of them but in the back of their head they're like well man if this does fall apart we know Jim has enough food to support us then you go over to Jim's Place when it collapses and Jim's like kick rocks you guys thought this was funny now it's not and Jim's going to tell you I only have enough food for 3 years for my family now if Jim's a good guy he's going to let them in and he's going to adapt accordingly Jim's he's going to sit there and tell him beat it a lot of us will help even though it's against our better interest Community is so important without Community you're you're in and always will be in a place of survival until your skills are so good that you become this Wilderness ninja right but no it's community and there's also laughter and joy within the community and that's important you know we are the most underdeveloped species of animal on the planet you know we are filled with ego and our intellect thinks that we are superior you are we are so new you don't have fur you have to wear clothing you have to rob the fur off another animal in order for you to live on this planet holy now we make textiles and things right our primary focus is to pass off the Primitive skills come on up here folks you know that there's the Cardinal skills which are the shelter water the multitude levels of fire making the Plant World of the Edibles medicinals utilitarian the hunting and the trapping parts of the tracking science Healing Arts and the presence and the awareness skills and the cognitive development Arts the movement skills those Shadow skills the higher forms of all of these things that's what this place is it's a home for those skills and a home for people that want to come and train and have a safe place to do it classic design is the two y sticks classic design with the long ridge bow twice the length of them if this is the case I've got the person in here right things that I hear in the school from students of why do they come here well it's the current affairs and the current affairs exist on this same things that we can always count on conflict religion politics Finance War nonsense so there's two worlds to this there is the urban emergency preparedness and then there is the Wilderness Survival Let's Talk willing to survival first they're not panicking there's no doomsday talk or Armageddon kind of things it's on people's minds for sure because I think they're starting to realize of how volatile our systems in our modern place actually are be it the electricity the food operations and so on it's very delicate people are coming out to to answer those unknowns it's coming out and joining the circle around a fire once again as we once did all right you got three minutes I think people are are really starting to reconnect to Nature and their relationship to Nature whatever that looks like for them all right time there are some folks that come who are nervous and have like environmental anxiety and and want to you know feel that they're prepared for whatever could potentially happen right so we don't add anything to it and we don't need this cuz NASA can see it so how big of a fire do we actually need you know years ago it was sort of the machismo full of ego nonsense you know Soldier of Fortune idiot you know like the Doomsday prepper kind of person as well that's shifted drastically now it's everyone it's families it's Elders it's young kids the one of the fastest growing demographics we've had in the past three four years has been women I'm one of the volunteers here at Mountain Scout I am also a Wilderness first responder and I'm also an AMT by trade I was working in Hospice Care during the pandemic and I needed to get away and that's when I kept finding myself in the woods more than usual and every time I went out I wanted to know more and more about how I could bring less and less with me and feel more and more confident on the landscape without you know all of this technical equipment so I looked I searched and I found Mountain Scout you don't have to put it in the ground at all you can literally just set it just yeah those you just lean them I know we have a bunch of sticks lying about but yeah I think Co really really accelerated a lot of things um because it really kind of laid bare a lot of the systemic issues and if there was one time where we going to come together and do something for the greater good it felt like that would have kind of been it and it really just kind of fractured us even more in a lot of ways we have the imaginary idea of what the shelter is supposed to look like oh my God you need to build it 3 this is not effective at all right now we are so not even done just come off oh yeah the rain comes in and you kidding me the rain is just going to push this right down yeah so we have to build this 3 to 4 feet for Summertime Summertime okay now look in the door looking through the door now this was the question you were asking before can I make this for two people or a family yes I don't really have faith in us to fix the systemic issues I think it's there's hard times coming and a lot of us well to-do people in North America have kind of been shielded from a lot of it so the debris on the outside is we've known about so much of this stuff for decades and haven't done anything about it and now it's going to take such drastic actions that and we can't even get on board with the smallest little First Steps so that that definitely worries me but yeah I mean we only have a li limited time on this Earth anyway and and I try to I try to zoom out and keep the proper perspective and even if we created this ideal society that would one day crumble and you know nothing nothing's going to last forever so I think it's it's important to to keep things in perspective and and even and try to make the best of it it's producing the dust that we need so now people should also keep this in mind it's one thing to be prepared and to be concerned about all of these things but please go enjoy yourself have an apple enjoy some ice cream have a strawberry look at the sunset go skip a stone live your life go have fun have fun knowing that you took the time and you're responsible and you made contingency plans in case something goes weird but don't stay in the world of paranoia or be in the world of prepper kind of a mentality live your life you know enjoy the love ones go [Music] Adventure this is a dream for a lot of people to come and see the reath they saved a lifetime to come here and there showing them it seeing how they appreciate it it is quite an amazing entity it was on our bucket list I took up to Great Barrier Reef this a dream come true never thought it would happen once in a lifetime [Music] experience we got our first boat in '96 and we've been running uh operations ever since with our little 16 M Sailing Boat we were actually diving um you know two three times a week together that was our our passion just to be under the water together and then showing people the the amazing great bar Reef when we first arrived there wasn't so much I guess talk about climate change and in those early days it was already a poster child as well but for the good you know it was an amazing icon in the world and it was bucket lless for everybody to visit and then over the years I guess you know you had a little bit of media coming in are you okay if you are okay tell me a lot of people come here thinking oh I better see it before it disappears they also come with a misconception of what it should look like I'm afraid um Hollywood didn't do us any favors by showing us the best you could ever see you will find that but it's not everywhere I wanted to do the coral reef and also I want to see some whales and dolphins maybe in the South let's see but the coral reef was very important for me also because I know it's an ecosystem that it's in danger so I want to see it before it's gone I hope it's not gone I definitely think seeing stuff before before it goes away while you can still see the majority of it is is important and taking steps to make sure that it doesn't disappear being a to go dive on the Barrier Reef is quite spectacular cuz i' I've grown up watching D atra documentaries as well as stuff on YouTube about the Great Barrier Reef um and how it used to look for climate change that all that sort of happened I found it quite interesting to see how it has changed and how it actually looks when it isn't G through [Music] filters we've had four Mass Coral bleaching events in the space of 7 years this is much more frequent and severe than what has happened in the past it's caused by climate change which exacerbates heat waves and leads to stress on the coral great bar being the poster child of for climate change I mean the Doomsday I think that's not just about the Barrier Reef I think there seems to be this notion in the world at the moment about everything if you connect somebody to the great bar Reef if you explain you don't throw a bit of plastic there because it looks like a jellyfish for the turtle to eat you know if you give that a meaning then you know you are going to have people coming off thinking oh I might you know not use plastic anymore if you're just making everything so hopeless in this world which everything seems so hopeless in this world well what is the poor Young Generation coming through got got to live for you know nature is very strong very resilient we've just got to give it a little bit of help sometimes and stop putting rubbish everywhere it's one of the snal wonders of the world and I can see why it's huge and it's beautiful this just reinforced the fact that it needs to be protected protected at all costs people said like it's different now with the change in the Eco system so I'm glad I got to see it if it is actually going away um hopefully not I'm also worried that we have too far but let's not get into that if you learn about something it's easier like to care anyone should do it everyone should do it and then I feel if more people saw it then they would care be like this is something weth [Music] [Music] protective even [Music] this [Music] for [Music] e night for for for for for for for for for for to yeah" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] this is what Gaza looks like after more than a year of Israeli bombardment in 15 months this densely populated strip of land has been totally devastated the UN says more than 2/3 of all the buildings in Gaza have been damaged or [Music] destroyed the scale of Destruction is almost incomprehensible there's nothing really prepares you for what you see a landscape that uh really was evocative of images of Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the atomic bombs had dropped the sheer Devastation is such that that most people simply cannot conceive that this has been allowed to happen there was just Rubble in every direction as far as you could see uh complete devastation it is the most barbaric dystopian situation that I have ever seen in my life all days all nights you live in fear you move in fear you sleep in fear you wake up in fear you are not sure that you will be safe in the coming uh few minutes uh every morning when we meet everybody we say thanks God you are still alive in summer 2023 I came here to make a film asking if Israel was using water as a weapon in Palestine I had no idea these images would become one of the last records of a place that's been decimated beyond recognition we're sitting on a Titanic ship everyone is going to hit the iceberg this war didn't spare anything in the city didn't spare a building it didn't spare a tree it didn't spare a person the destruction uh was for all sources all aspects of life [Music] [Music] after 15 months of bombs drone attacks and a ground Invasion killing more than 60,000 people a fragile ceasefire has come into Force and the tens of thousands of gazin who had been trapped for months in the south of the strip can finally return to their homes as they emerge from their shelters and head north to see what remains of their old lives our team in Gaza went to search for the people who shared their daily struggle with us just a few weeks before the war started [Music] among the thousands of people walking North is farmer Muhammad Cel he abandoned his family farm in B laa more than a year ago when staying became too dangerous today he returns to see what remains of the home he once knew the reality hits him there's almost nothing left when we met him in 2023 times were hard and water was scarce but his farm was getting by growing fruits and vegetables to sell at the local market that's all gone now fore most of gaza's Farmland has been destroyed by the Israeli bombardment the once fertile region of B lahia in gaza's North is now a Barren desert south of Gaza City is zun the Olive District famous for its Olive crops now now almost completely destroyed the Orchards and Farms of can Yunis once again decimated by Israeli forces unable to produce their own food garans are now almost completely dependent on the food trucked in by Aid organizations and safe water is even harder to come by Gaza until before the war 40% of the population were receiving uh high quality of water after more than 15 years of the Israeli blockade the water situation was already critical and when Israel started its full-on war in Gaza following the Hamas attacks on October 7th 2023 it quickly got much worse signs pointing to war crimes and genocide started to emerge including water war crimes is Amnesty International concludes that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza to deprive the population of Gaza of access to water amount to acts of genocide taking for survival in the Gaza Strip we saw Israeli leaders saying in public we will cut off water we will cut off other essential supplies to the population this was to the whole population it wasn't targeting the military combatants of Hamas it was cutting off water for everyone in Gaza the Israeli even beside uh targeting building streets and killing people they were using uh uh the water as an additional uh an additional weapon against the Palestinians the more it went on the more that appeared to be deliberate like this Israeli soldiers filmed themselves blowing up a water facility in Rafa and posted it on social media and this the aftermath of an attack on civilians waiting in line at a water filling station in the alhatti refugee camp [Music] 10 people were killed rights groups say this is clear evidence of genocide so genocide is the intent to destroy and holler in part a population it does not limit just to killings or similar acts it can also be the creation of condition of life that can make living impossible Israel rejects all accusations of war crimes and genocide in Gaza prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu who alongside his former Defense Minister yav galand is wanted by the international criminal court says the claims are false and outrageous when we visited gaza's water Distribution Center in 2023 this man rationed the water supply to different neighborhoods by spinning these wheels since then the situation has gone from inadequate to desperate this facility has been completely destroyed the new pipelines installed by the International Community are now a ruin of Twisted Metal and rubble and all the households who received water through these pipes are cut off more than 80% of water networks have been totally destroyed uh 300 30,000 of meters of water networks have been totally demolished as well more than 600,000 M of sea networks have been also uh demolished destroying Water Supplies attacking water workers um preventing the Reconstruction of um Water Supplies this all adds up to the evidence showing this was a deliberate policy a deliberate policy to deprive the population of essential water they are war crimes because they targeting facilities essential to the population to the surviv of the population but they're also a crime against humanity a crime whose impact will be felt long after the guns full silent there is no justification for a war crime war crimes are war crimes The Taking of hostages by Hamas is a war crime that does not justify Israel then committing 14 months of war crimes in Gaza in 2023 Muhammad Ahmed was selling water from a private company in Gaza City to residents of the Shati refugee camp back then the public water supply was only available for a few hours a day and it was mixed with seawater to boost Supply Gaza residents spent around a third of their income on water paying people like Muhammad to fill the tanks in their houses after the ceasefire we tried to contact him for some time without success the shy refugee camp where he lives was hit by multiple air strikes and there is evidence Israeli forces have been actively targeting water workers with phone service often cut off our our team went to look for him in the camp and were relieved to find him alive and well his truck was bombed by an Israeli drone but he's still delivering water to his customers as gaza's water system was left in ruins the Taps dried up and it was up to people like Muhammad to step in with no running water today these trucks are the only way to get water in Gaza so we were transferred into a very primary way of of uh providing service by tankering water so we were obliged only to use water tankers in order to transport and dispute uh water to the displaced people 59% of casualties in Gaza are women children and elderly population so these aren't combatants and to read reports then if women who are mixing contaminated water with formula simply to try to feed their babies that these women unable to feed their children themselves doing everything they can and they're then risking the lives of their babies at that point Sorry in extended War children are around three times more more likely to die from diseases caused by unsafe water than from direct violence in 2024 studies showed that 90% of gaza's children under five were suffering from an infectious disease 70% of children were found to have diarrhea compared to just 3.4% in 2022 while 40,000 cases of hepatitis were reported in 2024 compared to just 85 cases in in pre-war Gaza the destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure in hospitals and healthc Care Facilities has led to an unprecedented risk of infection and death it was highly dangerous and not safe for the doctors and other healthc care providers to deliver Healthcare Services due to the systematic you know destruction of healthcare facilities we have witness the killing of thousands of healthcare providers in addition to the deliberate Detention of other providers who have been detained and tortured till death Israel claims the hospitals were used for military purposes the UN reports 136 attacks on hospitals in the first 9 months of the war pushing gaza's healthc care system to the brink of total collapse and unable to cope with an explosion in water bone diseases you know the water it's the essence of life and it's not that there is no life without water we have seen hundreds of thousands of cases diagnosed with infectious disease like diarrhea like gasis like gastroenteritis like JIS for example and those people they were mainly children and you know vulnerable population today people in Gaza are living off as little as 2 L of water per day seven times less than the minimum required by the World Health Organization and every day they have to spend hours trying to find it many families delegate the task to their children finding a water source and waiting in line is just the first step carrying these cans is heavy work for small hands some use makeshift trolleys to lighten the load but much of this water is contaminated and unsafe every sip carries the risk of illness or even death yet there is no alternative the water in Gaza has been horrifically bad for a very long time very high levels of

          <attvalue for="7" value="Back in 2020 the team suffered – What am I watching? This Channel 1. Is that one of them? This is an AI news channel. Is that an AI person? It's all AI. – As many of the samples to float off into space. Nasa's latest asteroid chasing – I just think it's insane. With audiences disappearing online and revenues quickly following, traditional broadcast news is facing an existential threat. And the landscape is becoming more polarised and less trusted as a result. Recent poll shows 69% say they have little or no confidence at all in the news media. Around the world artificial intelligence  is increasingly being used to bring low-cost news and propaganda to the masses. Arriving into this  turmoil is Channel 1, aiming to personalise the viewing experience at scale, through its own use  of generative AI. So, like any self-respecting video journalist absolutely terrified about what that will mean for me in the future, I've come to LA to audition. Please call Stella, ask her to bring these things with her from the store. Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slobs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. Awesome. Can you try one where it's a little more sort of – OK, super energetic? Yeah, lighter news. OK. Kind of feel. What is the purpose of today? For all of our models, what we need to do is capture their voice so that when our algorithm looks at that it can then animate them in any way that we need to for a certain story. We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. The text reads like nonsense, but it covers all the sounds required to create any English language news script. And it doesn't stop there. English is one of over 30 languages currently being tested. The captured footage is then fed into a variety of closely guarded AI systems. Creating the voice. New British defence secretary John Healey visited ... The lipsync. WhatsApp in favour of Telegram or WeChat ... And the animated performance  of the virtual anchor. An important constituency in the state. The news story itself is also scripted and edited by AI, but draws on trusted newswire sources for its information. With the anchor imbuing the story with its own personal slant. Are you at all sort of concerned about  assigning away your kind of image rights to AI. I feel like initially I would be concerned about that, but the reason why I'm comfortable with it is because, they're going to be paying kind of  of like a residual for different stories. where we're not like, in studio for. What do you think they're looking for in their presenters, have you got an inkling? I don't know, I guess a very outgoing  personality, can speak well, a good like hosting type of like, presence I guess, but, yeah. OK. And with that it's showtime. Hello. Hi. Having been here for a little while, I think  my chances are slightly plummeting, but you know, it's all on me . This could all be a thing of the past right, once AI really comes in. Scary. Yeah? Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese. She can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go to meet her on Wednesday at the train station. I don't know how they do it, you know? They both seemed so calm, didn't they? I already feel very sort of stressed. What you're doing is great, I think  keeping a little bit of motion, because that's kind of what makes this look life like, right? People want to see the news from another human and so in this case even though it's an avatar, that's part of what makes it feel human is those little things, that you're adding to it. Why is this happening now? I think the news industry is in a place today where there's a reason to make some changes and I think there's economic struggles and there's some narrative struggles, but as far as why this is happening right now is because we can. Our channel is able to have one anchor record hundreds or thousands of stories, eventually once we get to scale, in all these different languages. And that's the thing that no matter how good a human is, they can't do. And so there's a reason we're doing it, it's not just to replace a human. The Channel 1 team clearly feel they've spotted a gap in the market. and the potential to revolutionise the news industry. Dramatically reducing costs in the process. Question I have is will anyone actually watch this? Let's find out. Forget about the past, it's all AI now. Would you watch? No. Would you give it a go? Yeah, sure. Because I would think the information comes from the same sources. We're so far into the age of technology  that if anyone or company can save money, they're going to use it. I'm not a big fan of AI honestly. No, but it's coming. It is, but I hate it. There are no guard rails, nothing's in place to let this thing not get out of hand. Frightening. Might AI offer something a bit different that might even restore some trust somehow? We would have to understand if the AI is being created to truly be unbiased, because there's eventually going to be a company that is, you know, directing how AI will be used for the news and how it's programmed, so I'm not sure that we can fully trust that either. I can be concerned about gas prices, but the end day you can't stop them. You know, they say AI is going to take our jobs. No, the people who know how to use AI going to take the jobs. As you can see, I've taken the script of the video ... The process that you went through, is simply the capture process. There is an entirely different process which is personality formation. We would give you some type of backstory, a set of opinions. And at what point is there that conversation to be had where you say, 'Well what is your leaning and how do we best represent who you are and what your views might be?' That is a conversation we would have with the talent, to make sure that they're comfortable, because I would personally would never want certain things coming out of my mouth. We're already in this very big echo chamber of information and we live in our little bubbles and we don't really penetrate other viewpoints as often as we perhaps should, And I just I just wonder if this is going to compound the problem or is it how would it address it? At some point we lost our way and we started letting people believe there's no such thing as facts and that's where you get Fox News for instance, literally saying stuff that is factually untrue and getting sued. We actually think really it's important for people to be fed a balanced news diet. That's our societal responsibility  as a news network, to try to repair some of the things that have happened and that's the reputation that we want, that's the brand that we want. I think if I was a news anchor I'd feel a bit worried now. An AI anchor has the potential to process and communicate vast amounts of data in multiple languages very, very quickly. So I'm hoping that there's still something humans might have to offer. Live from London, this is CNN Newsroom. AI news is coming, are you threatened? I'm excited about AI, because it's going to make my job a lot easier behind the scenes. What we do is get all this information around the world and try to get it on air and that was speed up rapidly. I think there's an issue with it when it comes to the delivery. We'll be with you every day, from wherever the news happens. Because if you take humans out of that, people won't connect with it. Perhaps in the not too too distant future people will not be able to tell the difference. The reality is we connect with other humans, we find  meaning from watching other humans. That's how we find our place in the world. Hello, welcome to our viewers joining us in the ... If you look at our viewing figures when there is breaking news, they are higher than ever. So, when it's something that really matters, something that people might make  their decisions on, they want a human It sounds to me very much like, you're not at all worried about the way that AI might change this industry. Well, I'm really old and I've been doing it forever and I've seen these phases before. It is Wednesday the 1st of November, I'm Max Foster. When I joined we were recording on tape and then the internet came along. Who is the most influential ... These are 32 websites ... TikTok launched its in-app shopping features. Humans created by AI ... I just see all of these things as just windows to information, the one consistent is humans bringing it through. And I'm not saying  we have to have anchors, but if you're going to have an anchor, it has to be a human, otherwise why would you have an anchor? As luck would have it, I'm about to find out. The Channel 1 team are  ready to unveil my own AI anchor. President-elect Donald Trump's plan to execute the largest deportation in American history, is raising fears within immigrant communities both in and outside the US. And showcase its capabilities. I can see why Max isn't worried. I felt like the story wasn't real, because the person wasn't real. But upon catching up with Adam. Hello. It sounds very much as though I'm now in AI anchor in search of a channel. One of the hardest parts of  anything in technology is timing. We built it, we watched it and it was somewhat interesting, but I think I figured out that, that wasn't the ideal format for everybody. and for the service that we would love to create, it is extremely ambitious in scope and it may be more feasible to do in the near future. So, the idea of of channel one itself as a kind of an independent rival to some of the big broadcasters, is that dead? I wouldn't say it's dead, I'd say we figured out a better way to do it. This new way is offering bespoke AI packages, with and without virtual anchors to existing broadcasters. Already taken up by networks in Sweden and Turkey, it's another example of AI's creep into our lives by the back door. And while the future of AI news seems up for grabs, I'm left with one burning question. Did I get the job? You're hired. You can be an AI anchor anytime you want. That's thrown me slightly.

          <attvalue for="7" value="let's fast forward back into well not the present where Sykes and Pico are are drawing with their crayon on a handkerchief so tell us tell us more specifics about about the the borders they decided to to create and why they why they did it in that way okay so there there's a couple of things going on one of them is oil they know there's oil there you got to remember that the British Empire is a naval imp everything is based on ships so if you're going to have oil powerered ships and you don't have access to oil your Empire is finished so they're freaking out when Royal Dutch buys shell there was really only one other major oil corporation on the planet at the time and it was Standard Oil and that was that of course belonged to the United States and so there basically there were these two big oil companies and the British didn't own either one of them now having said that the British had a great relationship with the Netherlands and and the British had a great relationship with the United States so it wasn't like they were owned by two rival States it wasn't like it was France and Germany that owned the oil companies it just that the British were concerned what if something down the road changes or shifts you know there's a bad election in United States or the Dutch decide they're more German and they want to go that direction and so the British decide they have to have their own oil resource so the way they the you know the way you look for oil back then was you walked staring at the ground and you were hoping to find like black Shale or black sandstone a porous rock that that you know like a sponge because if it's sitting on top of an oil field it'll literally suck the oil into it and turn black or because there was so much oil on the planet at time you could literally step in a puddle of oil and then that would be a big indication that there was oil um when the United States found oil in in Pennsylvania they found it at a place called oil Creek in other words there was a really big hint there was probably oil there and the reason the creek got named oil is the creek was cutting through the oil field and then oil floats so there was this Sheen oil on top of the creek and they like ah I bet there's oil here let's dig so you right that was how you found oil you just mostly you kept your eyes open but the problem is the planet is huge and so even though the British Empire own a giant chunk of the planet the idea of sending out armies of people to look at their feet and comb the whole planet to look for oil seemed daunting so the British decided to do something really extraordinary read history books and look for conversations about oil in the history books and they they found those conversations about oil in the Middle East um a thousand years ago the cities in the Middle East lit up their streets at night using oil using petroleum um the the the Roman Empire had in the seventh century and then again in the eth century were using flamethrowers using petroleum to fight the Arabs um at one point Arab armies carried around glass balls with a wick in it and inside it was oil and they would light them and throw them like little naal hang grenades uh Na that was the the name of the soldiers so uh the British knew there was oil they just didn't know where and so they moved in grabbed Kuwait by this point the British already had a presence in the Persian Gulf the Arabian Gulf um and that was in the United Arab Emirates they created the tral coast um they had already established a relationship with Oman so grabbing was just taking a chunk of land away from the the Ottoman Empire and and and basically creating a base with the idea of looking for oil in southern Iraq or in Iran they made a deal with the Persian government and the deal was amazing they got 86% concession so normally when you make a deal like that you get a 50/50 right you're the British company you're doing the work but it's you know it's the Iranian oil so they should get their share 5050 is pretty normal but the G the rulers of Iran were really how should we say into opium eager to get that British opium more than they were eager to advance their country and so the British got this really amazing concession from them and uh that began to shape the way they thought about oil I'm sorry thought about the Middle East having said that they found oil I'm pretty sure the Anglo Persian oil company found oil in like 1908 we should double check my date um so the short after they get the concession they find it shortly after they find it in Iran the Ottoman Empire finds it in what is today Northern Iraq and the British are eager to get a deal with the Ottoman Empire for that oil but the Ottomans decide that Germany is their future and so the the Turks make a deal with the Germans and of course in that moment the British are thinking okay the Ottoman Empire is you know we have to destroy it Germany can't have this oil Germany can't uh have this kind of access to oil and the reason is quite simply that they were worried that the German Navy was going to eventually eclipse the British Navy and the British and the Germans were in a an arms race every time the Germans built a ship the British would build two ships and that would force the Germans to build another ship to try to cancel the two ships the British just built which would then force the British to build two new ships and they were bankrupting each other at the at the rate that they were building ships it was inevitable that both economies were going to collapse and that's one of the reasons why World War I had to happen the they had to they had to just resolve the arms race one way or another somebody just simply had to to come out on top and of course the British come out on top the there is nothing wrong or evil about what the Germans did any more than what the British or the French did in World War I they're not the bad guys they were all bad right it was just a bunch of evil States attacking each other it's not like World War II where it's easy to sort of lay blame on the Germans in any case Sykes and Pico get together because they want to talk about what the future is and that future will not include an Automan Empire the British and the French had decided that they were simply going to take out the Ottoman Empire it didn't hurt any that uh there's an Arab Uprising and the Arabs are actually in the act of defeating the Ottomans because they're trying to break away and create their own independent state um and so the British and the French well the British really not the French assist the Arab uprising but not because they cared about Arab aspirations but because an enemy of an enemy is a friend um and then their their first goal of course was to undermine that Arab State and they did they successfully undermined it that Arab state did exist briefly its capital was Damascus um it had a flag shockingly similar to the Jordanian and Palestinian flag uh the stripes were weren't the exact order right it wasn't uh black white uh green it was if I remember green black green white but almost the exact same flag um and there that's where the jordanians and the Palestinians got their flag it was inspired by that Arab that first attempt at creating an United Arab state from from Syria in any case Sy and Pico before that Arab State existed before World War I is resolved are sitting down and talking about how they're going to carve up the Middle East when they made the plan there was still a Russian Empire so GRE the Italian Empire the Russian Empire the British Empire and the French Empire were going to be the participants in this giant carve up event so one one piece that needed to be carved up was the Ottoman Empire they were going to leave a piece behind that was going to become turkey but they were going to give a big piece to Italy in the South so antalia area that was going to go to Italy in the West ismir Was going to go to Greece so the Greeks were going to have the western shore of what is today turkey um and then the French were going to end up with Syria Lebanon and what is today Iraq the English were only going to take what is today Palestine Israel and Jordan um and the reason why the British were okay with that is then the French would get the oil that was in Iraq because the British were planning to get the oil that was in Iran the Russian Empire was going to invade Iran take the northern half of Iran and the British Empire was going to invade and take the southern half and that would get them access to oil that they could feel secure with the Russians though during World War I decide they're going to go communist have the Bolshevik Revolution and declare that they're no longer they no longer have imperialist aspirations and that they won't work with capitalists anymore and the British Empire realizes if there's no Russia to invade Iran from the north there's no way the British can manage Iran by themselves they need to divide and conquer they can't do it just conquering so the British ta have the French and take Iraq and they they're like you know we're sorry but we need to secure our oil fields you guys just have to figure it out on your own why do the French just agree to that the the French were in such awful shape at the end of World War I um the British Empire was the hegemonic superpower France was in Number the number two slot I think that at that point the French were just grateful that the British were willing to even cut them in because the French had nothing to do with the destruction of the Ottoman Empire it was the uh the the Arab uprising the British did do the invasion at galipoli but that also didn't right the the Turks won at galipoli it's okay though because the British were using Australians and nobody loves Australians so you know they're they're it's amazing that the British I like that but they are it's it's really amazing in any case uh the I think the French were just happy to have anything at that point they were grateful also they they will figure out eventually it's too late for them but but there is oil in Northern Syria it was nothing like what was in Iraq so they were probably hoping that they'd find something okay and what happens with Egypt and and Saudi Arabia okay so um Egypt had a different trajectory in 1798 Napoleon bonapart invades Egypt and after securing Egypt he actually invaded Palestine and his goal was to uh move the Jewish population out of France to Palestine he wanted to to uh ethnically cleanse the Jewish population from Europe and you know people see it as oh he loved the Jewish people well if you Lov them so much why didn't he want them to stay in France he clearly didn't love them as much as I think some people think um and any case Napoleon is defeated the British sink his Navy uh they catch his Navy in a in a bay and sink it and it's a disaster and the French have to escape Egypt and you know Napoleon was thinking he was going to basically to China he was going to he was going to start this new massive Empire with Egypt as his base of operations and the British ruin it for him so he decides you know okay I'll just conquer Europe so he Retreats back to France what what that did though was it inspired somebody so there was an Albanian General who was part of the Ottoman Army his name was mhmed Ali or Muhammad Ali depending on whether you're an Arab or a Turk he was an Albanian so I I guess we should ask the Albanian is what they say um he goes wow what Napoleon did was actually really cool I bet I could do something like that myself he takes his ottoman Army that he's in command of that he invades creit takes it over and then waits for the ottoman arire to respond it doesn't and then he's like well let's go and he invades Egypt conquers Egypt and then he takes his army into Palestine goes up through Syria and he actually invades what is today turkey before the the Ottoman Empire goes whoa what are you doing please stop right he's just an ottoman General who goes Rogue he didn't speak any Arabic um he knew Turkish and Albanian his soldiers mostly speak Turkish and Albanian you know like this is this is such an odd thing to be doing but this is what he does he's he's a Visionary and he thinks in Grand terms he negotiates out a deal with the Ottoman Empire where he'll give back a bunch of Syria and turkey in exchange he'll become basically the governor of an autonomous Egypt and he starts a whole dynasty of kings of Egypt that are they didn't take the title initially but you know it's effectively what they became um who are going to be the governors of a semi-autonomous Egypt and to to mix the two histories the SS the Saud the Saudi family had actually created a state so if you look it up it's the first Saudi state in the 1700s that Saudi State lasted something like 80 years years what happened was their Capital was DEA which is right next to Riad um in 1818 the Ottoman Empire was really upset with this first Saudi State because it it had become quite large it conquered what is today the UAE it had Bahrain uh it had essentially all of what is today Saudi Arabia and that was at the expense to some degree of the Ottoman Empire not all of that land was Ottoman territory but a bunch of it was and so the Ottoman Empire asked mhmed Ali basically for uh a favor and they said you know uh technically you're part of the Empire can you go put down this the Saudi State and he does he takes an army into Saudi this the first Saudi State he goes to daa he destroys Dura and the first Saudi state is is terminated it doesn't stick I I think it was six years later 1824 that's the year in my head um a Saudi state is formed that second Saudi state will eventually also fail and then a third Saudi state is formed out of nudged its idea is it wants to recreate the first Saudi State this big almost the entire Arabian Peninsula size State um but when we were talking earlier I was telling you about the fact that uh there was this attempt to create this Arab state in Syria when that Arab state was being created it was created by hais so West people who were living in Western Saudi Arabia it was a hashimite kingdom um the British go to the souths and they say we're going to undermine and destroy this hashimite state but it would be helpful if you did as well now they the SS don't react to that they're they're not directly uh responsive to the British but eventually they do and they'll go and they'll conquer hez they'll put it together and they create the third Saudi State as a result the British and the Saudi royal family had a cordial relationship they the British saw the SS as somebody they could work with somebody that maybe that they had enough in common with that they didn't feel like they were a threat in the case of Egypt the British did something really strange so the French built the Suez Canal but when the French built the sus Canal they charged Egypt for it now you go okay well they built it well let me rephrase a French company went to Egypt and then hired Egyptian laborers at way under labor value prices and then had them almost as slaves dig the sus canal with high mortality rates and then charge the Egyptian government for them and you know at some level you go really this is just another little imperialist scheme well the to do this the Egyptian state had to borrow money from Banks so that's what they did well in 1882 the British government decided that they were going to use the the debt Egypt owed it as an excuse to invade they invaded and conquered Egypt um there was actually a whole Defense Force set up in Alexandria to try and stop what you a possible European Invasion the Defense Force fails and the British take over Egypt and they make it a protectorate inside the Empire and they eventually Force thewi out of power but then they replace him with a king and so Egypt becomes an in independent Kingdom from the Ottoman Empire at that point" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="hi Meda thank you so much for being with us today with so much going on in the country and the world there's definitely many important things to talk about in the US it's become common now for ICE agents wearing masks to snatch people off the streets and there's also currently attacks against your organization Code Pink me members of Congress have made allegations against you claiming that you're backed by China or by Iran or by Russia in some cases and they say that that you support Hamas and that you're a foreign agent what's your response to them you know in the past we used to laugh because it's so absurd i mean I myself have been protesting since the time of Vietnam and nobody ever pays me to protest um but now it's gotten more serious because we're in very dangerous times and given the way they're snatching up students on the street green card holders um taking people's phones when they come into this country uh taking their electronics um we have members of Congress who are asking for the attorney general to investigate us it's starting to get more serious so there are um I mean we certainly are not going to be silenced but we do worry about the escalating attacks on people who are simply speaking out against genocide so it's dangerous times and can you speak out about the particular claims that these members of Congress have made against you and what kind of actions you're taking against them well there are several for example there is one there are four members of the Republican party that have asked for us to be investigated because they say we are providing aid and abetting illegal aliens uh I think that just means that on our website we tell people what their rights are if they're confronted by ICE agents um there's a another senator who has asked for us to be investigated for our links to the Chinese Communist Party and this is one they've been using for the last year um we have zero contact with the Chinese Communist Party we get zero money from them uh once when I made a visit to Iran and we believe in traveling all over especially to countries where the US has bad relations I was greeted by uh people from the FBI who said that I should register as a foreign agent for Iran which is absurd so um you know they're they're uh we just keep waiting to see if they're going to get uh any more um deliberate with us but in the meantime we fight back you know not only through uh articles on social media and the media uh also by sort of mocking them uh for example we turn around and say that it's actually the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee who is um Tom Cotton who is a foreign agent because he represents Israel he's gotten millions of dollars from Apac lobby groups when he first ran for Senate in 2014 and he continues to take hundreds of thousands of dollars from Apac and so it's quite interesting that they accuse us of getting money from foreign countries when they're the ones who get money from uh lobby groups that represent a foreign country yeah certainly like while they're claiming that you get funded by China or they even can't decide who you get funded by they seem to change that meanwhile they're getting millions of dollars from Apac clearly being funded by a foreign entity um now when we look at what's happening in America do you see uh that there is an attack on free speech are things getting worse that seems to be the worry at this moment looking at the green card holders being snatched up should American citizens be worried of these developments too we're terrified by what is happening i mean we haven't seen anything like this in our lifetimes it goes back to the 1950s when there was a uh what we call the McCarthy scare the red scare when people were accused of being communist and they lost their jobs and it was a terrible time it seems like we're going into that kind of what some are calling neoccarthyism uh the snatching up of students who are here legally of who committed no crimes uh is casting a poll on all kinds of people who have been speaking out particularly around Palestine uh we find that the people who used to come with us in the halls of Congress are afraid to come a lot of them uh certainly if they are green card holders uh if they are students uh we find that the repression against students has been so severe uh that many many students are afraid to be seen uh in protests um it is certainly a different kind of feeling we have right now i can't tell you the number of people who have said to me I'm scared i'm afraid to leave the country i don't know if they'll let me break back into the country i don't know if they'll take my uh phone away from me and uh look at all of my contacts and would that get anybody in trouble and I'm afraid to like things on social media now will that get me in trouble and we keep saying them to people look if you act scared if you let them intimidate you then they're winning they're only doing this now because they're losing because they're losing in the court of public opinion um they're losing in certainly in the the global opinion and um they're getting desperate and that's why they're doing these kinds of things you know I I read an article recently going back to this issue of Apac and the lobby groups that said the members of Congress don't vote in way because Apac tells them to do it they vote because they see what the public opinion is well that was written two decades ago now public opinion has totally changed and the majority of people are not sympathetic to Israel anymore and the number of people more sympathetic to Palestine has kept growing so now there's only 46% of the population that is sympathetic to Israel and if you uh there's a real generational breakdown so if you look at the young people they're way more sympathetic to Palestine so why don't we have in Congress that same kind of breakdown with half the members of Congress should be putting out legislation that says no more weapons to Israel uh stop the genocide uh we won't continue to back Netanyahu um but that's not what we're seeing yeah um as you mentioned you made many very important points but yes the Congress definitely doesn't uh represent accurately the amount of Americans who are concerned for Palestine who are not supporting uh America's relationship with Israel but that doesn't seem like the path Donald Trump has taken so far but prior to his election there was hopes that Trump can be a president for peace he made claims like that saying that he's going to bring about peace not only in Palestine but also between Ukraine and Russia what what's your take on how his term has turned out so far and do you think he has some potential to be a peacemaker in some area of the world i think in the case of Ukraine perhaps and I'm hoping uh we always were asking Biden talk to Putin start negotiations this endless war is just harmful toward the people of Ukraine who are exhausted from war and it's taking billions and billions of dollars from the American public we have to start negotiations and Biden refused to talk to Putin so we were glad when we heard you know in the early days of the Trump administration that he got on the phone and had a 90minute a long phone call with Putin you know it's had its ups and downs i think the way he has treated um Zalinsky in public is not the role of a negotiator um you know he he uh can be extremely undiplomatic to put it to put it nicely but I think there can be progress made in the case of Ukraine in the case of the Middle East you know we also had hope because it was because of Trump that we got the ceasefire you know we didn't get a ceasefire during Biden's time right and so we were hopeful but that hope has been dashed seeing Israel just destroy the negotiations refuse to go into phase two start the killing again and Trump siding with Netanyahu during this whole time and not only that we see the increase in the attacks on Yemen this which is you know so ridiculous because we know very clearly that the Yemenes and particularly the Houthis have said we will stop the attacks in the Red Sea when the genocide stops and we saw that they did do that indeed when the ceasefire was in place and when the ceasefire was broken by Israel they started up again so instead of attacking Yemen we should be negotiating forcing Netanyahu to go back to the ceasefire mhm and do you think a lot of analysts say that Trump can force Netanyahu in the ceasefire he has the influence to do it but what do you see happening now now that Israel has started targeting Gaza again thousands are already dead do you see any hope for a ceasefire in the near future i can't imagine that there won't be a ceasefire there's got to be a ceasefire i mean how much can people suffer and we've been saying this for so long like where is the world community where is the rule of law where are the Arab leaders and yes they they met and they came forward with their own plan for how Gaza could be rebuilt but then they're not doing anything to force Israel to stop the bombing and they're not even doing anything particularly forceful in the United Nations um I would like the world to gang up on the United States and say &quot;You have to stop the support for Israel you have to stop sending the weapons because look at the end of the day Israel could not do what it's doing without US weapons.&quot; Everybody knows that and so it is up to Trump really to decide when enough is enough and I think you know that comes when there's enough of an outcry to say we just can't keep watching this every day yeah and speaking of sending weapons to Israel there's a vote in Congress coming up particularly on this issue can you talk about the activism work you'll be doing around this vote and the work you do in general in the holes of Congress the kind of videos that kind of made you famous for a lot of people seeing you chase down senators can you talk about that work and how that's going to change perhaps under this current climate we have had one other vote in the past in the Senate uh on stopping weapons introduced by Bernie Sanders a Jewish member of the Senate uh and we got 19 senators to vote on that that's about 40% of the Democrats we didn't get one Republican to vote that way now we're having another chance to see can we get even more of them uh we feel like we know it's not going to pass but we feel it's so important to get these senators on record and it's tough for these senators because they're getting pressured by Apac you know they're getting a lot of calls into their offices saying you better not vote to stop these weapons to Israel and they're getting a lot of calls from our side as well and in the past their calculation has been well Apac is more powerful so I think I'll go with Apac but you just got to think at some point their own conscience their own morality will kick in uh we're still waiting for that but we are in the halls of Congress every single day because we think it's so important to be there we know that these pro-Israel lobby groups are there you know they might not physically be there but they're sending in their checks all the time they're meeting uh with their Congress people in their districts as well as in Washington and so we want to be a presence as well and we are and um some of the videos that we do are us chasing down these members of Congress to say &quot;When are you going to stop supporting the genocide when are you going to speak out about the kidnapping of students on our streets in broad daylight by masks masked men who are not even identified?&quot; Um when are you going to have some kind of moral conscience about the children that are being killed every day have you looked at the starvation that it's been almost a month that Israel hasn't let food into Gaza so you know we kind of run after them asking these very very serious questions and in the beginning they'd engage with us more i think now they're being told uh by their leaders to try not to talk to us um but we still run after them anyway because they're elected officials and they should have to respond to the public yes and you're doing a great job of holding them accountable to the public in that way for sure well yes and I don't know if you've seen any of the town halls the meetings they have when they go back to their districts but they have been interrupted not just about the issue of Gaza and uh Palestine but also about the broader issues about what Trump is doing in uh the cutting of government agencies uh the threats to so many uh people's livelihoods the threats to cut basic social safety net like Medicare and Medicaid and Social security so these Congress people when they go back to their districts they're getting an earful from their constituents mhm and the upcoming vote you mentioned that Bernie Sanders had introduced it the previous time a senator of Jewish descent and you also come from a Jewish background can you speak to how important for to for Jewish voices within America to speak out for Palestine can you speak speak on that well yes because everybody who speaks out is being labeled an anti-semite you know everything is anti-semitism there's been about 14 hearings in Congress on anti-semitism in the meantime look at who is really being attacked it's the people who are speaking out for Palestine and yet that's hardly ever discussed and that's why it's important for those of us who are Jewish to speak out because our voices are so important right now i mean they can call you a self-hating Jew and certainly they do that they do that to Bernie Sanders they do that to all of us um who speak out as members of the Jewish community but there are so many of us and this is also reflected in the generational difference because if you look at the uh the younger generation of Jewish Americans they are more sympathetic to Palestine as well so it's a changing demographic um and that's why we do see a lot of young uh Jews that are part of groups like Jewish Voice for Peace another group of young Jewish people called If Not Now and um and they're very important and and it's really interesting when you look at the encampments that happened last year in the colleges um so many of the people who came out to those were Jewish students and um there were Jewish religious services during those encampments guarded by Muslim students i it was beautiful the kind of interaction um that there was and I think it's so sad that the um pro-Israel forces have been so aggressive in labeling people who are speaking out against genocide as anti-semites because they're not yeah yes very important perspective you bring there and now like you mentioned that we're in unprecedented times like you've been demonstrating since Vietnam since the McCarthy era but what we're seeing now is perhaps unprecedented and never seen before where do you see things headed for America from here on is things going to get worse is it is is there going to be more encro encroachment on free speech maybe they'll start snatching Americans instead of green card holders what do you see happening i have no idea this is uncharted territory that we're in right now um I think the people were shocked that green card holders who are legal who have a path to citizenship are supposed to have the same equal rights as citizens um are being snatched up and so yes I think that we shouldn't be complacent just because we're citizens um certainly people like myself who has a have a history of going to countries whether it's to Yemen or Afghanistan or Iran or um you know places that uh North Korea I've been to um that it uh we are given secondary screening when we go in when we return to the country and um it is disconcerting how they are looking at us now as not American uh as um traders and so yes um we we have no idea where we're going i do think that with American people what they care about most is the economy and I think that some of Trump's policies of putting these tremendous tariffs on goods coming into the country is creating inflation is going to hurt the pocketbooks of the American people and that's where you're going to see them rising up and we'll probably see that as we get close to the next congressional elections and maybe that will be a force that will kind of tone down this administration the other thing we're seeing is other countries around the world rising up and saying we're not going to uh live by the dictates of the United States you know they have been for years now forging new relationships like the bricks uh and uh it's funny the the uh opposite effect that US policies are having of pushing countries closer to China uh pushing Russia and China closer to each other pushing Iran Russia and China closer to each other um at some point there has to be blowback and I think that we see already in this administration so much contradiction for example take the issue of Iran there are some people in the administration who say it's important to talk to Iran a war with Iran would be terrible and you hear consiliatory tones coming from Trump and the next day you hear just the opposite you know if Iran doesn't do what we want we're going to blow them to smitherreens uh and that's certainly not the way to get the Iranians to the negotiating table um we're seeing ups and downs constantly uh when it comes to the Middle East when it comes to Ukraine uh when it comes to even the way that um Trump talks about his good friend Putin one day and the next day he's very angry at Putin so how are we supposed to know where this is leading i think unpredictability is the main um basis of this administration and I think they do it on purpose to keep us jumping but there is one other thing I'd like to point out which is that people in this country are traditionally call themselves Republicans or Democrats or independents i think that's starting to change and when we see when Bernie Sanders has been traveling around many of the states um in the middle of this country he's getting a big audience of people who voted for Trump who might have considered themselves Republican and they're starting to question it now and you get many Democrats who maybe were lifelong Democrats but were so disappointed with Joe Biden and his presidency and started to kind of leave the Democratic party so I think there are more and more people who aren't really concerned about party affiliation and there we can unite over issues rather than around party politics and that's where I find some hope for example I'll give you one that's very interesting um people who were involved in the January 6 insurrection um these are what we call the MAGA people the make America great again uh stalwarts of Donald Trump when they were in prison before they got pardoned by Donald Trump they saw the terrible conditions in the prisons they saw the racism against the black people in this country in the prisons they saw the power trip of the people who run the prisons and some of them came out and said,&quot;I going to dedicate my life to helping the people I'd left behind in the prison and work for prison reform.&quot; And so they're working up with people who would consider themselves on the left people who would consider themselves Democrat to come together around that issue so that's just an example where people are starting to shed a little bit that party affiliation and look more at what can unite us mhm and that's very important to say what can unite us in these bleak times you do have a message of hope as well you know going to the going to the future and I guess you need some hope right to be like you and to be active for so many years be an activist you need to see a a a light at the end of the tunnel well in terms of the light at the end of the tunnel I think you know maybe because I'm in my 70s now I've seen a lot and things are cyclical and we see them not just in the United States we see them all around the world where things go up and down and good and bad and uh and the only thing that we can do is thank God when we get up in the morning we're alive we can put our feet on the ground we can face another day um we have a saying that says a protest a day keeps the fascists away so you know get out and organize um bring people together uh be loud be unapologetic not be afraid i mean those are the key things uh to retain the semblance or or the reality of a democracy in this country so I would just say that the worst thing is to give in the worst thing is to be scared the worst thing is to be depressed and a lot of people are depressed you got to get out of that um and get up every day to think what can I do to help the people in Gaza what can I do to uh help the people who are suffering whether it's an earthquake or whatever is happening around the world what can I do to make the world a better place and that will make you feel a lot better about the state of things thank you so much Ma so many important insights that you shared with us here today thank you for coming on thank you thank you" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] thank you so much R Shir for sitting here with me today talk about many things that Hing we can explore together one being Judaism in relation to Zionism and vice versa what you've turned uh Israel's armed materialism then possible new for of allyship between Palestinians and Orthodox Jews and everything in between those things but perhaps we can start with this question which I know is one you've explored so thoroughly is this relationship or lack thereof between Judaism and Zionism and for you if I understand correctly um they are not only different but at odds yeah it's more than at odds they work as kind of a team actually in the sense that a disease works as a team with its cure Judaism is the disease and Zionism is the cure Zionism was designed to create a new type of Jew the reason they wanted to create a new type of Jew is because because the uh old zionists back in the day 1800s uh they looked at the Jews as disgusting they looked at the Jews as weak they looked at the Jews as cowardly unmanly was a word that they used often they basically absorbed the anti-semitic tropes of Jews and they believed it see a little history is in order over here Jews for thousands of years were religious uh people a monastic people we lived in what they called ghettos but about a thousand years ago the Jews themselves requested to be segregated because we are loyal citizens to the countries we live in but we have a mission in the world as a religious people it's not just merely a religion that you have to believe in God and then you're saved but rather it's a actual lifestyle and a job description that governs every facet of our lives and not only are there dos and don'ts but but there's actual uh a job that we have to do we study and we pray and we the more scholarship you have of God's Bible and the Torah then the higher level you are the closer you are to God and the the deeper your prayers are the higher you are and the closer you are to God and it's a it's a lifetime it's a lifetime uh program being a Jew and the reason why it's a lifetime program is because after the lifetime is over then we stand before God and however much we accomplished in this world that's how much we can retire with for billions and billions of years forever more that's Judaism in a Nell we're here in this world to prepare for the afterlife and if you ever prepared for a test you know that you shut the doors and you shut the phone and you just lock everybody out and you say come back to me in a couple of weeks when the test is is over we're also preparing for a test but takes our whole life so we had our our way of living Imagine by way of analogy I know shaol and monks on a Hilltop but without the martial arts you know instead there's biblical studies and that's the way Jews were now not everybody uh wanted that lifestyle but Jews were forced to have that lifestyle there was a old historian a Cambridge historian Sao Baron who had a very good line he said that the locks on the inside of the ghetto doors were there before the locks on the outside but there were people that wanted to get out but they weren't allowed to get out until then came the Enlightenment and the Emancipation and we had freedom of religion and freedom from religion and there were Jews that said who whoop we do now we could assimilate and be like everybody else and they tried to assimilate and instead of studying the Torah they wanted to be artists and they wanted to be writers and they wanted to be like everybody else um it didn't work though that was the problem it started in Russia in about 1881 there were programs and the anti-semitic programs attacks lethal attacks against Jews which included the assimilated Jews as well as the religious ones these guys figured that why would anybody attack us why would anybody hate us we're the same as the Russians we're the same as the ukrainians they that led to kind of an identity crisis amongst these assimilated Jews they didn't want to be Jews because they thought the Jews were disgusting um weak pathetic cowardly unmanly um not part of History uninterested in anything useful um but the non-jewish world will not let them be non-jews so what do they do there are various different answers um communism was one of the answers the idea of communism if you believe in it is everybody's going to be treated equal and then the Jews will also be treated equal one of the ideas was Zionism and that ended up the dominance one because at the end of middle of the 20th century um the Jews in Europe were pretty much W wiped out and um because Zionism took place in Palestine to a large extent they ended up the dominant Jewish movement because the others were just wiped off the face of the Earth Zionism believed that the Jews need to change that the reason why people don't like Jews is because the image of the Jew is still of that religious Jew of the disgusting Jew in addition there's something else uh hatable about Jews they don't have a country nationalism in those days was a very strong movement Empires were becoming nation states and the Jews don't have a state and the Jews aren't the people like other people now we weren't because we were religion but they figured look if we could change the Jews into a nationality we could be like everybody else that will have two important results result number one people will look at the Jews differently now you're normal because now you have your own land you have a language you have a culture you're not these weirdos and two more importantly it'll change the Jews themselves the aspirations will change they instead of wanting to finish volumes of the talmud they'll want to win Olympic gold medals they'll want to win euro vision song contests they'll want to be like everybody else they'll want a strong Army so the Zionist set out to create a nationality out of the Jews this was a very it was a daunting task because the Jews had no National characteristics because we were not a nationality we had no common land language or culture h there was no common land cuz for thousands of years the Jews were all over the world and there was nothing wrong with that absolutely nothing wrong with that that's what God wanted and that's where we were God is all over the world we could also be all over the world we had no language or culture because they were Jews in Ethiopia there are Jews in Morocco Yemen uh there are Jews in Syria there are Jews in Germany Spain Russia England these Jews have nothing cultural in common they had one thing in common their religion that's it but the Zionist said no land language culture we need it for the Jews we'll make the Jews a flag like old people have they made a flag that's what's today's Israeli flag which existed before Israel did will create a language so they sat down aen Yehuda his name was to create modern Hebrew a Biblical Hebrew or Rabin Hebrew is not really a speakable language there only few hundred uh root words um so he created an actual modern language modern Hebrew um a national anthem they created H they created uh a culture they had various different ideas about what the culture should be it should be right-wing leftwing fascist socialist and that those differences of opinion led to differences of political parties today in Israel um long story short the religious Jews were very much against this they considered it a form of idol worship it's an actual denial of jewi Jewish identity because Jewish identity is only religious uh for many many centuries the Jews understood the only thing that unites the Jewish people is the fact that God gave the Jews the Torah at Mount Si as the Bible says and that's the only common denominator that Jews have the definition of a Jew is somebody en joined by God to fulfill the Torah being a Jew is a job description the Zionist said no that will not do we will become a nationality and there was always this not tension it was it was worse than tension the zionists wanted to cure the Jews of the aspirations which were to be meek mild humble uh Priestly uh the Bible says the Jews areos a Priestly people you will become strong men Warriors especially Warriors Jews did not like Wars it was very much against our values um you you will become Warriors you'll become strong men you will stop with this cerebral um lifestyle and the studious Pious lifestyle you will be like the kacs you will be like the Germans you will be like the Russians exactly how exactly which country you'll be like in what culture okay there are different Zionist opinions about that and again that resulted in different Zionist political parties today um and that was Zionism designed to wipe out Jewish identity uh destroy it and replace it with Zionist identity very simple and that way the Jews would be normalized and everybody will and the Jews will be normalized will be normal in the eyes of the world they had educational centers they created history books that changed Jewish history that the Jewish aspirations all throughout history was not for a messiah to come and make a renewal of the world and the world become spiritual place no Jewish aspirations were always for National self-determination we were always looking to 2,000 years to come back to our land no we were looking for a Messianic renewal of the world for an esoy for God to come back and end of days no that's not what we were looking at for said the Zionist we were looking for return to our homeland and the the Holy Land Palestine Israel it is never our homeland a Homeland in English the word homeland doesn't say much about what a Homeland is but in other languages including Hebrew Homeland like in French La Patria Fatherland there's Mother Russia it's motherland his Fatherland in Hebrew moles the place you were born and there's a certain in nationalist philosophy a certain organic connection between a people and the place that where the people were born where the people were formed according to Judaism the Jewish people were created at Mount Si in the desert there was no country according to Zionism the Jewish people were created as Israel's Declaration of Independence says in Israel before Israel weren't real Jews Moses never went into Israel but Israel is where the Jews were created and Israel is therefore the Homeland for us it's a holy land Israel for the Zionist it's a Homeland change all the Jewish Concepts change everything from spirituality to politics or from spirituality to physicality from spirituality to materiality keep the names keep the the symbols yes the holy land is valuable to us but not because of the way the Jews think and Jews think it's holy no it's your what Russia is to the Russians and German is to the Germany is to the Germans Israel is to the Jews we wanted an es eschatology in End of Days spiritual spiritual renal of the world said the Zionist no we want National self-determination the Jews are a people only United by our religion by our God we Jews are brothers because we have one father God no it's not true Jews are brothers the same way the Russians of Brothers we are Nationals and that's it now that's why Zionism is opposed to Judaism and never mind the fact that the zionists violate the Jewish religion in all sorts of ways um the most blatant is that we're not allowed to have uh sovereignty over that land until the Messiah comes but set that aside for now the very definition of a Jew according to Zionist is different than the definition of a Jew according to Judaism when I say Jew and Benjamin nanyu says Jew it's only hins so if you want to know the definition of Zionism really the Zionist won't even tell you what the definition of Zionism is they'll every Zionist will tell you that whatever you say that's not really the definition definition is the right for the Jews to do the all Zionism instead of talking about the definition of Zionism it's better um to realize that every Zionism presupposing is two things thing number one the Jews are a nationality not just the religion thing number two Israel is the state of that nationality in the words of Israel's own website aan wrote an article there that says the following and Dani alone said the same thing uh the zionists say this Netanyahu wrote this kind of different language but same idea in one of his books what Japan is to the Japanese and France is to the French Israel is to the Jews okay and therefore by the way that's why Netanyahu and all of these guys say anti-zionism has to be anti-Semitism this is coming from Benjamin Netanyahu you cannot say I'm against the existence of the United States of America but I want an American identity you can't say I'm against the existence of France France and say I want a french identity so too you can't say I'm against the existence of Israel and want a Jewish identity without Israel it's like French without France it's like the Japanese without Japan now the whole thing is baloney because the Jews existed way before Israel did we exist now independent of Israel there was no connection between the existence of the Jews the identity of the Jews and the state of Israel yet the state of Israel wants to own Jewish identity to the point where Japan is to the Japanese what Israel is to the Jews that's Zionism it's the nationalization of Jewish identity okay it's not even Jewish nationalism it's more than that a Christian nationalism let's say would say that would agree that Christianity is a religion but it should rule the nation um white nationalism would agree that whites are whites but they should also be a nation Zionism doesn't say merely that being Jew is a religion but this religion should run a country the Jews are primarily a nationality they also had a religion like the Greeks had a religion they had they worshiped Zeus and I don't know what the Scandinavians had Odin the Jews had our God but the Jews are a nationality like Greeks are a nationality okay that's Zionism and that's a absolute eraser of Jewish identity now this idea of Zionism it causes a lot of problems for the Jews and for non-jews first thing is that I am a Jew by religion I'm a citizen of the United States of America my family's from Poland we've been there for hundreds of years is Israel my country there is United States of America my country well Israel has a nation state law 2018 that Israel is officially the nation state of the Jewish people remember Zionism means the Jews are nationality and Israel is the state of that nationality but I thought I'm an American and America is my country this was one of the biggest objections to Zionism from both religious and non-religious Jews in England when they had the ball declaration there was one Jewish member of the um cabinet his name was Edwin montigue he was against the bord Declaration he was against Zionism he said you're going to make Jews um strangers foreigners in their own countries he says you want to make a Jewish state that means that the Jews will be strangers in their own countries and indeed Netanyahu comes to America he did so when he he came to speak to Congress about Barack Obama's Iran deal which he wanted a squelch and he said I come here representing not only the people that elected me but I represent all Jews all over the world Netanyahu claims to be my prime minister na toi Bennett said after Barack Obama insulted nanyu he called him a coward using a nasty colloquialism that insulting Netanyahu is insulting all the Jews all over the world Netanyahu is not only the prime minister of Israel he's the prime minister of the Jews Jonathan Pard the Israeli spy that was convicted for spying on America he did his time he would move back to Israel he had not long ago said it was in all of Israel's papers he would advise Jews to spy on America for Israel according to Zionism Israel is my country when Israel says that Japan is to the Japanese what and France is to the French what Israel is to the Jews imagine there's two people in France a Jewish guy and a non-jewish guy Fran is to the French what israels to the Jews he doesn't mean the Israeli Jews he means the French Jews too so Fran is to the non-jewish Frenchmen what Israel is to the Jewish Frenchmen Zionism by definition is anti-Semitic therefore because it it makes Jew it's a it's a um dual loyalty Trope not only dual loyalty Trope it demands my loyalty it demands that it claims that it represents Me by its own law now mind you there is not a single country in the world like that there is no other country in the world that claims to be the state of people that are not its citizens never were its citizens don't live there never did live there I have a right by international law to change my nationality if I don't like my President Joe Biden I can move to Mexico and then Mexico is my nation states if they'll have me but no matter where I run what country I live in Benjamin who claims to be my prime minister because I was born Jewish that sounds like a dictatorship not a democracy to me you know they may give people equal rights over there but if I can't escape from that that being my nation state doesn't sound like a democracy to me there is no other country in the world like that now we need to understand this Israel is different than all other countries in the world all other countries in the world are the countries of its citizens Israel is not the country of its citizens by Israeli law Israel is the country of the Jews meaning if you are an Israeli citizen but you're not Jewish Israel is not your country by that I mean Israeli law says you have no self-determination rights in Israel unless you're Jewish so if this is the country of the Jews and the non-jews are there yes they're there with equal civil rights they are citizens but Israel is not their country Israel could never allow non-jewish people to run the country has to be a Jewish majority now more than that by Israeli law remember I said that the Jews are a nation and Israel is a state by Israeli law there was no such thing as an Israeli nationality Israel census uh it has various different categories for people there's religion and there's nationality and citizenship nationality is Jewish nationality is Arab nationality is Jews citizen Israeli Israel is the country not of its citizens Israel is the country of a nationality now you have to understand how Israel looks at themselves and if we understand this we'll understand a lot of things about why Israel behaves in many ways that they do and why they look at themselves in certain ways as opposed to the rest of the world looking them at them in other ways there are people who have said that Israel is a racist State because it favors Jews okay is turkey a racist State because it favors Turks over people who are not Turks I'm talking about Turkish citizens well obviously not countries are there to serve their people Turks turkey is there to serve the Turkish citizens France is to there to serve the French citizens but Israel is to serve the Jewish Nation they look at all the Jews as other countries look at the citizens of those countries it is the country of the Jews it was made to be to be the country of the Jews now you're going to tell me well okay but every other country you can become a citizen of that country regardless of your nationality well you can convert to Judaism and then you are officially an Israeli National which is weird because even though Israel claims Zionism claims that being a Jew is not a religion it's a nationality if you go through a religious conversion not a naturalization process you go to a rabbi in Belgium and you go through religious conversion maybe anti-zionist rabbis rabbis that don't recognize Israel if you are a Jew by religion you are now a Jew by nationality and by the way that doesn't apply to all Jews by Israeli law even if you're an atheist obviously you you're a Jew and you're entitled to the law of return because has nothing to do with religion although it's kind of contradictory to the fact that if you become if you convert with a religious conversion now you're Jewish National however according to Israeli law if you're born Jewish and you believe in another religion other than Judaism you believe Jesus is the Messiah you believe Muhammad's the prophet you're not a Jew you you believe in no God then you are a Jew you believe God's a trinity no Jew there was a case of a Jew that was born uh Jewish his name was Daniel refusion polish guy he later converted to Christianity he was no anti-semite he helped Jews Escape in World War II because of his status um and after World War II 1948 he like when Israel was formed he wanted to move to Israel and become a citizen on the law of return Israel Supreme Court ruled no he's not Jewish he's Christian but wait if an if a Jew could be an atheist why can't the Jew be a Christian imagine this this brother Daniel that's what was a commite monk if he would say all right I don't believe in Jesus anymore I don't believe in anything anymore I'm an atheist oh now you're Jewish now you can come I'm Christan you're Christian you're no good okay fine I don't believe in Christianity anymore I'm an atheist oh now you're an atheist come to Israel now you're Jewish now you're none of this makes any sense and the reason it does doesn't make any sense is because Israel tried to create something that doesn't exist they tried to create added the Jews a nationality had they wanted to create a new nationality they were pseudo kind of zionists that did want to create a totally new nationality have nothing to do with the Jews they were called cananim never never got off the ground that would be one thing it was a valid idea it was also a fiction but they had no nobody to buy into it nobody what they did was they tried to Gaslight the Jews and change the Jews and re-educate the Jews to look at themselves differently as a nationality rather than a religion the problem is the Jews for thousands of years have been very very solid in their identity that they're nationality and that they are a religion they have no National characteristics and this whole idea that well if you're a Jew anywhere uh you could come to Israel what's the definition of a Jew Israel has never defined what a Jew is Israel claims to be a Jewish State the Jewish State what's a Jew" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="let's talk about the war in Myanmar opposition forces are trying to overthrow the military which has been in power for decades and it looks like they may have the edge all kinds of people have joined the fight from established armed groups to students and activists who want democracy the military if you like is on the roads he losing significant land civilan territories mymar is now at the vert of State failure millions of people have already been displaced there are now warnings of famine and reports of all sorts of atrocities being committed so what's behind the fighting and could the military regime really be about to [Music] fall Myanmar which used to be called Burma is in Southeast Asia sandwiched between all these countries and to understand what's going on there now we need a quick backstory for decades a repressive military regime has been in charge ruling over a very diverse country made up of more than a 100 ethnic groups Yanmar was heavily sanctioned and isolated from the world it was seen as a kind of pariah state but from about 2011 things started shifting and led to a period that some people call myanmar's experiment with democracy the the ruling generals agreed to share power With a Civilian government there were elections in 2015 and a party called the national league for democracy or nld W it was led by anang Suchi who'd been the face of the opposition for decades and had spent almost 15 years under house arrest in 2020 the nld won again by a landslide but the military disputed the result they staged a coup to take back power anang suuchi was detained and then sent to prison although it's not clear where she's being held right now what came next led to a fullscale civil war that is still going [Applause] [Music] on myanmar's 10-year journey to democracy appears to be over the military takeover has sparked the biggest demonstrations seen in Myanmar in more than a decade a stark warning from the UN special Envoy on Myanmar quote a blood bath is imminent Security Forces shot more than 100 people dead peaceful demonstrations were responded to with massive Violence by the military this violence made them even more determent to get the military out of Politics the people of Myanmar were not prepared to turn back the clock since then the the the people have built up their armed resistance to the milit and the situation now in Myanmar is unprecedented after 4 years of fighting the map of Myanmar now looks like this the military regime has lost a lot of territory especially in the last year it now only has full control of 21% of the country according to a BBC investigation but that includes the capital Napa and other big cities the rest is controlled by a range of different anti-military groups you can see there are lots of them but they roughly fall into two main categories you've got the ethnic armed organizations these are groups that represent different ethnic minorities and they've been fighting against the military for more rights autonomy even Independence for a long time these wars go back 60 years it's it's it's nothing new U there have been periods of greater or lesser uh violence in these wars but they have been continuous since the military became the dominant power in Myanmar in 196 too every minority in Burma has their own stories to tell you how much they are suffering so that is a main driving force for this minorities they feel that we must protect ourself as well as the ethnic armed groups the other main category on the anti-military side are the resistance groups that emerged in response to the 2021 coup when many of the protesters decided to pick up weapons with the goal of ending military rule and restoring democracy you had all sorts of volunteers joining the fight students lawyers Medics and a lot of them have been trained by those ethnic armed groups in secret jungle camps and over time they've become a more effective and better equipped fighting force a lot of Mama citizen they've been donating money to the resistant movement eventually they they grow uh exponentially one of the things that's made a huge difference in the last 6 months is weapons the pro-democracy force have seized from military bases they've overrun the main resistance group are the people's Defense Forces or PDF these are the areas they control the PDF are essentially the boots on the ground for a rival opposition government that was set up after the coup called the national Unity government now while the PDF have been pretty effective it's really the ethnic groups that have been making the difference much as the nug would like to claim this military success of the resistance as its own what's happening on the battlefield in Myanmar is primarily being driven by the ethnic armed groups for example one group known as the arakan Army is now in full control of the border with Bangladesh after pushing the military out in this video you can see soldiers waving White flags and surrendering there are lots of reports of how the military have been struggling to get enough people to fight for them there is massive number of surrenders uh to the people's Revolution site we know that morale is very low that they have introduced conscription and are are literally kidnapping young men to fight in the military sending them to the front line using as a human shield this is the biggest crime going on in Burma so you've got this situation where the military which used to be all powerful is really Under Pressure could the regime actually fall though well plenty of people are predicting that it's only a matter of time this illegal C attempt by the military now we can say for sure as has failed one of the very reason is because of the very uh unwavering determination and resistance resilience of the MMA people the especially the young Generations are absolutely Resolute in their fight to end this military operation once and for all we should not be surprised uh if sudden and dramatic change comes to mymar maybe I wouldn't predict it but we shouldn't be surprised when it happens or if it happens a lot would still need to happen for the regime to finally go one big Advantage the military has is air power and it uses these weapons brutally and uh basically adopts a scorched Earth policy to seek to obliterate The Villages towns and even cities that it has lost in the fighting on the ground the military also still controls the major city ities the PDF and ethnic groups would have to Stage a pretty major offensive to take those cities but there are big questions about whether they're all United enough to make that happen keep in mind the ethnic armed groups are more focused on achieving autonomy in their own regions some are even fighting each other the ethnic armed groups do understand that if this current military is left in power in the center they will never be at peace but whether that translates into a willingness to expend enormous resources uh and lose uh you know a huge number of lives by marching on the central cities that's another question intirely so what about pressure from other countries that could shift the balance of power well just as Myanmar isn't really in the news much there's not a great deal of diplomatic attention focused on it either the main player here is China but Beijing seems to be hedging its bets China is the only country that has been putting significant effort uh to address the issue but on the other hand that was uh mainly for protecting its own interest but rather than resolving the issue in Myanmar China traditionally has tried to play all sides uh it has been a supporter and armor of the military but it's also armed most of the ethnic groups directly and indirectly uh I think China's major concern is to ensure that whoever wins the War in manmar China is on that side and while the world's attention is elsewhere the people of Myanmar are suffering A desperate humanitarian and human rights crisis it's getting worse parts of Myanmar are cut off with no internet so it's hard to get information out but there are reports of atrocities being committed by both the military and some of the armed groups in rakine state for example civilians from an ethnic minority called the ringa are reportedly being killed and displaced by the military and the arakan Army which is the main ethnic armed group there you've probably heard of the renga a mostly Muslim minority who've been persecuted for years 750,000 fled to Bangladesh in 2017 to escape what the UN have called genocidal Violence by the military aside from the report of attacks on the renga the broader humanitarian situation in rakine is particularly bad the UN is warning of famine there but people all across Myanmar need help 20 million according to the UN and nowhere near enough Aid is getting in 15 million people don't have enough to eat while Cyclones and floods have destroyed huge areas of farmland and that's really impacted heavily impacted food security now that the resistance controls so much of the country including all of the major Crossing points to Bangladesh India China LA and Thailand there is no excuse not to provide massive humanitarian Relief by land across those land borders and this is a failure of the International System and of myanmar's neighbors not to be undertaking this kind of humanitarian relief start here is all about explaining the news watch our recent video on teros which Donald Trump is talking a lot about right now and follow me on Instagram so you can stay up to date with all the stories we're working on [Music]" />

And in the pocket in the pocket it goes safe and sound with daddy musk was clearly stung by the crack about electric vehicles so he immediately fired back live tweeting &quot;Without me Trump would have lost the election.&quot; and Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 5149 in the Senate yeah you think we've forgotten that buddy buddy have you been to a Tesla dealership lately cuz nobody else has now as soon as Trump was done meeting with Chancellor Brownfiger he he clapped back elon was wearing thin i asked him to leave i took away his EV mandate that forced everyone to buy electric cars that nobody else wanted that he knew for months I was going to do and he just went crazy i'm sorry went crazy elon has always lived the geographic center of insanitude he's not the mayor of crazy town he's the governor of off his Medania also also also I want to point out he says that nobody wanted electric vehicles when Trump himself sold them on the lawn of the White House this is knowing no one wanted them in fact in fact CNN pointed out that Trump himself bought a Tesla that day and it's still parked there at the White House so now Donald Trump is a Tesla owner who hates Elon Musk he's never been more relatable i can't believe it game sees game next Trump escalated the by threatening Musk the easiest way to save money in our budget billions and billions of dollars is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts i was always surprised Biden didn't do it to which to which Elon Musk replied &quot;Go ahead make my day.&quot; Oh you two have already made mine cutting Elon Musk's contracts with the government isn't just petty it's dangerous because as one user pointed out the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft transports astronauts to and from the International Space Station so Elon snarked &quot;In light of the president's statements about cancellation of my government contracts SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.&quot; Okay okay okay so to any astronauts currently in orbit don't get too attached to your current bone density then then I got to say I got to say Yeah you got to say it elon gave us a fun one time to drop the really big bomb donald Trump is in the Epstein files that's the real reason they have not been made public have a nice day DJT oh oh them oh oh oh oh i mean is is is this Twitter war a cheesy gordita crunch wrap supreme because it's dripping hot messy filth and I am eating up every sloppy bite bring it daddy like but by the way Elon a little late on that intel donald Trump was a sexual predator that prayed on young women which is something I've only decided to tell you because he hurt my feelings i am the hero of the story wow trump's going to have to get one of those bumper stickers for his Tesla that says &quot;I bought this before Elon told everyone I was on Epstein's plane.&quot; So let's recap sounds good let us come let us recap together the most powerful man in the world and the richest man in the world each with their own missiles are throwing hay makers at each other like real housewives on the girls trip this this this this could easily get out of control but thankfully a cooler head has stepped in to calm things down kanye tweeted &quot;Bro please no hug emoji we love you both so much.&quot; Yay yay has entered the chat it's Kanye Elon and Trump the easiest game of Mary kill ever cuz cuz obviously I'd kill myself you know you know things are bad when the rational voice mediating your dispute is Kanye West that's like walking into an intervention organized by Captain [Applause] Morgan keep drinking people like you more when you're a little spicy so then I need like a sponge bath at this point i need a towel then as if things couldn't get any juicier Elon Musk retweeted &quot;Trump should be impeached.&quot; That thunder is that thunder oh my Oh oh my sweet lord i I agree with Elon Musk siri what is the current temperature of hell working on it okay but I got to say Elon damn man you were best friends with the guy last Friday did that meaningless key he gave you mean nothing you know what you know what you know what folks i'm just glad Jeff Epstein isn't alive to see any of this would have broken his heart on the sidelines on the sideline steve Bannon has weighed in saying Elon Musk should be deported by Homeland Security okay that's that's that's you knew that was coming i guess you knew that was coming though they are a bit short staffed over there short because many of them are still growing we just learned the Department of Homeland Security's new official overseeing terrorism prevention is a 22year-old 22 how could he possibly know how to stop terrorism when he doesn't even know how to fix a cassette tape with a pencil that's a skill reserved for those of us whose birth year begins with a 19 now this this bull work of national security who I believe cannot legally rent a car yet is Thomas Fugate a former Trump campaign worker who once worked at the Hardright Heritage Foundation where he served as an intern hear that terrorists you mess with him and he will refuse to pick up your dry cleaning on the way to Starbucks fisher macchiato goodbye let's take You know what let's be fair yeah let's Let's take a look at this little fella oh boy okay ter terrorists terrorists cover your drinks now it would be it would be understandable if the idea of a young adult still on his parents' health insurance being in charge of stopping terrorism unnerves you but some folks uh in the news some real news folks found his LinkedIn and he has worked at okay internship uh internship uh another internship and oh landscape business owner okay well that's entrepreneurial what was his portfolio performed lawn care work around my neighborhood my duties consisted of mowing the yard weed whacking the weeds then clean up of debris you mowed your neighbor's lawn you damn fetus you know you know what you know what i'm pretty sure we actually have a picture of your White House interview is that We got a great show for you tonight our guests our CEO of Reo and the creator of Andor Tony Gilwood and when we come back New York [Applause] [Music] [Applause]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="- [Reporter] Amid the fallout between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump- - I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot. - [Reporter] Musk threatened to decommission SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft. That's a big deal for US space missions. - Dragon has been the only US spacecraft launched by a US space company transporting astronauts to and from the station from the US. - I find this to be disconcerting how quickly this went to the threatening from contracts that's not good for the United States. - [Reporter] Musk retracted the threat just hours later. Still, as the feud continues, SpaceX remains one of the largest financial and logistical vulnerabilities for both Musk and Trump. (upbeat music) Since 2008, the government has awarded SpaceX more than 20 billion in contracts across at least 10 different agencies. Most of it is focused here. - NASA needs SpaceX, SpaceX needs NASA. - Musk said recently that SpaceX is expected to generate 1.1 billion in revenue this year from NASA. The company is less dependent on government contracts than it was in the past, but still does big business with agencies. - SpaceX has really deep relationships with a lot of government agencies. Unraveling that would not be easy for either side. - [Reporter] NASA made a push during the Obama administration to contract with commercial companies. - We wanna leap into the future. - We had one launch provider, United Launch Alliance, they were the result of a merger of Lockheed and Boeing. When they consolidated, the costs went up and the US lost market share to the rest of the world, namely China, France and Russia. We set up competitions, and SpaceX has been by far the leader in these major competitions. - Elon brought the cost of his Dragon down to under a billion, and then under hundreds of millions. I mean, just the savings are wonderful from a customer perspective because I can now purchase services rather than have to do them all in-house myself. - [Reporter] Since then, NASA has obligated more than 15 billion in awards to SpaceX, including 2.9 billion to develop a human landing system as part of the Artemis program. In 2022, NASA said the contract for ferrying astronauts to and from the ISS would total 4.9 billion - Beyond sort of the dollars and cents, as we've been talking about with these astronaut missions, it's SpaceX that has been allowing NASA to do some of its highest-profile operations. - When NASA says it's safe to fly on a SpaceX rocket, the world will follow. The governments, industries, anyone will say, &quot;If it's good enough for NASA, it's good enough for us.&quot; - [Reporter] SpaceX recently had to step in when another NASA contractor, Boeing, wasn't able to bring back two astronauts from the ISS. - The fact that SpaceX was tapped by NASA last summer to bring those two astronauts back to Earth, NASA did not want Boeing to sort of finish that job, shows how comfortable NASA is or has gotten over the years with using SpaceX and the trust that the agency has that the vehicle and the operational side of it works and can be safe. It also very much did highlight the dependence NASA has on SpaceX for this particular operation. - [Reporter] Between Starlink flights and missions for outside customers, SpaceX carried out nearly double the amount of launches than the next three most active companies combined. - That is like a huge ongoing, you know, business and something that SpaceX is expected to be doing for years to come. - [Reporter] Agencies also contract SpaceXperts' own satellites, it's growing and strategically important Starlink system. - You see sort of Starlink popping up in everything from military bases or government agencies needing some kind of satellite internet solution. - [Reporter] One of the most notable contracts is one to provide Starlink to Ukraine. - A lot of military officials who are thinking about the future of war have been obsessed and really interested in how the Ukrainians have used Starlink. That experience in that conflict zone has created just a lot of awareness at the Pentagon, and frankly, in governments around the world about the need for fast, reliable, secure communications in conflict areas. - [Reporter] Starlink is also a big revenue generator for SpaceX outside of the government. Quilty Space, a consulting firm, estimated that Starlink revenue is set to grow to 12.3 billion this year. - Starlink has provided a very significant revenue source for SpaceX that isn't dependent on government contracts and the budget cycles in Washington and all the rest. - [Reporter] SpaceX has a number of important future projects with the US government lined up. - SpaceX, because they've been successful, have been built into the ecosystem and the architectures of future missions for both NASA and also the Department of Defense and other Spacefaring agencies. So a lot of the US government is dependent upon SpaceX for their very good vehicles. - [Reporter] It's not just responsible for shuttling people and supplies to the ISS, it was also selected to deorbit the station at the end of its operational life in 2030. And in April, 2025, the company was awarded almost $6 billion from the Department of Defense for future satellite launches. SpaceX also submitted a proposal for Trump's Golden Dome, a missile defense shield that combines ground-based interceptors with satellites. - A lot of people I've talked to believe that SpaceX will have to be involved one way or the other in that because it has the most launch capacity, and of course, it's also developing a huge new vehicle that could potentially be involved in the future. - [Reporter] So with all of this, what does it mean for SpaceX and NASA in Musk and Trump's potential divorce? - Getting more competition is probably the biggest answer. Elon himself says he wants competition. Unfortunately, SpaceX is so far ahead in so many areas, that will take years. - [Reporter] NASA experts think that a full breakup is unlikely. - SpaceX, Elon have every incentive to do this work. It all supports what his long-term vision is, as stated to colonize Mars and make life interplanetary, make humanity interplanetary. - Ideally, we can take anyone who wants to go to Mars, we can take to Mars. - [Reporter] A NASA spokesperson said in a statement that NASA will continue to execute upon the President's vision for the future of space, and that they will continue to work with industry partners to ensure the president's objectives in space are met.

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] ants are among the most numerous widespread and frequently exploited members of the undergrowth these in australia collect seeds and store them underground plants encourage them to do so by adding a tasty capsule to their seeds that may seem odd but these ants don't eat all the seeds they store in fact seeds are more likely to germinate below ground than above but not everything on this forest floor is what it seems when it comes to putting your eggs in a suitable place some insects persuade other insects to do the job for them this little object looks like a seed and certainly it's fallen from above and that ant seems to think it's worth eating but actually it hasn't come from a plant it's come from another insect and this is it it's rather difficult to see because it looks exactly like a dried leaf but it's a stick insect as its head antennae and that's the tip of its abdomen as an adult like this it spends all its time up in the trees eating leaves and when the time comes to lay and this one is doing so all she does is simply to flick away the egg and let it fall to the ground but that's not quite as risky as you might think wherever you are you can be pretty sure that some ants will turn up looking for food and that is exactly what the stick insects eggs look like a nutritious seed complete with that fatty capsule at the tip so the ants start to haul them away although the ants certainly eat a great number of the seeds they store stick insect eggs don't seem to be quite as tempting at any rate the ants after all their labor usually leave their stick insect legs untouched [Music] while the seasons pass the eggs lie underground hidden from birds and any other predators that might eat them they may remain there safe for up to three years but eventually they hatch [Music] it's only at this early stage of its life that a stick insect actually runs the youngsters positively scamper up into the tree branches [Music] there they will take up their adult life of leisure well camouflaged solidly chewing leaves giving your offspring a good start in life can take a lot of effort so some insects have evolved highly complex strategies to induce other species to become nurse maids on their behalf this californian desert hardly seems to be the best place to find nurse maids but blister beetles have an amazing way of discovering them it starts simply enough with the female beetle she has dug a hole and is now laying her eggs in it that done she abandons them a few centimeters below the surface of the sand conditions are good for eggs not too cold neither too hot even in the heat of the day six weeks later they hatch but these sands are very barren and scorching hot somehow the tiny larvae have got to find food and they won't find it here their survival depends on teamwork together as a closely coordinated group they climb up a stem of withered grass [Music] when they get to the top there's nowhere else to go they look dangerously exposed to the sun and to other predators but there they stay in a tight squirming mass for those that can get there the top of this stem has become a stage for a remarkable piece of deception what these larvae want is a lift a ride and they want it so badly that sometimes they'll even try and get it from a human finger what they're really searching for is not a human finger they're searching for another insect here it comes a female digger bee leaving a tunnel that she's just dug for her own young she's off to gather pollen she packs it into baskets on her back legs and takes it back to her burrow it'll provide valuable food for her young when they eventually hatch and here comes a male he's on the lookout for a female [Music] to him the cluster not only looks like a female it smells like a female for the beetle larvae are producing a perfume a pheromone that is exactly like that emitted by a female bee he alights in order to mate and in seconds is covered by the larvae that swarm all over him at first he seems stunned by the shock of his sudden increase in weight but then he's off again now his luck improves this really is a female and while he mates his passengers jump ship now they're all on board a female bee she having mated goes back to her nest to lay taking the larvae with her at last the young beetle larvae have reached safety and food the sword of pollen that the female digger bee worked so hard to collect for her own young so they hop off and tuck in not only do they consume the pollen when that runs out they will eat the young bee larvae too around the world people are now devoting their lives to saving some of the most threatened sea creatures as here in the caribbean every year on just a few islands a remarkable event takes place as the sun sets giant reptiles begin to emerge this magnificent creature preparing whoops preparing to lay her eggs is the largest of all turtles a leatherback they can grow up to half a ton in weight and they have an ancestry that goes back 100 million years to the age of the dinosaur but in recent times their numbers have fallen catastrophically here however in the caribbean there is hope leatherback turtles leave the sea in order to lay their eggs in the dry sand but out of water these huge creatures are easy targets for hunters in a small fishing village in trinidad len peters has experienced this first hand i grew up in a household where the presence of filter meat was normal the fridge is always full of it everybody everybody harvests the turtles including my parents it's only when i became exposed to things that would be published about leather basil and the booze of extinction and nobody cares that peaked my interest len took the leatherback's future into his own hands he began patrolling the beach at night to protect the turtles a brave thing to do we were met with tremendous resistance people would pelt us at night i have had persons um insult me and my heart person cursed me or that person physically tried to to wrestle me with a machete so it was really a hostile time back then if len was going to save these turtles he needed to win over the whole community we had to find a way to get the villagers to benefit from the presence of these animals he began to encourage tourists to visit the beach and train some villagers to be their guides to help secure the turtle's future he took the message to the next generation now what's what's the largest size a leatherback can grow to uh shawnee and that's correct leatherbacks can grow to two thousand pounds that's a big tooth lens hard work paid off and now attitudes have changed so many things you want to accomplish tonight it took us a while to reach out to the villagers but gradually we got them involved as well we got some of the poachers who would be hunting the animals to be part of the conservation program well as protecting the adult turtles the team also collect any eggs that might be flooded at high tide if the eggs are laid too close to the sea we relocate the eggs and we bury them thanks to the efforts of this community these turtles have had an extraordinary change in fortune this is now thought to be one of the densest leatherback nesting beaches in the world [Music] when we started at the height of the nesting season the numbers will be 30 40 turtles a night now it's over 500 so we have seen an increase from 40 turtles to 500 of those a night in just around 20 years precious new hatchlings are also given a helping hand any that emerged during the day are collected to be released safely back to the sea away from hungry birds this little leatherback will have to face a thousand hazards before it returns as an adult to this beach where it hatched and those dangers will be greatly increased because of damage that we have done to the oceans good luck little leatherback [Music] [Music] [Music] so you might think that this iron is washing socks as some kind of circus trick for which he's been specially trained but not so she is doing this entirely on her own initiative she's seen others doing it and she's copying and that ability to imitate as well as to use tools is something which started among monkeys but has been brought to a much greater level among the apes and those two talents were ultimately the lead to the transformation of the world [Music] camp leaky in borneo is home to a special group of orangs who have been rescued from captivity and returned to the wild because they've lived partly in our world as well as theirs they can give us an insight into what we have in common this old lady loves diy so does her son who was born in the wild even her infant is interested very striking when you sit as close to an orangutan as this to see how similar they are to human beings we are both of course great apes but look how human her hand is the skill with which she picks things up the way that she can grasp a tool like that the way she uses her brain to imitate what she's seen others doing but the most important thing we share is our big brain it's that that has produced so many of the talents and abilities that we have in common in this tree there is one of the most extraordinary plant predators it's one animal that i don't need to sneak up on this extraordinary creature is half blind half death and this is just about as fast as it can move that's what can happen to you if you live on nothing but leaves it's a sloth it's not exactly an enthusiastic leaf eater a couple of half-hearted chews and the leaves go straight down to its stomach leaves however are not easily digested the slaves technique is to give them time then eventually this mobile compost heap pulls itself together and starts on a long and dangerous journey this is a very unusual sight a sloth in a hurry it wants to defecate and the only place it's happy doing that oddly enough is down on the ground it only does it about once a week but why does it come down to the ground to do it and why does it nearly always choose to do so in exactly the same place whatever the reason it must be very important for a sloth on the ground is almost helpless any predator could attack it and it doesn't have the speed to escape why it comes down in this way is a mystery nobody knows now he's finished and back he goes up to the safety of the canopy leaves are not very nutritious the sloth's way of compensating for that is not to eat more but to do less its claws hook over the branches so that the sloth can hang without any effort of its muscles which have been reduced to thin ribbons and to save energy it spends most of its time hanging around half asleep in the treetops so with very little muscle and a reaction time only a quarter as fast as ours how does a sloths day compare with our day in the time it takes me to write a few letters the sloth just about manages to groom itself while we have our lunch the sloth nibbles a few leaves and then as we film the sequence for the series it's time for another [Music] what bird has the most elaborate the most complex most beautiful song in the world and i guess there are lots of contenders but this bird must be one of them the superb live bird of southern australia he clears a space in the forest to service his concert to platform females to come close and admire his plumes he sings the most complex song he can manage and he does that by copying the songs of all the other birds he hears around him such as the kookaburra it's a very convincing impersonation [Music] [Laughter] even the original is fooled he can imitate the calls of at least 20 different species he also in his attempt to out sing his rivals incorporates other sounds that he hears in the forest that was a camera shutter and again and now a camera with a motor drive and that's a power alarm and now the sounds of foresters and their chainsaws working nearby [Applause] [Music] [Applause] already cities like miami here are under threat scientists predict that by the end of the century the sea levels could have risen by a meter or even two well that to happen parts of this city would certainly be submerged around the world hundreds of millions of people live near the coast and as sea levels rise their lives will be seriously affected [Music] it's now clear that our actions are having a significant impact on the world's oceans during the four years it took to make this series we've witnessed many of these changes first hand [Music] but we've also worked alongside men and women dedicating their lives to safeguarding the ocean's future the oceans provide us with oxygen they regulate temperature they provide us with food and energy supplies and it's unthinkable to have a world without a healthy ocean i still think we have the capability to change the manner in which we're wasting the resources in which we're poisoning our oceans and we can look to a future with healthy oceans when i look forward i believe that if what we are doing can be duplicated just a little bit these animals will have a chance of surviving it comes down i think to us each taking responsibility for the personal choices in our everyday lives that's all any of us can be expected to do and it is those everyday choices that add up we are at a unique stage in our history never before have we had such an awareness of what we are doing to the planet and never before have we have the power to do something about that surely we have a responsibility to care for our blue planet the future of humanity and indeed all life on earth now depends on us you" />

have been in the headlines this week You are lending your voice to a very important uh situation Tell us about that Uh I've just come back from Katana Sicily where we were seeing off uh a small boat called the Madlin uh and its mission is to uh leave with a hold full of humanitarian aid and it's going to head to um Gaza to try and break the blockade Mhm Um and that's what we were doing for the last few days And there was a lot of press there and um and celebrations and and uh flag waving and protests and and these beautiful hum of humanity people who are on this boat are um doing what the international community should be doing What's on board the vessel i mean people will see Greta Tunberg is of course probably the most prominent name on board But in terms of actual aid on board there are uh the stuff that the IDF want to lay in crutches um there are antibiotics baby formula um uh I think there's morphine because a lot of people in extraordinary pain mostly medical and there is also which I find kind of heartbreaking there is a a 3D printed prosthetic baby's arm that they're bringing as well uh um and um and hoping they their voyage won't be impeded Uh you well on that topic of being impeded you mentioned the blockade Um at this point in the abstract what is the likelihood of your colleagues being able to land that flea well we have no idea Uh because you're you're if you're dealing with a sane government um there would be some predictability and there would be some sort of um diplomatic at very least um conversation Um but these uh uh people in power in in Tel Aviv uh we've seen what they can do They've already although they didn't admit it who else could it be they did destroy a boat or ex damage it heavily in Malta and they sent in two uh drones um to take out the the ship So this is a replacement boat uh that unfortunately only takes 12 crew and eight volunteers Um so um basically anything can happen We've there's already been threats There's already been um drones in the air at nighttime Uh so the intimidation has begun But what they will do the closer the guys get to the off the coast of Gaza is is uh is anybody's guess I mean it is a very brave endeavor in terms of the individuals who are traveling on the flutella You mentioned at the start there though it's something that governments should be doing Well 100% according to international law and I've even thrown myself into having a look at what the G Geneva conventions require of a government This is not suggestions if there is a uh a visible genocide and t-sh Martin used the word in in in government and uh to use that word um uh leads you down the path of necessary legal uh obligations And one of them is is that it it's very specific even if it's not in your state You are obliged legally to intervene in in a genocide And this uh legislation came on the back with the International Court of Justice and the ICC on the back of the horrific Holocaust and genocide of uh the Jewish people in World War II So um uh legally and I said this yesterday in an interview we should be sending the navy filled our navy with on a humanitarian mission uh to to deliver this stuff and uh and if we don't do it then it not it it not only brings shame on ourselves it brings um a a sense of destruction on the international rules based order which is we are responsible for We are the caretakers of international law until it's handed on to the next generation and it's falling apart in front of us It's it's appalling It's clear to see that the public here is very much on board with this in terms of support for the Palestinian people All of the polls we've seen in the papers even over the last number of weekends show that the government has said they've done things like they recognize the state of Palestine They said they're pushing forward with the occupied territories bill Now people will dispute how much impact that's going to have particularly because services may not be included in that but it is when you put it like that when you see international law and what it says when you see wrong happening in terms of breaches of international human rights law you have to intervene it almost makes it difficult to understand for people out there why why aren't we doing more why are we only doing this here and that here I mean is that what you think that's where you think the public is at with this is that we're very good at saying that there's a problem there Ireland has been as I described previously one of the least worst countries in terms of speaking out about it But in terms of action do you agree that we don't feel to be or seem to be able to get that next step forward in terms of sticking our necks out the the the words aren't working That's uh obvious because of the damage that we've seen to to the the Palestinian people since we've recognized Palestine since uh since ME Martin has said it's genocide Um it's not enough We we need action in the time But I'm I I'm not sick hearing the words and uh and we're on the side of the oppressed and blah blah blah If you do nothing then the words mean nothing Um so I prefer not to hear them talking about it at all because that just reflects their actions and we really need to do we need to step up We are we're in a wonderful position We're a small country We're not militarily aligned with anybody uh um and we can be an honest broker and especially from a country that suffered occupation for 700 years Um we we feel it we know the game you know we're also a country that it's very easy to look at it that we suffered two genocides here I mean don't forget that you know and these are British establishment figures uh when Oliver Cromwell was here for the 9 months he was here and left his new model army for an additional 3 years the the figures are from the British that 40% of our population was slaughtered that was the first one and you can be in no doubt that we although we give it this magnificent romantic phrase the great hunger that was a genocide I mean they did the same thing in India there was 50 ships a day leaving Ireland filling the shops in in in England while our famine was going on and they had Lass say fair let them get on with it Nothing to do with us They were occupying our country They were in charge of that and we lost the estimates are a million people and a million and a half or two two million went you know left the country For for Ireland not to have sympathy with the plight of the Palestinians would be the bizarest thing on the planet if we weren't sympathetic at the very least Well the government would say that it goes beyond because of the government not here to represent itself I'm going to re relay its view which would be that it's effectively from a European standpoint it's almost bestin-class that it has recognized Palestinian statehood that it has at least taken a cabinet decision to progress with a version of the occupied territories bill that it's one of the first governments to call for an outright suspension and a outright review of the trade association deal there between the European Union and Israel You obviously don't feel that's enough the government would say that it's kind of it's wedded to this kind of multilateral worldwide view of trying to move in concert and trying to bring the rest of the world along with it Uh well the one one provisor that I believe is in the EU is that each country is responsible for its own foreign affairs right it's with trade and stuff like that it's different uh this is very much about foreign affairs uh with a with a country that is committing genocide um when you compare to hold us up as a beacon in in the EU and yesterday and today uh when the French dockers um have impounded or thrown to one side 14 tons tons of uh munitions and machine gun parts whatever they are going going to is supported by the ditch Yeah And Yeah And then today they found more containers So one of the leading lights of the EU is supplying arms to a genocidal regime So to hold us up as a beacon when you've got that standard below us doesn't make us look too good Liam what's your read on what's holding us back then from from doing this what like Well it's fear obviously but I mean the Americans are incredibly powerful and I'm sure there's been a few whispers in the year ears of we'll take this away or we'll repatriate our large businesses or whatever it may be It's been reported I mean the ambassador said that to to the last year wasn't it that you know this will impact a thousand US companies if you go forward with the OTB Yeah So the thing is if you well the OTB is one thing but what about you know as you mentioned there the Navy going out with aid Well that would be a legal obligation It's not a case of you know let's go gung-ho and let's break this thing we if we don't do it we're breaking international law and because everybody else is not doing it doesn't make it all right Um we really I mean look that would be a huge step to to do that but the very least we should stop doing business with a country that's committing genocide I mean this is not a big ask And if you're putting a spreadsheet or or the success of Q4 ahead of the dismemberment of children then then you you're you're morally bankrupt That's it On the aid situation because obviously the flatillaa is going to bring in a small amount of aid That's that's the objective of this While there are thousands and thousands of trucks currently sitting outside Gaza not being permitted to go in One of the things I've seen you be quite critical of over the last number of months has been news coverage of this um the situation in Gaza particularly around aid has been there's been it's been so noticeable to see Western news organizations for example with regards to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation as it's been described Yeah It's just been it's just disbanded hasn't it they've just cut it off They say that they're restoring the aid distribution as they put it to centers this evening there But it's been interesting that there was all these headlines around the world of the blockade has been lifted It's the end of the blockade It certainly hasn't by anyone's measure So I mean do you think that that's actually creating a level of distrust generally in Western media because if we can't call a spade a spade in this country or in Britain or in the states when everybody can see clearly what's happening in their own eyes they can see what's being live streamed from Palestinians there as well Then what are we doing here as journalists uh we're bathing in fear It's not it's not a case of if we do something It it what people are worried about here and specifically in the government is what are the repercussions if we do something It's kicking the can down the road and we've seen it with with many of the difficult decisions that government when they set up the community whatever it is those uh uh those gettogethers to uh deal with the poison chalice Uh and it's one of those uh there's it's it's uh it's dealing with the obfiscation Um and I mean for instance what you were talking about that that MOSAD funded according to drop site news I think they they discovered that that what are they called GFD or something ghf humanitarian foundation Yes Yes So they are somebody some there is a report that they have traced the money back to a MOSAD uh operation and either way it's Israeli sanctioned anyway which goes against the general principles of how a absolutely and if you look at it none of the aid agencies including the UN will have anything to do with it because these people are totally inexperienced there's been what 460 shot at these at these centers and they're calling them in and when they called them in yesterday the Israeli head stated that those centers have now become combat zones So anybody comes into them is going to be shot after beckoning them uh to to get their limited aid there So they can't be on the ground there and communication is difficult Then you don't know which center you're going to which is a target and which one is a safe zone Well they were queuing because they were given the word that the that the centers were going to open up at 7:00 a.m I think it was 8:00 a.m and there was a huge amount of people at 3:00 a.m So as soon as they opened there was a huge rush They panicked and just opened fire on on unarmed people scrambling for food We can't allow that to continue It's the it's the it's shooting fish in a barrel as the Americans used to say about it in Iraq Speaking of the flotilla itself you were telling us on the way in that the original plan was for it to hopefully land on Sunday or at least to make it to the gas and coastline on Sunday Um you were telling us that there's a bit of new development which might at least weigh that timetable Yes So I just had a call just before I came in I was sitting in the car and uh the wonderful Queever Butterly who's a huge part of the flotilla um uh she gave me a ring and uh they got a distress call this morning from a sinking uh inflatable rib uh with uh migrants from Libya on it They were the closest vessel So under international law is their duty as a ship to go and uh to go and rescue them Uh the um rib was uh uh deflating rapidly uh to the extent that uh four or four or five uh of the occupants of the rib craft dived into the sea and had to be rescued by the maline the boat we've just been talking about H and they are now in in in possession of these uh unfortunate sudin who are trying to escape the madness of Libya Uh and they are now in a bit of a quandry about what to do with them They they want them picked up They are also in uh very uh tense about if they do head for Cree to to uh uh deliver these uh unfortunate migrants that they may be impounded The Greeks are have a very very questionable relationship with the Israelis at the moment Um and uh they're worried that the ship might be uh impounded but that's ongoing You can't stop in Libya on the way back because if that's where the Sudin people have come from you can't state they've come from if if we handed them over to cuz the Libyan Coast Guard was there Yeah Uh and they would uh return them to Libya which for people seeking asylum is is highly illegal under Bringing them on their mission an option No I shouldn't I shouldn't think so I'm not sure they have the capability The maximum they could keep on the boat with the amount of humanitarian aid was eight volunteers It's it's quite it's a smallish boat Yeah we we saw some of the overhead pictures People might have actually seen them in our reports earlier in the week Actually some overhead drone footage as it was disembarking from from Sicily It is a relatively small boat Yes it is And we were buzzed Just before they took off a military helicopter came down incredibly low into where people were bathing in the harbor and stuff and and basically buzzed buzzed the boat just before they came in just just to let them know we were being watched I mean how juvenile can you get it's just it's pathetic Just by people like yourself and by Greta Tunberg taking part in this Obviously it does help to get word out about these situations when you do have high-profile people putting themselves forward like this I've seen people have been very critical of Greta Tunberg you know a young woman of course who has you know put herself and put the planet first in many ways before Have you faced any repercussions from your stance on Gaza no You know what's funny and I completely understand the question uh especially uh because I do a fair bit of work with with companies from the states Um it really is the king is only the king as long as the people think he's the king Uh and if anybody has put me on a list because they don't like my humanitarian pro approach to our beautiful species um they're not people I want to work with anyway So uh and I've said this before whatever shadowy list that I might be on or some of my fellow mouthy people uh might be on the list that I have is a hell of a lot longer than the list I might be on Yeah So no I'm no impediment to work at this point There's no there's no The only impediment is to work with people I didn't want to work with in the first place That's fine It's a good position to be in isn't it yeah I think it's good Stand by your principles You got to Yeah Taking this forward I mean because this has been something which is ongoing It's now in a real deep humanitarian crisis this point in time 600 trucks a day need to need to get in I think the last reckoning by the International Red Cross was that 600 boxes at a max we're actually getting into Gaza 2 million people starving And the five trucks put the put the hair up on the back of my neck The five trucks that got in after Israel broke the ceasefire two of those trucks had death shrouds in them That's was all that was delivered of those five trucks the two of them were were I think a Saudi Arabian um gift and they were shrouds for the dead But we're all sitting here and we're all watching this I actually spoke with Mary Robinson about this recently that she worries about the mental health aspect on on on us which is almost a luxury to be in a position where we can worry about that Yes But you look at the situation that is unfolding before our eyes on a daily basis where you're seeing a people being starved on a daily basis kids dying of malnutrition literally starving in the streets at this point in time How do you think we're all going to look back at this period in the world's history when there are there's so much enormous wealth there's so much you know we talk the talk in terms of international human rights and with regards to the West being a leader and we respect international law all of these things And yet here we all are going back to October of 2023 and we we've let this happen Uh yes we haven't We haven't The impunity is well the impunity have been going on forever So the reason they're doing it is because they weren't slapped on the wrist for doing it before with Operation Castled with all all the various um uh batterings that Gaza has had And let's not forget about the West Bank what's going on there And and even in my profession the guy who just won the Oscar Yeah Um his uh his village has been raised to the ground Um and and there's an Irish woman in her 70 years old is in is in detention at the minute Uh I'd like to know what our government is doing about uh getting her Uh and very interesting uh that Israel holds the deportation meetings You know where they hold them at the airport Like you're going to win that case aren't you that's where the that's where the uh the deportation uh um cases are held at the airport Yeah But how do you think this is going to be looked back at this period it's it's a shameful period It's going to be a shameful period And as I've said before uh one of the things that's important I mean my kids are grown up now and they and they are very much um about the haters of injustice I should hope I battered that into them Um but I am not having my grandkids growing up and when they're reading about this saying uh what did you do during there i at least I can throw my social media at them and and stuff like this uh and say look I I I did what I could I roared about it I tried to um get more people to speak Um it's the people who are saying nothing Have you got your answers ready for your kids or your grandkids when they're hitting secondary school and they're reading about this uh and as I said before in World War II you could say we didn't know about the Holocaust We didn't The vast majority of us this genocide is in 4K on your telly Uh and uh your only answer you're going you're not going to be able to say &quot;I didn't know.&quot; The only answer you're going to be able to give to your kids is &quot;I didn't care.&quot; And that is not uh is that something you want your kid to think of you that you did nothing when that was happening right I'm not prepared to to to give that answer to my kids or grandkids For Irish people who have spoken out I just saw a column in the spectator of all places today by Brendan O'Neal Ireland has been consumed by hatred of Israel He says &quot;A new religion blights the Republic of Ireland Catholicism has been supplanted by a far more cultish creed Uh he goes on to say its name is Israel phobia He says he knew Ireland was hostile to Israel but I had no idea how bad things had got Everywhere you go he says you see the swirling animus for the state The political class speaks of little else The media media are ferventishly obsessed Uh the cry goes out that Israel is evil It's inescapable He says it's all over Dublin along a hotbed of leftish activism he says I'm not sure I'd agree with that necessarily but this this targeting of of of Ireland internationally but the point would be by the British media or American media We've seen it on Fox and Friends where they describe Miho Martin as a socialist and very left Um this is something which is you know it's been is being described and it has been thrown around at Irish people for speaking out about humanitarian issues in Gaza I mean what do you make about the way that Ireland has been targeted miho or Michael Higgins excuse me says that it has been a slander effectively on our nation It's absolutely right But listen it's bully boy tactics and most of the people you quote there and the people in in the states you have to remember they're to the right of a tilla the hon they have no credibility at all I mean anybody in the in the states in the political system over there has has completely lost any uh right to speak about a healthy political system I mean it's it's incredible I mean the the uh the J1 visas the students have all been told scrape your social media go in This is like McCarthyism is back in the states So anything any of these people say is not worth the uh the bribery check it's written" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="The Angolan Civil War was one of the most important, long-running and brutal conflicts of modern African history. Angola’s journey from colonial rule to independence and through decades of civil war is a tragic yet pivotal chapter in international relations. Following its struggle for independence from Portugal, Angola was thrust into a 27-year civil war, which became one of the most brutal Cold War proxy conflicts. The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), backed by the Soviet Union and Cuba, clashed with the United States and South Africa-supported National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). This devastating war left millions dead, displaced countless others, and turned Angola into a battleground for Cold War rivalries. The country’s rich natural resources, including oil and diamonds, were critical in fueling the conflict, further entrenching Angola in the global geopolitical struggle.&#10;&#10;Despite a ceasefire in 2002 and remarkable post-war economic growth driven by its oil industry, Angola continues to grapple with the long-lasting effects of its turbulent history. Generations traumatised by war face ongoing challenges, including widespread poverty, corruption, and underdevelopment. Landmines still scar the landscape, hindering agricultural recovery, while political dominance by the MPLA raises concerns about democracy and governance. Angola’s story exemplifies how Cold War power struggles devastated local populations, shaping the modern history of Africa and global geopolitics.&#10;&#10;MY LATEST BOOK!&#10;Secession and State Creation: What Everyone Needs to Know&#10;Oxford University Press https://global.oup.com/academic/produ...&#10;Amazon https://amzn.to/2MPY3W2&#10;Audiobooks.com https://www.audiobooks.co.uk/audioboo...&#10;&#10;SUPPORT THE CHANNEL&#10;Hello and welcome!

          <attvalue for="7" value="For over 40 years, Angola was locked in  conflict. Following a war for independence,   it was plunged into one of the most  brutal civil wars of modern times. In addition to a fight for control  between local factions, the country   became a centre of superpower rivalries  as the United States, Soviet Union, Cuba,   and South Africa were all drawn into what  became a devastating armed confrontation. But just how did the struggle to end colonization   spiral into decades of warfare that left millions  dead and displaced and profoundly changed Africa? Hello and welcome! If you're new to the  channel, my name is James Ker-Lindsay,   and here I take an informed look at international  relations, conflict, security, and statehood. We tend to think of the Cold War  as a confrontation between the two   superpowers and their allies that never  escalated into direct armed conflict. Indeed, the term &quot;Cold War&quot;   deliberately separates it from the usual  form of hot militarized confrontations. And yet, in truth, the Cold  War was far from peaceful. Over four and a half decades, many wars and  conflicts emerged as local proxies for the   United States and the Soviet Union fought for  control across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. One of the best examples is the Angolan Civil War. Emerging from a decade-long  anti-colonial quest for independence,   it became one of Africa's most  prolonged and brutal conflicts. As local forces fought each other, outside powers,  including the United States and the Soviet Union,   became deeply involved, turning the country's  war into one of the most significant, deadly,   and devastating Cold War proxy conflicts. The Republic of Angola is located in  southwestern Africa at approximately 1   and a quarter million square kilometers,  or around 480,000 square miles. It's the continent's seventh-largest country. Namibia borders it to the  south, Zambia lies to its east,   and the Democratic Republic  of the Congo is to the north. The Atlantic Ocean lies to the country's west. Today, the population is around 36 million and  is divided into three predominant ethnic groups:   the Ovimbundu, the Ambundu, and the Bakongo. The country is also rich in natural resources. In addition to oil and diamonds, which  have long underpinned the economy,   it has significant reserves of other minerals,  including iron ore, copper, and gold. Angola has a long and rich history, once  home to several significant African kingdoms. Our story really starts in the  late 15th century when European   explorers first arrived along  the country's Atlantic coast. By the 16th century, Portugal  had established a foothold. This would have devastating consequences   as Angola became a central hub of the  Portuguese transatlantic slave trade. Over the following centuries, millions of Angolans  were forcibly taken to colonies such as Brazil. Although Portuguese control initially  remained confined to coastal areas,   relying on alliances with local  kingdoms, by the late 19th century,   the slave trade had been abolished,  and Portugal began expanding inland. As the European &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot; unfolded,  Portugal strengthened its authority over the   entire country, and by the start of the 20th  century, it completely controlled Angola. It profited from the country's vast economic   wealth and subjected the local  population to harsh colonial rule. While most European colonial powers  began to decolonize after the end of   the Second World War, Portugal refused  to give up its overseas territories. With its rich natural resources and fertile land,   Angola was simply too vital to  Portugal's economic interests. As a result, in 1956, urban intellectuals  and left-leaning activists founded the   Marxist-oriented Popular Movement for  the Liberation of Angola, the MPLA. This drew its support primarily from the Ambundu,   the country's second-largest ethnic  group, as well as from urban elites. As it pressed for an end to colonial rule,   the group sought international backing from  the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Meanwhile, as anger steadily grew over  continued Portuguese colonial rule,   two uprisings emerged in 1961. The first saw plantation workers  protest about harsh labor practices. Following this, Angolan nationalists attacked  prisons and administrative buildings. As Portuguese forces brutally suppressed  both rebellions, the Angolan War of   Independence began, as widespread opposition  to Portuguese colonial rule now took hold. Two more groups would emerge. The first was the National Front  for the Liberation of Angola,   the FNLA, established in 1962. It was based in the north and drew support from  the Bakongo, Angola's third-largest ethnic group. Meanwhile, in 1966, the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, was formed. Based in central and southern Angola,   this represented the Ovimbundu,  the country's largest ethnic group. As a result, by the late 1960s, the  war had intensified as the three   major nationalist groups fought  to end Portuguese colonial rule. However, despite the escalating human  and economic cost of the conflict,   the military administration then in power in  Portugal refused to give up control of Angola. That was until April 1974. Following a left-wing  military coup that overthrew the regime in what's   known as the Carnation Revolution, Portugal  began a rapid process of decolonisation. Just 18 months later, on 11 November 1975, Angola became independent. I hope you're finding this useful. If so, please do give it a like and  perhaps subscribe if you haven't already. Thanks so much, and now back to the video. While Portugal's departure was hailed as  a significant step forward for Angola,   any hopes that it would lead to a  bright new future were short-lived. From the very start, the  country was deeply divided. In November 1975, the MPLA, led by Agostinho Neto,   declared itself the government of  the People's Republic of Angola. However, its effective control was  limited to the capital, Luanda. Elsewhere, the FNLA and UNITA had seized  effective control of what they respectively   called the Democratic Republic of Angola and  the Social Democratic Republic of Angola. As Moscow backed the MPLA, its Caribbean ally,   Cuba, soon began sending thousands of  troops to support the Luanda government. All this saw the MPLA make rapid  headway across the country. Faced with these advances, the FNLA  and UNITA now received support from the   United States and nearby apartheid South Africa,   both of which were determined to stop the  spread of communism in southern Africa. But despite this international backing, the FNLA  was soon forced to retreat into neighboring Congo,   then known as Zaire, where it ceased  to be an effective military force. Instead, the conflict now became centered on the   Western- and South African-backed UNITA  and the Soviet- and Cuban-supported MPLA. By the start of the 1980s, the MPLA,  now led by José Eduardo dos Santos,   controlled much of Angola. But as intense fighting continued, the first  attempts to resolve the conflict began in 1984. The sides signed the Lusaka Accords. Although this led to a ceasefire  and envisioned the withdrawal of   South African forces, the two sides soon  disagreed over the terms of the deal. As a result, the agreement had collapsed  by May 1985, and fighting resumed. Ultimately, it would be another three years  before things began to change in earnest. In 1988, following a seven-month battle between  the sides and their foreign backers—one of the   largest and most significant confrontations  in modern African history—new talks began. Against the backdrop of thawing superpower  tensions and the gradual end of the Cold War,   the UN was able to broker another deal. The so-called Tripartite Accord saw South  Africa agree to pull out of Angola and end its   colonial control over neighboring Namibia,  which gained independence in March 1990. Cuba also agreed to withdraw  its forces from Angola. While the era of foreign intervention  was now over and the Cold War had come   to an end, the fighting nevertheless  continued between the MPLA and UNITA. But things were beginning to change. After decades of conflict, Angola was devastated. As well as the vast loss of life, millions  had been forced to flee their homes,   and the country's infrastructure  and economy lay in ruins. As a result, in 1991, the sides  signed another peace agreement,   the Bicesse Accords, which paved  the way for national elections. But again, hopes for peace  proved to be short-lived. While the MPLA claimed victory,   UNITA argued that the vote had been  rigged, and fighting again resumed. But while another deal, the Lusaka Protocol,  followed in 1994, this too soon collapsed,   plunging the country back  into full-scale civil war. By the end of the 1990s and  following several peace attempts,   the sides were under growing international  pressure to end their 25-year conflict. This included UN-imposed sanctions on UNITA,   which had turned to mining  diamonds to fund its campaign. Despite this, the organization  vowed to continue the fight. In the end, though, the critical  turning point came in February 2002,   when Jonas Savimbi, the long-standing  leader of UNITA, was killed in battle. From there, things rapidly changed. As the remaining UNITA leaders gave up the  fight, two months later, in April 2002, the   group signed a ceasefire agreement with the MPLA  government, thus ending the Angolan Civil War. The legacy of the fighting was, of course, huge. The 27-year civil war, which  had followed over a decade   and a half of conflict against Portuguese  colonial rule, had devastated the country. Most crucially, it had an  enormous effect on the population. It is estimated that up to a million  people were killed in the fighting. Meanwhile, millions more  were wounded or displaced. Even after the war ended, the  human effects continued to be   felt and are still profoundly shaping the country. Several generations grew  up knowing nothing but war. This left the population highly  traumatized despite reconciliation efforts. Meanwhile, the country is  still littered with landmines. Aside from the continuing threat to life,  this also hinders the development of farming. On top of this, the war affected almost  every other aspect of life in Angola. Nearly three decades of conflict left a  shattered economy and destroyed infrastructure. Yet things have since improved. Since the war's end, Angola  has experienced impressive   economic growth as its oil industry has boomed. However, as many observers point out,  the effects of this have been uneven. While certain areas have profited enormously,  much of the country still remains underdeveloped. Meanwhile, although UNITA became an established   political party after the agreement,  it hasn't been able to gain power. Instead, the MPLA continues  to dominate Angolan politics. Indeed, José Eduardo dos Santos eventually  stood down in 2017 after 38 years in power. He was succeeded as president by João  Lourenço, another senior MPLA official. More to the point, Angola continues to be plagued  by allegations of authoritarianism and corruption. For instance, Freedom House ranks the country   as &quot;not free,&quot; scoring just  28 out of 100 on its index. But looked at more generally, Angola was  one of the best examples of how the Cold   War—a confrontation we often tend to  think of as a non-militarized conflict   between the superpowers—played out as armed  conflicts in many other parts of the world,   often at the cost of hundreds of  thousands, if not millions, of lives. While the decades of war in Angola had a huge  impact on Africa and international relations more   generally, here are some videos on other conflicts  that have shaped the modern global system." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="one sure sign that the narrative the tide is turning on Israel's war on Gaza when a former Israeli prime minister describes the war as genocidal enough is enough medics getting the story out the doctors and nurses filling in the vacuum in the news coverage and taking a look under the hood of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the agenda never has been to provide humanitarian aid to the Palestinians an organization that does not do what its name implies more than 600 days into its horrific war on Palestinians in Gaza even Israel's most loyal allies from foreign governments to news organizations have been forced to confront reality from Berlin to London Paris to Ottawa support for Israel is turning into disapproval verging on condemnation over the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in the strip starving Palestinians have been lining up for food aid supplied by an organization that is the brainchild of the American and Israeli governments and looks more like a PR exercise than a humanitarian response the external political pressure along with rising dissent within Israel over the Netanyahu government's waging of this war is having an effect on the media narrative there and fracturing a consensus that goes all the way back to October 7th 2023 try as the Israelis might it will take more than a trickle of humanitarian aid to silence their critics more than propaganda to hide the war crimes it is committing when they talk about Israel and its genocidal ways in Gaza European politicians choose their words carefully particularly German ones like the chancellor Friedrich who went on the state funded broadcaster where he said finally and more than once that Israel has gone too far we have been hearing more and more international criticism germany's is probably the most significant one because of the historical baggage that guilt of the Holocaust that brought Germany to just accept and support whatever crime Israel has been committing so the fact that even Germany can no longer whitewash Israel's crime is extremely significant at the same time the foreign minister said &quot;But you know what we will not ban the weapons to Israel we reject an arms embargo so the European government is saying &quot;We condemn a killing spree but we will give the killer a sharper knife.&quot; Telling Israel &quot;What you're doing is morally wrong and might lead to negative consequences but we're not going to implement those consequences yet.&quot; With the European governments you can see stronger statements at the moment but statements basically bounce off Israel's iron dome of impunity from mers of all people it is truly too little too late and I await to see whether Palestinian solidarity activists students who have been calling out this genocide and facing brutal policing in some cases deportation i look forward to Meltz welcoming all those people back to Germany and telling them that they were right all along chancellor Meritz added Germany's name to a growing list of Western countries including France the UK and Canada that have criticized Israel over this war threatened it with sanctions but have not yet acted that effectively buys the Israelis time which they are using to keep punishing Palestinians cloaking their war crimes under the cover of organizations like the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the GHF after consistently blocking aid from getting into Gaza and attacking the agencies trying to help Palestinians including the UN's the Israelis teamed up with American military contractors mercenaries to create the GHF whose first foray into Gaza proved disastrous crowds of hungry Palestinians were herded like animals into an aid depot in Rafa humiliating scenes worthy of a concentration camp the crowd surged overwhelming those contractors shots were fired at least three Palestinians were killed the government media office in Gaza called it a deliberate massacre a full-fledged war crime committed against civilians suffering siege induced starvation people in Gaza are literally starving especially children because their bodies are not able to to withstand that that level of malnutrition even some of Israel's staunchest allies are now coming out to criticize Israel for its starvation campaign because this war has gone on for far too long we cannot allow the people of Gaza to starve it's not because they're having these big epiphies that that mass slaughter of Palestinians is wrong there's a great liberal centrist tradition of standing on the right side of history only when the relevant moment to do so has significantly passed we are seeing that grand liberal tradition be repeated now by Kama Emanuel Macron Mark Carney and other leaders who are only willing to condemn but indeed not stop Israel's activities at this point i think future proofing of reputation to say &quot;Oh but we did indeed speak up might very much be in play here.&quot; But those of us who have been paying any attention at all for the last year and a half plus are all too aware that these very governments have been funding and ideologically enabling uh Israel's actions throughout its war on Gaza Israeli officials from Benjamin Netanyahu on down have routinely dismissed allegations of war crimes as inherently anti-semitic the anti-semitic decision of the international court in the H is a modern driver that argument is more difficult to make now since more and more of those accusations are coming from Israelis including a former prime minister what is it if not a war crime ehood Ol first made that argument in a liberal Israeli paper Harets before repeating it on CNN golan a former army chief of staff turned opposition leader is another who has strayed from the path there have also been shifts in coverage in the Israeli media although limited and more common in the print sector than the broadcast side they are notable in that they reflect what is occurring politically almer is one of the earliest founders of Netanyahu's party Lioot so he's known left-wing pro Palestinian peace he's the guy that carried out one of Israel's most atrocious wars on Gaza Operation Gas so to see him now condemning what Israel is doing in Gaza as a war of annihilation as genocide it is extraordinary it speaks basically of how far Israel has gone this moment is ripe for the likes of Yer Golan and and other opposition figures in Israel because Netanyahu is facing increased pressure and leaders around the world will be happy to scapegoat Netanyahu as the perpetrator of this genocide in Gaza rather than face the reality that this was a genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian people by the state itself and so this moment presents an opportunity to put all the blame on Netanyahu both internally and internationally israel is now panicking realizing that their strategy of repeated atrocities to exhaust the global attention did not work that's why you had saying our propaganda is collapsing our legitimacy is over and you had Israel Hom saying the world is talking less about us and more about Gaza and their solution is not to end the genocide but to propagandize more to whitewash the genocide even more to double down on the failing strategy that didn't work without a doubt there are media outlets and journalists who are reassessing their position regarding this war and Wet is a good example they're showing more pictures of what's going on in Gaza speaking through the angle of starvation referring to it more and more overall however Israeli media coverage that allows for empathy for Palestinians remains the exception not the rule [Music] [Applause] 600 days into this war there have never been more lives at risk in Gaza where day after day GHF aid depots have produced nightmarish scenes of desperation and violence politicians overseas out to salvage their legacies could be enough to save some of those lives but as Israeli journalists well know there will be no saving of reputations on the Israeli airwaves the moral standing of news channels that too many citizens there still use as their primary source of information if you're only consuming Israeli media in Hebrew you will know less about what the Israeli army is doing in Gaza than probably any given citizen in the rest of the world the Israeli media has been a collaborator with this genocidal mindset and actually promoting it and by concealing the Holocaust of Gaza from the eyes of the Israeli public when the day comes that the criminals responsible for this genocide will stand on trial i think next to them on the bench the Israeli media should be located there's a reason that um experts in genocide studies and humanitarians are using terms like final solution for this stage of the genocide in Gaza we're seeing images of children burnt trapped in schools the reports we're hearing from the imperiled hospitals has prompted certain world leaders to speak up but that shouldn't lead any viewers to think that this is because there's been some sort of uh dramatic aberration by the Israeli military this is a continuation and an escalation in Gaza after so many many months of this kind of genocidal warfare throughout Israel's war on Gaza health care workers have become key voices in the reporting of this story and over the past couple of weeks the dispatches coming out of hospitals there have grown more and more desperate minakshi Ravi has been tracking this story gaza's health care system and the Palestinians who work in it have been systematically targeted by Israel for nearly 20 months now at least 94% of all hospitals in the strip have been damaged or destroyed more than 1,400 healthcare workers have been killed with thousands of doctors and nurses arrested the few who have made it out of prison say their Israeli captives reserved specific brutal torture for medics international doctors who have traveled in with aid groups now say their mission goes beyond medicine the main thing is to come here to bear witness because you're not seeing what I'm seeing because there's been a complete block to all media i am getting very sick and tired of having as as are all my colleagues of having to go onto the the news programs because journalists aren't allowed in etc to to point out what is happening here physicians returning from Gaza have also been outspoken on how dire the situation there has become the starvation the particular nature of the burns and injuries they are seeing and the targeting of Palestinian medics people need to understand that civilians their families uh healthare workers are are being intentionally and deliberately killed and I just want to say that the IDF have said in their statement regarding this uh attack in Kunis they've said that the IDF evacuated civilians from this area you don't ask the perpetrator of of of genocide we have to Dr hassan we have to ask the Israeli government if you also in addition to that response mentioned that Amn A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A am A amnesty international doctors without borders human rights watch the international court of justice would all beg to differ this past week American trauma surgeon Dr firo Sidwa delivered testimony to the United Nations Security Council i'm not here as a policy maker or a politician i am a physician bearing witness to the deliberate destruction of a health care system the targeting of my own colleagues and the eraser of a people these doctors are not isolated voices they have formed a network of sorts a valuable one to fill the void in reporting on this story caused by Israel's refusal to let journalists into Gaza and its killing of so many Palestinian reporters more than 200 of them thanks Mina in our lead story we touched on the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation the GHF formed just months ago it is an American Israeli coalition that includes ex CIA and military personnel it is a shadowy group that started distributing aid in the southern end of the strip this past week there is not a single international aid organization that has endorsed or cooperated with the GHF instead from the UN to Oxfam to Medsan Frontier warnings have been issued that the GHF is militarized privatized and politicized an exercise in quote aidwashing when a pretense of aid is designed to cover up something else entirely one of the news outlets tracking the GHF closely with reporting from Palestinian journalists in Gaza is Drop Site News its co-founder Jeremy Scill joins us now jeremy let's start with the name of this organization now handling aid in the war zone the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the GHF out to do what its name implies not in any way shape or form i mean f first of all let's just get one basic fact straight the amount of so-called aid that it's distributing is is a pittance relative to what is needed in these starvation conditions in Gaza that are being enforced as an act of war by the USbacked Israeli regime it's incredibly cynical to use the term humanitarian in this name because Netanyahu himself has been very clear that this is a scam a scheme that is intended to kind of quiet some of the criticism that Netanyahu has received primarily from Republican senators who have said &quot;We don't like the appearance of starvation in Gaza so if you can create the facade that you're actually doing something then we're going to make sure that the weapons keep flowing and our support for your war of annihilation continues i mean Richard you couldn't get uh a a sort of uh starker symbol of what the agenda is here that you have a circumvention of an existing program that was effective that you have American mercenaries deployed on the ground that you have Israelis opening fire at desperate starving Palestinians and that it's all actually out in the open that the intent of this is to be uh just sort of a facade of humanitarianism to enable a genocide the GHF's aid distribution got off to a bad start this week the images that have come out of this the Palestinians in those caged pens lining up for food when you looked at those images what went through your mind well look I've been speaking to sources on the ground we have reporters inside of Gaza and my understanding is that there was almost no coordination whatsoever with uh local aid organizations to even inform people where they would be able to go to pick up these parcels or what would be inside of the parcels people just heard through text message WhatsApp word of mouth there's going to be aid dropped in this location and so because the population is starving and you have acute malnutrition among thousands of children people started to trek through incredibly dangerous terrain and they arrive at these sites and and it was very chaotic in some cases they were using biometric identification systems or interrogating people in others they forced or almost like cattle Palestinians into barbed wire fencing apparatus um on the first day that they started getting uh this aid distribution underway um we heard from sources inside of Gaza that a man had been kidnapped when he was interrogated by Israeli intelligence they got his family on the phone they were supposedly looking for some relative that the family hadn't been in touch with uh since the start of the war and when he didn't provide information that they were demanding from him they disappeared him that family has no idea where he is we've heard of at least a dozen or so more uh other people that were snatched when they went to go and get aid also the Israelis uh opened fire at one point they say that it was warning shots um but Palestinians were killed you know Israelis compare Palestinians to animals and this is part of what the plan is they want to essentially bait them into a cage shut the door behind them and then they either get killed in this killing cage or the ultimate plan which they call Trump's plan is to take that cage filled with Palestinians of Gaza and ship them to another country what we are witnessing here right now is is a a completely disgusting trap that Palestinians are being forced to as part of what Netanyahu has described as the final stage of his war to conquer Gaza now its backers say that the GHF is specifically designed to bypass the UN its relief agency ENROA why do the Israelis and the Americans involved in this say that that's even necessary the bypassing of established tried and tested systems of aid distribution richard it's because the the agenda never has been to provide humanitarian aid to the Palestinians um UNRA was established uh around the same time as the state of Israel was imposed on Palestine and and the reason that Israel has always stood against UNRA is because it is perhaps the most powerful symbol that uh that makes it clear that Palestinians have a right of return to their land have a right of return to their homes what we saw from the the the the moments after the October 7th operations happened inside of Israel was a very intense campaign to try to demonize the United Nations as a whole but UNRA specifically and the Israelis began planting stories that said that scores of UNRA employees had participated in the October 7th attacks and perhaps the the chief launderer of this narrative in the media was the Wall Street Journal and those stories were actually published with a by line uh of one of the reporters who herself was a uh a former IDF soldier and they they essentially portrayed UNRA as a Hamas front organization the United States and other countries responded to this propaganda and they admitted that they didn't even do their own independent review by moving swiftly to try to defund UNRA when the United States and major US media outlets began serving as conveyor belts for the lies of Israel about UNRA this was a devastating uh series of events and UNRA has been fighting for its life and so by creating an alternative pathway that circumvents international bodies that essentially seeks to to disintegrate UNRA what Israel is doing is saying &quot;We want to always be in control of the calorie intake of Palestinians we want to be able to shut off the water we want to be able to shut off the food we want to be able to block the medicine.&quot; The intent of this is to create the appearance of some alternative that would be viable to UNRA while at the same time ensuring full spectrum domination of Israel over the lives of Palestinians in Gaza you and Dropsite have done extensive reporting on the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation how difficult has it been to do that how transparent is this organization what kind of challenges are you facing in trying to tell this story you know as someone who's done a lot of reporting on mercenary organizations um and CIA front organizations it looked like what we would call a cutout that it's not actually intended to be what the public is being told but that it was set up for an alternative purpose sometimes intelligence agencies or governments set up fake companies uh to try to cover their employees as they do espionage other times they try to set up a company that has some legitimate front to it but the agenda is different i think we can safely say that the fact that there's very little information that's been released that we know the connections to both Israeli and American intelligence that this was intended to be a cutout uh that would serve the purpose of uh allowing Netanyahu to continue his war of annihilation while claiming that they're actually giving aid to people um in Gaza but Israel has been very effective with its propaganda in part because of its allies in the Western media particularly American and British news organizations that have promoted these lies or have not pushed back hard enough in demanding evidence so you know at some point uh all of these governments and officials are going to come out and pretend like they were always against the genocide we're seeing more and more media outlets coming out and taking that position we're seeing more and more academics and scholars taking that position you're seeing former Biden administration officials taking that position well history is full of people who want to be right uh through hindsight courage means speaking out in real time and so this should serve as a very serious lesson for journalists and governments when it comes to Israel you cannot ever believe the first draft of what they say you know Ronald Reagan used to say trust but verify in the case of Israel you have to assume it is lying and then check the facts jeremy Scill Drop Site News always great to have you on the show thanks again for speaking with us here today thank you Richard" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="Is South Sudan heading back into full-scale civil war? This video explores the alarming escalation in tensions between President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar that has reignited fears of renewed conflict. After gaining independence in 2011 amid global optimism, South Sudan quickly spiraled into a devastating five-year civil war, largely driven by political rivalry the war took on an ethnic dimension as fighting broke out between the Dinka and Nuer communities. Although a peace agreement was signed in 2018, known as the Revitalised Agreement (R-ARCSS), the uneasy truce is now unraveling. Machar's recent house arrest, ordered by Kiir, has sparked condemnation and violent clashes, including attacks on civilians and aid workers.&#10;&#10;This video traces the origins of South Sudan’s internal strife—from British colonial legacies and post-independence tensions with Sudan, to the oil-fueled conflict that tore the nation apart. We examine how unresolved grievances, political power struggles, and ethnic divisions have created a fragile state teetering on collapse. With over 150,000 people newly displaced and peace talks faltering, many now fear that the country may be on the verge of a second civil war. Can diplomacy prevail?

          <attvalue for="7" value="Is South Sudan on the brink of a new civil war? In July 2011, South Sudan became  the world's newest nation. But celebrations soon turned to violence as the  country sank into a brutal five-year civil war. But while the sides eventually reached a peace   deal, the uneasy truce has now  collapsed, leading to clashes. So what exactly lies behind this story, and could  South Sudan really be about to return to war? Hello and welcome. If you're new to the channel,  my name is James Ker-Lindsay,   and here I take an informed look at international  relations, conflict, security, and statehood. We tend to think that civil wars end  when the sides reach a peace agreement. The warring parties sign a deal and then begin   the long and arduous process of  reconciliation and reconstruction. However, all too often these  agreements merely pause the fighting. A period of calm is followed by renewed conflict. This can be due to various factors. Sometimes the root cause of the conflict—such  as ethnic or religious tensions,   disputes over resources, or economic  and social exclusion—remain in place. At other times, dissident factions undermine  peace, sparking a return to violence. But sometimes the return to war is caused by   lingering hostility between  the supposedly former foes. A good case in point is South Sudan. Just two years after becoming independent in 2011,   it collapsed into a brutal civil war  as the country's leadership split. However, while an agreement eventually brought the  warring sides together, it's been an uneasy peace. As splits have again opened up between  the country's top leaders, a series of   attacks mark the possible start of what many  now believe could be a renewed civil war. The Republic of South Sudan  is located in East Africa. Landlocked and covering approximately 650,000  square kilometres, or around a quarter of a   million square miles, it's bordered by  Ethiopia to the east, Kenya, Uganda,   and the Democratic Republic of Congo to the south,  and the Central African Republic to the west. To the north lies Sudan. Its population is believed  to be around 12 million. While this comprises over  60 different ethnic groups,   the two dominant communities  are the Dinka and the Nuer. Situated in the northwest of the country, the  Dinka represent around 35% of the population. Meanwhile, the Nuer, representing around  15%, are located mainly in the northeast. Most of the population is Catholic or Anglican  Christian, followed by local religions. While South Sudan has a long and rich  history, our story begins in the first   half of the 19th century, when Ottoman  and Egyptian forces pressed southwards,   establishing control over what is now Sudan. However, after an Islamic uprising broke out  in 1881, raising concerns about the security   of the newly built Suez Canal, Britain sent in  troops and Sudan came under Anglo-Egyptian rule. From the start, it was a complex situation. Although Sudan was formally a single colonial  unit, it consisted of two very distinct parts. The six northern provinces, which made up  around three-quarters of the population,   were predominantly Arab and Muslim. In contrast, the three southern provinces  included various sub-Saharan tribes. While many of these followed local religions,   as missionaries reached into the area,  increasing numbers converted to Christianity. All this would come to a head  after the Second World War. As British decolonisation began, a  debate emerged regarding Sudan's future. While the North wanted independence,   many in the South feared domination  by their northern neighbours. To this end, they called for the new state to be   based on a federal structure that would  provide them with extensive self-rule. And if this wasn't possible, they  demanded their own separate country,   a position resolutely rejected by the North. All of this led to increasing tensions. Fearing that it was losing control,  Britain now swiftly decided to withdraw. Six months later, on 1 January 1956, the  Republic of Sudan gained its independence. From the start, tensions  between the communities grew,   especially after the central government  was overthrown by a military coup in 1958. As the Muslim Arab North attempted  to extend its control over the South,   the South launched an insurgency. While at first this was contained, by the  end of the 1960s the situation was changing. With support from Israel, which was  growing increasingly concerned about   Sudan's close ties to its then-archenemy Egypt,  southern forces began to gain the upper hand. Following international mediation, the  sides reached a peace agreement in 1972. Under the terms of the deal, the  South would gain extensive self-rule. But little changed in the years that followed. The North still dominated. And on top of this, other  significant differences now emerged. Notably, as the northern leadership  became overtly religious, it tried to   impose Islamic Sharia law on the Christian South. At the same time, strains emerged  following the discovery of oil on   the boundary between the North and South. As a result, in September 1983, the  Sudanese government unilaterally   cancelled the peace agreement, plunging  the country back into a new civil war. This time, though, the South  was far better prepared. Under its leader, Dr John Garang,  an agricultural economist and former   colonel in the Sudanese Army,  the Sudan People's Liberation   Army—the SPLA—quickly seized control of  most of the rural areas in the South. But while the war ebbed and  flowed over the next two decades,   by the turn of the millennium,  fatigue was setting in on both sides. Twenty years of fighting had left over two million  dead in what was now Africa's longest civil war. Meanwhile, the broader geopolitical  situation was also changing. Following 9/11, the United  States stepped up pressure   on the Islamist regime of the country's  long-standing dictator, Omar al-Bashir. All this paved the way for new negotiations. And in early 2005, the sides signed  a Comprehensive Peace Agreement,   giving the South considerable autonomy. Crucially, they also agreed that a  referendum would be held after six years. This would provide the South  with a fundamental choice. It could either accept the new power-sharing  arrangement and remain within Sudan. Or it could break away and become independent. In January 2011, almost four million South   Sudanese went to the polls to vote  on whether to keep the arrangement. Unsurprisingly, almost 98% voted for independence. And just six months later, on 9 July 2011,  South Sudan formally declared independence,   becoming the 193rd member of the  United Nations just five days later. I hope you're finding this useful.

While there were initially high hopes for peace   and stability after half a century of  conflict, the euphoria quickly faded. From the start, the new country faced serious  political, economic, and social challenges. In addition, corruption and ethnic favoritism led   to increasing factionalism across the ruling  Sudan People's Liberation Movement—the SPLM. This was highlighted by the deep divisions  between the country's top leaders. On the one hand, there was President  Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka,   who had assumed leadership  after Garang died in 2005. Meanwhile, on the other side was the Vice  President, Riek Machar, an ethnic Nuer. Amidst rumours of an impending coup, in July 2013  Kiir dismissed the government, including Machar. As the ruling party now split into two  factions—the SPLM in Government, led by Kiir,   and the SPLM in Opposition, led by Machar—South  Sudan descended into a bitter civil war. Despite its political roots,   the fighting soon gained an ethnic  dimension, pitting Dinka against Nuer. As a result, an estimated 400,000 people  were killed and millions more displaced in   a conflict that was marked by brutal  atrocities and a widespread famine. Meanwhile, although international efforts to  broker peace led to multiple ceasefires and   temporary agreements, these were  repeatedly broken by the sides. In the end, a new agreement  was reached in September 2018. Under the terms of the deal, Machar was  reinstated as First Vice President under Kiir. At the same time, it also  contained other vital elements. These included a new constitution,   efforts to unite the factional ministers  within the army, and promises of elections. However, despite the promises,  little of this took place. Meanwhile, critics argued that the  agreement neglected deeper issues,   such as the serious ethnic  divisions that had emerged. In addition, the country continued to be plagued  by economic instability and humanitarian crises. As a result of all this, the relationship between   Kiir and Machar and their respective factions  remained tense, leading to occasional clashes. All this came to a head in March 2025. Accusing Machar of inciting rebellion,   Kiir ordered that the Vice President  be placed under house arrest. While many international observers—including the   United States and the United Nations—strongly  condemned Machar's detention, seeing it as a   dangerous escalation of the situation,  the government refused to back down. As a result, the opposition claimed  that the peace deal was finished. As expected, all this saw a dramatic rise in  tensions and further clashes between the groups. The situation further exacerbated with  news that neighbouring Uganda had sent   its forces into South Sudan to  support the Kiir government. All this has, in turn, prompted the  UN's representative, Nicholas Haysom,   to warn that the country is teetering on the  brink of a return to full-scale civil war. Such fears have been most recently  stoked by a deadly bombing of   a hospital run by the international  aid charity Médecins Sans Frontières,   which killed at least seven  people and injured twenty. While it's unclear who carried out the  attack, with the sides blaming each other,   MSF has condemned the attack as a  deliberate violation of international law. So, is South Sudan on the verge of  a return to full-scale civil war? At this stage, the situation is obviously unclear. Efforts to mediate the crisis are still ongoing. For example, Kenya dispatched  its former Prime Minister to   facilitate dialogue between the factions. However, the situation certainly  remains precarious, with the 2018   peace agreement under significant  strain—if not entirely broken. And it's for these reasons that the  international community continues to   urge both leaders to recommit to the peace process  to prevent a return to widespread conflict. But given past experience, hopes are low. With such a long history of  violence and factional fighting,   there are fears that South Sudan may well be  on the brink of another devastating civil war. I hope you found that useful. If so, here are some more videos  that you might find useful. Thanks so much for watching,  and see you in the next video." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] representatives Adam Holmes and Roy Kloppenstein Thank you so much for joining me on Message from the House I just got done telling you both I think this is the fourth episode or fourth group of interviewees we've had That four is pretty good I'll take that It's a privilege It's great Privilege I mean the privilege is all mine You know House Bill 15 we just kind of talked before this I heard about it first in January I'm sure that the you know concept for energy reform came to fruition you know well before that How do you go about crafting such a large piece of legislation and then to see it go to both chambers already You know we're still in April um I guess May now So talk me through kind of this process for House Bill 15 Well I I think part of it or a lot of it is timing and certainly when we look at where we are as far as the energy sector as a whole and the buzzwords now are data centers and AI and cryptocurrency Yes that's part of the equation Um the rest of the equation is we've come through a time frame or a time period when base load generation has been uh vilified and when I say base load generation that's coal which all of us grew up on uh being uh blessed by coal by having our light switch works nuclear and in some cases gas and oil It's all someone but been vilified and it's unfortunate because basel generation is what not only keeps Ohio a great place to live but it keeps uh United States of America as a first world country and and folks that know me or hear me speak the difference from a a first world to a second world country to a third world country most often is energy and and certainly there's there's a government style and factor but um you can't overplay the importance of energy So uh part of the timing of this bill is we have huge energy consuming things coming online and it was time to reform uh Ohio and Ohio wants to be a leader And I view the overall view of this bill as if we do it right and and we think we have done it right with our colleagues in the Senate and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle Um it will create an atmosphere create a place where base load they want to come to Ohio They want to be built in Ohio That's good for all Ohioans Quite frankly it's good for all the Midwest But it will set Ohio up and I really believe this that this legislation will open the door for industry coming back to Ohio industry growing in Ohio We will have more jobs than we have people And it's almost you could say a quality of life issue And you can't have a good quality of life if you have rolling blackouts rolling brown outs anything of that sort You have to have and Chairman Holmes alluded to this when we first started the energy committee um affordable reliable and dependable uh energy If you don't have that uh if you're asked to shut your air conditioner off in the afternoon um none of us want that And quite frankly you know the way our system is set up now and because of the lack of base load we have factories that are paid to shut down at the moment to lower the peak load demand That's inefficiency Yes it keeps our grid live and maybe thanks to our utility programs uh utility uh dist distribution networks but without that we would have already had rolling blackouts and brownouts So we want enough power produced here in Ohio that that possibility is not a possibility and we think this legislation opens that up and uh chairman's home's leadership and and bringing it and shephering it through the committee It's been a pleasure to work with him and um exciting things coming Yeah Well thank Yeah it's been so great so rewarding Right I think a a thing to mention a year almost two years ago recognizing the emergency that was impending for the United States on a shortage of energy and and Ohio's in the center of that and the opportunities here But uh it's we're so integral to the economy of the United States so much manufacturing is done here in our natural resources that exists inside our state We were going to be a key member of the energy future and so we had to get on this So even two years ago right you and I were both anxious that we better get something going and and very fortunate that Speaker Huffman and the Senate President also recognized that same urgency So like you said the timing came or we had to get on it and it's so urgent that we had to get on it and run really fast to get something signed now because it's going to matter The new plants that want to be constructed in this area they were waiting for this bill to get signed so they can start submitting their approval process It's really I think Ohioans are more u tied into global politics than they might imagine It's really important what we're doing And Rep Holmes you had mentioned this had a lot of support from both chambers and both parties Right Right We we set up a mission statement because if the as the legislature the House of Representatives we represent every Ohio because every Ohioan uses electricity So it's got to be a nonpartisan unity of effort And uh beyond the parties it's it's the ge geography of Ohio the urban centers the rural areas everybody has to be taken care of And so it that's what it required that kind of open transparent communication to ensure we address the requirements of everybody That's been rewarding too because I think we got it done Yeah I would I would say so It was very neat to watch the process you know your aids and everybody else you know the experts and to learn about it all I want to hear from you both again I know you know you've mentioned this several times in other spaces How does this bill protect rateayers Well the the first thing when you say rate payers or customers um the first people want to uh go to is the amount of money they spend on energy I don't believe that what they're paying would make a diff difference to a constituent if they don't have the power when they need it So I think the the most important part of this bill is availability of energy We are setting the stage so we have availability We can talk about rates after that or what the customers pay We can somewhat project without enough base load the scarcity of energy raises the cost I would not expect this bill to lower the cost the day the governor signs it into uh practice or into law I think it will slow down the rate of increase you know everything that goes into energy whether it's building the um free market production of electric or whether it's addressing the cost of transmission and distribution wires from uh the EDUs inflation has done a number on the cost of delivering the power to the people What this does is make the availability of the production so that costs don't rise as quick Um I I think it would be a false pretense to tell our folks you know what you're going to see lower prices I would love to be able to say that I don't know that that's the case because there's so many things that goes into the price of electric but certainly the the rise in prices the growth in prices uh should slow as we bring more base load online So I I I think when we talk to rateayers or customers I don't think we can sell this on an expectation that their bill is going to go down by 10% I don't think quite frankly I don't think that will happen But if the bills don't go up by 25% and instead go up three four 5% the cost of uh or the rate of inflation it's a huge victory And it is a supply and demand and people do not want to be without supply in this case Um we one of the other things that was addressed in this bill and we talked about is the reliability factor You know I I live in an area where seldom do we ever see an outage Uh our our backup generator the hours on it are from its routine runtime We have a tremendous uh asset in our area for reliable power That's not the case everywhere in Ohio And this bill tries to address and does address that reliability factor which is when you talk about rates there It's more than rates You got to have the power there as much of the time as possible This bill's that that's part of the equation here And quickly I'll never forget this It was um close to my last reporting day in Columbus And do you there were probably it was 2022 and there were really bad storms and tornadoes and it was really hot Mhm And so generators were taken off the grid or not generators you know I'm not an expert You guys are users are taken off right And so the spots that still had the capacity to produce energy the grids were getting overloaded And so they had to pick and choose in Columbus who they took off I was one of them My apartment didn't lose power in the storms or the heat but I was one that they they took me off um the grid obviously not to overload the other pieces and parts So I'll never forget that How long were you out of power Two days I lost all my food in my refrigerator Think of that right Yeah And and when that that's an example with a storm Oh yeah with a storm It was a rarity and it was I just remember it was so hot So that was the even worse part But yeah one of those things that when you when you talk about price of a product um quite frankly what would have you paid extra to have power that day Yeah How much you you would have paid more So the reliability factor and the availability of power um that we hope to increase here in this bill can't be understated Yeah Um it it is huge the the other part of that equation you know we're part of the overall PJM market and PJM probably with the local utilities they have to manage the distribution and the power that uh gets sent out to folks So the decision was made that day how can we who do we shut off to affect the least amount of people so the whole grid doesn't go down Correct Yeah and and unfortunately the most uh if you want to say productive or unproductive you were the lucky winner But when when we look at the whole grid and I referenced earlier where we have programs in place or electric companies have programs in place today that factories shut down so the rest of the folks and most often homeowners don't lose power That's significant Most consumers unless they work at that plant and they get the afternoon off or they're managing the plant they don't know about those programs Um some of us uh have that on a small scale where we have electric shut offs on our hot water heaters and and that's the lower peak use Wouldn't it be nice if Ohio had so much power being produced Peak doesn't matter Yet it does but we have enough power produced that we're shipping it out of Ohio And it wasn't that many years ago that Ohio was an excess power producer Unfortunately we're not today And I'm pulling up my phone only because I wrote down a quote during the floor speech and I wanted to ask the question in what ways does this work to make Ohio energy independent Well energy independent if um PJM manages the distribution of power and the generation of power Ohio now today imports more power from outside Ohio than what we produce Anytime you import you're not you're using more transmission line The more transmission line you use the more probability statistically you have of power going down So producing the power here you're using less of the transmission network Your reliability factor goes up So uh it's just a win-win to have the power being produced here And Representative Holmes yes transparency is also another focus of the bill How do you feel it works to foster that between the utilities and the consumers The the biggest one is I think if we share information everybody can benefit And that's a great thing to say This is not an anti-util It's there's going to be growth and we're going to really rely on them to build a lot of distribution and trans uh transmission lines One of the key um components we added was something called a heat map if you've heard of that before And that's really is showing how much stress or how much usage there is on any specific piece of the transmission or distribution lines We're going to make that a public u public information because I do think that if we all know that we can make better decisions on where to site electricity generation because in certain places if you if you for example put uh sites close to urban centers it can get congested and they you cannot transmit all the power they're producing through the lines like traffic jams like interstates during rush hour So uh proper distribution of those of the new energy development we'll do that in a cooperative collaborative way with utilities and the generating plants those those kinds of ideas will win will prevail It'll always be a better plan if everybody's involved in it and understands it And to piggyback off of that this bill also works to keep the market competitive and in turn you know as Rep Coppenstein brought up improve energy availability right markets always increase quality right and decrease price That's their nature And that and we better get on that and we'll get both And like uh um Rep Coffenstein said we need to have reliable and resilient energy And so that the market will drive that And we've taken historical examples from across the United States in regulated states where uh it wasn't a market driven uh environment and there were substantial impacts looking at you California So we're so that's something lessons we learned to not to avoid and and most of our consumers um they just pay their bill but you know we're a regulated monopoly after generation uh generation is free market and I I don't remember the number but since 1999 when we went to that uh deregulated market I believe it was 1999 on on the production side you know the Ohio consumer have saved millions of dollars And this bill I think tends to enhance that and say look we're going to remove the barriers We're going to uh change the paradigm of what the bureaucracy is to get that base load generation happening Th this bill does address those timelines It does address the bureaucracy and we're going to continue to look at that It's it's quite frankly a partnership Um it's a partnership between the generators It's a partnership that includes the electric uh utility companies Uh quite frankly uh back to the heat maps It includes the consumers and new businesses where they locate right Uh it's a capacity thing where we know in retail or in uh factories making parts first to market wins typically and the only way you can get first to market in many cases is you have to locate where there's available power Um that's something that we think will help economic development and help people site plants that says &quot;Hey um they have the ability over on this grid for x amount of growth where if we build at this location we're three years out from getting that power to the site So heat maps are critical It's a component that is used in other states and has been used successfully Um there no there's no reason why we can't use it here in Ohio and increase the quickness that we can come to market with uh new factories new housing developments and uh be more efficient And I think you know that was even my next question of how it's connected to Ohio's economic development right I don't think we even think about that looking at an energy bill from the surface but as you just broke down it really does impact that Well and it the impact I don't think we can measure it And and I said earlier I really feel that if we get energy done right here in Ohio our kids and grandkids are going to have incredible opportunities um that we don't even know are coming yet You know we we hear all the talk about data centers I actually think AI is a bigger growth area than data centers um reliable power to run AI Uh that I don't know how to quantify what a difference that's going to make And Ohio you know we talk about we're within what 40% of the population of United States within eight hours of us We're the perfect place to build We're the perfect place to develop We're the perfect place um for a host of other reasons outside of energy when we look at the things that make businesses want to come here But um you might say uh energy is the base load of making it happen So was that a pun Yes it was I appreciated that Thank you Yeah that's great Bringing the energy right I can't take credit for that That was Kylin who threw that pun out to uh me So thank you Kylin I also I know we had jokingly said we didn't necessarily want to talk about the PUKO shot clock I'll ask maybe as a trivia question for folks that might not know what that acronym stands for If you want to take it away Well we are a regulated monopoly We are a deregulated production state But everything that happens in the energy sector goes through the power sighting board or the public utilities commission of Ohio So if we talk about a three or a four-pronged approach between generation transmission distribution and the customer the other part of that equation is the bureaucracy And that's I don't mean that in a bad way That's not what I meant there The power sighting board has a purpose The public utilities commission has a purpose And when they can do their job in an effective and efficient manner in a timeline which we can't have people waiting two years three years or four years for rate cases or for the permits to build and uh the public utility commission their director has been fantastic to work with on this bill but that's something that is part of making things happen And when that's inefficient it slows everything down So the shot clocks are part of that equation that we we've somewhat challenged PUCO on saying look you're part of the answer to making Ohio number one frankly in everything and and we realize that they do great work It's just we want it better We're we're forcing the timelines there a little bit and says &quot;Hey we want the dirt work done quick enough that people when they have a choice of building in Ohio or one of the surrounding states they say &quot;Look we want to locate in Ohio.&quot; And that that shot clock is part of that equation right Like a deadline Yeah Accelerate our bureaucratic process We got to go because if they have to wait around they'll go to another state So we want to we want to really expedite this and the demand's going up while we're hanging around So yeah let's get it approved and get it going That's the idea Rep Holmes how consequential would it have been if House Bill 15 was not a concept or if we had passed as quickly as it had I think we would would have missed a lot of opportunities and we would have been way behind on responding to this increased demand that's coming as a state and and uh we would lose to other states or the blackout that you endured would increase and I'm still we think about that all the time of getting on it right there if there was no house Bill 15 and then we were spending money on energy I believe in ways we didn't have to that was not the most efficient use of of of state money on our transmission and distribution and generation So those those two things for sure I really had a sense of urgency on it that we were looking at a train a train wreck coming if we didn't act like right now Unfortunately Roy and many others in the legislature saw that too So yeah I feel great I think one thing we haven't mentioned is um national security Yeah And we're not going to put out names here but we have other states making decisions on the energy front that are not good and not reliable And it puts Ohio in a place that energy is part of our national security and and we're positioning Ohio to be a part of the solution not a part of um there's some other states just making decisions that aren't good for us as a country right And and we're part of the solution So I I don't think we can underestimate and it's something we really can't measure at this point If if if the United States is going to lead the AI race we have to have the power If we look at at it globally we we have a competitor in China that depending upon who you believe they're ahead of us in the AI race We can't lose that This is a national security uh issue too And when you think House Bill 15's part of that solution part of winning that AI race it brings a sense of urgency to us to get it done Were you distracted by our timekeeper report right She was Yeah giving you the four We really you know we really tackled a lot You you know we talked about consumers we talked about market competitiveness we talked about availability of energy If you both want to conclude by saying what are your hopes maybe in a sentence or two that House Bill 15 will do for the state of Ohio House Bill 15 sets the table for an extraordinary future for Ohio to return to the center of action for the United States which means for the world We um Ohio energy means the capacity to do work and people work in this state We manufactured so many things here This idea of reshoring is we can be the center of that once again We're blessed with oil natural gas coil and uh coal energy underneath our feet and we so having that together with the transportation networks and the industrial capacity we're in it to win it So that's what I want and this is a catalyst for that kind of extraordinarily bright future I think the other thing that uh it's it it sets the table in a new way and it sets the table in a new way where um we don't we don't place one sector over the other sector as far as importart importance um a base load generation is critically important The electric distribution utilities are critically important PUCO and a power sighting board are critically important We're not here to pick winners and losers individually We want to be a winner with all the sectors working together Um we poke some sacred cows We're not afraid to do that We want the consumer to win in the end And that's what this bill does It lets the consumer win I think you guys would be the best head coach assistant coach in the game Rep Holmes do you coach anything Everything Who's the head coach and who's the I don't I guess it depends what what the environment is If you want you know a mellow head coach and a a hype man assistant you do that or vice versa The best team right That's I really think you guys are a great duo He's more photogenic so he needs to be the head coach That's what I think Roy I think we're a good team Just two farmers helping Ohio's energy production one pill at a time Thank you guys so much Rep Cloffinstein Stein and Rep Holmes thank you again Quick social media shout out You can follow us on

          <attvalue for="7" value="l'ennesima scalinata salita da [Applauso] Doković la seconda semifinale del Rolanga Rossa 2025 il numero 1 del mondo Jannick Sinner contro il tre volte campione di Parigi titolare di 24 slam e di un'altra serie infinita di primati nel tennis Novak Dokovic la loro nona sfida il bilancio dice quattro vittorie a testa però ci sono un po' di postille da mettere a questa rivalità che è cominciata nel 2021 è la seconda volta soltanto che i Sinder Jokovicć si sfidano sulla terra battuta il loro primo incontro era stato a Montecarlo al Country Club nel 2021 con Sinera ancora in formazione e una vittoria piuttosto semplice da parte di Doković tutte le loro sfide successive si sono giocate sul duro che fosse cemento all'aperto o sintetico indoor un bel vento e non è facile giocare quest'oggi sbaglia ancora dal lato del dritto Sinner e credo che stia proprio facendo riferimento al vento doković cerca ancora il dritto di Sinner doković tiene la battuta tiene la battuta S o pari è anche scivolato Sinner dopo aver giocato la controsmorzata vediamo se ha preparato tatticamente questa soluzione per Doković lei farà le palle corte anche per insomma muovere il suo avversario e e creargli qualche fastidio negli spostamenti questa non era la scelta corretta in diagonale ancora una smorzata da parte di Doković che fa il pollice in su al recupero questa volta vincente di Simner eh sì ha giocato una palla corta e poi è stato un po' lì in mezzo al campo e Sinara ha potuto vedere spazio in diagonale e ha giocato in maniera perfetta da quel lato tiner ci arriva ma ha fatto un giro troppo lungo perde le proporzioni del campo ancora una smorzata per Dokovic poi più attento a fare il pallonetto successivo beh d'altronde sul ritmo da fondo è nettamente superiore Sinner quindi deve chiamarlo avanti deve chiamarlo in una zona dove lui si sente meno meno comodo servizio al corpo può parare la palla niente più Doković 30-0 no no male eseguita questa smorzata incrociata e Sinera la chance del 5-2 e l'ha seguita male anche perché ciè arrivato malissimo in ritardo e non è la prima volta che succede siamo sette smorzate di cui sei di rovescio solo due punti ottenuti che bravo Sinner difesa clamorosa da parte di Sinner doković in difficoltà con lo smash non lo scopriamo sicuramente questa sera era difficile per tutti non soltanto per lui sì anche in queste condizioni non è facile con la palla che si sposta ma che difesa di Sinner sì la smozzata di Joković è alta invitante Sinnerva e chiude e sceglie di chiudere incrociato anche se Gokovi c'era da quella parte cercando la violenza la potenza però Doković adesso aspetta prima di utilizzare questa soluzione ha capito e avverte dall'altra parte del campo dell'incertezza della tensione però ha alzato il volume con il dritto Doković in questo scambio quindi ci pari abbiamo raccontato tante volte di come Doković si sia messo a lavorare su ogni singolo [Applauso] colpo pazzo come si è tolto dalla palla sinner la risposta mirata ai piedi bravissimo 30-0 cioè i riflessi incredibili S ma ci lavora e tante volte lo vediamo mentre si riscalda lavorare sulla coordinazione e basta il primo set point a Jan Xer la differenza tra i due in questo momento è notevole bravissimo Sinner mantiene il controllo delle operazioni trova la via della rete a Doković non si alza il lob 4030 gli ha tagliato le gambe alla fine sembrava proprio non riuscire a arrivare più sulla palla doković una palla destra una palla a sinistra ritmo alto grande profondità oh che ci arriva no incredibile e chiude Doković che punto che punto hanno giocato fantastico eh sì ancora una volta cerca la smorzata per uscire da quella pressione Doković insomma sul tocco alla fine l'ha vinta [Applauso] lui però smash di rimbalzo che per Dokovic vale 10 lode per come l'ha giocato e poi Joel Fritzongas apprezza giocato un gran punto Dokovic che poi come al solito ingaggia una sfida anche con chi a suo dire lo ha disturbato salva la palla Break sì però che gran punto ha lasciato andare i colpi ancora una volta il lungolinea di [Musica] dritto e buona applaude anche Doković mamma mia come se n'è uscito da questo scambio durissimo sinner alta di diritto nel campo aperto Dokovic che ha salvato la prima palla break e si prende questo quinto game mane corto il colpo di Dokovič ne approfitta subito Senner a segno [Musica] 15-30 e se ne va il dritto di Dokovic arriva quindi il break in un punto che può essere di importanza capitale per questo incontro dokovic un mostro in difesa ma ancora meglio Sinner che chiude con questa splendida volè smorzata 30-0 sì ha dovuto fare il punto tre volte [Musica] di la insomma lezione di gioco da fondo campo gran servizio eh di [Applauso] Joković questa attenta a non rallentare troppo Sinner e Doković si prende dei rischi 15-30 e si ferma in rete il dritto di Sinner giocato un game passivo solo con la seconda di servizio e per la prima volta nell'incontro subisce il break cinque pari ancora riga esterna il dritto splendido di Dokovic e gioca con la gran risposta di rovescio Sinner ancora palla break [Musica] bravo lo schiaffo di dritto janni Sinner riesce a portare dalla sua parte questo game che per lui si era messo davvero male doković si è fatto massaggiare la coscia sinistra ace di seconda questo è il numero uno del mondo 30 pari ace di seconda ancora ancora Ace traiettoria Slice da destra vincente altro set point Sinner un'altra prima di servizio 203 kmh jannixtiner vince anche il secondo set di questa seconda semifinale de Rolang

          <attvalue for="7" value="China is pushing for dominance – using axes and ramming ships. Because it wants to control the South China Sea. The Philippines and Vietnam are threatened most by China’s ambitions. And both struggle to counter them. The rivalry between China and the United States also has a huge influence on this regional conflict. The Philippines is getting closer to the US in the hope this protects it from China. While Vietnam is balancing between the two superpowers. In this episode, we will look at how China is expanding its control in the South China Sea. And how the Philippines and Vietnam are pushing back in such different ways. Let’s start with this: Chinese warships on patrol, as shown by state media. And sailors taking an oath to defend China. What's interesting about that is where they did it: here, one thousand six hundred kilometers from the Chinese mainland. A provocation for others around these waters: the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and Taiwan. Because many of them have competing claims on these waters. Looks confusing, right? Well, it is! Let’s talk about China’s claims because they’re the biggest. And Beijing has the military muscle to make their claims a reality. Vietnam and the Philippines are most affected. For decades, they’ve been slowly pushed aside in the struggle for control of the many islands in this sea. China’s efforts have already paid off here in the Paracel Islands. Beijing took full control in the nineteen seventies, pushing out Vietnam. Now their focus is on the Spratly Islands. China has been moving in here since the nineteen eighties. The Spratlys are basically disputed bits of land, rock or reef. So, it's actually more important what's around them. The South China Sea is a crucial maritime trade route. There are oil and gas reserves below the seabed... ...and rich fishing grounds. An important food and income source for many people living around here. China refers to it as the South Sea, which is the basis for the English name used internationally. But for Vietnam, it’s the East Sea. And the Philippines calls the waters close to its shores the West Philippine Sea. So even the name of these waters is in dispute. In recent years, China has managed to expand its dominance: by occupying these features in the South China Sea. Let’s zoom in on one example: Mischief Reef. It also has different names in the Philippines, China and Vietnam - but we will stick with the international names. Actually, the Philippines have special rights here under international law. That’s because states are entitled to exploit natural resources, like fisheries and oil within 200 nautical miles of their coastline. It's called their Exclusive Economic Zone. But China has its own interpretation. In the mid-nineties, it erected a number of huts here. It claimed they were meant for Chinese fishermen and ignored protests from the Philippines. Later, Beijing added concrete buildings. In 2015, Chinese dredging ships arrived. They took coral from the reef's core, pulverized it and piled it up to create an artificial island. So, Mischief Reef went from this... ...to this. Today it’s a Chinese militarized outpost. There are dozens of hangars for fighter aircraft, an underground fuel storage and a runway long enough for big military planes. China built up more islands in a similar way - four have airfields. Now, their combat aircraft could strike most countries in the region. And how does China justify all that? After World War II, Beijing published this map with dashes surrounding most of the South China Sea, claiming it has historical rights to it. And China still uses a similar version of it today, a nine-dash line, like in this submission to the UN in 2009. And what about the military installations on the islands? Well, China says they are not directed against its neighbors. This is Hu Bo, director of the South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative, a think-tank in Beijing close to the Chinese government. The US has no official position on who should control what in this sea. But it says it cares about freedom of navigation here. The US has deployed ships and aircraft in the region—in response to China’s island buildup. And both countries sometimes come dangerously close to each other. So, their rivalry is growing here. And that has consequences for the main US ally in the region: the Philippines. This is the moment a Chinese coast guard member went at the crew of a Filipino naval vessel—with an axe. This sailor says he lost a thumb in the incident. He was headed to a Filipino outpost in the Spratly Islands. To this old navy ship, which might be the world’s most unique military assignment: the Sierra Madre. The Philippines ran it aground at Second Thomas Shoal in 1999 to claim control of the reef. Yes, they did that on purpose. And yes, since then the ship has basically been stuck there getting rustier. They say they did it to keep an eye on the ongoing Chinese construction of Mischief Reef, which is just twenty kilometers away. There are a few Filipino military personnel living on the grounded vessel. The navy delivers food and material to repair the rusting hulk. But China is trying to block the resupply efforts. So, that’s why we have recently seen so many standoffs here. The Philippines is filming the encounters and blaming China publicly. That’s part of their strategy. Experts call it: The transparency initiative or the transparency approach. Calling out China's actions as and when they happen. This is Charmaine Willoughby. She is an associate professor at De La Salle University in Manila. And focuses on maritime security in Southeast Asia. This has so far been rather successful for the Philippines because apart from us, there's practically no other claimant states that calls China's actions out. And Manila’s confidence to confront China stems from two things: First: the Philippines took Beijing to the International Court of Arbitration – and won. I still clearly remember the 12th of July in 2016. Practically everybody in the country was celebrating because we realized that international law is actually behind us. That’s when an international tribunal ruled that there is no legal basis for China’s historical claims in the South China Sea. China rejected that ruling. The second reason for the Philippines’ confidence is their big ally, the US—their former colonial power. After independence, the two countries signed a mutual defense treaty. If the Philippines was attacked, the US should help defend them. Given the growing tensions with China, the Philippines is turning more strongly to the US. The country has given the US access to nine military bases on its soil. They are part of the so-called first island chain—a line of American military bases that the US is using to project power close to China. Check out our episode on Taiwan for more on that. Many Filipinos would agree that this is largely the fight between the United States and China, and the Philippines is just caught in the middle. We've always gotten that from our regional neighbors that we have consistently been warned that, hey, don't be too close to the Americans. One country being cautious about how close it gets to the US is Vietnam. These are the outposts Vietnam controls in the South China Sea. One of them is Barque Canada Reef. This is what it used to look like. And this is it in 2024. Enough space to fit a runway for long-range military aircraft. So, Vietnam is kind of following China’s playbook. Vietnam has been ramping up its outposts a lot recently. The Vietnamese sense that now maybe it's a good time for them to really scale up without attracting a lot of attention from Beijing. Nguyễn Khắc Giang is a Vietnam analyst. He works for a Singapore state-funded think tank. The Yusof Ishak Institute. And he's based in Australia. The focus is now on the Philippines. So, they try to do it as quickly as possible before the Chinese will shift attention to the Vietnamese. In the past, China and Vietnam have repeatedly clashed in the South China Sea. But right now China isn’t publicly pushing back against Vietnam’s island building. Maybe because they’re doing the same thing. And maybe because both countries are governed by a communist party. Vietnam avoids publicly confronting China. They try not to provoke China because they know that they cannot really go head on head to China because of the asymmetry in terms of power. And that restraint isn't only because Beijing has a stronger military. Vietnam has a long land border with China. And China is its largest trade partner. So, Vietnam is vulnerable. That’s why it tries to strike a balance between China and the US. This is Vietnam making sure they are getting the exact same treatment during state visits. Vietnam’s balancing act is called “bamboo diplomacy.” Moving between the line like a bamboo swinging in the wind, but not really leaning on one side or the other. In practice that means: The country accepts security assistance including boats from the US—its former war-time foe. But Vietnam also regularly conducts joint patrols with China, close to their common border. But unlike the Philippines, Vietnam says it would not accept a foreign military presence on its soil. Or be part of a military alliance. Vietnam has been trying to walk a really fine line. It used to be a pawn in the geopolitical struggle between Soviet Union, China and the United States. And it was caught up really badly in the Cold War. And I don't think the Vietnamese leadership wants to really relive that experience anymore. China shows no signs of backing down. The Philippines and Vietnam have different strategies in dealing with Beijing. The future of the US-China rivalry will also shape the South China Sea dispute. And how the countries in the region will navigate these troubled waters." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Most of the stuff you buy crosses the world by sea. But shipping containers don't just hold goods. They hold something else, too: power. And China is all in. That’s why they've been investing massively in ports. All over the world. China probably has stakes in a port near you. They're creating a network. And it goes beyond trade. This is a story about promises, sprawling ambition... and a plan to dominate the seas. But let’s start small. Let's go to Kribi in Cameroon. It's a coastal town known for its sandy beaches and fresh fish. Now it's also home to a deepwater sea port built by China just down the coast. This is what the coast by Kribi looked like on satellite images about 20 years ago. Not too much going on. In 2011 a Chinese state-owned construction company started building the port with the help of the Cameroonian government. You can see how quickly it pops up here, along with a highway, that connects Kribi to the rest of the country. China invested over 1 billion dollars to open the port in 2018. The idea, as outlined in this promotional video: to turn Kribi into a key trade hub for all of Central and West Africa. China promised fireworks. And locals say the port has certainly changed things here. And it isn't just Kribi and Cameroon. China's port promise is attractive for governments. They lend you money, you hire a Chinese state-owned construction firm, they quickly build you a port .... and that connects you to global trade. China very efficient in doing so because China has a strong state-owned enterprises. China very efficient, it has hard workers. So that's basically what the Global South will need from China. That’s Wang Yiwei. He’s Director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University of China in Beijing and is a former Chinese diplomat. Also China needs those markets. I think that's a mutual benefit. And in return, China promises not to get involved in your politics no matter what. By the way, China's involvement isn't the same in every port. For example, it can vary from 100 percent ownership to a minority stake. But the pitch has been successful in the Global South. Especially in African countries. Out of around 160 ports that China has stakes in, 53 are on the African continent. Another reason why African countries might be wary of Western investment is – well – the last few hundred years of Western colonialism. China still calls itself a developing country and says it's an equal partner – as opposed to the West. But China's deals with Global South countries still serve China's interests. Like in Kribi. Because as we’ll see, each of these ports is just one small part of a bigger strategy. Enter: The Belt and Road Initiative. By building roads, railways and sea ports, China wants to connect the world in one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects ever conceived. When the Belt and Road Initiative Launched in 2013, it was initially supposed to connect China and Europe – just like China's ancient Silk Road. Now China is tapping into markets in the Global South. So we needed to find a new market for China. And those countries are also very eager to share in the experience of Chinese modernization. Like the Chinese slogan goes, &quot;If you want to get rich, build a road.&quot; Here's the network China has built up. The orange lines are overland routes. The blue lines are maritime routes. In the last few years, China has increasingly expanded the maritime part of the network. And that strategy makes sense: because remember, most traded goods cross the world by sea. These are the main routes they take. And these are some of the world's most vital chokepoints: ships with goods important to world trade need to pass through here to get from one region to another. Now take another look at those ports. They give China pretty crucial access. Which is important for the country as the world's biggest exporter. The real question to my mind has to do with whether or not these infrastructure projects that leave China as the lender, as the builder, as an owner, as an operator accord them undue influence in foreign countries. This is Isaac Kardon. He is a China expert at the US-based Carnegie think tank. His research focuses on China's maritime power. This use of economic coercion against trading partners, the threat or actuality of withholding certain trade and the sort of control over the trading network itself helps give China a bunch of different mechanisms by which it can accomplish that. Meaning: China has gained leverage over many countries. In 2022 China was accused of having used it in the UN human rights council. There was a proposal to talk – just TALK - about Chinese human rights violations against the country's Uyghur Muslim minority in internment camps. Here are the 47 countries in the council at the time. These countries said yes to talking, these countries said no, these abstained. Note that a lot of the African countries in the council voted NO. China has invested in infrastructure projects in some of the countries that voted YES and ALL of the countries that voted NO. The proposal was rejected. Of course, it could have been a coincidence. China's influence has increased, because of lots of investment into those countries. They even learn from China, learn Chinese, you know. Maybe they prefer more like more Chinese model, but that that's their choice. One thing is for sure: China's involvement in ports is cementing a global network - with political allies and trade ties. Now that China has built that trade network, it's anxious to protect it. Let's look at one of those key chokepoints we mentioned before. This narrow strait between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula is called Bab el-Mandeb. The Suez Canal is on the other end of the Red Sea here. Around 12% of world trade usually passes through here. And you guessed it - China has a port here. In the small country of Djibouti. China also has its only official foreign naval base here - right next to the commercial port it has stakes in. China said the reason for opening a base in Djibouti is to secure trade from piracy. And it's not the only country with a military base in Djibouti. Take a look. By the way, the US base is around 13 kilometers from China's base. But we'll get to that rivalry later. So many countries have set up on the strait by Djibouti... ...in part because of attacks like THESE. Most recently Houthi rebels from Yemen have been targeting commercial ships in the Red Sea. Those attacks have been so intense... ... that they changed global trade routes. Many ships are now avoiding the Red Sea altogether. And taking this, much longer route, to get to Europe. Along with Russia, China reportedly even struck a deal with the Houthis to avoid their ships being hit. The UN says disruptions to trade in general are increasing all over the world. A worry especially for the Chinese. The country is not only a big exporter, but also needs to import resources like oil and minerals to keep its economy running. There is a risk to China of the disruption of that network and that would really cause significant problems for their economic model. And political rivalries could also lead to disruption. There is this perception in China that they're vulnerable to US sanctions, to US naval interdiction, to other US efforts alongside allies to essentially cut China out of the global trading system. So it’s no surprise that giant container vessels aren't the only ships from China showing up at these ports now. Meet: the People’s Liberation Army Navy, the PLAN. The navy’s official mission is to &quot;safeguard China's overseas interests.&quot; That includes securing trade. Military doesn't just mean war, rivalry. Military also means providing public goods, securing public goods. In the last few years, China has been massively building up its navy. China can now rival the US in some important military capabilities and already has a larger fleet if you only look at ship numbers. And it's building even more. Plus, there have been rumors about potential new naval bases beyond Djibouti for a while. The most likely spots for them are – you guessed it – some of the overseas ports China is involved in. The US research lab “AidData” found eight ports that they think could become Chinese military bases within the next five years. Remember Kribi in Cameroon? Well, it's on the list. China is the port operator there, the port is deep enough to harbor big warships, ...and China and Cameroon are on good terms politically. And even without ports like Kribi OFFICIALLY becoming naval bases: The People's Liberation Army has made quite extensive use of this network of port facilities. All of the ports and virtually any commercial port is intrinsically a dual-use facility because naval ships need some of the same things that any commercial ship does, in particular fuel and water and food and the ability to rest their crews. And there's more. The US is concerned Chinese involvement in ports could block or limit US commercial – and military – access to them. And that China is using ports to spy. Like here at the Port of Khalifa in the United Arab Emirates. US intelligence said a new planned terminal there was actually a secret military facility. Just to put the US accusations in context: China has one foreign military base, and the US has... well, see for yourself. The bigger the bubble in each country, the more US military bases there are there. In the Chinese case, they're not at that level. They don't have anything resembling the US basing network. But what they have is an interesting alternative. China says it has a different foreign policy, it says it doesn’t intervene in other countries. But the ports certainly expand China’s presence around the world. The existence of this port network and the political relationships and political influence that's associated with it have really created a much more permissive international environment for Chinese military forces to be a kind of regular feature of some of these regional security environments where they didn't used to be present at all. We don’t know how the use of this port network will ultimately play out. The US is watching warily as China expands into what they perceive as their backyard in Latin America. One of the new ports: Chancay in Peru. It will supposedly slash shipping times between South America and Asia. A Chinese shipping company will be the sole operator of the port, which is why US officials have repeatedly voiced concern about the project. But China's port promise remains attractive around the world. As they expand their port network, they are gaining new allies willing to harbor their ambitions. gpersonalcordula_johannis_dw_comEuksdsYyeLlItjLa05mHI3YBtYcj5bcZFoxWmoPcaXQiMg?e=bkAvcR" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="It’s a symbol of Germany’s economic might. The chemicals factory of BASF in the city of   Ludwigshafen. BASF helped spread Germany’s industrial power around the world.  Now, it's axing 2600 jobs here. All the while,  it’s opening a new 10-billion-dollar factory... in  China. Germany has long been known as Europe’s   economic powerhouse. But this year, it’s the world’s worst performing leading economy.  German economic growth is down, its factories  are less productive, and hope for its future  success is waning. As Germany’s economic outlook shifts from   grand to gloomy, the model behind its rise is thrown into doubt.  Why should you change a winning team? The  success of really the last 20 years probably  has made a couple of people, you know, a bit  blind, a bit insensitive to how the global  economy has changed. If left untreated, Germany’s economic   pain risks spreading to an entire region. It's really the European Union where most   of the trade for Germany takes place. Exporting and importing at the same time. So if Germany's   economy is not doing that well, that is also experienced by the other countries.  In this episode, we will analyze the rise and  potential fall of Europe’s biggest economy.  The situation overall is not great. The  German economy is shrinking, and companies are  telling us, yes, they expect a  certain stabilization, but overall,   most companies arerem pessimistic.  We will look under the hood  of Germany’s economic success.  What is the German recipe for success so  far? That was to produce technologically  advanced products that are in  high demand all over the world.  We will assess the gravity of its problems. We can’t be naïve. We are experiencing a cyclical   downturn, but we also have structural problems that we are working on.  And we will ask ‘Is Germany’s  economic success model doomed?’  That’s all coming up on Business Beyond. To understand Germany’s problems today,   we have to dissect what made the country so successful in the first place.  During the 1990s, Germany’s  economy was struggling.  Reunification merged a successful capitalist  economy with a low-income socialist planned  economy. Absorbing the East meant West  Germany had to dish out big social security  payments. The consequences strained  Germany’s budget and its job market.  20 years ago, early 2000, the late 1990s, sick  man of Europe, we had actually only one big  problem in Germany and there was or maybe  two, and it was the aftermath of the  reunification and we had surging unemployment  To turn the country’s economic woes around,  the center left government of Gerhard  Schröder introduced reforms that greased  the wheels of the job market: they cut  employment benefits and created  more temporary and low paying jobs.  The first thing is it really led to labor  market reforms that lowered wages or made people  more willing to accept jobs at wages that  they would have otherwise not considered.  More people working in lower wage jobs  meant labor became cheaper. So German  companies were able to manufacture and sell  goods at a better price. At the same time,  other parts of the world  started buying more stuff.  When you look back over the last 20 years.  We had China joining the global economy. We  had also Eastern European economies  joining the European Union. We had many  emerging economies clearly catching up with  the developed world. So all these factors  together were creating a huge  demand for manufacturing goods.  Roadmarking machinery, custom made tunnel  drills, printing machines for stage designs and  specialized endoscopy devices. Made in Germany was synonymous with   precision and quality. The country went from laggard to leader. It inspired literature. And   flashy economic papers. It even won the world cup.  What is the German recipe for success so far?  That was to produce technologically advanced  products that are in high  demand all over the world.  It’s fastest growing buyer? China. The country’s emergence as a market economy   in the 2000s played into the hands of German engineers. German   exports to the country surged. That was a completely new market   and it was a huge market and it was really very profitable to go there and sell our products.  Thanks to Beijing’s boom, Germany became  the world’s third biggest exporter.  But, since then, the sunny  outlook has become cloudy.  As long as things go fine, it’s like: Okay,  big party. But at the moment, the world economy  hits a bit of a bump in the road. Like now,  the German economy suffers immediately.  The world bank says the global economy is  perilously close to falling into a recession. The  war in Ukraine and the continuing effects  of the pandemic mean it has significantly  downgraded its expectations for this year. Germany’s economic model made it extremely   dependent on appetite for German products around the world. And, right now,   that appetite is waning. Particularly in one of its most important markets.  After peaking in 2020, the share of Germany's  exports to China has been on a steady  decline. Remember BASF,   the German chemical giant? They  recorded a 76% profit loss in the  second quarter of 2023. The main reason?  Lagging demand from China. And BASF is no  outlier. So if something goes wrong in China,   it immediately means the demand for, say, German cars is falling. But the demand for German   engineering machine tools, you know, Siemens type big engineering projects is falling as well.  On the one hand, Germany is a giant exporter  of consumer goods. So products that are  ready to use like cars and medicine. On the other hand, the German economy also   depends on selling capital goods, so products that are used to produce other things.  And so the Germans export fewer consumer  goods to China, fewer capital goods to China,  and fewer capital goods to countries that  export consumer goods to China. So, it's  basically once you have a tailspin in  Germany, it hits three times where in other  economies it would just be the exports in  the narrower sense, the consumer goods that  would be hit. The global demand driving Germany’s success   is dampening. But that’s not the only problem.  Remember the energy crisis in Europe? It  really turned Germany’s industry on its head.  Let’s go back to the BASF plant in Ludwigshafen. On any given day,   the plant uses more power than Switzerland. Factories like these make Germany’s industry much   more energy intensive than that of its neighbors.  That wasn’t much of a problem when Russia  provided cheap gas to the country. But, with  the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Germany’s  era of affordable energy ended. And so did  momentum for G erman manufacturing. During the second quarter of 2022, sky-high   natural gas prices jolted BASF’s energy bill up by more than 700 million Euros.  So at the moment we are paying the price  of a delayed energy transition. We were too  heavily dependent, especially on Russian  gas. And this is why now we see fossil energy  inflation. And with this also a stagnation  of the German economy at the moment  BASF was forced to shut down its most  energy-intensive production lines.  Some 700 jobs will be affected. All the while,  its expansion plans for China remain intact.  Up until about a year ago, I think people would  incorrectly say that businesses care about  two things only when they decide on where  to locate, and that is taxes and wages. And  then since the year ago, they would  say it's taxes and wages and energy.  Germany has now made it out of last year’s  energy crisis. And prices have been falling. But  in some areas, lasting economic  damage might have been done.  So, yes, energy prices have come down again  since the surge last year. And in the first  week after the start of the war in Ukraine. But  energy prices are still higher than pre pandemic.   Plus, the future of energy supply and  the future of energy prices is highly  uncertain. And this explains why. You know,  and I guess, you know, it's understandable  why businesses, corporates are also looking  elsewhere to see, okay, is there another  region that might offer more stability, more  clarity, more energy security than Germany  currently can? Rising energy prices and falling orders   have hurt Germany’s gas-guzzling industry. It's producing less of the things that made it rich.  And that’s making a country known for its  efficiency lose momentum. Right now, Germans  work fewer hours, so are less productive,  than employees in other industrial nations.  We are in the process of deindustrialisation  because production is falling and I don't see it  easily coming back. If demand OUTSIDE Germany is falling – economic   engines INSIDE the economy become more important. Like how much people buy.   But here’s the issue: They aren’t buying enough.  The problem in Germany has been that private  consumption has systematically been to  too low. Relatively low wages helped jumpstart   Germany’s export machine 20 years ago. Now, they are making matters worse.  Wages cannot rise much more, wages don't  rise much more. Um, so, so the effect is that  private demand doesn't grow much in  Germany, which means that the German economy  is even more dependent on exports than it  would otherwise have been. So wages have to  be kept under control because it depends on  exports. So domestic demand falls, export,  you know, become even more  important as a proportion.  According to a study by the Knowledge from  Growth Institute, Germans’ wage expectations  this September were the lowest they have been  since the beginning of the survey in 1991.  But its not just low incomes suppressing  consumption. Germans’ wallets are also under  stress from rampant inflation  and high energy prices.  With low demand insi de the country, the export  sector will likely remain Germany’s biggest  economic engine. But, when it comes to the  goods its sells, analysts believe that Germany  has been betting on the same horse for too  long. All the while, the racetrack has changed.  I think we only just have to ask ourselves,  what is it that we're mainly purchasing on a  daily basis. Is it an app or is it really a  good. And I think most people will answer: Well,  indeed it is an app. It is music, it is a movie,  but it is not kind of a tangible manufactured  good. And this is where the German economy   is not that strong. And this is also where the German industry is hit the most.  As Germany’s traditional export industry  declines, the question is what big new thing will  replace it. So far there’s no clear answer. Except for software maker SAP, Germany’s tech   sector is essentially non-existent. And that’s no coincidence.  The German government has been frugal  concerning its future. For the past two decades,  it has invested significantly less into  its economy than its European neighbors.  I think, you know, we've done well. And when  we do well, we just, you know, think that  we have everything we need. Marianne Janik is the CEO of Microsoft in Germany.  Berlin’s prudence is linked to a cultural dislike  for public debt here in Germany. A relic of the  hyperinflation that gripped the  country during the Weimar Republic.  Fiscal policy in Germany is, you know, to put  it mildly, is repressive. Right. I mean, they  you talk about the black zero, the Schwarzer  null, but a zero means nothing in fiscal policy.  It's not good to have a zero because it means  essentially that you're not investing in the  future. Right. It's like you have to think of  your economy as a house that you buy over 30  years or longer, not as a household that  has to meet sort of weekly or monthly budget  constraints. That's not how you do it.  One crucial sector that has been underfunded  is IT. Only a third of all German households  have very high-speed internet connection. And  the country’s workforce is less digitally savvy  than that of many other European countries. We shouldn’t be defeatist, but we also shouldn’t   be naive. We have to change things. We have a big transformation   of our economy ahead of us. That’s Christian Lindner, Germany’s finance   minister. His government recently approved further budget cuts for investments in   digitalization. Germany being the   country where you just think about  efficiency, about cost reduction.  And this also, you know, doesn't help when  you have to evolve. You have to invest, of  course, in those digital infrastructures.  So we've done a little bit too well maybe.  Digitalization is one of Germany’s keys to  more economic growth. But, at the moment, 40%  of Germany’s small and medium-sized  businesses can’t find employees with necessary  digital expertise. For one, the country’s society is ageing, so   there aren’t enough workers to fill vacancies. But it’s also because those who CAN   work don’t have the right training. Because of the crisis, we are seeing growing   interest in training for digital professions. Dalia Das founded an IT bootcamp in Hamburg.   Retraining schools like this one are becoming more common. They offer   to bring employees up to speed. Germany is lagging behind in the digital   realm. If we don’t manage to include all social groups and make them more digitally savvy,   we are going to have problems. To bring its economy on a future-fit path,   Germany now plans to double its funding for AI and create new university labs for research. But   for progress in these highly advanced technologies, Germany will first need   to mend the craters in its digital foundation. There's a lot of research going on in Germany,   the entire IT sector. We are not very good at it so far, but there's   a lot of potential for development Germany’s traditional export market is waning,   and its tech sector is weak. So, experts say it’s important to explore new areas of growth.  We have to see there are huge opportunities  out there in many sectors and how can we  be successful in developing them? I think it's  mostly based on our ability to be innovative,  to research. Innovation begets economic growth.   But it’s not an area Germany performs well in. A 2023 study placed it 10th worldwide. Behind   countries like Singapore, Switzerland and Denmark.  But lack of innovation isn’t coming from a lack  of ideas. Germany registers more patents in  Europe than any other European country. The  issue is turning those ideas into GERMAN  businesses. The first hurdle is made up of paper. Lots of it.  Germany is infamous for its bureaucracy. It takes more than 120 days to start a new   company in Germany, compared to just 40 in Italy or Greece.  And construction permits take more than 50%  longer than the average for industrialized  countries. The second hurdle, also paper.  Let's look at Marvel Fusion for example. The  Munich deep tech start-up wants to produce  zero-carbon energy with atomic fusion. It’s  thriving and expanding massively. It recently  announced the construction of its first lab  worth 150 million dollars – in the United States.  This is Heike Freund, the COO of Marvel Fusion If I compare the European ecosystem to the   US ecosystem, especially when it comes to investments, more than 90% of all the investments   globally have been done in the US and not in Europe,   in the private fusion company space. Giant funding like the one Mar vel   Fusion needed is still hard to come by in Germany. Meaning many ideas get stopped in their tracks.  I believe we have amazing human capital  here. We have great talent here, we have a  great industrial ecosystem here. So, Germany  would have all the pieces here to develop  the next tech champions. But with that missing  funding gap, it's close to impossible to  commercialize those innovations  at the end in Europe.  At the beginning of this video, we asked  whether Germany’s economic success model is  broken. The experts we spoke to painted a  picture of a country whose prosperity is  threatened. Not only by short-term problems  but also by structural issues. *Aside* Even  Germany’s finance minister admits to that.  Subtitles: We shouldn’t be naïve. We are  experiencing a cyclical downturn, but we also  have structural problems that we are  working on. Talent, energy, infrastructure,  digitalization... Ample trade, cheap energy and strong   industry fueled Germany’s boom times. They lulled leaders into a false sense of security. Their   failure to pursue reforms is now coming back to bite.  It doesn’t make sense to keep things as  they are. Everything changes, so we have to  change as well. Now, Germany has to find a new economic   engine. That will entail breaking out of existing patterns.  So in the current situation, it will not be  possible to orchestrate a full overhaul of the  German economy and sticking  to the fiscal debt brake.  Investing in the future. We should be broad. And politicians   don't need to answer this question: “what are the sectors of the future?” But they have to create   conditions that allow for developments in many areas.  Improving energy supply. The current government has now made   a lot of decisions to increase the share of renewables much faster than in the past.   So a lot of barriers have been removed. There are now windmills installed a little bit faster,   but a lot of solar PVS on the roofs. That is increasing at the moment. So this is   going in the right direction. And boosting a dwindling workforce.  Pay them better and they will  come. It’s not a mystery.  At the same time, experts say that Germany’s  success as an export power shouldn’t be  buried completely. But it doesn't mean we have to throw   away our comparative advantage. For instance, in trade, I think the German government at the   moment is doing, in that case the right thing. They are saying, let's try and do new trade   agreements with Latin America, with other countries  So you sort of have a have an interesting  problem is that the slump in Germany will be  more accentuated because of its industrial  structure and its sort of position in the  international division of Labor. But the  inverse happens when the world economy picks up  again because then Germany  is the first one to benefit.  One thing is certain, the cushy years are  coming to an end. What Germany does with that  realization will determine the strength  of its economy in the years to come.  And Germany has been sort of the engine of  of the European economy. So people worry,  people ask. But on the other hand, you know,  I think it's a good thing that that we get a  little bit of attention as well that makes us  also reflect a little bit and get this reflection,  this perspective from the outside so that  we, as you know, German economy, German  companies, German industry start to reflect  a little bit what we want to stand for.  And that’s it from this episode of Business  Beyond. If you want to dive deeper into the German  economy, check out our recent video on German  carmaker’s troubles in the electric vehicle space." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="my fellow Americans this is Liberation Day waiting for a long time april 2nd 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn the day America's destiny was reclaimed and the day that we began to make America wealthy again it's been a little over a month since US President Donald Trump upended the global economy with a huge onslaught of tariffs it's been a wild ride within a week of so-called Liberation Day most tariffs were paused while those on China were ramped up to 145% before a deal was struck markets have reeled and since bounced back uncertainty abounds take the US dollar it has slumped sharply since Trump's inauguration in January losing value against other major currencies big announcements have been followed by sharp dollar falls as investors lose faith in the currency and the US economy in general consequences are part of a deeper plan many in Trump circle believe the dollar is overvalued and its strength is responsible for many of the issues they want to address from trade deficits to de-industrialization and some believe that Trump's team are eyeing an alternative grand bargain in order to reshape the global financial system in America's favor so is there a philosophy behind the chaos or is it simply chaos it's coming up on Business Beyond speculation that Trump has a radical plan to upend the global economic system has been rampant it's an idea that goes beyond tariffs it's about convincing other major economies to devalue the dollar a major catalyst was this a paper published in November 2024 by the investment firm Hudson Bay Capital Management it said Trump's return to the White House put America on the cusp of generational change in the international trade and financial systems it suggested that rather than face punitive tariffs trade partners like Europe and China become receptive to a quote unquote currency accord in other words that the tariffs simply be used as a bargaining chip towards dollar devaluation and it gave the potential agreement a name the Mara Lago accord the idea being that the great nations of the world would meet at Trump's Florida base to thrash out a deal on global currency exchange a paper like this could easily slip by unnoticed but this one got people talking because the author was Steven Myron now Trump's chairman of the Council of Economic Adviserss right at the center of policymaking in the White House in his pitch Myron referenced big moments in economic history where currency rules were agreed at grand gatherings and it is true that rules can change quickly one of the most well-known summits came at Breton Woods in New Hampshire towards the end of World War II in 1944 where allied nations forged a new financial system the Brentonwoods order established stable exchange rates between currencies and set the US dollar as the world's main reserve currency used for most international trade it also established global financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund crucially the system enshrined the gold standard which pegged the value of currencies to gold in 1971 the so-called Nixon shock saw President Richard Nixon end dollar convertability to gold major currencies were soon traded on floating exchange rates but by the mid 1980s the US dollar was seen as seriously overvalued amid strong economic growth and large trade deficits at New York's Plaza Hotel in September 1985 the then G5 nations of the US Japan West Germany France and the UK agreed a major intervention in currency markets to depreciate the dollar against their own currencies it became known as the Plaza Accord now in 2025 many in the Trump administration favor a similar redrawing of the international financial order myron argues that for decades the US dollar has been too strong mainly due to its reserve currency status and that that has made American exports too expensive leading to massive trade deficits and de-industrialization there are various ways of measuring the relative strength of the US dollar one of the most reliable is the real broad dollar index used by the Federal Reserve it's weighted by trade volumes and includes many other currencies looking at its progression over the last 20 years we can see that since the lows of the financial crisis in 2011 the dollar has been getting stronger and stronger despite a few bumps before Trump took office it was at its strongest point since this measure began in 2006 a more long-term measure is the US dollar index it's not weighted by trade and measures the dollar against a few other major global currencies it surged in the early 1980s leading to the 1985 Plaza Accord it fell sharply before rising again in the late 1990s amid the Asian financial crisis the dotcom bubble crash in the early 2000s prompted another fall as did the global financial crisis but since then the dollar has been on an upward curve we approached Steven Meyer for an interview but he wasn't made available to speak to us however in a speech he made at the Hudson Institute last month he explained how the global demand for dollars has led to imbalanced international trade the reserve function of the dollar has caused persistent currency distortions and contributed along with other countries unfair barriers to trade to unsustainable trade deficits these trade deficits have decimated our manufacturing sector and many working-class families in their communities to facilitate non-Americans trading with each other central to his argument is the reserve currency role countries like to hold foreign reserves for various reasons and they want to hold them in a dependable currency the US dollar is undeniably the world's reserve currency more than half of all foreign reserves are held in US dollars leaving it way ahead of the euro in second place it's sometimes suggested that the Chinese renmanb could emerge as an alternative reserve currency but current data shows just 2% of international reserves are held in it many economists agree that the dollar is too strong but there are disagreements around the reasons for that and its consequences i dislike the myin piece uh quite strongly i think it's wrongheaded that's Mark Soil a veteran US Treasury official he worked in international financial diplomacy for much of his career and is now the US chair of the official monetary and financial institutions forum think tank he agrees that the dollar is exceptionally strong but thinks it is more to do with the US government's need to borrow big to finance itself and service its huge debt pile rather than its global status as a reserve currency and Myin talks about the dollar's reserve currency status but he doesn't really talk about the need to uh get our fiscal house in order and then the Myron article kind of implies that the dollar's global role is bad for America now in Europe they always talk about the dollar's exorbitant privilege but uh Myron implies that there is an exorbitant burden i don't think it's either of those things i think it's a net plus the US has a massive federal debt burden and it's getting bigger the US government spends a lot more money than it takes in through taxes and other revenue and borrows heavily to meet its obligations which can push up the value of the dollar since the CO 19 pandemic annual deficits have swelled and they're projected to remain at around $1.5 trillion annually for the next few years myin also talks a lot about trade deficits something Trump and his team say the tariffs directly target someone who agrees on trade deficits is Richard Coup currently the chief economist at Namura Research Institute in Japan he has advised several Japanese prime ministers and worked with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the 1980s just before the Plaza Accords were agreed for a very long time this trade deficit caused largely by the strong dollar was left unattended and it was Trump's genius to find out that there was so many unhappy people there and once he start talking about protectionism you know suddenly he began to attract huge number of support some countries export a lot more than they import and vice versa those who export more have trade surpluses china has the biggest in 2023 it had a surplus of just under 400 billion US some of its Asian counterparts such as Japan India and the Philippines have trade deficits but no one's trade deficits rivals that of the US it had a deficit of just shy of $800 billion in 2023 and the US has been running trade deficits for decades since the year 2000 its trade deficit has routinely been $400 billion or more per year in the last few years it's been just under $1 trillion richard Coup believes decades of trade deficits have severely hurt Americans his research group has tried to calculate the cost and they came up with a huge figure when you calculate GDP you add trade surplus dollar for dollar you subtract trade deficit dollar for dollar the amount of uh GDP Americans lost as a result of this 40ome years of trade deficit was over 153% of GDP in equivalent to dollars that's 41 trillion he thinks these costly deficits are a direct consequence of the strong dollar it was the strength of the dollar which created this massive trade deficits for such a long time and because government did nothing about it we ended up having this very protectionist president at the top to protect American workers and the industry so it's in that sense that I would argue that the dollar was too strong for too long but there are many who question how the Trump administration has framed the issue of trade deficits and how they relate to the dollar one is Steven Myron's predecessor as chair of the Council of Economic Adviserss under the presidency of Joe Biden that's Jared Bernstein who served in the role from June 2023 to January 2025 you don't necessarily see the trade deficit move in lock step with a strong dollar we've had periods with a strong US economy leading to a strong dollar high trade deficits and really low unemployment so all of those folks can all of those characters in that play can show up together and there's the view that Trump's obsession with trade deficits obscures wider economic contexts trump is very obsessed with uh trade bounces and the US trade deficit and he believes that foreign countries are ripping us off and we should have uh a balanced position and part of getting there uh involves a lower dollar central to Trump's rhetoric on trade and to Myron's ideas is a pledge to restore American manufacturing to apparent former glories american steel workers auto workers farmers and skilled craftsmen we have a lot of them here with us today they really suffered gravely they watched in anguish as foreign leaders have stolen our jobs foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream it's a view that's resonated with many US voters one person who shares President Trump's views on manufacturing is Judy Shelton she was an economic adviser to Trump during his first term when he nominated her to the Federal Reserve before her appointment was blocked due to opposition in the US Congress whole sections of the country who were dependent on industrial production and manufacturing particularly our auto industry th those regions of the country have been hollowed out as factories closed and there really wasn't much sympathy for those workers it was almost sort of a callous well why don't you learn computer coding why why don't you build wind farms um it was a little bit of a I won't say cruel but let's say negligent approach and as it turns out those workers um ended up voting for Trump for decades up until the global financial crisis the share of US workers in manufacturing declined back in the 1970s close to a quarter of US workers were still employed in manufacturing but the figure plunged in the 1980s and into the 1990s further declines in the 2000s saw it hover around 10% by the global financial crisis where it roughly remains shelton and others believe that countries managing their currencies against the dollar going back to the 1980s allowed them to hold up their manufacturing bases at the expense of the US i can recall in the 1980s currency manipulation was actually a huge bipartisan issue in the United States government where um Democrats and Republicans were saying you know it's really not fair to our exporters that um other countries can can debase their currencies relative to the dollar and I think since China has come on so strong and we've seen the the yuan depreciate against the dollar um that's been particularly hard and and as a result our country is flooded with cheap imports from China because Americans used to produce lots of televisions cars household appliances stereo sets all sorts of things but if what they produce cannot be sold at the competitive prices that the Japanese or Germans are coming in then even if they have the capacity to produce it they won't be able to sell it and I think that's how it all happened over these years but there is another view jared Bernstein has sympathy for the argument that free trade has hurt workers in the US and elsewhere but he says Trump's policies will not restore US manufacturing the Trump tariffs are being sold to the American public as pain now in terms of higher prices higher costs on our imports uh and gain later in terms of reindustrializing America bringing manufacturing back and there are many reasons why I believe that's a false promise why that won't work he says developed countries such as Germany which have trade surpluses have also suffered de-industrialization and it's true while manufacturing has declined as a share of total employment in the US that's a common story across the developed world in fact the US current rate of manufacturing employment as a share of total employment at or just below 10% puts it in roughly the same position as many countries in Europe South America or Asia however China which still has close to one-third of total employment in manufacturing has the highest share in the world look at countries that have very different levels of trade deficits and as as as economies advance they tend to move from manufacturing to services and that's fine that's not a bad thing uh but re-industrialization doesn't look to us like a plausible scenario at the end of it so instead of being pain now gain later it looks to us like pain now pain later yet while many agree that a return to the manufacturing base of old is unrealistic there is a view that dollar devaluation is still needed to restore a sense of balance around trade i don't think we'll ever get back to the world we had in 1970s but what we have to do with the exchange rate adjustment is to reduce the number of people in United States who consider themselves losers of free trade that brings us back to the beginning and to a major part of Myron's argument that the dollar's reserve currency status keeps its value too high relative to other currencies that role does come at a certain cost to the US as Mark Soil explains if country X has dollar reserves they're they're getting interest payments on that right and that um adds to pressure on our capital markets it adds to the US interest bill which is very high but it also brings significant advantages from lower borrowing costs for the US government to reduced foreign exchange risks to support for the US financial system the reason the dollar one of the reasons the dollar is the world's reserve currency is the openness and liquidity and depth of our capital markets people can bring their money here they can bring their money out no problems and they know they'll be protected by good rule of law one of Myron's proposals is to have foreign bond holders that means investors who loan the US money and then hold bonds issued by the US government to convert short-term highinterest bonds into long-term bonds that the US won't have to pay much on so that would reduce the financing pressures now uh of our interest bill and that would help our fiscal uh situation but again why would an investor uh go out why why would an investor do that well this Mar logo argument also have this notion that other countries have to hold zero coupon you know US treasuries or something that part I don't think will fly under any circumstances uh because each country do have their own sovereignty right they don't they cannot be forced to hold these things but Judy Shelton and Richard Ku do believe that a Plaza Accord style of restructuring global exchange rates should happen and that it could limit Trump's desire for tariffs why don't we consider this option maybe we can use the tariffs as some sort of a you know kind of a dealmaking tool to get people to come in and actually sit down about and try to do something about this but the final solution for US trade deficit problem has to be the dollar correction we need to talk about free trade in the context of of a rules-based approach and we have in currency markets a free-for-all and I think that um the trade relationships are a reflection of that because certainly look you don't have to call it currency manipulation let's just call it um no fault currency shifts nevertheless it has negative consequences for the country um that suffers through no fault of their own in fact Judy Shelton might have been one of the first people to actually come up with the idea of a currency pow-ow at Mara Lago writing for the Financial Times back in 2016 she raised the idea of Trump bringing back the gold standard writing &quot;No one anticipates that a Bretonwood style conference will soon take place at Mara Lago the exclusive Trump resort in Florida.&quot; Still as Mr trump often urges it's time to start thinking big once again i might have been among the first to say if we have such a conference in the future or an effort to have a stable international monetary foundation to to carry out the logic of free trade in that Adam Smith sense of comparative advantage uh if it takes place at Mara Lago great but Jared Bernstein says the famous summits of the past had very different contexts to the world of 2025 namely a spirit of cooperation and mutual concern for that to happen I mean accord means getting together and agreeing which is actually what happened at the Plaza Hotel getting together with other countries cooperating and agreeing have you seen President Trump in action on the global stage does he seem like an accord guy to you uh and the answer to that if you've been paying attention should be no so that's doesn't really you know I think that's why I don't really believe that there's going to be anything like that happening then there is the key question of central banks independence from their governments and their desire to pursue their own currencies interests the ECB the Fed are independent they target inflation not exchange rates uh the major financial authorities are free floaters they don't really believe intervention has a lasting impact um another issue is that countries cyclical positions vary um and countries are going to pursue their own self-interests as with many issues in the Trump era polarization has come to define economic debates but those who agree with the Mara Lago accord idea or with Trump's agenda in general believe their serious proposals if everyone approaches it by taking a breath and saying &quot;Let's have an ethical and orderly international trading system based on a stable monetary order.&quot; These these could be worthy objectives and uh perhaps even in entice some of our trade partners into the same pursuit i have spoken to many uh currency officials China Japan and elsewhere and they are all they all agree that this is the great idea the question is who's going to be the leader to do it but those who disagree say the issue is not just wrongheaded it's economic makebelieve and fantasy there is no Marago accord okay it's like the Loch Ness monster people talk about it a lot but no one's ever seen it in terms of really policy implementation and then there's a view that there's simply no plan that talk of accords and grand projects is just a way to make sense of something fundamentally lacking there's a thing that people sometimes do especially sort of complex thinkers you know and economists that that they look at an administration like the Trump folks and they try to make sense out of it they try to make it fit into something sensible and rational it's almost a defense mechanism and frankly I kind of understand that on a psychological level i wouldn't go there with this team it's very chaotic it's very transactional it's on today off tomorrow so don't try to impose coherence on this agenda coherent or not the agenda rolls on and while many disagree with Trump vehemently they recognize that much of his success has roots in economic discontent yet finding common cause to solve these problems in an era of division ranker and name calling that remains elusive and that's it for this episode of Business Beyond please let us know what you think in the comments

          <attvalue for="7" value="The shores of Greenland. This remote island in the Arctic has a problem now. We need Greenland for national security. ... One way or the other, we’re gonna get it. Geographically part of North America, Greenland has close ties to the United States. But politically it’s part of Europe -- as a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. This wasn’t an issue before. The U.S. and Denmark are NATO allies and have long cooperated on the island. Until now. Donald Trump refused to rule out military force to take control of the island. Denmark’s prime minister has been racing across the continent trying to shore up support from allies. What does Trump’s longing for Greenland mean for its people? Do you want Greenland to be bought? No, not at all. Why is this island in the far north suddenly so important? You can think of Greenland as a giant aircraft carrier sitting in an amazing position. Only fifty-seven thousand people live in Greenland which is the world's biggest island. Greenland’s towns and settlements are scattered along the coast, including the capital Nuuk. The island is right between the US, Canada, the European Union and Russia. And on the shortest route between the European part of Russia and the US. That’s why, here... ...the US built one of its most important radar stations – at Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base. The US facility was set up during the Cold War to detect missile launches from the Soviet Union – and prepare to strike back. The job was to build a giant airbase for our largest long-range bombers high on the north-west coast of Greenland at a tiny settlement called Thule. Built with the permission of the Danish government, the base would push our defense line two thousand miles to the North. Today it remains the northernmost US military base in the world. And don’t get fooled by this footage. Winters there are brutal. Despite this significant US base... ...Greenland is actually a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. How did this happen? We will get to that. Denmark is a small European country of 6 million people. And its capital, Copenhagen, is further away from Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, than Washington DC. Denmark only has a light military footprint in Greenland. Danish troops patrol on dog sleds across the inland... ...and a few navy vessels monitor the shores. It’s American power and not Danish power that provides security. Because the Greenlanders know that our base there is ultimately what's going to guarantee their security, and the Danes know that, as well. This is Scott Barry Zellen, an American researcher at the University of Connecticut, specializing in Arctic geopolitics. And so, the fact that Greenland has a strategic role to play and a forward military presence for the US military already means that they are part of our security system. But Donald Trump is taking it to the next level. He says the US must have control of Greenland because of Russian and Chinese cooperation in the Arctic. You look outside, you have China ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We're not letting that happen. That has stunned Europeans. In Denmark, we're also requesting, well, what is it actually the US want us to do? Marc Jacobsen is researching Arctic security and diplomacy at the Royal Danish Defense College, which is under the oversight of the Danish armed forces. What we know is that they want Denmark to increase surveillance of Greenland. It’s important to remember that Greenland is half the size of Europe. So even if Denmark used all its military budget on increasing surveillance of Greenland, we would never know everything what's going on there. Surveillance is especially important between Greenland, Iceland and the UK in this area called the GIUK Gap. This naval chokepoint is a crucial part of NATO strategy to detect and contain Russian ships, especially submarines moving between the Arctic and the Atlantic. Denmark is now investing in new ships and drones to deploy in the far north. It wants to keep sharing defense responsibility for Greenland with the US. That cooperation started after Nazi Germany occupied Denmark in World War 2. The Danish ambassador in Washington agreed that the US should occupy Greenland... ...and construct military bases on the island to prevent a German invasion. More than ten thousand US fighters and bombers landed in Greenland on their way to the war in Europe. Greenland proved such a strategic asset, that in 1946 the US wanted to buy it from Denmark for a hundred million dollars in gold. The offer was rejected but both countries kept it secret at the time. Not long after both countries became founding members of NATO. Denmark agreed US troops should stay. And in 1951, the two countries signed a treaty on common defense of Greenland. It is still in effect today. That’s why Trump’s threat to take Greenland is such a big deal. We're now the greatest threat to Danish unity. Not the Russians, not the Chinese, but America, their NATO partner. And this tension is not only about security. In February 2025, a US-Senate committee held a hearing revealing much broader interest in the island, for example from the US mining industry. Greenland's entire coastline holds what is indisputably one of the world's greatest collection of minerals in one jurisdiction. Throw a dart at any portion of the coastline and you will undoubtedly hit a potential world class target. Just look at this map of mineral resources, provided by Greenland’s government. Precious metals, base metals, industrial rocks, and rare metals – including rare earths. This is just a hint of the resources in Greenland. But most of it remains largely untapped. It's important to remember that there's very little mining activity in Greenland. All these stories about Greenland's riches in terms of mineral resources, it's still far on the horizon. There are just two active mines in Greenland. And only about a hundred people currently work in Greenland’s mining sector. Exploration is very challenging. Take this mineral deposit site in the south of Greenland, for example. It is said to be among the world's top rare earth deposits outside China. But in 2021 the Greenland government stopped exploration here. Because the site also contains radioactive uranium and is close to populated areas. But it’s not just environmental concerns. Extracting resources is a lot costlier here than in most other places. There are no roads linking Greenland’s settlements. And the terrain is rough, with deep fjords, glaciers and icy mountain ranges. The climate is harsh. But it is changing due to the climate crisis. Whether you're for or against it, ice just melts. It's melting faster, it's melting more rapidly, and it's creating opportunity as ice retreats in time to have greater accessibility to interior natural resources. And it’s also affecting the ocean around Greenland. This visualization from NASA shows the reduction of ice pack in the Arctic between the nineteen-eighties and twenty-nineteen. But instead of a wake-up call, many companies and countries see it as an economic opportunity. They are waiting for new shipping routes to open in the Arctic. Three of them in particular: The Northwest Passage through the top of the Canadian archipelago. The Northern Sea Route along the Russian coast. And the Transpolar Sea Route. These routes could cut shipping time between Asia and Europe. Because for most destinations they are much shorter than the current route via the Suez Canal. For now, navigation across the Arctic is limited and relies on expensive icebreakers. So, both mining as well as new shipping routes remain something for the future. Right now, fishing is the mainstay of Greenland's economy. But that is not enough. That's why Denmark has to chip in. Every year Denmark sends a grant of about 500 million euros to Greenland's government. It's about half of its budget – nearly ten thousand Euros per resident every year – a major factor for the island’s economy. That money runs everything and without it you end up with impoverished native villages, without economies that implode socially. But it's not charity. Denmark gets something out of it as well. Because we have Greenland, we kind of get a lot to say with the great powers such as the US, but also Canada and Russia. It means a lot politically. Denmark kind of punches above its weight in international politics. Whether Denmark likes it or not – most Greenlanders do not see their long-term future with Denmark. Inuit people have lived on the island for thousands of years. They survived by subsistence hunting of whales and seals. Their culture was based in the middle of nature. Modern Danish colonization started in 1721 with the first Danish settlements. Over the next 200 years, Christianity and the Danish language were pushed on the Inuit, their families were torn apart. And that trauma left a legacy. Only after World War 2, a slow process of decolonization started. Step by step, Greenland became an equal part of the Kingdom of Denmark, elected its own parliament and government. Today, it is a semiautonomous territory. This means that it governs its own domestic affairs. Denmark is still responsible for security and foreign policy. But Greenland has the right to declare independence if it decides to do so in a referendum. And the government of Greenland says that’s its goal. Polls suggest a clear majority support such a step. Of course, in the future I prefer an independent Greenland. We are our own people. We are not Danes, we are Greenlandic people and we want to be free. And what about Trump’s plans for the island? Do you want Greenland to be bought? No, not at all. Why not? Because it is our land and we have our culture, language and we are starting to get our own way of life. I don't really like this idea of being part of the United States of America. But what I do like is to work with them for example. This is a common opinion here. Because building the island’s economy is the biggest challenge on the way to independence. That is why Greenland is looking for partners. It has representative offices in Iceland, the EU, the US, and China. It has also signed cooperation agreements on mineral exploration with the US and the EU. So, it is trying to keep its options open. For Greenland, the US is an increasingly important business partner and had long guaranteed its security. So, Trump’s interest could easily lead to a wider discussion about Greenland’s future. I would certainly think that some Greenlanders will want to talk about it. Just because this kind of attention by the White House, this kind of attention by the world, it's like a once in a generation opportunity. Internationally, it will be relevant how Trump proceeds. For US allies in Europe, the issue of Greenland is part of a growing recognition that the Trump administration could even pose a threat to their security. Greenland strategically, through the lens of Trump grand strategy, is this idea of strengthening North America as their primary security focus for the government. So, it's the America first on steroids and America first in diplomacy. That’s why Denmark is seeking support from other European countries. It's been very clever from the Danish government to not make this an issue between the US and Denmark but between Europe and the US because we are way stronger together with the other European states. But the outcome of this dispute will be closely observed all around the world. Especially if Trump forces Denmark or Greenland into a deal. Trump is really talking about doing to Denmark what Putin is doing to Ukraine and what China wants to do to Taiwan. And so, all that might be a transition to a new world order that Russia, China and America might now all share the same strategic vision of spheres of influence being reestablished. In a world increasingly determined by the whims of great powers, will Greenlanders even get a say in determining their own future?" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="la questione israelo-palestinese non si decide solo nella striscia di Gaza ma anche nelle principali capitali del pianeta non è un caso infatti che il presidente statunitense biden sia volato in Israele e che quasi ogni paese abbia espresso la propria posizione sulla guerra in questo video analizziamo proprio questo le alleanze e le posizioni internazionali dei principali stati Rispetto alla questione israelo palestinese capite anche voi che è una panoramica che per forze di cose semplifica l'argomento pensate magari a quando ne avete parlato con gli amici Quante idee e pareri diversi esistono Ecco potete immaginare quanto sia complesso fare lo stesso esercizio accorpando milioni di persone riporterò quindi le posizioni più o meno ufficiali dei vari paesi senza pretendere di rappresentare perfettamente la realtà A questo proposito vi invito a vedere tutti i video che abbiamo realizzato sulla questione israelo palestinese Soprattutto sulle sue cause storiche ma anche a leggere gli articoli su geopop.it e a seguire il podcast geopolitics su tutte le principali piattaforme audio la complessità del topic Infatti è affrontabile solo con tanti contenuti diversi che si incastrano l'uno con l'altro a formare un mosaico cominciamo sin dalle origini il conflitto israelo-palestinese si è inserito in dinamiche geopolitiche più ampie e ha spinto numerosi paesi a prendere posizione le ragioni sono sostanzialmente due da un lato per Israele e Palestina gli appoggi e gli aiuti internazionali sono necessari per poter sopravvivere dall'altro molti stati tra i quali le principali potenze del mondo considerano la regione palestinese un cocevia fondamentale in Medio Oriente e si lasciano perciò coinvolgere posizionandosi spesso l'uno in contrapposizione all'altro ora andiamo a vedere più nel dettaglio Chi sta con Israele Chi sta con la Palestina distinguendo fra autorità Nazionale palestinese e a hamas e quali sono i paesi sostanzialmente neutrali l'ordine Prima Israele e poi Palestina è puramente casuale per piacere niente commenti eh avete messo prima Israele siete di parte Vi prego La diplomazia di Israele si fonda principalmente Sul rapporto coi paesi occidentali e soprattutto con gli Stati Uniti che considerano lo stato ebraico un angolo di occidente in Medio Oriente e uno strumento per tenere a freno paesi che considerano ostili come l'iran gli USA sostengono Israele sul piano militare e politico e nel corso degli anni hanno usato decine di volte il loro potere di veto al consiglio di sicurezza dell'ONU per bloccare risoluzioni che condannavano lo stato ebraico non sono mancate però e non mancano alcune frizioni a causa della politica israeliana verso la questione palestinese anche gli altri paesi occidentali appoggiano Israele l'Unione Europea in particolare ha relazioni diplomatiche commerciali molto strette con lo stato ebraico e molti paesi tra i quali l'Italia sono suoi partner militari in alcuni casi i leader europei hanno criticato la politica israeliana verso la Palestina ma Ma le critiche non hanno danneggiato la cooperazione in generale Comunque Israele ha rapporti diplomatici e commerciali con quasi tutti i paesi del mondo con l'eccezione di vari paesi arabi alcuni stati a maggioranza islamica e pochi altri casi ora come ha fatto a creare una rete così forte ed efficace uno dei motivi principali è che in molti paesi sono presenti comunità ebraiche che hanno un certo peso economico e politico come sappiamo infatti gli Ebrei non vivono solo in Israele ma quasi in tutto il mondo e sono partic armente numerosi negli Stati Uniti in particolare secondo uno studio del 2020 il loro numero complessivo nel mondo è di poco inferiore ai 15 milioni di persone di cui quasi 7 milioni vivono in Israele quasi 6 milioni negli Stati Uniti e gli altri altrove in particolare la comunità ebraica statunitense offre un sostegno costante a Israele e nel 1953 si è dotata di un'organizzazione l'american Israel Public affairs committee lapac di cui fanno parte anche americani non ebrei per spingere le istituzioni statunitensi a sostenere lo stato ebraico oggigiorno l' ipac è considerata una delle lobby più influenti degli Stati Uniti ed è politicamente vicina all liud il partito guidato dal primo ministro israeliano netan è importante però segnalare che non tutti gli ebrei statunitensi e non sostengono l'attuale linea politica israeliana semplificando la Palestina in questo momento è spaccata in due da un c'è l'autorità Nazionale palestinese in sigla ANP cioè l'organismo politico di autogoverno palestinese che ha il controllo della Ces Giordania mentre dall'altro c'è l'organizzazione hamas che dal 2006 ha in mano la striscia di Gaza la NP è riconosciuta dalla maggior parte dei paesi del mondo mentre non lo è pienamente in quelli dell'Occidente anche se ha con essi relazioni diplomatiche e commerciali dal 2012 Inoltre l'ONU ha accettato che la delegazione della NP fosse denominata stato di Palestina e ne ha riconosciuto la condizione di Stato osservatore non membro Che significa che può partecipare alle assemblee Generali senza però poter votare le risoluzioni ora Chi sono i più accesi sostenitori della causa palestinese in sintesi i paesi arabi e gli stati non arabi a maggioranza musulmana ci sono però posizioni diverse alcuni paesi intrattengono Infatti relazioni ufficiali o informali anche con Israele pur criticone spesso le politiche Egitto e la Giordania ad esempio lo fanno da decenni mentre Emirati Arabi Bahrein Marocco e Sudan l'hanno fatto a partire dalla fine del 2020 e A questo proposito Probabilmente è stato il recente avvicinamento tra Israele e Arabia Saudita a spingere hamas ad attaccare Israele altri paesi musulmani invece come l'iran sono schierati in modo netto dalla parte della Palestina e in particolare della stessa hamas e ne sostengono la lotta armata un altro paese filo palestinese che sostiene finanziariamente politica amente anche hamas è il Qatar o Qatar che nonostante le sue piccole dimensioni sta assumendo un ruolo sempre più importante nelle dinamiche internazionali pensate banalmente agli ultimi mondiali di calcio anche il Libano è filo palestinese e negli anni passati è stato più volte in guerra con Israele ma è in una situazione particolare al suo interno opera Infatti l'organizzazione hesb considerata Quasi uno stato nello stato che è nemica giurata di Israele e si è scontrata numerose volte col suo esercito là è legato ad Damas e si teme che possa aprire un secondo fronte nel conflitto in corso un caso particolare è rappresentato dalla Turchia che nel 1949 è stato il primo paese a maggioranza musulmana a riconoscere Israele e a coltivare con esso relazioni cordiali per molti anni Attualmente però il presidente erdogan coltiva rapporti Anche con hamas e sta cercando di assumere un ruolo di mediatore nel conflitto in corso e nel mezzo invece chi ci sta pur con varie differenze tra tra stato e stato sul piano politico molti paesi non occidentali criticano la politica israeliana in particolare la costruzione di insegnamenti in CIS Giordania e l'uso eccessivo della forza contro gli arabi palestinesi ad esempio nella striscia di Gaza Ma hanno ugualmente rapporti diplomatici commerciali con lo stato ebraico tra i sostenitori della linea mediana diciamo così c'è la Cina che è uno dei primi partner commerciali a militari di Israele ma sostiene la fondazione di uno Stato palestinese critica la politica israeliana e coltiva rapporti molto stretti con il mondo arabo per la Cina in questo momento la guerra è sia una minaccia che un'opportunità è una minaccia perché ostacola il progetto delle nuove vie della seta una serie di collegamenti di corridoi tra estremo Oriente ed Europa di natura sia commerciale che Geopolitica È un'opportunità invece la guerra perché potrebbe distrarre in parte gli Stati Uniti dall'oceano Pacifico dove la Cina vorrebbe espandersi e consolidare le proprie posizioni Infine c'è anche la Russia nella linea cosiddetta mediana che riconosce sia Israele sia la Palestina una parte significativa della popolazione israeliana Infatti è di origine russa al punto che il russo è la terza lingua più parlata del paese dopo ebraico e arabo e le relazioni diplomatiche e la cooperazione commerciale tra i due paesi sono molto strette la Russia però in genere non sostiene apertamente la posizione israeliana in ambito internazionale essendo così legata agli Stati Uniti ragazzi Spero che questo video sintetico sulle alleanze Rispetto alla questione Israele palestinese vi sia piaciuto Grazie mille di averci seguito e vi aspetto in un prossimo video sempre qui su geopop le scienze nella

          <attvalue for="7" value="ehi bentornati e bentornati su Breaking Italy Questa sarà una puntata un po' particolare di quelle che ci piace fare ogni tanto quando arriva un argomento che merita molto più spazio del solito e stavolta è il momento dei referendum abrogativi per cui andremo a votare tra meno di un mese l'8 e il 9 giugno nelle ultime settimane se n'è un po' parlato spesso per le ragioni sbagliate e ci prendiamo un po' di tempo per vedere innanzitutto cosa nel concreto stiamo andando a votare modi e tempi per farlo e infine perché i quesiti sono così importanti che ci aiuterà poi a capire come mai la politica li sta sfruttando per avere spazi e coperture mediatiche Partiamo La primissima cosa da capire è che si tratta appunto di referendum abrogativi ovvero un tipo di consultazione popolare che richiede ai cittadini se vogliono annullare una legge preesistente il cui testo cesserà nel caso di aver effetto Si tratta di un istituto referendario regolato dalla stessa Costituzione all'articolo 75 che ne esplicita chiaramente i limiti Per poter essere indetto servono almeno 500.000 firme di elettori o cinque consigli regionali e può partecipare chiunque possa eleggere i deputati alla Camera quindi per farla semplice vota chi ha almeno 18 anni e la cittadinanza italiana Affinché lagazione abbia successo serve raggiungere due obiettivi in primis il cosiddetto importantissimo quorum ovvero il numero minimo di votanti che è necessario partecipino alla votazione e che in questo caso è pari alla maggioranza più un degli aventi diritto cioè il 50% + 1 cosa storicamente molto difficile da ottenere e poi ovviamente tra questi deve esserci un'ulteriore maggioranza che voti a favore dell'abogazione quindi il sì sulla scheda elettorale dato che i quesiti referendari iniziano tutti con una formula sul tenore di volete voi abrogare Ecco sono più o meno tutti così però ovviamente di base i sì nel caso sono più dei no sempre per il fatto che chi normalmente vuole votare no semplicemente se ne sta a casa È il famoso giochino del quorum Ora le schede che vi troverete davanti saranno cinque come cinque sono i quesiti Questi che vedete a schermo sono non so delle repliche potremmo dire di come appariranno i quesiti e come e prassi servirà a recarsi al seggio con la scheda elettorale Però attenzione non è obbligatorio votare per ogni singolo referendum potete scegliere voi quali Posto che se entrate in cabina e ricevete la scheda quindi con la scheda in mano a prescindere che votiate o meno comunque verrete conteggiati nel quorum Quindi per non essere conteggiati siccome i quum sono distinti per ogni singolo quesito dovete specificare prima di entrare in cabina quali tessere volete ricevere e restituire le tessere con all'interno i quesiti a cui non siete interessati perché se voi le prendete entrate in cabina e ci pasticciate sopra ci fate ci mettete la mortadella quello che volete poi uscite venite comunque conteggiati nel quorum Questo è molto importante perché mi rendo conto che per molte persone la sola idea di parlare con il presidente del segggio e dirgli allora io voglio ricevere questo non voglio ricevere quello sia automatico attacco di panico e quindi realisticamente molte persone decideranno se andare e prendere tutte le schede o o non andare Però stare lì a dire questo sì questo no in genere lo fa poca gente A queste votazioni potranno poi partecipare anche i fuoriede chi vive quindi in un comune diverso da quello di residenza e non è scontato anzi perché la possibilità di poterlo fare è stata introdotta solo lo scorso marzo pensate con un decreto legge E se prima bisognava ritornare quindi nel proprio comune per poter votare ora basta fare domanda a quello in cui si è domiciliati dove si dichiara di essere fuori serie da almeno 3 mesi e si riceve un certificato che indica dove votare da presentare al seggio domanda che però va posta entro 35 giorni dalla data del voto ed è quindi troppo tardi ad oggi per chi non l'abbia già fatto Se invece siete residenti all'estero dovete come sempre o essere iscritti all'Aire l'anagrafe degli italiani residenti all'estero e riceverete direttamente a casa il plico per votare oppure farei richiesta al Comune di Residenza se non siete iscritti all'Aire ma siete fuori Italia da almeno 3 mesi Ma anche in questo caso il limite per le richieste è già scaduto quindi vabbè Detto questo cari amiche cari amici bando alle ciance staccino per prendere il fiato e ce li facciamo di corsa a questi quesiti uno dopo l'altro e deciderete poi voi cosa votare se eventualmente andare a votare o cogliere l'invito di un pezzo dei partiti a non raccarsi alle urne proprio per impedire il raggiungimento del famoso quorum Dicevo prima di proseguire devo dirvi una cosa Io lo so che tantissimi di voi mi seguono da fuori dall'Italia lo so perché me lo dice YouTube ma anche perché me lo dite voi stessi Posso presumere quindi che non tutti stiano godendo del sole di questi giorni Qui in Sardegna c'è anche chi ne approfitta per andare al mare ovviamente non il sottoscritto che non vuole uscire di casa e magari qualcuno di voi sarà anche non lo so in fase di pianificazione delle ferie o chi lavora in smart working potrebbe pensare di spostarsi in una meta dove viversi questo calduccio E in generale è un periodo di viaggi quindi chiunque decida di spostarsi potrebbe trovare molto utile lo sponsor di oggi che ormai conoscete Nor VPN I benefici di utilizzare una VPN sono tantissimi in particolare quando ci si muove all'estero Ad esempio connettersi a una rete Wi-Fi pubblica potrebbe rendere il dispositivo da cui vi state connettendo vulnerabile e l'accesso a documenti aziendali privati potrebbe non essere consegnatissimo Oppure potreste trovarvi in un paese che vi impedisce l'accesso a servizi e contenuti disponibili solo in Italia che ne so Ecco in questi casi la VPN permette di collegarsi in maniera sicura dato che diventa impossibile per terzi intercettare o crittare le proprie comunicazioni anzi decrittare e quindi vedersi le proprie password rubate i propri file in giro insomma sapete di cosa sto parlando Quindi se avete ancora qualche dubbio ho anche un regalo per voi perché se passate tramite il link che trovate in descrizione o sul sito breakingaly.it riceverete non solo uno sconto esclusivo ma anche 4 mesi extraorni di soddisfatti o rimborsati Quindi potete provare il prodotto provare tutti i prodotti che in realtà decidete di inserire nel pacchetto di Nor VPN che ha tantissimi servizi collegati che adesso non ho descritto ma ve li descrivono meglio loro sul loro sito Dicevo provarli e avete poi 30 giorni per decidere se siete soddisfatti oppure rendere tutto e riavere i soldi indietro Quindi partiamo Il primo quesito che affronteremo che è quello che poi si distacca molto dagli altri a livello di tematica è quello sulla cittadinanza La scheda per votare sarà di colore giallo e il suo scopo è modificare l'articolo 9 della legge 91 del 1992 che regola appunto la modalità di concessione della cittadinanza agli stranieri maggiorenni Con la modifica in questione la conclusione sarebbe una cioè che una persona straniera maggiorenne potrebbe richiedere la cittadinanza dopo 5 anni di residenza sul suolo italiano e non più dopo 10 come attualmente norma la legge potendola poi anche trasferire ai propri figli con lous sanguinis Poi in realtà non sono neanche mai veramente 10 anni sono sempre un po' di più perché ci sono le lungaggini burocratiche Questo realisticamente si applicerebbe anche ai 5 anni sarebbero un pochino di più però la legge è questa cioè la la volontà di modificare la legge è questa qua Ora qui devo fare anche una serie di osservazioni Prima del 92 la concessione della cittadinanza era normata diversamente e bastavano infatti solo 5 anni di residenza per ottenerla che è proprio il requisito a cui aspira il referendum Mentre dopo si è passati a quattro per i cittadini dell'Unione Europea e appunto 10 per quelli extracomunitari e proprio di loro parliamo Quindi va da sé che prima degli anni 90 le cose stavano diversamente Basti pensare agli sbarchi di massa sulle coste pugliesi da parte degli albanesi nel 91 Ne abbiamo parlato sia nella prima puntata di Focus sia nel podcast flussi che insieme a tutto quello che è accaduto negli anni successivi hanno cambiato per sempre il volto dell'immigrazione in Italia C'è poi un'altra cosa da sottolineare Se infatti i numeri delle cittadinanze concesse dall'Italia in senso assoluto sono più alti dell'Unione Europea il grafico che vedete fa riferimento a dati del 2022 è altrettanto vero che questo primato viene perso se lo si vede in proporzione con quante persone vivono nel paese In questo caso invece al primo posto c'è ovviamente il Lussemburgo che è piccolino dove non sono neanche 700.000 mentre l'Italia è quinta dopo tra le altre la Spagna Questo fatto è importante da tenere a mente soprattutto perché rimette in prospettiva una delle tesi più utilizzate dai detrattori del referendum compresa Giorgia Meloni per cui siamo fin troppo generosi Rimaniamo comunque ai primi posti però bisogna dirlo cioè effettivamente l'Italia concede molte cittadinanze e questo è vero Peraltro altre grosse nazioni europee hanno curiosamente norme più lasche delle nostre Ad esempio in Francia e in Germania sono sufficienti 5 anni di residenza mentre in Spagna sono di base 10 anni ma con tantissime eccezioni Ad esempio nel caso di persone che provengano dall'America Latina e altri paesi dove si parla spagnolo come Andorra o Filippine sono solo due mentre si parla di un solo anno per persone nate in suolo spagnolo per dirla tutta Quindi nel senso non è che l'Italia sia sì ci sono delle particolarità però ci sono anche in altri paesi Tra l'altro ci tengo a precisare una cosa quello degli anni di residenza non è l'unico requisito per ottenerla né in Italia né negli altri paesi di cui vi ho appena parlato rimane di fatto l'obbligatorietà di dimostrare un livello di reddito che dimostri le entrate del proprio nucleo familiare quindi un lavoro ma anche una discreta conoscenza della lingua italiana e anche l'integrazione culturale nelle comunità è tenuta in considerazione come l'adesione ai valori nazionali e l'inserimento sociale È però vero come alcuni che sono per il no sostengono che questo referendum non faccia nulla sull'integrazione degli stranieri che invece alla base di una società recettiva funzionante Passiamo ad altri due quesiti referendari Le quischede sono verde chiaro e grigio e che hanno una cosa in comune perché agiscono entrambi su norme che appartengono al Jobs Act quell'insieme di decreti legislativi approvati nel corso del 2015 che riguardano il diritto del lavoro e sono anche rimasti nella storia dell'opinione pubblica come una delle principali eredità del governo Renzi Il primo dei due vuole abrogare completamente il decreto legislativo del 4 marzo 2015 che regola il contratto di lavoro a tutel crescenti e disciplina i licenziamenti illegittimi Nello specifico il decreto che si vuole abrogare stabilisce che dal 2015 in poi è in caso di licenziamento considerato illegittimo sia previsto solo un indennizzo economico tra le 6 e le 36 mensilità e non il reintegro obbligatorio nel posto di lavoro Se la norma venisse abbrogata invece si tornerebbe all'articolo 18 dello statuto dei lavoratori approvato nel 1970 e alla legge Fornero varata nel 2012 le quali prevedono che oltre l'indennizzo ci sia anche il reintegro nel posto di lavoro per quanto solo in caso di licenziamenti considerati particolarmente gravi ad esempio dovuti a una discriminazione o a malattie e durature Una delle tesi di chi è contrario a questo punto è che l'obbligo di essere reintegrati sul posto di lavoro veniva utilizzato come arma negoziale in casi giudiziari perché ovviamente voi immaginatevi soprattutto in una piccola realtà di licenziare qualcuno che non funziona Questo vince la causa e siete obbligati a tenero lì e persino che se entrasse in vigore questo punto verrebbe meno il tetto di mensilità di 36 mesi 3 anni di stipendi tutela Tornando invece alla legge Fornero che ne prevede un massimo di 24 mesi poi bisogna capire qui è preferibile questo non è preferibile è un discorso di equilibri su chi si vuole dare maggiore responsabilità a chi si vuole attribuire maggiore potere cosa è più importante cosa è meno importante e non c'è una risposta univoca Il secondo quesito sul Jobs Act invece punta a cancellare alcune parti del decreto legislativo numero 81 del 2015 che stabilisce come un contratto a tempo determinato di massimo 12 mesi possa essere stipulato senza dover indicare una causale una motivazione che quindi spieghi il perché il contratto non è a tempo indeterminato Se il referendum in questione passasse però il datore di lavoro sarebbe invece obbligato a dare delle spiegazioni sulla sua scelta Chi supporta questo quesito ritiene che rafforzerebbe la stabilità del lavoro contrastando al contrario la precarietà perché di fatto obbligherebbe le aziende a rendere più velocemente indeterminati i lavoratori in ingresso ma una delle tesi contrarie che vengono mosse è che abrogare parti di una legge non sia realmente efficace e che bisognerebbe invece tutelare maggiormente la contrattazione collettiva Anche qui ci sono un po' di perplessità sul fatto che non so io personalmente non mi sento di esprimermi quanto obbligare un'azienda a assumere qualcuno immediatamente a tempo indeterminato possa essere la soluzione e rispetto a dei non so dei sistemi di incentivi più che di obbligo però di nuovo il referendum può solo abrogare parti della legge ed è quello che si sta cercando di fare La scheda arancione invece vuole abbrogare parte dell'articolo 8 della legge numero 604 del 15 luglio del 1966 e eliminando i limiti massimi di risarcimento previsto in caso di licenziamento senza giusta causa Questo nelle piccole imprese Infatti per come stanno adesso le cose nel caso delle aziende con meno di 15 dipendenti il tetto massimo di risarcimento è di sei mensilità per non far esplodere l'azienda Ma secondo i promotori del quesito dovrebbe invece essere il giudice a stabilire liberamente il totale del risarcimento anche molto maggiore di così valutando quindi liberamente caso per caso Siamo all'ultima scheda quella rosso rubino lo scrive così il ministero degli interni non l'ho scelto io non è la mia libertà artistica che punta ad abbrogare parti del decreto legislativo 81 del 9 aprile 2008 Il decreto in questione stabilisce che nel caso di appalto o subappalto le aziende committenti quindi chi commissiona il lavoro non siano responsabili per gli infortuni sul lavoro o le malattie professionali se queste derivano da rischi specifici dell'attività svolta da imprese a cui quel lavoro è appaltato Faccio un esempio Bisogna sistemare la facciata di un edificio Io come azienda non ho la capacità di farlo e mi affido a quelli lì che si arrampicano con i cavi no perché loro quelle skill le hanno Ecco se il quesito dovesse passare e uno di queste persone dovesse cadere anche io azienda committente potrei essere potenzialmente ritenuta legalmente responsabile di quel ferimento di quella morte anche se l'attività era stata appaltata a esperti Questo dovrebbe aumentare le precauzioni e l'attenzione nell'ambiente laborativo Noi sappiamo che in Italia c'è un grave problema in questo tema ma al contrario chi fa eh propaganda per il no diciamo parla di una scelta populista cioè dalla volontà di spalmare le responsabilità anche sull'azienda appaltatrice che non c'entra nulla con quello che è accaduto piuttosto che voler risolvere il problema alla radice Arrivati a questo punto cerchiamo di capire come sono schierati i principali partiti italiani anche perché su questo punto da alcuni giorni la maggioranza di governo si è esposta sul referendum chiedendo agli elettori di non presentarsi ai seggi e sostanzialmente di non andare a votare Di questa polemica ne abbiamo già parlato anche noi qualche giorno fa ma sappiate che tutti e tre i partiti di centr-destra hanno scelto per la linea dell'astensione Partiamo proprio da Fratelli d'Italia che lo ricordiamo si mantiene salda secondo gli ultimi sondaggi come primo partito politico Saldo non salda Avrebbe infatti inviato una comunicazione interna agli esponenti del partito in cui invitava alla promozione all'astensione mentre il segretario di Forza Italia Antonio Taiani ha dichiarato come non andare a votare sia una scelta legittima sottolineando come sia illiberale costringere la gente ad andare a votare in presenza di un quorum da raggiungere Sulla stessa linea anche la Lega che ovviamente solo qualche anno fa era il 2018 criticava invece chi cavalcava l'astensionismo perché guardate tutti i partiti fanno sto giochino eh tra astensionismo e pericolo democratico a seconda di come tira il vento ma l'abbiamo già detto in passato lo fa la destra lo fa la sinistra Mentre lo diciamo giusto per rendere più completa la panoramica noi moderati non seguirà questa scelta preferendo andare a votare ma votando no per tutti e cinque i quesiti per quello che vale Ci spostiamo quindi dall'altra parte per analizzare invece come si sono schierati gli altri partiti italiani e cominciamo dal Partito Democratico con la segretaria ellin che si allinea a favore dei cinque quesiti anche se bisogna comunque dire che una parte del partito parliamo dell'ala riformista non è completamente allineata ma è orientata sul sì verso il quesito della cittadinanza e quello sulla responsabilità delle imprese e sul no sui restanti tre Movimento 5 Stelle e direzione ancora diversa perché per loro la campagna è improntata non su cinque sì ma su quattro sostanzialmente tutti quelli sul lavoro escludendo invece quello sulla cittadinanza Proseguiamo con Più Europa che promuove il sì al quesito su appalti e sicurezza e quello sulla cittadinanza dato che sono stati loro a depositare il referendum per modificare la concessione della cittadinanza italiana sollecitando peraltro nel comunicato stampa attraverso le parole del segretario del partito Riccardo Magi alla partecipazione al voto per il referendum con un appello ad azione affinché desse una mano Nel partito guidato da Carlo Calenda inizialmente era infatti contrario al referendum non solo per le modalità e il metodo ma anche per i contenuti di tutti i cinque i quesiti salvo per poi cambiare idea su una cosa sola cioè il referendum sulla cittadinanza Ovviamente stessa linea di pensiero anche su Italia Viva Per una volta vanno d'accordo su qualcosa ma sarebbe anche molto strano visto che una parte di questi referendum l'abbiamo detto andrebbe a modificare il Jobs Act che è cioè centrale diciamo nell'eredità politica del leader di Italia Viva Matteo Renzi Quindi sarebbe un po' strano se loro stessi poi andassero a modificare con la legge Bene sapete quello che dovete sapere Questi sono i quesiti Decidete voi cosa volete fare se volete andare non volete andare volete andare in spiaggia volete andare per monti volete andare a entrare chiedere quante le tessere quante tessere volete Questa sì questa no Spero abbiate preso appunti perché poi non è che lì ve lo spieghino nel senso arrivateci preparati le schede hanno dei colori diversi vanno messe delle urne diverse non è difficile solo che eh sapere le cose prima vi aiuta Per il resto grazie per aver guardato grazie al

anziani e neonati e poi gli elettori repubblicani e democratici sono sempre più divisi e in giro per il mondo è evidente Quanta fatica stiano facendo gli USA a sostenere militarmente i propri alleati che succede gli Stati Uniti sono davvero in crisi con la Cina pronta a subentrare come prima superpotenza del mondo oppure questo secolo sarà un altro secolo americano ne abbiamo parlato con Francesco Costa vicedirettore del post che ha appena pubblicato un libro proprio su questo tema si intitola frontiera e lo trovate in libreria e on prima di ascoltare il suo punto di vista sulla questione vi ricordo che se apprezzate il nostro lavoro e volete sostenerci gratuitamente basta un click sul pulsante Iscriviti per noi è di grande aiuto grazie e andiamo Francesco 400 milioni di armi da fuoco per una popolazione che però è di di 330 milioni di abitanti e purtroppo sentiamo spesso di sparatorie in giro per gli Stati Uniti Allora io ti chiederei se è possibile di fare due cose la prima è però raccontarci Com'è la distribuzione di queste armi e la seconda è spiegarci come mai gli americani ce l'hanno così tanto con le armi ne hanno così tante intanto Sì sono più armi che persone perché in America Ci sono circa 340 milioni di abitanti 400 milioni di armi ma conta che i 2e ter delle famiglie americane non possiedono armi è un metà di queste armi è posseduta in realtà dal 3% della popolazione Quindi è una minoranza consistente però Parliamo di un terzo delle famiglie molto armata e le conseguenze di questa diffusione delle Armi le vediamo non tanto sai nelle stragi nelle sparatorie che sono sicuramente poi le notizie di morti per armi da fuoco che arrivano dalle nostre parti perché ci colpiscono di più le sparatorie nelle scuole nelle chiese Ma se guardi ai dati la morte è un'esperienza molto più quotidiana per le persone rispetto alle armi da fuoco la causa di morte principale legata alle armi da fuoco sono i suicidi Eh la seconda sono eh persone che uccidono persone che conoscono colleghi di lavoro risse e questioni familiari ovviamente donne uccise Conta che per le donne incinte la prima ragione di mortalità sono le armi da fuoco negli Stati Uniti e quando hai così tante armi le armi poi vengono utilizzate tant'è che se guardi ai reati in America non è una società che delinque in cui ci sono più reati rispetto ai paesi europei ma è molto più facile morire quando vieni rapinato Se c'è una rissa davanti a a un pub è chiaro che in parte questo è un problema che si autoalimenta Nel senso che se tu avessi il potere domani di fare una legge che vieta del tutto la vendita di armi avendo comunque 400 milioni di armi già in circolazione Che fai Con chi non te le vuole restituire e poi è un problema così difficile da risolvere perché ha a che fare con la cultura la storia degli Stati Uniti la faccio semplice però per capirci la storia nostra la storia Europea è una storia che è stata segnata dal progressivo tentativo poi riuscito delle popolazioni di togliere allo stato il monopolio assoluto della violenza che poteva utilizzare con ogni mezzo la nostra storia è una storia di di Regni di di di regimi che utilizzano molta violenza con le armi nei confronti del popolo che armi non ne ha finché con la democrazia diciamo noi riusciamo a mettere la violenza dello Stato sotto il controllo delle leggi il controllo Democratico negli Stati Uniti La storia è totalmente opposta Nel senso che a parte le 13 colonie l'America del dell'est tutte le persone che andavano a spostarsi verso Ovest arrivavano e fondavano insediamenti città molto prima che arrivasse lo Stato e quindi da una parte avevano bisogno di armarsi per difendersi per regolare i conflitti il Far West per dire che Vediamo nei film dall'altra parte quando arriva lo Stato trova dei cittadini che sono già armati e non solo le armi gli sono servite per sopravvivere quindi hanno un ruolo in quella società in quella vita cruciale e questo Sì è una storia del 700 del 600 dice oggi sono passati tanti anni ma ha fatto sì che le armi guadagnassero All'epoca un ruolo culturale fortissimo per le vite delle persone non so se ti devo raccontare che cosa mi lega nella mia infanzia il ricordo a a mia zia che mi portava in libreria a comprare i libri e negli Stati Uniti Questo esempio è spesso mia zia mi portava a sparare mio nonno mi ha regalato la sua arma a quel punto l'arma ha un valore simbolico ha un valore di identità Mi dice chi sono la storia della mia famiglia e questa cosa si è mantenuta fino a oggi perché oggi le armi dicono chi sei oggi Molte persone in America comprano un'arma anche se non la sanno usare Perché comprare un'arma vuol dire dire da che parte sto se chiedi a un politico come la pensa sulle armi dalla sua risposta tu puoi desumere come la pensa su tutto e quando qualsiasi cosa diventa così simbolica con un significato che va molto oltre la sua funzione diventa difficilissimo ragionarci fare delle leggi perché se vuoi vietare le armi Allora vuol dire che non si tratta sulle identità Questo è il classico problema Purtroppo tragicamente irrisolvibile nelle condizioni date Serve un cambio culturale che richiederà però moltissimo tempo A proposito di armi c'è proprio il concetto di violenza che forse è interno alla cultura americana e che si lega peraltro a un altro concetto fondamentale Cioè quello di frontiera che poi un pochino il motivo per il quale gli americani si sentono portatori di una missione in qualche modo nel mondo che poi è Quello che comunemente viene chiamato esportare la democrazia Per quale motivo gli Stati Uniti appunto hanno questa idea di frontiera e tendono ad andare all'estero con un po' di ingenuità a colonizzare il mondo comunque a occuparsi anche del resto del mondo Dunque loro Intanto sono un popolo che ha una storia abbastanza unica e prova a raccontartela Così noi oggi anche in Europa facciamo un sacco di conti nei nostri Paesi con le difficoltà di integrare accogliere persone di culture diverse farle vivere insieme costruire una nazione che sia eterogenea sul piano etnico culturale sappiamo Perché la nostra vita quotidiana Quanto è complicato se c'è un paese che ce l'ha fatta che ha costruito se stesso proprio sulla base di questa premessa sono gli Stati Uniti perché non esiste un popolo americano sul piano etnico a parte i popoli indigeni che poi sono stati sterminati nel genocidio di conquistatori europei nel corso del del dello scorso millennio e tutti gli americani vengono da qualche altra parte Trump a Origini tedesche Obama in mezzo keniano biden in mezzo irlandese italoamericani quanti ne vuoi e questo quindi è un esperimento che è unico in quanto tale gli americani lo sanno e se lo dicono Molto e se lo raccontano molto dell'essere un popolo eletto Ronald Reagan certo non un presidente di sinistra diceva tu puoi vivere tutta la vita in Francia ma non sarai mai francese se non sei nato lì e tu puoi venire in America in qualsiasi momento e diventare americano Questa è stata la loro forza in questo contesto loro si vedono e si sono raccontati molto fin da quando sono nati come come paese l'idea che abbiano loro lo chiamano un destino un destino manifesto che siano il popolo destinato a guidare il il mondo anche con l'esempio non solo poi con La colonizzazione con la forza perché poi di potenze Imperiali Ce ne sono state molte forse le più principali sono state europee nel corso della storia l'impero britannico l'impero romano eccetera e dal loro punto di vista La colonizzazione cosiddetta o l'influenza che esercitano sul mondo passa molto attraverso il cosiddetto soft Power e cioè oggi soprattutto non tanto le campagne militari oggi l'America va molto riluttante mete in guerra Soprattutto dopo i fallimenti colossali delle guerre in Afghanistan e in Iraq ma il condizionamento che è frutto dei rapporti commerciali che che fanno diventare i paesi sempre più vicini che li fanno somigliare sempre di più e della cultura cultura non vale soltanto per i film per le serie tv ma pensa ogni anno quando danno i premi Nobel e tu scorri la lista di chi ha vinto il Nobel o sono americani o hanno studiato in America o insegnano in America c'è una centralità americana che nei fatti Vediamo accadere in molti contesti diversi da quello strettamente militare e loro si considerano anche per questo il popolo che segna diciamo il da che parte va il futuro Poi a noi tutto questo sembra sempre megalomane sembra anche in operazione di propaganda e in parte lo è ma la cosa secondo me importante per capirli è capire che loro questa cosa qui non la dicono a noi la dicono a se stessi per convincersene e ci credono Davvero E ogni tanto li porta a fare delle cose incredibili vanno sulla luna eh disegnano il futuro della nelle innovazioni tecnologiche di tanto in tanto G porta invece a dei disastri inenarrabili dei farmaci oppia le armi gli americani si buttano con tutte le scarpe dentro qualsiasi cosa in questo aprono molte strade al resto del mondo In altri casi vanno a sbattere prima degli altri ecco A proposito di andare a sbattere spesso e volentieri Adesso c'è una narrativa sui media che parla di un'america in crisi sempre più in crisi con forti divisioni sociali c'è la narrativa anche che la Cina prima o poi sorpasserà dal punto di vista economico e anche geopolitico gli Stati Uniti l'America in questo momento è così in crisi ci sono dati a favore e contro questa tesi Sicuramente sì perché ogni paese specialmente così grande non ha mai tutto che va bene o tutto che va male è un discorso molto interessante questo Perché che cosa intendiamo e che cosa pensiamo di volere da un paese che sia una superpotenza mondiale e che non abbia rivali anche durante il secolo scorso c'è stato la guerra fredda l'abbiamo chiamata così perché era una rivalità fortissima non era un periodo di una sola potenza nel mondo se c'è stato un periodo così è durato dalla fine degli anni 90 fino all'11 settembre diciamo Eh perché già comunque del 2001 la Cina entra nel wto comincia questa grande cavalcata che poi porta la Cina alle olimpiadi di Pechino a smettere di essere la fabbrica del mondo e a iniziare questo percorso che i grafici lo mostravano chiaramente li avrebbe portati verso un sorpasso inesorabile quello che abbiamo visto però negli ultimi anni è che questo sorpasso non avverrà almeno diciomma poi le cose possono cambiare naturalmente ma a oggi le due rette non vanno più a congiungersi Anzi si stanno allontanando perché gli gli Stati Uniti oggi hanno l'economia che ha il miglior stato di salute al mondo crescita economica disoccupazione peraltro ne stanno beneficiando soprattutto le minoranze le persone che hanno di meno le diseguaglianze si riducono è un momento di grande successo economico per il paese che cresce se chiedi alle persone Anche rispetto al loro stipendio quanto sono soddisfatti in America i consumi gli americani vanno in vacanza moltissimo Non ci sono mai state così tante donne con un lavoro così tante persone con disabilità con un lavoro insomma le cose vanno bene Eppure a fronte di questo predominio economico anche mentre la Cina invece dopo la pandemia ha avuto grossi problemi ha rallentato eccetera Noi abbiamo la percezione di un paese Quando guardiamo agli Stati Uniti che è in crisi un po' perché tante altre cose vanno a rotoli parlavamo delle Armi l'immigrazione il quadro politico è un quadro politico sconfortante che non ti fa avere ottimismo verso il futuro ma ma ma non solo la Germania voleva farsi un gasdotto per portare il gas Russo il famoso North stream l'America non voleva alla fine la Germania se l'è fatto l'Italia nel 2018 voleva firmare un memorandum con la Cina l'America non voleva ma alla fine l'Italia l'ha firmato Insomma essere alleati dell'America non dà all'America il potere assoluto di fermare Israele per dire No non è che biden ha un pulsante sulla scrivania e non lo vuole premere Ma se lo preme abbiamo il cesto del Fuoco L'America ha dei mezzi spuntati si è visto nella faccenda del ritiro dall'afghanistan si è visto nella guerra in Ucraina si è visto nei negoziati internazionali col clima non può costringere gli altri paesi a fare quello che vuole lei e gli altri paesi hanno delle loro soggettività E hanno anche delle relazioni con potenze rivali come la Cina e quindi si crea e c'è già un mondo multipolare a fronte di tutto questo Noi a volte pensiamo che gli americani debbano avere il potere di biden perché non fai finire la guerra in Israele dall'altra parte vorremmo davvero un contesto mondiale in cui gli Stati Uniti con un una firma del presidente determinano cosa accade in Italia in Germania in Israele il mondo è complicato gli americani sono al centro di un mondo molto complicato e oggi mi sembra che la leadership la crisi di leadership della loro politica li faccia anche sembrare meno potenti di quanto in realtà non siano perché secondo me lo sono ancora molto A proposito di leadership di divisioni interne soprattutto in campo politico abbiamo le prossime elezioni presidenziali a Novembre ecco repubblicani e democratici non sono mai stati così divisi come ora Probabilmente i sondaggi Insomma lo dicono E da un lato abbiamo un presidente che viene continuamente massacrato dalla stampa anche quella teoricamente amica dicendo che è troppo anziana eccetera dall'altra abbiamo Trump che è un po' definito una scheggia impazzita nel paese Abbiamo tantissimi gruppi paramilitari un grandissimo numero di armi eccetera vedi una possibile deriva autoritari all'interno degli Stati Uniti sai che ultimamente c'è questo paragone tra gli Stati Uniti e l'Impero Romano no Per cui vedi come è successo a Roma che una repubblica possa trasformarsi in un impero oppure no allora domanda impegnativa naturalmente anche per il tipo di previsione che mi chiedi di fare diciamo però io credo che il rischio che la democrazia americana subisca una crisi ehm cruciale una crisi profonda Cioè non che semplicemente come capita anche in tanti paesi europei certi indicatori certe cose si logorino certi percorsi ma noi abbiamo lasciato Trump alla casab Bianca nel 2021 a gennaio Eh che aveva tentato apertamente di restare al potere nonostante avesse perso le elezioni Insomma non si può dire in altri modi e non solo con le violenze fomentate il 6 gennaio ma cercando di chiamare la Georgia perché trovassero i voti che gli mancavano Insomma è un è un politico che non può accettare non sa accettare la sconfitta in nessun caso e quindi una sua potenziale Vittoria eh quantomeno ci costringe a farci delle domande su quale sarà E qual è il punto di rottura delle istituzioni statunitensi perché Trump sicuramente non avrebbe voglia poi di lasciare il potere nemmeno dopo un secondo mandato immagino proverebbe a cambiare la costituzione e non è un politico dal quale si può escludere nulla dall'altra parte l'imposizione di una deriva autoritaria di un accentramento così grande dei poteri su una persona in un paese come gli Stati Uniti che è costruito sulla libertà in senso davvero ideologico Ed è l'unica cosa che trascende le questioni di parte è vero che il paese è molto diviso tra democratici e repubblicani che si detestano come non mai ma hanno una cosa in comune che credono molto nel fatto che le persone devono essere libere di votare di scegliere quello che vogliono questo vale anche molto per la destra e Trump non ha una storia elettorale di vittorie ha vinto nel 2016 per il rotto della cuffia ma da allora ha sempre perso questa agenda così libert CDA lui i suoi candidati nel 2018 Nel 2020 nel 2022 nel 2023 con le elezioni speciali e questa deriva così liberticida preoccupa molti americani poi questo non vuol dire che non possa vincere le elezioni perché le elezioni sono una lotta binaria ai due candidati la dico estrema se durante uno dei confronti TV biden sviene dimostrando che fisicamente non regge Trump vince le elezioni perché l'altro è venuto meno però al netto di chi vince o chi perde la società americana credo che possiede abbastanza anticorpi persino più di quelli che hanno le istituzioni per evitare che l'America diventi una dittatura diciamola diciamo così chiaramente peraltro l'agenda politica di Trump in politica estera non è un'agenda imperialista in senso classico nel senso Trump è Anzi un isolazionista abbandonerebbe l'Europa abbandonerebbe la nato questo non vuol dire che poi non può tirare un missile sopra suleimani in Iran però è un'agenda politica che lascerebbe invece molto spazio alla Cina alla Russia si è visto anche durante il suo primo mandato senti Un'ultima domanda a proposito sempre di potenziale crisi americana Secondo te quanto la crisi è reale e quanto invece è descritta e raccontata dai media che hanno un pochino questa tendenza a raccontare solo le cose negative No guarda ti ricorderai negli anni di Trump l'economia americana andava molto bene anche in quegli anni lì Questo perché l'economia americana è un treno è un treno che va tutta a velocità efficiente fortissimo per mille ragioni diverse i presidenti c'entrano poco i presidenti magari provano a toccare qualcosa che corregge un po' La Rotta ma l'economia americana è un treno e durante quei 4 anni i media conservatori dicevano a nastro con una sola voce l'economia va benissimo merito di Trump vedete che grandi risultati che grande successo oggi l'economia va molto bene va anche meglio di quegli anni lì ma tu non hai i media progressisti dire con una sola voce l'economia va bene Vedete che grande lavoro il presidente biden eccetera e questo accade non perché siano ipocriti Perché abbiano chissà quali secondi fini Ma perché nel mondo progressista questo secondo me accade anche da noi per ragioni secondo me anche comprensibili e giuste ma ci si sente un po' in colpa a celebrare i risultati a dirsi contenti della strada fatta fin qui non che voglia dire che abbiamo risolto tutti i problemi ma viene considerato un po' disdicevole darsi le pacche sulle spalle Mentre il mondo va a rotoli Bernie Sanders ha scritto un libro che si intitola È giusto essere arrabbiati contro il capitalismo oggi essere arrabbiati è un po' la cifra dell'essere progressista se non sei arrabbiato per qualcosa chi sei e però questo finisce a volte io lo vedo molto nei discorsi che si fanno sul clima per scoraggiare le persone Anche rispetto alla possibilità che possa esserci un Progresso che le cose possono migliorare se quando migliorano non te lo dici anche alla luce di voler andare avanti questa cosa non funziona noi oggi Vediamo che i media conservatori ce l'hanno a morte con biden e i media progressisti quasi in modi diversi Entrambi questi mondi danno la stessa cosa alle persone quello che vogliono sentirsi dire che le cose vanno male in tutto questo poi biden è oggettivamente anziano Proietta oggettivamente una grande fragilità molto più fisica che mentale Nel senso che nessuno sa dire una decisione sbagliata che biden avrebbe preso perché è vecchio se l'ha presa l'ha presa perché come tutti i politici fa delle cose che ogni tanto non ci piacciono però nessuno dice come rimbambito Allora eppure biden non riesce a fare una parte grossa del lavoro del presidente che è rappresentare la nazione ispirare forza fiducia nel futuro Trump ha una retorica che è in grado con un'efficacia senza paragoni secondo me oggi in America e non solo di infilarsi in tutte le crepe della società in tutte le linee di rottura in tutti i conflitti anche latenti Trump sa entrarci e usare quel conflitto facendolo esplodere per aiutare se stesso Ecco in questo contesto è difficile guardare l'America e non ti par dell'immigrazione dei problemi risolti e vedere un paese che non sia in crisi che non abbia dei grossi problemi da affrontare dall'altra parte io ho studiato molto negli ultimi anni la crisi della California per farti un esempio uno stato fortissimo rilevantissimo influen issimo e con città visitate centrali e tutto San Francisco è una città in profonda crisi ma da un anno e mezzo a questa parte è ripartita perché tutto il business le aziende dell'intelligenza artificiale generativa sono lì insomma l'America Ha una forza tale economica culturale produttiva che poi sa anche molto rigenerarsi e San Francisco sta ripartendo e ripartirà non perché biden ha fatto una riforma o no perché arriva Trump e fa qualcosa Perché si sono inventati un prodotto nuovo L'hanno inventato lì Non a caso e ne guadagneranno e ne godranno diciamo degli effetti per probabilmente decenni a venire Questa è la vera forza dell'America e a fronte di tutto questo un'elezione con due candidati un po' deprimenti e un quadro politico sconfortante Secondo me rischia di farci perdere di vista l'obiettivo io quello che cerco di raccontare nel libro è proprio perché sulla base di come sono fatti gli americani al di là della politica come ragion è quasi un libro antropologico rimangono Secondo me i migliori a giocare al gioco del capitalismo gioco che può non piacerci Ma questo è loro sono unicamente dotati per essere i migliori a primeggiare questo gioco anche per tutta la questione appunto della frontiera e quindi riprendendo il discorso in la frontiera è sempre stato un luogo non geografico un luogo culturale addirittura nel corso dell'800 provano durante il censimento a dire dove finiscano gli Stati Uniti e dicono il confine si sposta in continuazione perché le persone vanno esplorano conquistano la frontiera quindi è il luogo dove vorremmo essere e in quanto tale è un luogo ideale gli americani scrivono nella costituzione tutte le persone hanno il diritto alla felicità pari diritti quella cosa l'hanno scritta quando c'erano gli schiavi Quindi pensa che è grande contraddizione però serviva a dirsi non cosa siamo cosa vogliamo diventare ed è quella a cui servono le costituzioni e nel loro caso in modo molto imperfetto intermittente eccetera ha funzionato abbastanza parliamo comunque della più grande potenza economica culturale del pianeta Insomma proiettarsi Sempre e comunque avanti Francesco Grazie mille di essere passato e del tuo racconto sugli stati Uni Grazie Alessandro grazie a voi Grazie mille ragazzi Spero che questa intervista vi sia piaciuta grazie a Francesco Costa di aver partecipato e ovviamente a voi per averci seguito ci vediamo in un prossimo video sempre qui su geopop le scienze nella vita di tutti i giorni Ciao di" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Quali sono i confini tra Israele e Palestina perché non si tratta di veri e propri confini e geograficamente parlando cosa ostacola la soluzione a due stati quella tra israeliani e palestinesi è la storia di due popoli e una sola terra una storia di conflitti politici più che religiosi lunga quasi un secolo una storia Dunque piena di mappe tutte diverse e mutevoli ma partiamo subito dicendo che quelli tra Israele e Palestina non sono veri e propri confini perché la Palestina non è uno stato che gode di piena sovranità la formula internazionalmente utilizzata è quella di territori palestinesi occupati che sono la Cis jordania chiamata anche West Bank gerusalem Est e la striscia di gazza secondo le nazioni unite sono territori che Israele occupa militarmente contravvenendo il diritto internazionale e l'occupazione fa sì che non si possa parlare di confini internazionalmente riconosciuti anche altri confini di Israele sarebbero provvisori come quello settentrionale con il Libano e quello nord orientale con la Siria in prossimità delle alture del golan anchesse illegalmente occupate da Israele un'altra premessa necessaria a capire il perché sia così difficile avere una mappa stabile di Israele e Palestina è che in epoca contemporanea e fino al 1948 su quel territorio non erano mai esistiti né uno stato ebraico né uno stato palestinese spesso avrete visto questa successione di mappe ma è forviante mentre non esisteva lo Stato palestinese della prima mappa quello della seconda mappa è la proposta di spartizione dell'ONU che però non è mai stata attuata infine l'ultima mappa riporta le aree sotto l'amministrazione dell'autorità Nazionale palestinese cioè l'ente burocratico amministrativo nato con gli accordi di Oslo del 1993 che avrebbe dovuto rappresentare il nucleo del futuro stato palestinese non si tratta quindi di mappe demografiche dal momento che i palestinesi oggi vivono anche in Israele fino alla fine della prima guerra mondiale la Palestina era parte dell'impero Ottomano suddivisa in due province il San giacc di Gerusalemme e e il vilayet di Beirut comprendente il San giacca di Nablus e quello di Acri il crollo degli imperi nella grande guerra portò la suddivisione tra Francia e Regno Unito dei territori una volta ottomani una suddivisione stabilita con una serie di Trattati che vanno dall'accordo segreto di Sex pic del 1916 al trattato di Losanna del 1923 passando per la conferenza di Sanremo del 1920 che avrebbe dato il via al mandato britannico sulla Palestina nel 1917 un altro documento avrebbe avuto un'importanza storica per il futuro della Regione la dichiarazione balfour con cui il Regno Unito si dichiarava a favore della creazione in Palestina di un focolaio nazionale per il popolo ebraico quello che ci interessa qui è che solo durante il periodo britannico i confini sono rimasti invariati in quella che dal 1920 al 1948 veniva chiamata Palestina mandataria gli anni che portano alla nascita di Israele sono molto turbolenti la popolazione ebraica che alla fine dell'epoca ottomana si stimava al di sotto del 10% e concentrata soprattutto a Gerusalemme e in altri centri urbani comincia a crescere in virtù dell'immigrazione dall'Europa incentivata dall'organizzazione mondiale sionista nata nel 1897 fino a superare il 30% dopo la Seconda Guerra Mondiale un processo quello dell'immigrazione di coloni ebrei accelerato dalle persecuzioni antisemite prima nella Russia zarista e poi nella Germania nazista quindi dai profughi scampati dai lagher In Europa è una considerazione importante per la determinazione dei futuri confini per almeno due motivi Il primo è che gli immigrati ebrei perlop europei a differenza del vecchio isub cioè la comunità ebraica palestinese precedente alle immigrazioni non si integrarono nel nuovo contesto culturale politico e sociale rendendo di fatto difficile la convivenza con gli arabi sulla stessa terra In secondo luogo l'immigrazione fu accompagnata dall'acquisto di terreni gestito da agenzie come il jewish National Fund che condizionarono le acquisizioni di terra a una clausola che ne vietava la rivendita in questi anni iniziano gli scontri violenti a livello locale tra le due comunità nascono organizzazioni paramilitari e terroristiche da entrambe le parti e fioriscono i contrapposti nazionalismi ci saranno prima una rivolta araba quindi un'inserzione ebraica contro il mandato in questo contesto i britannici ormai incapaci di gestire L'ordine sociale in Palestina cominciano a pensare a una soluzione quella della partizione sulla Formula due popoli due stati poco dopo lo scoppio della rivolta araba nel 1937 i britannici creano la commissione PIL che propone una partizione che assegna agli arabi la maggior parte del territorio crea uno stato ebraico che si concentra sulla costa e nel nord e mantiene un mandato sulla regione di Gerusalemme e una striscia di terra che va fino a giaffa il piano viene rifiutato l'anno successivo ci riprova la commissione woodhead che propone tre soluzioni la a molto simile alla partizione PIL la b Che aggiunge la Galilea al mandato e la C che pone sotto un altro mandato anche il deserto del neg è una commissione fallimentare e gli stessi britannici sostengono che una soluzione di partizione è impraticabile l'ultimo serio tentativo arriverà dopo la Seconda guerra mondiale nel 1947 il compito viene assegnato alla neonata organizzazione delle Nazioni Unite la commissione incaricata di trovare una soluzione l'unc è composta da 11 paesi considerati neutrali la proposta è una mappa complicata che crea uno stato ebraico che ricopre il 55% del territorio mentre agli arabi va al 45% Gerusalemme per via della sua importanza per le tre grandi fedi monoteiste ottiene invece uno status internazionale la spartizione viene rifiutata dai paesi arabi mentre i sionisti la accettano entusiasti il 29 novembre del 1947 l'assemblea generale dell'ONU vota a favore della risoluzione 181 è un giorno storico sancisce de facto il riconoscimento internazionale del diritto di uno stato ebraico per gli arabi invece il piano È inaccettabile per almeno tre motivi Innanzitutto perché assegna in perc Ale molto più territorio agli Ebrei In secondo luogo perché a differenza dello stato ebraico i tre territori palestinesi non godono di continuità territoriale infine perché più di 400.000 arabi si sarebbero ritrovati al di fuori del loro stato costituendo oltre il 40% della popolazione dello stato ebraico temendone ritorsioni e repressioni a guardare la situazione oggi la mancata accettazione di quel piano Sembra un errore storico il 14 maggio 1948 ultimo giorno del mandato britannico viene proclamata la nascita dello Stato di Israele è Importante sottolineare che nella dichiarazione di indipendenza non viene fatta menzione dei Confini Ma si afferma che lo Stato di Israele sarà pronto a collaborare con le agenzie e le rappresentanze delle Nazioni Unite per l'applicazione della risoluzione dell'assemblea generale del 29 novembre 1947 il giorno dopo scoppia la Prima Guerra arabo-israeliana e i confini non sarebbero più stati come prima gli esiti più importanti di questa guerra furono due in primis le operazioni di pulzia etnica e la conseguente ondata di profughi palestinesi conosciuta nella memoria collettiva come Naba catastrofe è una questione fondamentale per i confini poiché dopo il 1948 si stima che circa 750.000 palestinesi ovvero Metà della popolazione diventino profughi vivendo Quindi al di fuori dei territori su cui il diritto internazionale garantisce il diritto a ritornare E in secondo luogo l'ampliamento rispetto al piano del 1947 della superficie dello stato ebraico fino al 78% dell'ex Palestina mandataria l'armistizio di Rodi del 1949 segna il limite con i due territori arabi rimasti la striscia di gazza controllata dall'Egitto e la Cis Giordania sotto controllo Giordano la linea dell'armistizio pensata per essere temporanea e conosciuta come Green Line È tuttora lì è la denominazione che compare Anche oggi usando Google Maps questa situazione rimarrà tale fino al 1967 Quando scoppia la guerra dei 6 giorni un conflitto brevissimo col quale Israele aumenta del 100% il proprio territorio oltre ad occupare cisjordania Gerusalemme Est e la striscia di gazza Tel Aviv occupa anche le alture del golan un territorio Siriano e la penisola egiziana del Sinai quest'ultima tornerà all'Egitto con gli accordi di camp David del 1978 successivi alla guerra dello jonkin pur del 1973 le conseguenze territoriali della guerra dei se giorni saranno destinate a cambiare per sempre la politica e la geografia dell'Asia occidentale se vi state chiedendo perché non la chi a Medio Oriente vi lasciamo qui l'episodio dedicato alla Regione politicamente dopo il 1967 perde vigore il panarabismo del presidente egiziano Nasser mentre geograficamente comincia La colonizzazione israeliana della codan l'occupazione militare dei territori palestinesi iniziata nel 1967 è stata considerata illegale da diverse risoluzioni Ono i 10 anni successivi saranno quindi determinanti per il futuro geografico e politico di Israele e Palestina in questo periodo di tempo infatti Israele inizia a costruire le colonie in CIS Giordania insediamenti di popolazione ebraica più o meno grandi che secondo diverse risoluzioni ONU e la Corte Internazionale di Giustizia sono illegali e contrari al diritto internazionale in primis la quarta convenzione di Ginevra anche nella striscia di gazza verranno costruite diverse colonie quattro fino al 1977 e altre 12 fino al 1993 tra il 1967 e il 1975 Inoltre i governi di Tel Aviv creano diverse zone militari su oltre il 26% del territorio CIS Giordano zone di terra inaccessibili per i palestinesi sebbene In molti casi ne vantino pregressi diritti di proprietà queste si estendono soprattutto lungo la Valle del Giordano portando quindi Israele a controllare de facto il confine orientale con la Giordania e isolando ulteriormente i palestinesi dal resto del mondo arabo dalla fine degli anni 60 e fino al 1997 invece Israele istituisce diverse riserve naturali su circa il 6% della cisjordania terreni dove sulla base di considerazioni di carattere ambientale viene limitato lo sviluppo Urbano la costruzione di nuove case così come le attività pastorali lo sviluppo delle colonie israeliane su terreni di proprietà palestinese avviene in diverse fasi uno sviluppo che nel 1979 però incontra L'opposizione di una sentenza di una corte di giustizia interna il governo israeliano trova quindi un espediente ovvero dichiarare terreni statali quelle terre palestinesi destinate alle colonie Agg girand così i precedenti diritti di proprietà privata e collettiva un escamotage giuridico che consentirà a Israele di controllare il 22% della cisjordania terreni su cui saranno costruite ulteriori colonie la costruzione delle colonie è stata portata avanti da diversi governi israeliani ed è tuttora in corso ad oggi si stima che abitino circa 700.000 coloni in CIS Giordania e a Gerusalemme est all'interno di 200 179 insediamenti che in alcuni casi sono vera e propria città alcuni di questi sono conosciuti come avamposti che a differenza delle colonie sono costruiti autonomamente da cittadini senza autorizzazione statale e sono quindi il legali anche per Israele che però non si adopera per il loro smantellamento quella delle colonie è una questione centrale per l'eventuale determinazione di veri e propri confini tra Israele e un futuro stato palestinese in primis perché frammentano la continuità territoriale delle terre palestinesi oggi suddivisi in 165 isole impedendone Tra l'altro l'attività di coltivazione e l'accesso alle risorse naturali e poi perché i coloni il cui numero crescente compromette la demografia locale In molti casi sono armati e difesi dall'esercito israeliano e ciò spesso contribuisce a rendere Praticamente impossibile un futuro di convivenza tra le due comunità La fermentazione dei territori palestinesi diventa ancor più tangibile dal 1991 in poi quando a seguito della prima intifada ai palestinesi che desiderano entr entrare a Gerusalemme est o in Israele viene chiesto un permesso speciale a questa ulteriore interruzione della continuità territoriale si aggiungono i checkpoint ovvero punti di passaggio interpretabili come nuove frontiere Una svolta sembra arrivare tra il 1993 e il 1995 con gli accordi di Oslo 1 e 2 coi quali Israele e l'organizzazione per la liberazione della Palestina si riconoscono formalmente gli accordi prevedono il parziale ritiro israeliano da alcuni territori palestinesi e la creazione di tre aree in CIS Giordania l'area a sul 18% della CIS Giordania viene assegnata all'esclusiva amministrazione dell'autorità Nazionale palestinese entità istituita dagli accordi l'area B il 22% della West Bank prevede un amministrazione congiunta di israeliani e palestinesi quindi il restante 60% ovvero l'area C controllata esclusivamente da Israele sebbene gli accordi rappresentino ad oggi il miglior tentativo di garantire un futuro stato palestinese la loro implementazione non è stata del tutto completata e diversi episodi come L'assassinio del premier israeliano izac carabin firmatario degli accordi insieme al leader palestinese Yasser Arafat l'hanno lasciata in un limbo politico istituzionale che dura ancora oggi nel frattempo a seguito dello scoppio della seconda intifada nel 2000 il governo israeliano ha deciso di costruire una barriera di separazione tra Israele e la cisjordania si tratta di una barriera in cemento alta fino a 9 m giudicata contraria al diritto internazionale dalla Corte di Giustizia internazionale oltre a separare e a isolare diversi territori palestinesi complicandosi ancora di più la continuità territoriale attraverso la creazione di enclave e nicchie abitative che segregano la popolazione palestinese il muro di fatto Erode ulteriore terreno alla CIS Giordania la barriera Infatti non coincide con la greenline dell'armistizio e per l'85 degli oltre 700 km corre all'interno della cisjordania inglobandolo su cui sorgono colonie così come diversi Pozzi d'acqua nonché i sobborghi di Gerusalemme est se fin qui abbiamo parlato solo tangenzialmente della città santa è perché la sua condizione particolare merita un approfondimento specifico lo abbiamo chiesto a Mattia Serra ricercatore dell'osservatorio Medio Oriente nordafrica dell'ispi la questione di Gerusalemme è uno dei temi più controversi del conflitto israelo palestinese questa città ha Infatti un valore religioso e simbolico enorme sia per gli israeliani che per i palestinesi e la sua storia è legata a doppio filo con quella del conflitto il cuore di Gerusalemme è sempre stata la città vecchia quella parte della città in cui si trovano la basilica del Santo Sepolcro il muro del pianto e la spinata delle moschee come potete vedere la città vecchia è storicamente divisa in quattro quartieri quello ebraico quello Cristiano quello Armeno e quello musulmano una divisione che già ci rende l'idea della ricchezza culturale e religiosa di questa città già all'epoca del mandato britannico Gerusalemme era stata al centro di tensioni che sfociarono spesso in violenze e rivolte quando negli anni 30 si comincia a parlare della possibilità di dividere la Palestina in due stati il futuro di Gerusalemme diventa una delle questioni più importanti nel 1937 la commissione PIL propose il mantenimento di un protettorato britannico su una fascia di terra che andava da Gerusalemme Betlemme ad est fino al mar Mediterraneo ad ovest anche il piano di partizione dell'ONU del 1947 prevedeva uno status speciale per la città che in questo questo caso sarebbe stata posta sotto la tutela delle Nazioni Unite come sappiamo questo piano non venne mai realizzato e da allora ci sono stati due importanti punti di svolta il primo fu la guerra del 1948 alla firma dell'armistizio Gerusalemme si ritrovò di fatto divisa a metà la parte Ovest im mano agli israeliani e la parte est Dove si trova la città vecchia im mano ai Giordani E allora che si inizia a parlare di Gerusalemme est ovvero quell'area della città in cui ancora oggi vive la maggior parte dei palestinesi il secondo punto di svolta è la guerra dei se giorni del 19 167 quando Israele riesce a conquistare militarmente la Cis Giordania e quindi anche Gerusalemme est a seguito dell'occupazione gli abitanti palestinesi di questa parte della città furono classificati come residenti permanenti uno status giuridico che permette loro di viaggiare lavorare all'interno di Israele ma che però di fatto non rappresenta una vera e propria cittadinanza Dal 1967 a oggi sono passati molti anni ma la città santa è rimasta al centro del conflitto nel 1980 il Parlamento israeliano passò una legge che definiva Gerusalemme come capitale unita e indivisibile dello Stato di Israele chiaramente i palestinesi non hanno mai riconosciuto questa decisione ed allora non sono mancati momenti di tensione per esempio nel 2000 fu la camminata del futuro primo ministro israeliano arel Sharon lungo la spinata delle moschee a far scoppiare la seconda intifada ma sono tensioni che abbiamo visto venire a galla anche negli ultimi anni Gerusalemme rimane quindi una delle principali questioni risolte del conflitto e non è un caso che il futuro della città santa sia stato lasciato fuori dai negoziati che hanno portato Agli accordi di Oslo la sua risoluzione Infatti venne rimandata a negoziazioni future in cui però le parti non riuscirono mai a trovare un accordo e a finalizzare il fallimento del processo di pace ha quindi lasciato la questione sospesa anche se Gerusalemme è amministrata per la sua interezza da Israele gran parte della comunità internazionale continua a considerare la parte est come un territorio occupato il cui status dovrà essere risolto in un negoziato di pace anche per questo motivo la decisione dell'amministrazione Trump nel 2017 di spostare l'ambasciata a Gerusalemme ha rappresentato un punto di rottura in questi ultimi anni alcuni paesi hanno deciso di seguire le orme degli Stati Uniti Ma su questo tema la comunità internazionale rimane divisa con la maggior parte dei paesi che si è rifiutata di seguire l'esempio americano Gerusalemme In fin dei conti rimane il cuore pulsante del conflitto è una città che raccoglie tutta la ricchezza e le contraddizioni di questa terra ed è per questo motivo che a più di 100 anni dall'arrivo degli inglesi in Palestina Gerusalemme continua ad essere una questione risolta in ultima analisi parliamo del caso della striscia di gazza Lunga 41 km e Larga 10 dopo il 48 la striscia di gazza ha vissuto una separazione fisica sempre più accentuata dagli altri territori palestinesi sviluppando così peculiari specificità territoriali controllata fino al 1967 dall'Egitto con cui comunica fisicamente attraverso il valico di Rafa anche in questo territorio ci sono state colonie israeliane nel 1991 la separazione della striscia viene marcata ulteriormente dall'installazione di checkpoint che di fatto consentono a Israele di controllare la libertà di movimento dei suoi abitanti a propria discrezione nel 1994 Tel Aviv costruisce una recinzione elettrica pattuglia da sentinelle militari che rende quasi impossibile il passaggio dalla striscia alla cis jordania e impone un controllo sempre più stringente su tutte le persone e le cose che entrano o escono da Gazza dopo la seconda intifada quando la recinzione fu demolita ne venne costruita una nuova e più sofisticata dot ATA di alta tecnologia di sicurezza e preceduta da una buffer zone interna che è inaccessibile ai palestinesi della striscia oltre al controllo degli unici passaggi di collegamento che funzionano come vere e proprie frontiere Israele Controlla anche lo sbocco sul mar Mediterraneo del quale ha unilateralmente ristretto sempre più la zona di pesca dalle 20 miglia nautiche sancite anche dagli accordi di Oslo alle attuali 3 miglia ovvero 5 km5 nel 2005 l'esercito israeliano ha lasciato la striscia di gazza da dove sono state smant ate anche tutte le colonie Tuttavia Israele ha mantenuto il controllo sullo spazio aereo quello Marittimo così come sui valichi d'accesso regolando Quindi ogni aspetto della vita dei Gasi tra cui il materiale per costruire e ricostruire gli edifici il carburante che serve anche per generare energia elettrica l'acqua dal momento che il 95% di quella di gazza è contaminata e non potabile e persino L'apporto calorico per questi motivi le nazioni unite continuano a ritenere Gazza un territorio occupato dal 2007 il governo della Striscia è passato nelle mani di hamas organizzazione islamista che Israele G usa e l'Unione Europea considerano terrorista 16 anni fa è quindi iniziato il blocco totale della striscia da cui si può uscire solo Ottenendo permessi speciali il blocco a cui è sottoposto il territorio ha contribuito a renderlo economicamente arretrato costringendo alla povertà gran parte degli oltre 2 milioni di abitanti della striscia di gazza si stima che oltre l'80 per di questi dipenda dagli aiuti umanitari e che la disoccupazione si aggiri intorno al 50% oltre al divieto di importare ed esportare liberamente i propri beni anche lo sviluppo infrastrutturale è bloccato da Israele l'aeroporto di gazza è fuori uso a causa di bombardamenti aerei dal 2001 mentre non è mai stato possibile sviluppare il porto di Gaza City tutte queste precarietà sono state drammaticamente aggravate negli anni dalle cicliche guerre condotte tra hamas e Israele nel 2008 nel 2012 nel 2014 nel 201 18 e quella attuale iniziata il 7 ottobre 2023 in seguito all'attacco terrorista dei miliziani jihadisti e che ha portato alla ritorsione israeliana la più devastante di tutte in termini umani Quando è stato girato questo video le vittime certe sono 1200 israeliani e oltre 14.000 palestinesi 6000 dei quali sono bambini quella tra israeliani e palestinesi è una storia di confini impossibili Resi tali da decenni di violenza contrapposte retoriche di negazione discriminazioni e privazioni deportazioni e presunti crimini di guerra questo video termina chiedendosi se mai esisteranno veri e propri confini tra Israele e Palestina un traguardo lontanissimo che necessita di una roadmap che passi per un cessate il fuoco Quindi un negoziato dunque un riconoscimento internazionale solo allora smetteremo di avere una terra sporcata dal sangue e mappe fatte da temporanei tratteggi geografici in favore di una soluzione stabile con confini in grado di garantire sia pace sia giustizia" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="La minaccia che la crisi ucraina possa trasformarsi in un’invasione militare della Russia di Putin e sfociare in una guerra rimane un'opzione concreta. Ma cosa sta succedendo in Ucraina? E perché siamo arrivati a questo? La situazione attuale continua a oscillare tra esercitazioni militari, dimostrazioni di forza e inviti diplomatici verso una de-escalation. &#10;&#10;Negli ultimi mesi 100.000 soldati russi sono stati spostati vicino ai confini con l’Ucraina. Gli Stati Uniti del presidente Biden sono pronti a inviare 8500 militari per difendere i Paesi dell’est Europa. Diversi Stati hanno richiamato in patria i propri diplomatici. La Russia ha dichiarato di essere pronta a invadere il suo vicino ucraino a meno che USA, UE e NATO non diminuiranno la loro presenza nell’area.&#10;&#10;I tentativi di negoziazione che si sono svolti a gennaio per trovare un accordo tra le parti in causa sono stati al momento vani. La tensione è salita alle stelle e la Russia ha mostrato i muscoli con esercitazioni militari, facendo ritornare vivo il ricordo di una non troppo lontana Guerra Fredda e riaprendo una vecchia ferita, forse mai del tutto chiusa. &#10;&#10;Si respira un’aria pesante e la situazione è critica.

          <attvalue for="7" value="100.000 soldati russi sono stati spostati vicino ai confini con l'Ucraina vari paesi hanno già richiamato i padri propri diplomatici e gli Stati Uniti sono pronti inviare 8.500 militari per difendere i paesi dell'est Europa Senza considerare il dramma di una possibile guerra sappiate che il 40% del gas usato nel vecchio continente viene dalla Russia e se non ci avete mai fatto caso Guardate l'Italia è molto più vicina all'ucraina di quanto non lo siano tra loro Trentino Alto Adige e Sicilia la situazione è critica cerchiamo di fare chiarezza in una nuova puntata di geopolitics Cosa sta succedendo in sintesi negli ultimi mesi la Russia accerchiato militarmente l'Ucraina e sarebbe pronta a invaderla A meno che non otterrà garanzia scritta da parte degli Stati Uniti e dell'Unione Europea che diminuiranno la loro presenza nell'aria le parti si sono incontrate a gennaio e hanno provato a negoziare ma senza trovare un accordo la tensione quindi è salita alle stelle sono state realizzate delle imponenti esercitazioni militari la Russia minacciato di portare le proprie testate nucleari vicino alle coste americane e nel caso di un attacco all'ucraina gli USA e l'Unione Europea hanno concordato di inviare degli armamenti a quest'ultima e di imporre la Russia durissime sanzioni Insomma si respira un'aria pesante ma come siamo arrivati a questo punto dovete sapere che per la Russia l'Ucraina è una ferita aperta e molto dolorosa per svariati motivi anzitutto l'Ucraina in particolare la capitale Kiev è storicamente considerata la culla del Popolo Russo e del successivo dell'impero Russo Kiev fu infatti la capitale del primo grande stato Russo della storia una monarchia esistita Per circa quattro secoli tra fine e800 e inizio 1200 Inoltre fino al 1991 l'Ucraina ha fatto parte dell'Unione Sovietica l'immensa superpotenza guida russa e Amatrice comunista che ha sfidato gli Stati Uniti per La supremazia mondiale durante la cosiddetta guerra fredda Russia e Ucraina presentano perciò molte somiglianze dal punto di vista storico culturale la lingua russa in ucraino ad esempio sono abbastanza simili Senza considerare che il russo è largamente parlato anche in Ucraina lo stesso zelinski l'attuale presidente ucraino è un ex comico diventato celebre parlando in russo veniamo quindi ad aspetti più strategici il primo la Russia considera l'Ucraina un cuscinetto territoriale assolutamente necessario per distanziare se stessa dal suo storico rivale cioè gli Stati Uniti cosa che però attualmente non avviene anzi dopo la caduta dell'URSS Infatti usa gli hanno espanso attraverso la nato la propria area influenza verso l'Europa Orientale giungendo così sull'uscio di casa della Russia Ma andiamo con ordine nel 1949 gli Stati Uniti diedero vita alla Nato l'organizzazione del trattato del Nord Atlantico è sostanzialmente un insieme di paesi alleati di cui fa parte anche l'Italia che nel caso fossero attaccati da un nemico esterno avrebbero la garanzia di essere Aiutati e difesi da tutti gli altri prima degli anni 90 la nato comprendeva usa Canada e molti paesi dell'Europa occidentale il confine ideale tra il blocco americano e il blocco sovietico la cosiddetta Cortina di ferro passava proprio dai confini dell'Alleanza Atlantica in Europa dopo la caduta dell'Unione Sovietica gli Stati Uniti ne hanno approfittato e dal 1997 hanno invitato a far parte della NATO quasi tutti gli stati dell'Europa centro-orientale compresi ex territori dell'Orso non solo hanno proprio delegato a questi paesi in particolare a Polonia e Romania e Bulgaria il contenimento attivo della Russia sostenendoli economica ovviamente e armandoli in questo modo neanche a dirlo la Russia si è sentita sempre più accerchiata ma non è tutto torniamo all'ucraina l'ex Repubblica Sovietica è un paese molto povero e dipende dal gas Russo Non solo anche una buona parte del gas che serve all'Europa giunge dalla Russia proprio attraverso gasdotti che passano in territorio ucraino Ecco finché l'Ucraina era alleata della Russia quest'ultima le ha venduto il gas a un prezzo di favore facendo peraltro finta di nulla rispetto ai suoi debiti ma questo sistema si è incrinato agli inizi degli anni 2000 nell'ex Repubblica Sovietica Infatti ha vinto le elezioni un partito filo-occidentale ai tempi si è parlato di rivoluzione arancione e a quel punto la Russia per punizione ha preteso il pagamento dei debiti e ha alzato il prezzo del gas le crisi che ne sono scaturite e hanno colpito anche molti stati europei che da quel momento hanno iniziato a diversificare di più il proprio mix energetico e a bypassare l'Ucraina per il gas il famoso gasdotto Nord stream il suo gemello no due e per ora bloccato hanno proprio questa funzione vanno dalla Russia alla Germania attraverso il Mar Baltico nel frattempo in Ucraina Dopo alterne vicende si è reinsediato un governo filorusso quello del presidente iankovic Ebbene nel novembre 2013 questo presidente si è rifiutato di firmare un trattato di Maggiore integrazione economica con l'Unione Europea scatenando però in questo modo ampie proteste in tutto il paese la repressione condotta a quel punto dal governo ha solo avuto l'effetto di aumentare le contestazioni e di trasformarle in un fiume rivoluzionario Il presidente iacovich è così dovuto fuggire dal paese si è formato un governo filo-occidentale che ha firmato il trattato con l'Unione Europea D'altra parte la Russia non aveva la minima intenzione di perdere lo storico alleato Ha dichiarato che la rivoluzione era un colpo di stato sostenuto da usa e Unione Europea e ha quindi invaso l'Ucraina affermando di voler difendere i diritti dei cittadini russi che ci vivevano anzitutto nel 2014 ha occupato la Crimea la Crimea chi non lo sapesse è una penisola strategica per il controllo del Mar Nero e già Allora in effetti era abitata da Molti russi era infatti stata regalata nel 1954 dal Presidente Krusciov all'ucraina in quel momento storico si era trattato di un'iniziativa abbastanza simbolica dato che esisteva l'Unione Sovietica ma in seguito la Russia si era ritrovata senza un territorio strategico aveva sempre avuto in mente di recuperarlo dopo aver occupato militarmente la Crimea putina imposto alla popolazione locale un referendum per annettere formalmente la regione alla Russia il risultato scontato un plebiscito a favore della proposta il referendum Tuttavia si è svolto Con evidenti pressioni e senza alcuna trasparenza e quindi non è mai stato considerato valido da Unione Europea e usa poco tempo dopo la questione della Crimea la Russia poi sostenuto la ribellione di truppe indipendentiste filo rosse in due regioni sull'orientali dell'Ucraina donech e Luras conosciute però congiuntamente con nome di don Bass il conflitto che motivato prosegue tuttora Da un lato la Russia sostiene la necessità di riconoscere l'indipendenza delle due regioni dall'altro Unione Europea e usa le ritengono invece territorio occupati quel che è certo è che da allora gli scontri hanno provocato 13.000 morti più di 30.000 feriti hanno sottratto l'Ucraina un territorio che ai tempi contava il 10% della sua popolazione e valeva il 20% del PIL del paese il 25 per cento delle sue esportazioni attaccata dalla Russia in cerca di aiuto l'Ucraina sia così rivolta ancor più agli Stati Uniti e all'Unione Europea ha inizio 2019 all'interno della Costituzione è stato addirittura incluso l'obiettivo di entrare a far parte sia dell'UE sia della NATO e contemporaneamente gli Stati Uniti hanno cominciato ad armare e sovvenzionare le forze armate ucraine E così siamo arrivati alla crisi attuale ai 100.000 soldati russi di spiegati vicino al confine ucraino e alla minaccia di Un'invasione Che cosa vorrebbe Putin il suo obiettivo è recuperare l'Ucraina per la sua importanza strategica e storica sia per non essere ricordato come il leader che la persa sia perché se in Ucraina l'appoggio occidentale dovesse funzionare anche i cittadini russi potrebbero cominciare a chiedere maggiori diritti e libertà creando quindi problemi di instabilità interna pertanto la Russia ha fatto agli Stati Uniti una serie di richieste estreme per così dire come ad esempio escludere dalla NATO tutti i paesi dell'Europa orientale più concretamente però Putin vuole la garanzia che l'Ucraina e anche la Georgia non entrino mai a far parte della NATO gli USA D'altro canto si trovano in una posizione di forza e non vogliono cedere terreno alla Russia l'ideale Per loro sarebbe continuare a mantenere lo status quo e contenere ulteriormente l'ex paese degli Zar destabilizzando piano piano altri alleati di Mosca come la Bielorussia o il Kazakistan in questo senso l'inclusione dell'Ucraina nella nato potrebbe aspettare in base al trattato del Nord Atlantico peraltro l'Ucraina non potrebbe nemmeno far parte l'alleanza perché presenta al suo interno dei territori occupati Ma scusate e i paesi europei nella contesa purtroppo sono divisi e contano ben poco quelli del Nord e dell'est sono terrorizzati da possibili concessioni alla Russia o da una guerra quelli dell'ovest invece sono in gran parte dipendenti da Mosca Per le forniture di gas e temono anzi che eventuali sanzioni danneggerebbero anche le loro economie Ecco A proposito se scoppiasse Purtroppo una guerra Quali sarebbero le mosse dell'Occidente l'invio di soldati sembra escluso perché il territorio ucraino è difficilmente difendibile e un conflitto diretto potrebbe degenerare in qualcosa di Ben peggiore rimarrebbe perciò un sostegno economico e militare esterno e l'imposizione di durissime sanzioni alla Russia vi faccio degli esempi blocco definitivo del nostro in due restrizioni alla conversione dei rubli in altre valute limitazioni all'azione del fondo sovrano Russo nel mondo e alla compravendita di componenti elettroniche e tecnologiche sanzione biciclette a puti nel soci e la disconnessione del sistema bancario Russo dal sistema internazionale di transazioni Swift Insomma come andrà a finire al momento non lo sa nessuno quel che è certo però è che le prospettive non sono delle migliori usa vorrebbero incrementare la militarizzazione di Polonia Bulgaria e Romania contemporaneamente in Bielorussia sta per tenersi un referendum costituzionale che chiederà la popolazione di rinunciare allo stato di paese denuclearizzato E questo potrebbe portare all'installazione di missili nucleari russi in loco ragazzi Spero che questa puntata vi sia piaciuta Grazie di averci seguito e ci rivediamo con un prossimo video sempre qui sul geop Le Scienze nella vita di tutti i giorni Ciao Poi ci dice se questo video è un video Pippone oppure no ci fate sapere voi se volete più video pipponi oppure no

          <attvalue for="7" value="Israel has a reputation for freeing hostages it's a reputation they've built up over decades with some extraordinarily daring rescues but this time it's different as Hamas militants rampaged across Southern Israel killing 1,400 people they also captured almost 250 hostages it was a core part of their strategy to give themselves a bargaining chip during the war they started they're bargaining hard demanding around 20 Palestinian prisoners be released in exchange for every hostage despite their reputation Israel seems to be struggling to get the hostages out I'm begging the world to bring my baby back home I'm Matt Bon and this is if you're listening I want to welcome the right honorable Benjamin Netanyahu the prime minister of the state of Israel in Israel there's a famous story there's movies and books about it it's told over and over at special events ladies and gentlemen like this one that Benjamin Netanyahu went to in 2016 this is a deeply moving day for me it's like the Israeli galipoli their watero their Gettysburg we have gathered here to mark an event that inspired the world and lifted the spirits of my people it's the day Israel rescued 100 and two hostages from the heart of Africa International terrorism suffered a stinging defeat and a legend was born the rescue mission proved that good can Prevail over evil that hope can triumph over fear and it's personal for Netanyahu because it's also the day his brother died I learned from my brother and from others that two need things are needed above all to defeat terrorism Clarity and courage he see the late 1960s and early 1970s were big for plane hijackings there was very little security in airports no x-ray machines you could take liquids on the plane nail scissors a gun even a bomb a couple of sticks of dynamite sitting in the seat next to him he told us right from the start that he meant business and he was going to throw us all up usually when someone hijacked a plane they would just trying to get into or out of communist Cuba but the era of high stakes poit iCal hijackings began in 1970 when Palestinian militants took four planes with Israelis on board the hijacking in a single week of four jet airliners by one of the more extreme Guerilla organizations the popular front for the liberation of Palestine one plane was taken to Cairo the other three to a runway in the middle of the Jordanian desert the Palestinians claimed they'd blow up the planes with passengers on board if certain European governments and Israel refused to release Arab Commandos held in their jails after 6 days in the desert heat the terrorist Dems were met and the hostages released though the people were spared the planes were not $24 million reduced to ashes giving into hijackers demands was not something Israel was Keen to turn into a habit so when another Plane full of Israelis was hijacked they decided to do something about it it was 1972 and Palestinian militants had taken control of a plane they landed at Tel Aviv airport and demanded the release of 315 Palestinian prisoners who were being held in Israeli jails after 24 hours of negotiations the Israeli government appeared to give in they told the hijackers they'd concede to their demands and bring the prisoners to the airport and they could use the plane to fly everyone off to Egypt the hijackers were delighted they were so happy they cracked open the plane's emergency doors a little bit to let in a breeze but the Israelis said they'd have to fix the plane before it could take off because the tires were flat because the Israelis had punctured them 16 mechanics in white overalls approached the plane in baggage carts among the mechanics were two future Israeli Prime Ministers ahood Barack and Benjamin Netanyahu sorry to be clear the men weren't actually mechanics they were Special Forces soldiers and in their tool boxes were guns watching from the sidelines was netanyahu's older brother Yoni also a Commando Commander Barack had refused to let both brothers join the operation in case both were killed the mechanics arrived at the plane and I don't know donked the side of it with hammers and spanners a bit before pulling their guns out and ripping open the emergency doors Netanyahu pounced on one of the militants and demanded and did she' tell him where the bomb was there was a scuffle people started shooting Netanyahu was hit in the arm two hijackers and one hostage were killed in a matter of seconds it was all over the hostages were released the story of bib netanyahu's daring rescue mission became famous and a part of his personal mythology but an even more famous and far more dangerous Mission the one spoken on in reverent tones to this day was yet to come and now the big one see 4 years later Israel was put to the test again and it was Yoni netanyahu's turn to go this time the hijacked plane wasn't in Israel it wasn't even in the Middle East we were really at the ends of the Earth we could have been on the moon the Air France plane took off from Tel Aviv and was supposed to land in Paris instead the hijackers diverted the plane midair Cynthia zega and 250 hostages were taken to the old terminal at uganda's International Airport on the shore of lank Victoria if you look at a map you realize that even if you escaped from that building where would you go the plane had been hijacked by Palestinian and German extremists but the hostages were now under the control of someone even scarier they now the virtual hostages of the Ugandan president Ed AR mean yes idam me the brutal dictator of Uganda the world's favorite evil buffoon idaman made no secret of his hatred of Israel but is it true that you said the Hitler didn't kill enough Jews during the war and of his support for the Palestinian C the year before the hijacking Palestinian leader yasa Arafat had served as best man at one of am's weddings when idaman found out about the plane he saw an incredible opportunity to get a bit of international attention he came every day with a television crew with a radio crew the non-israeli passengers were released leaving 103 passengers and crew still in the terminal building there was Terror constantly we were always surrounded by men with guns men with grenades we also were surrounded outside the building by the Ugandan army with heavy arms with Bazookas with machine guns the terrorist demands were the same as last time releasing Palestinian prisoners in Israel the families of the hostages protested outside government officers to demand the trade the Israeli governments understood to be under heavy pressure from Jews with relatives being held in Uganda earlier there had been emotional scenes when some of the relatives marched on the cabinet building to plead for the lives of the hostages Yoni Netanyahu by this stage was a battle hardened and highly decorated soldier a veteran of three Wars and several special ops he was put in charge of a rescue operation that was so insane that the terrorists never imagined it was possible the main problem was to get to the terrorist with the biggest surprise possible we used several tricks to do that the hijackers have been holding the hostages for a week when finally the operation began on July 4th 1976 Israel launched the most daring rescue of all time to save our captive brethren in the heart of Africa Israeli planes flew at an altitude of less than 30 m for thousands of kilometers before approaching Uganda over Lake Victoria they landed in the dead of night in a country led by a brutal dictator who gave Refuge to terrorists when the plane landed the Commandos rolled out in a black Mercedes identical to IDI ain's car flanked by Land Rovers they were dressed in ug Ugandan army uniforms Ugandan soldiers thinking it was their terrifying president let the cars approach the terminal it took less than an hour the Commandos burst out of the car and blasted their way through the airport killing seven hijackers and 45 ugandans most of them did not understand until the last moment what really happened they blew up 11 fighter jets to make sure they could Escape safely three hostages were killed and also a senior Israeli officer was killed shot in the back my beloved brother Yoni who led the force that stormed the old terminal overcame the terrorists and freed the hostages was the only soldier who was killed the operation immediately became legendary when the hostages returned home there were parties in the street it was retroactively renamed operation yonathan in net Yahoo's memory by the end of the year production had begun on eight separate movies about the raid Warner Brothers victory at nby starring Bert Lancaster Elizabeth Taylor and Kirk Douglas will premere in Sydney in a few days time the movie starred Richard dfus as Yoni Netanyahu we've got the terrorists we can start moving the hostages out there have since been questions raised about netanyahu's actions leading up to and during the rain with some reports suggesting that he was on the verge of being relieved of command just beforehand but that's not the narrative spread by the Netanyahu family Benjamin Netanyahu became internationally famous appearing regularly on American television to talk about his brother and I think it grew inspiration from the Bible from the biblical Heroes Benjamin Netanyahu is the brother of the Fallen Jonathan and he is now a ambassador from Israel to the United Nations and be the editor of a new book called terrorism How the West can win books have been written about y Netanyahu including the publication of his private letters this is a book uh that our guest has written the letters of Jonathan uh his brother netu self-portrait of a of a hero this is something you might enjoy reading around the world military forces tried to replicate Israel's success in fighting against terrorists they failed in Iran the is one of national delight at America's disastrous failure to bring home the hostages but this only added to Israel's mistake the idea that they were the only ones up to the job in the following decades other successful though admittedly less spectacular hostage rescues solidified this image and retaliatory attacks by Israel against Palestinian targets sent a clear message if you take israeli's hostage we'll get them back and then we'll kill you people ask for Revenge we determined to settle the account now Israel's reputation is being put to the test Hamas has 239 hostages being held in their vast network of tunnels dug into the soft Sandstone under the suburbs of Gaza Hamas claims the tunnels are more than 500 km long there so many hostages in so many different places that Hamas took a while to figure out how many they had hopes of a rescue operation are slim at least in previous operations they knew where the hostages were this time they're spread across Gaza so option b is a trade the hostages families are pleading with Benjamin Netanyahu to get their loved ones back I'm begging the world to bring my baby back home the families are desperate some are mourning the death of loved ones while they hope for the release of others the family is broken can their father saki is being held hostage in Gaza their 18-year-old sister Mayan is dead Hamas says that they are willing to do a trade Hamas declared this that they are ready for immediate exchange so that all civilians Israeli civilians will come home and in exchange for Palestinian prisoners being released I think that's fair but it's expected that to get them all released it will take a massive release of Palestinian prisoners potentially thousands in 2011 Israel had to release a th000 prisoners in exchange for one single soldier who was being held hostage in Gaza so far Hamas has only released four hostages two Americans and two Israeli grandmothers 85-year-old Israeli grandmothers yav lifshits and 79-year-old nurit Cooper are given treats and tea before being released one reaches her hand out to her armed guard and says Salam which is Arabic for peace one Israeli soldier who is being held hostage in Gaza has been rescued the families of the other 239 hostages have asked Netanyahu to trade all 4500 Palestinian prisoners for all 239 hostages in what they're calling an all for all deal and we the families will not stop until everybody is back nyaho says he's considering it but he'll find it difficult to persuade his hard-right political allies that it's the right thing to do Israeli defense minister says an all for all deal is impossible and the only solution is for the Defense Force to destroy Hamas sometimes in Gaza the living look like the Dead Israel said it hit more than 400 Hamas Targets in 24 hours Hamas says that Israeli bombings have already killed 50 hostages the question is will there be any hostages Left Alive by the time Hamas is

          <attvalue for="2" value="3" />
          <attvalue for="3" value="The man behind Trump’s trade war is Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and his backstory is extraordinary. He’s been a hero, he’s been a villain, he’s been a sympathetic figure and also one of the most hated men in America - and all of that is even before he attached himself to Donald Trump. Over the last few months, gambling with tariffs has caused economic chaos and sent global markets into a tailspin… but  Howard Lutnick is clearly all in. So why is the Commerce Secretary so reckless when it comes to the future of America’s economy?  &#10;Subscribe: https://ab.co/3yqPOZ5   &#10;Watch all episodes of If You're Listening - in our playlist here: &#10;   • If You're Listening | ABC News In-depth  &#10;&#10;Welcome to ABC News In-depth, where you'll find our long-form journalism and other videos to help you understand what's going on in the world around you.&#10;&#10;Watch more ABC News content ad-free on ABC iview: https://ab.co/2OB7Mk1&#10;&#10;For more from ABC News, click here: https://ab.co/2kxYCZY&#10;&#10;Get breaking news and livestreams from our ABC News channel:    / newsonabc  &#10;Like ABC News on Facebook:   / abcnews.au  &#10;Follow ABC News on Instagram:   / abcnews_au  &#10;Follow ABC News on Twitter:   / abcnews  &#10;&#10;Note: In most cases, our captions are auto-generated.&#10;&#10;#ABCNewsIndepth #ABCNewsAustralia" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="can you imagine what it would be like to have basically every economist in the world calling you an idiot this could not be more stupid we're living in crazy town right now how stupid is that someone puts a gun to their own head now I don't think that this bothers Donald Trump too much he's the one they're calling stupid by the way all because one scenile billionaire won't give up on the one stupid idea in his head he is extremely sure that his idea of fixing the world with tariffs is a good one tariffs are very powerful both economically and in getting everything else you want donald Trump argues that tariffs are the solution to everything tariffs are a properly used are a very powerful tool not only economically but also for getting other things outside of economics almost everyone else including people that have worked with him for years disagrees but he doesn't care what all those other people think because he's got someone in his corner agreeing with everything he says today I'm honored to swear in our next Secretary of Commerce Mr howard Lutnik i've known him a long time he's great guy howard Lutnik a billionaire with a permanent smile on his face is Trump's pointman on tariffs and he is all in so I think it's just a different way of thinking donald Trump understands it he's going to be the driver of that policy and I'm excited that he's at the desk this is the guy that I want to talk about today his story is tragic and surprising he has been both a hero and a villain two decades ago he was briefly one of the most hated men in America he's about as Wall Street as anyone can get but he's not stupid he's not confused he clearly understands the system that he is helping Trump upend so why is he doing this what a what a fun day to be on your show today i think the answer lies in his past and while Trump may have eased off on the stratospheric tariffs on China for now I get the impression that he and Lutnik will not be dropping tariffs entirely anytime soon global tariffs are a gamble and Howard Lutnik is all in i'm Matt Beavenon and this is if you're listening there is this photograph of Howard Lutnik that I have been thinking about ever since I first saw it it was taken outside his son's kindergarten on 90th Street in Uptown Manhattan and then I took my next son my oldest son was five to his first day of kindergarten howard Lutnik was almost never late for work because he had a very important job but on this particular day he took the morning off so I have a picture of me he's got he's got a little wet hair he's wearing a little backpack on any other morning Howard Lutnik would have been downtown he was the chairman of Caner Fitzgerald a financial services firm that occupied floors 101 to 105 of the North Tower of the World Trade Center he was a proper Wall Street rich guy he loved fast cars fancy suits and expensive art the office was filled with sculptures by August Redan among those statues was a very nepotistic workforce we chose to only work with people that we like so we would tell everybody &quot;Look you you've got winning friends let's hire those winning friends.&quot; So we all hired our friends i had my brother Gary had my best friend Doug there were 29 sets of siblings on the Caner Fitzgerald floors on the day that Howard took his son to his first day of kindergarten so I have a picture of me with my son in front of the school at 8:46 8:46 a.m on September 11th 2001 had Howard and Kyle looked up as that photo of the two of them was taken they would have seen the hijacked American Airlines Flight 11 fly almost directly overhead holy [ __ ] he he called my sister uh just after the just after the plane hit and he told her that um he said that the smoke was pouring in and he just wanted to say that he loved her when he wanted to say goodbye and uh tell everyone that that he loved them howard Lutnik went to the base of the tower and frantically searched among the evacuees for any of his staff members then he was hit by a wall of debris as the south tower collapsed his driver Jimmy dragged him uptown and the north tower collapsed behind them of the thousand caner employees at the uh trade center only 300 are accounted for at this time and none was at the building at that time by September 14th it was clear that none of the 658 people who were in the Caner Fitzgerald offices that morning had survived my 700 families 700 families i have 700 families howard did interviews with three TV stations and cried in all of them he became nationally famous as the face of the Wall Street victims every single individual with his firm gone gone his entire office everybody everybody i mean I I watched this guy tell his story and it just it just ripped me off i I couldn't handle it on the 14th of September Lutnik created a relief fund for the families and yet the following day he sent out final paychecks to all of them he would no longer be paying their lost loved ones salaries lutnik was all over national television saying that he would do whatever he could for the families of the missing employees well it was about a week later that those families learned that all their paychecks were going to stop immediately why would he cry so on television are you suggesting that he just turned on the tears oh yeah he went on CNN to talk to Larry King about it and cried again they call me and they say &quot;How come you can't pay my salary why can't you pay my husband's salary are the other companies pay their salary why can't you?&quot; But you see I I lost I lost everybody in the company so I can't pay their salaries so they they think we're doing something wrong can't pay their salaries they don't have any money to pay their salaries within weeks Lutnik was a national pariah wall Street watchers say that's the cutthroat Howard Lutnik they know so what was he doing well he had a strategy of sorts having looked at his books he thought that if he kept paying the salaries of his lost workers the company would rapidly go bankrupt but what if he restarted the company on September 12th I hosted a call with my surviving employees and I laid out two choices for them we could either attend our friends funerals but that's 20 funerals a day for 33 straight days or we could try to rebuild the company to take care of the 658 families that we lost that day he planned to pay the families of the victims using Caner Fitzgerald's profits my partners and I we we talked about it and we've decided that what we're going to do is we're going to give 25% of the profits of the company to the families of the victims it was a massive gamble he had lost 2/3 of his workforce he was locked out of all the company's accounts the people who knew the passwords were dead in the rubble all of their paper records were in New York Harbor did they have a backup yes in what they thought was a safe place the basement of the other Twin Tower the company was a shambles what if he never made a profit again 25% of nothing is nothing it's going to be a different kind of drive than I've ever had before it's not about my It's not about my family i get to kiss my kids i get to kiss my kids tonight but other people don't get to kiss their kids but he had a reason to think that his gamble might pay off see Caner Fitzgerald was an unusual firm they were basically the eBay of US Treasury bonds what that means is they trade US government debt i'll let this 1960s film star explain hi I'm Donna Reed i'd like to talk to you about a unique Christmas gift a gift that will fit any situation is always in the best of taste and will never never go out of style one guess you're right it's money but not the ordinary kind of money no this is growing money would you like to see some US savings bonds now watch how they grow this is the 1960s version of Marggo Robbie in a bubble bath explaining credit default swaps so this Christmas give growing money give United States savings bonds thank you and merry Christmas i guess that didn't really explain it did it i guess I'll have to be the one getting in the bubble bath the US government is always in debt so it almost always needs to borrow money you can lend your money to them in exchange for a bond a promise that they will pay you back with interest in the future us savings bonds are one of America's most important institutions they are not new it's not sexy but it's considered very safe after all the US government is hardly going to collapse generally US stocks and US Treasury bonds go in opposite directions because people switch one for the other and that's how it's supposed to work anyone can buy these bonds but you can't just call up the US Federal Reserve and buy them directly you need a broker and that's where Cander Fitzgerald comes in excuse me anyway in 2001 Cander Fitzgerald were by far the biggest broker of US bonds they had reached that status by trading bonds over the phone but they were also in the process of transitioning to online trading via a platform they owned called Espeed espeed the global leader in real time electronic market solutions howard Lutnik knew that the markets would soon be reopening when the greatest financial market on Earth does resume trading the whole world will be watching and he thought that the horrific terrorist attack would lead people to look for safe investments switching their stocks for government bonds people have basically moved to try and get into what they think of secure assets so that they've gone into gold they've gone into government bonds and if people want to buy government bonds they're going to do it through Espeed and that means revenue for Caner Fitzgerald we have to make our company be able to take care of my 700 families using their London staff a temporary office space in New Jersey and an army of technicians they managed to get Espeed up and running in 2 days the strategy paid off so together we raised $180 million over the next five years for those families and my employees they stitched my soul back together that's about 275,000 per family he also paid for their health care for 10 years after 15 years Kender Fitzgerald had hired 57 children of staff members who had died in 9/11 along with his sister Lutnik now runs a massive charity which provides support to victims of terrorist attacks and natural disasters and it's called the the Caner Fitzgerald Foundation and um you know anyone who can uh can make a donation to it is going to help a lot of people who really really need it lutnik knew what funding and community could do for people who had lost everything and dedicated a great deal of time to helping people in need in fact it was through charitable giving that he met Donald Trump he appeared on Trump's TV show Celebrity Apprentice in 2008 as a bidder in a charity auction how aboutund all right that's the game we're playing i'll take a bit for $100,000 in the front row $100,000 all right now obviously this is kind of how it rolls on Wall Street massive gamles that if they work make people think you're a genius it was pretty wild though i think if it was me I would have liquidated the firm taken the insurance and just split the proceeds among the victim's families and that is probably why Howard Lutnik is now a billionaire cabinet secretary and I am a thousandair basement podcaster i think Howard Lutnik's business and his history has made him a very unusual Wall Street trader i'm feeling great Richard this is the best I've felt in a long time for one thing his business is based on how much people trade not on whether the market is going up or down we don't make money when the markets go up we don't lose any when it goes down uh but when we win is when it's busy the company loves volatility and with volatility back you know the numbers of the company are just are just beautiful bull or bear it doesn't matter as long as the market is busy secondly this is a man who has gone through one of the worst traumas imaginable twothirds of his workforce including his brother and best friend were killed in an event that he survived only by chance he seems more than most people to be almost entirely unafraid of negative consequences how could anything be worse than what he has experienced and anyway he's a billionaire now who makes money from volatility he is basically immune from repercussions in 2023 he got a call from his old TV friend Donald Trump so 2023 calls me says &quot;Will you help me?&quot; I actually thought about it like and that was the first time I really thought politics and then I said &quot;Yes.&quot; He told the All-In podcast that he spent a lot of time in Trump's orbit throughout 2024 before deciding in October what he wanted to do to help a potential second Trump administration and I said I want to balance the budget United States of America and I this is the way we're going to do it he said if Elon Musk can cut $1 trillion in spending and he can raise $1 trillion through tariffs he thought that he would be able to get to a balanced budget if we can balance the budget for you will you agree to wave all income tax for every person who makes less than $150,000 a year for the United States of America which by the way is about 85% of America right right and the reason you want to work for Donald Trump is he looks at me goes &quot;Sure.&quot; Okay I want to pause on that point because it is wild remember a few episodes ago when we were looking into Doge and I was illustrating Elon Musk's cost cutting goals with two very big jars of water yeah I'm not going to do that this time because in order to illustrate what Lapnik is suggesting that would basically involve me smashing the jars with a hammer and then trying to glue the pieces back together he says he's wanting to use tariffs on imports to basically fund the entire US government this is the equivalent of Howard Lutnik looking at a pile of twisted steel and concrete a massacred workforce a cloud of paper floating through the air and thinking &quot;I can still make a profit this quarter i have to to support the 700 families the American people are his 700 families now and he's taking another spectacular gamble.&quot; Donald Trump is a rare politician he does what he says he's going to do the stuff Howard Lutnik and Donald Trump are saying in interviews only makes sense if you understand that they are genuinely trying to upend the entire US economy like this quote for example promising to bring the production of high-tech products back to the US you're going to see robotic production of iPhones and the jobs that are going to be created people who build those factories the mechanics who work on those robots these jobs are going to be millions and millions of those jobs these are great high-paying jobs and you don't need a college education to do it millions of non-oled educated robot mechanics who presumably pay no income tax what What about this quote from Donald Trump i don't think a beautiful baby girl needs that's 11 years old needs to have 30 dolls i think they can have three dolls or four dolls donald Trump genuinely wants Americans to cut back on consumption of products that are currently made overseas i'm just saying they don't need to have $30 they can have three they don't need to have 250 pencils they can have five they're not saying all these things by accident these aren't gaffs they are redesigning the American economy you won't need a degree to get a good job you won't buy so many toys or clothes trade with other countries will be vastly different thanks to the trade deals they're currently negotiating but you're going to see over the next month or so we're going to roll out dozens of deals okay because we'll find categories of countries that it'll work out just fine but the other thing here is he's not making any specific promises there's no particular benchmarks or goals much like with his promise to give 25% of his profits to the families that could have been 25% of 1 million or 180 million this means that any concessions they get from other countries can be called a win we had a a trade conversation with a country that sells a lot of cars into America and we don't sell hardly any cars into their market and we were getting nowhere we were just getting nowhere and the meeting was coming to an end and the trade minister at the end of the meeting drops his head and goes &quot;Fine we'll give your car manufacturers the same subsidy that we give our car manufacturers.&quot; Bang bang we don't know what country that was or what the subsidy was or if that's what Lutnik was even trying to get out of them but in Lutnik's eyes that's a win bang i don't know what's going to happen here but it's clearly not going to calm down howard Lutnik is in the middle of the biggest gamble of his life and in his mind it's impossible for him to lose the only thing that's convinced him and Trump to ease off a little bit was a sudden drop in the price of stocks and bonds at the same time after their liberation day tariffs instead of people swapping US stocks for US bonds people swapped both for foreign investments because they thought that America had gone mad short of this kind of thing happening Latutnik is not going to stop until he is forced to stop or until the US economy is unrecognizable if you can find a way to benefit from volatility like Howard Lutnik did then the next few years look pretty good i don't know what's going to happen to everybody else [Music] it's done [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="GEOFF BENNETT: The clash between  President Trump and Elon Musk is   the latest twist in a whirlwind week of  political drama and global headlines. Here to discuss it are Brooks and Capehart.  That's New York Times columnist David Brooks   and Jonathan Capehart, associate  editor of The Washington Post. Welcome, gentlemen. GEOFF BENNETT: So, this public falling  out between the president and the world's   richest man upended one of the most powerful  dynamics shaping Donald Trump's second term. David, I remember on this program right  after inauguration you said that this   rupture was inevitable. What are the  implications now that it's happened? DAVID BROOKS: It's so rare that every  pundit makes a prediction and it comes true. (LAUGHTER) DAVID BROOKS: But it did happen. I, of course, thought they're having a  philosophical discussion about debt-to-GDP ratios,   and Elon Musk thinks they're too high and  Trump doesn't -- isn't bothered. But they   do have substantive disagreements.  Elon Musk thinks the spending bill   is too big and he thinks the future is  in renewable energy, not fossil fuels. And that is the core. There actually is  a substantive core. But these are the two   Super Bowl beefers of the online world. And so,  as you saw it unfold on Twitter on Thursday,   you realize they're super self-conscious  about what they're doing. They know how   the beefing game is played. They're  good at it. They love the attention. And you almost got the sense that they were  cooperating. I don't think they were. But   it's so practiced. It's now such a routine to have  these online beefs that it seems almost like meta. GEOFF BENNETT: Jonathan, as you see  it, what's at stake here for both men? JONATHAN CAPEHART: Well, one, I just  want to say the fight between them,   to pick up on what David  was saying, it's so petty. I mean, I would look at the traffic  back and forth and just be like,   girl, really? This is what you're doing. But,  look, what we have here is a battle between   two epic characters. One is the world's  most powerful leader just by virtue of   being elected president of the United States.  The other one is the world's richest person,   who has his own media company,  i.e. X, formerly known as Twitter. And so, yes, they can beef with each other  and smack each other around. But, again, this   was so predictable, right? I think we both said  right afterwards that this is doomed to failure. And the other thing I will point out is that these  are two men who, especially with President Trump,   loyalty is a thing. But with President  Trump, loyalty is a one-way street.   And what we have seen with Elon Musk, well,  for him, loyalty is a one-way street as well. And so you have in Elon Musk what you  haven't had in anyone else President   Trump has gone toe -- has battled or criticized,   and that is someone who is willing to fight  back with him in the same way that he fights. GEOFF BENNETT: Yes. Well, more  to come on that front, for sure. Let's shift our focus to foreign policy.  We had that astonishing attack this week   by Ukraine on Russian bombers deep inside Russia,   by some accounts wiping out more than a  third of their long-range bomber fleet.   And then you had President Trump in  the Oval Office with this response: DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States:  Sometimes, you see two young children fighting   like crazy. They hate each other and they're  fighting in a park. And you try and pull   them apart. They don't want to be pulled.  Sometimes, you're better off letting them   fight for a while and then pulling them apart.  And I gave that analogy to Putin yesterday. GEOFF BENNETT: Comparing the war in  Ukraine to two children fighting in a park,   what does that tell you about the  way the president sees this conflict? DAVID BROOKS: Well, he is an amoralist.  He just doesn't get moral sensibility. And so these were not two children fighting  in the park. This was one dictatorship   invading a democracy. So there's just a moral  difference, but he's obtusely unaware of it. Second, it turns out winning a Nobel Peace Prize  is harder than it looks. And you actually have   to do stuff. And the one thing he has to do  to Vladimir Putin is to raise the cost of   continuing this war. And so, if he wants peace,  it's not two children. You raise the cost for   Vladimir Putin. You have more sanctions. You give  Ukraine more aid. You welcome Ukraine into NATO. You do the things that Vladimir Putin doesn't  want you to do. But Donald Trump will never do   that because he doesn't actually do that kind of  diplomacy, where you impose costs on people to get   them to do what you want to do. And that leads to  the thing which may be the theme of our two first   subjects. Narcissists cannot understand  what's going on in other people's minds. And whether it's Musk or Trump or  Musk v. Putin, none of these three   guys can understand how another person is  thinking. And you can't do a negotiation,   broker a deal between two warring parties if  you can't put yourself in other people's shoes. So, on multiple levels, Trump is  just whiffing on his Russia policy. GEOFF BENNETT: Jonathan, how do you see it? JONATHAN CAPEHART: And I would add  to that that the interesting thing   here is that the United States' influence  around the world seems to be diminishing. And I think it's diminishing, one, because  of who's sitting in the Oval Office. He   doesn't want alliances. He doesn't want  partnerships. We look at what's happening   with the Iran nuclear talks now. And it  was brought back to when President Obama   was negotiating the Iran nuclear deal.  And the thing that jumped out was that   it wasn't just the United States  and Iran having the conversation. It was the United States and other nations as a  united front putting pressure on Iran and having   these negotiations. We don't have any of that.  It's not happening. Is President Trump working   with the Europeans to help come up and put the  pressure on Putin that David is talking about? No.   He's on the phone for two hours with President  Putin. For what? What came out of it? Nothing. So, as long as the president decides to go it  alone, his dreams of having some foreign policy   success and certainly a Nobel Peace Prize  will never -- it's never going to happen. GEOFF BENNETT: As we wind up our  conversation, I want to talk, David,   about your column this week, because you  write about the Democrats' big problem,   as you see it, you say they don't understand  that the Trump revolution has upended the   whole political order and that Democrats  need to rethink their entire world view. How existential an issue is this  for the Democrats as you see it? DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I have just  -- all my Democratic friends are   mad at the party leadership. We  need a message. We need a policy. But, to me, that's too small. Sometimes,  historical epochs change. And parties have   to change to deal with it. In 1932, when  FDR started the New Deal, that changed   the historical epoch. And the Republican Party  spent 20 years ignoring that fact and losing,   until Dwight Eisenhower came along and said,  I accept the New Deal, we're going to move on. And, to me, we're in that kind of  historical pivot. It started sometime   in the 2010s. Global populism was on the  rise. Nearly two-thirds of Americans say,   we're in decline. Nearly two-thirds  of Americans say, elites don't get   us. Nearly two-thirds of Americans say,  experts don't care about people like me. This is a populist epoch. And there's  a left-wing version and a right-wing   version. But if the Democrats continue  along the Clinton-Obama-Biden road,   that's just not up to the moment. And so I  think it takes a big rethinking, a new identity,   a new grand narrative, a new definition of what  the biggest problem in the world right now is. And those are all beyond the scope of working  politicians who are trying to fund-raise. GEOFF BENNETT: A big rethinking. I mean, meantime, Democrats have launched a $20  million initiative to figure out -- as you put   your head down lamenting -- $20 million  to figure out how to talk to young men,   the kinds of young men who broke for Donald Trump  in the last election. Is that money well spent? JONATHAN CAPEHART: No, it is not money well spent. (LAUGHTER) JONATHAN CAPEHART: You don't need a think tank to figure out how to talk to young  men. Just go talk to young men. I look at -- before I get into that, one,  I stand by what I have said on the show   many times. The Democrats don't have  a message problem. The Democrats don't   have a narrative problem. The Democrats  don't have a policy problem. I think what   the problem that they have is what David  pointed out in your column. They haven't   quite figured out how to turn all of that  and have it meet the moment that we're in. Democrats are still looking for a savior.  They're looking for that one person to bring   them back to the promised land, instead of  focusing on where we are right now and making   sure that these constituencies understand  that Democrats get what they want to do. And I keep thinking about the candidate for the  Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in Iowa. His   name is Nathan Sage. When you look at his launch  video, you would swear, you look at the guy,   he must be MAGA. You listen to his tone, it's  aggressive, it's focused, it's clear. He must   be MAGA, but he's not. He is a Democrat with a  capital D and he's talking like a real person. If -- the people who are putting that  $20 million into this dumb think tank,   how about taking a look at people like Nathan  Sage and other Democrats around the country   who have gotten the message that they need  to talk like real people about real issues   and talk about what they're going to do about  it? That's already in the Democratic playbook. That's what they need to be doing. GEOFF BENNETT: Lots of Democrats are  going to be Googling Nathan Sage tonight. GEOFF BENNETT: Jonathan Capehart,  David Brooks, my thanks to you both. DAVID BROOKS: Thank you. JONATHAN CAPEHART: Geoff, thanks." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="&gt;&gt; RACHEL. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU RACHEL. THANK YOU. WELL, THE CRISIS FACING THIS COUNTRY AND THE WORLD. TONIGHT IS THE COMPLETE COLLAPSE OF MENTAL. ACUITY IN THE. &gt;&gt; PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. &gt;&gt; THE CURRENT PRESIDENT. THIS WEEKEND, THE PRESIDENT. &gt;&gt; OF THE UNITED STATES ENDORSED. &gt;&gt; A SOCIAL MEDIA POST THAT SAYS THERE IS NO JOE BIDEN EXECUTED IN 2020. BIDEN CLONES, DOUBLES AND ROBOTIC ENGINEERED. &gt;&gt; SOULLESS. &gt;&gt; MINDLESS ENTITIES ARE WHAT YOU SEE. NEEDLESS TO SAY, DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; IS THE ONLY. &gt;&gt; PRESIDENT IN HISTORY. WHO CAN PUBLICLY EMBRACE AND. ACCEPT AND BELIEVE SUCH INSANITY WITHOUT IMMEDIATELY PROVOKING A RUSH OF QUESTIONS BY THE. &gt;&gt; WHITE HOUSE. &gt;&gt; PRESS CORPS AND. NEWS ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE WORLD ABOUT THE SANITY OF THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, WHICH MEANS. THAT THE INSANITY OF THE CURRENT. &gt;&gt; AMERICAN PRESIDENT. &gt;&gt; IS NOW. &gt;&gt; OFFICIALLY TAKEN FOR GRANTED. IN THE NEWS MEDIA. NO HUGE BANNERS. &gt;&gt; OURELY. &gt;&gt; ENGINEER A ROBOTIC. &gt;&gt; SOULLESS, MINDLESS ENTITY TO BE SMARTER. &gt;&gt; THAN DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY. &gt;&gt; OF THE AMERICAN. &gt;&gt; NEWS MEDIA. HAS ABSOLUTELY. &gt;&gt; NO PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; NOW, WITH DONALD TRUMP SAYING. THERE IS. &gt;&gt; NO JOE. &gt;&gt; BIDEN EXECUTED. IN 2020. DONALD TRUMP. &gt;&gt; DIDN'T ACTUALLY WRITE THOSE WORDS. &gt;&gt; HIMSELF, BUT HE FOUND THOSE WORDS IN HIS POISON SOCIAL MEDIA FEED, AND HE DECIDED TO FULLY. &gt;&gt; ENDORSE AND EMBRACE THOSE WORDS. &gt;&gt; THE NEW YORK TIMES REMAINS ONE OF THE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS THAT FINDS THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR IN A PRESIDENT STRANGE. &gt;&gt; THOUGH NOT WORTHY. &gt;&gt; OF BIG FRONT PAGE HEADLINES. AND SO THE NEW YORK. &gt;&gt; TIMES RAN A STORY TITLED. TRUMP AMPLIFIES ANOTHER OUTLANDISH. CONSPIRACY THEORY. BIDEN IS A ROBOTIC. &gt;&gt; CLONE. AND HERE IS THE MOST. &gt;&gt; IMPORTANT LINE IN THAT STORY. &gt;&gt; THE WHITE HOUSE DID NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT. ON THE. &gt;&gt; POST ABOUT MR. BIDEN. &gt;&gt; THAT, OF COURSE, WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR. &gt;&gt; ANY OTHER WHITE HOUSE IF THE PRESIDENT AMPLIFIED. &gt;&gt; QUOTE. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER OUTLANDISH. CONSPIRACY THEORY. IF ANY OTHER PRESIDENT SAID THAT A. &gt;&gt; PREVIOUS LIVING PRESIDENT. &gt;&gt; IS A ROBOTIC. &gt;&gt; CLONE. &gt;&gt; THAT WHITE HOUSE WOULD. &gt;&gt; NOT BE ABLE TO SIMPLY. &gt;&gt; REFUSE TO COMMENT. &gt;&gt; BUT THAT IS HOW FULLY DONALD TRUMP HAS CRUSHED POLITICAL REPORTING AND POLITICAL COVERAGE. &gt;&gt; IN THIS COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE HE HAS CRUSHED IT, HE CAN, IN PUBLICITY TERMS ANYWAY, GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING AND HEITE HOUSE DID NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT ON THE POST ABOUT MR. BIDEN. IF YOU WANT TO RUSH TO DONALD TRUMP'S DEFENSE, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GUESS AT A DEFENSE. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE UP A DEFENSE THAT DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF HAS NOT OFFERED. YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BELIEVE, AS A RESULT OF THAT SINGLE POST ALONE, THAT DONALD TRUMP IS COMPLETELY DERANGED AND HAS NO IDEA WHAT DAY IT IS OR WHAT COUNTRY HE LIVES IN, THAT IS AS DEFENSIBLE A REACTION TO DONALD TRUMP'S POST AS THE NOTION THAT IT'S A JOKE. NEITHER ONE OF THOSE REACTIONS CAN BE PROVED, BUT WHAT IS UNDENIABLE BY ANYONE, ANYWHERE, THE STILL BREATHTAKING STUPIDITY OF DONALD TRUMP TO FIND THAT POST, AND THE POISONOUS FLOW OF HIS SOCIAL MEDIA AND DECIDE THAT THAT'S THE ONE, THAT'S THE ONE HE WANTS TO PUSH THAT DAY. THAT IS A MAN WHOSE STUPIDITY KNOWS NO BOUNDS. THAT IS THE MAN WHOSE STUPIDITY NEVER BUMPS INTO DECENCY, WHICH WOULD THEN PREVENT HIM FROM DOING THE INDECENT, THE STUPID. IN FACT, DONALD TRUMPEN NEVER PARDONED ANYBODY WHO STOLE $200 MILLION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AND JOE BIDEN NEVER APPOINTED ANYONE TO ANYTHING AS INCOMPETENT AND RECKLESS AND CRUEL AS ELON MUSK, WHO BID HIS FAREWELL TO HIS FORMAL ENGAGEMENT OF SERVICE WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ON FRIDAY IN THE OVAL OFFICE, WHERE HIS PHYSICAL BEHAVIOR GAVE MANY INDICATIONS OF POSSIBLY CONFIRMING THE HEADLINE THAT EMERGED IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT VERY DAY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, ELON MUSK JUGGLED DRUGS AND FAMILY DRAMA. WE AWAIT AN EXPLANATION OF ELON MUSK'S PHYSICALITY, INCLUDING HIS INEXPLICABLE GAZES AT THE CEILING AND HEAD TWISTING AT THE CEILING IN THE OVAL OFFICE. THE FOX WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, WHO APPEARED TO BE THE MASTER OF CEREMONIES OF THE PRESS CORPS IN THE OVAL OFFICE ON FRIDAY BECAUSE HE WAS ALLOWED TO ASK MANY MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANYONE ELSE, SEEMS TO BE ON HIS WAY TO ASK ABOUT THE NEW YORK TIMES. BREAKING NEWS ABOUT ELON MUSK'S DRUG USE. &gt;&gt; THERE IS A NEW YORK. &gt;&gt; TIMES REPORT TODAY. &gt;&gt; THAT ACCUSES YOU OF BLURRING. &gt;&gt; THE LINE. &gt;&gt; BETWEEN NEW YORK TIMES. IS THAT THE SAME PUBLICATION? &gt;&gt; NOTICE THAT THE FOX REPORTER IMMEDIATELY STOPPED WHEN ELON MUSK ORDERED HIM TO STOP AND WAIT. ELON MUSK THEN WENT INTO A LYING SOLILOQUY ABOUT THE NEW YORK TIMES, ENDING WITH A DIRECT ORDER TO THE FOX FOX REPORTER, TO QUOTE THESE WERE HIS WORDS MOVE ON, AND THE FOX REPORTER DID EXACTLY WHAT RUPERT MURDOCH IS PAYING HIM TO DO IN THAT SITUATION. HE MOVED ON WHEN ORDERED TO MOVE ON BY ANYONE IN TRUMP WORLD. THAT IS THE SAME FOX REPORTER WHO GLEEFULLY JOINED IN THE SCREAMING AT JOE BIDEN OR HIS PRESS SECRETARY IN THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE. EVERY REPORTER WORKING IN THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE KNEW THEY COULD SCREAM AT JOE BIDEN OR SCREAM AT THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY AND NOT BE KICKED OUT OF THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE PERMANENTLY OR EVER. AND LIKE CHILDREN WHO KNOW THEY WON'T GET IN TROUBLE IF THEY DO IT, THEY DID IT. THEY SCREAMED AT JOE BIDEN AND HIS PRESS SECRETARY. AND LIKE CHILDREN WHO KNOW THEY WILL GET IN TROUBLE IF THEY DO IT, THEY DON'T DARE DO IT NOW, BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HAS CRUSHED ALL OF THAT. AND SO DONALD TRUMP AND ELON MUSK GOT AWAY WITH ANOTHER LYING SESSION WITHOUT ANY SERIOUS CHALLENGE FROM A SINGLE WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, NOT ONE OF WHOM ASKED ELON MUSK HOW IT FELT TO KILL CHILDREN. NOT ONE OF THOSE WHITE HOUSE REPORTERS COVERING ELON MUSK'S FAREWELL FROM GOVERNMENT SERVICE ASKED HIM TO REPLY TO BILL GATES DESCRIPTION OF ELON MUSK AS THE WORLD'S RICHEST MAN, KILLING THE WORLD'S POOREST CHILDREN. THAT IS ELON MUSK'S SINGULAR ACHIEVEMENT IN GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE ELON MUSK DECIDED TO DESTROY THE UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, THE AGENCY THAT WAS FEEDING MORE STARVING CHILDREN IN THE WORLD THAN ANY OTHER AGENCY. MORE STARVING CHILDREN IN THE WORLD DEPENDED ON SURPLUS FOOD FROM THE UNITED STATES TO SURVIVE. FOOD WE DO NOT NEED AND CANNOT CONSUME, FOOD WE HAVE OVERPRODUCED IN THIS COUNTRY. AND ELON MUSK DECIDED TO TAKE THAT FOOD AWAY FROM THEM AND LET THEM DIE. AND THAT IS NOT NEWS TO THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS. NO ONE IS COUNTING BECAUSE ELON MUSK FIRED THE PEOPLE WHO WERE COUNTING, COLLECTING STATISTICS AND ADVANCED ECONOMIES IS RELATIVELY EASY, WITH ADVANCED METHODS RELATIVELY ACCURATE. BUT IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD, THE MOST IMPOVERISHED PARTS OF THE WORLD, STATISTICS CAN BE HARD TO COME BY. NOT EVERY BABY GETS A BIRTH CERTIFICATE. NOT EVERY BABY GETS A DEATH CERTIFICATE. THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE COUNTING HOW MANY PEOPLE ELON MUSK KILLED BY KILLING USAID WERE THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ELON MUSK FIRED FROM USAID. SO ELON MUSK COMMITS THE GREATEST CRIME OF THE 21ST CENTURY AGAINST THE POVERTY POPULATION OF THE WORLD, AND FIRES EVERYONE WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO QUANTIFY FOR US THE ENORMITY OF THE CRIME. THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTS, QUOTE, MR. MUSK, MUSK'S DRUG CONSUMPTION WENT WELL BEYOND OCCASIONAL USE. HE TOLD PEOPLE HE WAS TAKING SO MUCH KETAMINE, A POWERFUL ANESTHETIC, THAT IT WAS AFFECTING HIS BLADDER, A KNOWN EFFECT OF CHRONIC USE. HE TOOK ECSTASY AND PSYCHEDELIC MUSHROOMS, AND HE TRAVELED WITH A DAILY MEDICATION BOX THAT HELD ABOUT 20 PILLS, INCLUDING ONES WITH THE MARKINGS OF THE STIMULANT ADDERALL, ACCORDING TO A PHOTO OF THE BOX AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN IT, HE HAD A WHOLE BOX FULL OF DRUGS THAT HE COULD HAVE BEEN USING WHEN HE WAS TAKING LIFE SAVING DRUGS AWAY FROM CHILDREN. THE NEW YORK TIMES ACCOUNT IS ABOUT THE DRUGS ELON MUSK WAS TAKING DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. NBC NEWS HAS NOT INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED, CONFIRMED THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTING ELON MUSK HAS NOT ACTUALLY DENIED A SINGLE WORD OF THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTING. THE NEW YORK TIMES SAYS, QUOTE, WE PROVIDED MUSK WITH MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO REPLY OR REBUT THIS REPORTING BEFORE PUBLICATION, AND HE DECLINED. THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTING SUGGESTS THAT ELON MUSK TOOK FLIGHT ON A CAMPAIGN STAGE WITH DONALD TRUMP THE FIRST TIME HE WAS UP THERE, BECAUSE HE WAS POSSIBLY ON KETAMINE OR ECSTASY OR ADDERALL OR PSYCHEDELIC MUSHROOMS OR ALL OF THE ABOVE. AT THE SAME TIME. THE TIMES OBTAINED A TEXT MESSAGE BEFORE ELON MUSK JOINED THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, IN WHICH ELON MUSK COMPLAINED ABOUT THE INVESTIGATIONS OF HIS BUSINESSES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS DOING. AT THE TIME. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION VIEWS ME AS THE NUMBER TWO THREAT AFTER TRUMP. I CAN'T BE PRESIDENT, BUT I CAN HELP TRUMP DEFEAT BIDEN AND I WILL, HE ADDED. AND THE REST IS TRAGIC HISTORY. THE RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD POURED MONEY INTO A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, MORE MONEY THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS, AND HE DID IT TO END THE INVESTIGATIONS THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS AIMING AT HIS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. AND, OF COURSE, DONALD TRUMP ENDED THOSE INVESTIGATIONS BECAUSE YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR WITH DONALD TRUMP, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE THE RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD. THE WORLDWIDE CRUELTY CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED BY ELON MUSK AND DONALD TRUMP, NOW INCLUDES DEPORTING PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER COMMITTED A CRIME TO COUNTRIES WHERE THEY HAVE NEVER LIVED AND DO NOT SPEAK THE LANGUAGE. ELON MUSK SEEMS TO BELIEVE THAT CRUELTY IS THE ANTIDOTE TO EMPATHY, WHICH HE CONSIDERS A GREAT HUMAN WEAKNESS. ELON MUSK TOLD THE COMEDIAN JOE ROGAN, QUOTE, THE FUNDAMENTAL WEAKNESS OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION IS EMPATHY. ABRAHAM LINCOLN DID NOT KNOW THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN BELIEVED HE SHOULD GOVERN WITH EMPATHY. SO DID FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT. SO DID MOST PRESIDENTS, SOME BETTER THAN OTHERS. IT WAS EMPATHY, COUPLED WITH GEOPOLITICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH WISDOM, THAT LED PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH TO CREATE THE PRESIDENT'S EMERGENCY PLAN FOR AIDS RELIEF, WHICH SAVED 26 MILLION LIVES IN AFRICA ALONE. BEFORE ELON MUSK DECIDED THOSE LIVES WERE NOT WORTH SAVING. &gt;&gt; HAS ANYONE IN THE WORLD DIED BECAUSE OF WHAT ELON MUSK DID? THE YES OR NO? RECLAIMING MY TIME. IF YOU WON'T ANSWER, THAT'S A LOUD ANSWER. &gt;&gt; NO ONE HAS. &gt;&gt; DIED BECAUSE. &gt;&gt; OF USAID. THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; WHO HAVE DIED. &gt;&gt; AS A RESULT. &gt;&gt; OF CUTTING OFF THE OXYGEN OF A WOMAN IN BURMA AND DENYING HIV. &gt;&gt; AIDS TREATMENT &gt;&gt; ASKING ME QUESTIONS? &gt;&gt; MY JOB IS TO ASK YOU QUESTIONS. &gt;&gt; ONE THAT'S CLAIMING THAT. &gt;&gt; SECRETARY. &gt;&gt; I'M RECLAIMING MY TIME. SECRETARY, I'M RECLAIMING MY CLIENT. THIS IS WHY I'M INTRODUCING THE RUBIO ACT. SO YOU FOCUS ON THE ONE JOB. &gt;&gt; THAT THE. &gt;&gt; SENATE GAVE YOU TO. SERVE AS OUR SECRETARY OF STATE, BECAUSE YOU. ARE CLEARLY DISTRACTED. OKAY. AFTER LAST FEW MONTHS, I UNDERSTAND WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SUCH COLORFUL NICKNAMES FOR YOU. YOU'RE OBEDIENT. YOU'RE FOLLOWING THE RULES. YOU WILL DO ANYTHING THE PRESIDENT TELLS YOU TO DO WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE LAW, THE CONSTITUTION, AMERICA'S SECURITY, OR STANDING AS A LEADER IN THE WORLD. UNLIKE YOU, I DO NOT FEAR CROSSING DONALD TRUMP. I REFUSE TO GIVE UP ON THESE CHILDREN. &gt;&gt; MARCO RUBIO DID NOT TELL THE TRUTH TO THE COMMITTEE, AND THE PROOF THAT HE WAS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH IS THAT HE HAS CHANGED HIS STORY. AFTER THAT TESTIMONY, THE WASHINGTON POST FACT CHECKED MARCO RUBIO'S TESTIMONY, SAYING THERE IS NO DISPUTE THAT PEOPLE HAVE DIED BECAUSE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ABRUPTLY SUSPENDED FOREIGN AID. ONE MIGHT QUIBBLE OVER WHETHER TENS OF THOUSANDS OR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS HAVE DIED. IN HIS TESTIMONY, SECRETARY OF STATE RUBIO TRIED TO CONTRADICT REPORTING FROM AFRICA, FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES, NICHOLAS KRISTOF NICHOLAS KRISTOF RESPONDED TO RUBIO'S TESTIMONY, WRITING IN THE NEW YORK TIMES, LET ME HELP RUBIO WITH THE TRUTH. MEET EVAN ONZA, A FIVE YEAR OLD BOY WHO WAS BORN WITH HIV IN SOUTH SUDAN. I MENTIONED EVAN IN A COLUMN IN MARCH FROM SOUTH SUDAN. THIS WAS A CHILD AS PRECIOUS AS YOURS OR MINE. EVAN'S LIFE WAS IN OUR HANDS, AND FOR FIVE YEARS, AMERICA KEPT HIM ALIVE WITH ANTIRETROVIRAL MEDICINES COSTING LESS THAN $0.12 A DAY THROUGH THE PRESIDENT'S EMERGENCY PLAN FOR AIDS RELIEF, OR PEPFAR. THIS WAS A PROGRAM STARTED BY PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH AND HAS SAVED MORE THAN 26 MILLION LIVES SO FAR, AND IT TURNED THE TIDE OF AIDS AROUND THE WORLD AND BUILT ENORMOUS GOODWILL TOWARD THE UNITED STATES. THEN ALONG CAME PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS FREEZE ON MOST HUMANITARIAN AID IN JANUARY. HOW COULD A FIVE YEAR OLD ORPHAN POSSIBLY OBTAIN MEDICINE ON HIS OWN? EVAN WEAKENED AND SOON DIED OF AN OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTION, MARCO RUBIO TOLD THE HOUSE COMMITTEE. NO CHILDREN ARE DYING ON MY WATCH. EVAN DIED ON HIS WATCH. EVAN'S, OF ALL AGES ARE DYING ON MARCO RUBIO'S WATCH, AND NO ONE IS COUNTING. AND SO WE DON'T KNOW AS OF TONIGHT WHETHER IT'S TENS OF THOUSANDS OR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF EVAN'S, BUT WE KNOW IT WILL BE. IN A NEW YORK TIMES COLUMN TITLED, QUOTE, ELON MUSK'S LEGACY IS DISEASE, STARVATION AND DEATH. MICHELLE GOLDBERG REPORTS. BROOKE NICHOLS, AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF GLOBAL HEALTH AT BOSTON UNIVERSITY, HAS ESTIMATED THAT THESE CUTS HAVE ALREADY RESULTED IN ABOUT 300,000 DEATHS, MOST OF THEM OF CHILDREN, AND WILL MOST LIKELY LEAD TO SIGNIFICANTLY MORE BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THIS IS WHAT MUSK'S FORAY INTO POLITICS ACCOMPLISHED. IF THERE WERE JUSTICE IN THE WORLD, MUSK WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO REPAIR HIS REPUTATION, AT LEAST NOT WITHOUT DEVOTING THE BULK OF HIS FORTUNE TO EASING THE MISERY HE'S ENGENDERED. MUSK'S SOJOURN IN GOVERNMENT HAS REVEALED SEVERE FLAWS IN HIS CHARACTER A BLITHE, DEHUMANIZING CRUELTY AND A DEADLY INCURIOSITY. BILL GATES HAS SEEN STARVING CHILDREN IN AFRICA MANY, MANY TIMES AND HAS DEVOTED HIS LIFE AND HIS BILLIONS TO TRYING TO SAVE THEM, WHICH MAKES BILL GATES VERDICT ON THE CURRENT RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD SO IMPORTANT AND POWERFUL. BILL GATES, THE FORMER RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD, SAID THE PICTURE OF THE WORLD'S RICHEST MAN KILLING THE WORLD'S POOREST CHILDREN IS NOT A PRETTY ONE, AND THE PICTURE OF THE RICHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD CARRYING AROUND HIS DRUG BOX OF ECSTASY, ADDERALL, PSYCHEDELIC MUSHROOMS AND THEN TAKING LIFE SAVING DRUGS AWAY FROM THE POOREST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD IS A PICTURE ONLY DONALD TRUMP COULD HAVE CREATED. AND WITH ELON MUSK AND DONALD TRUMP, SOULLESS, MINDLESS ENTITIES" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="Donald Trump’s sudden shift on Ukraine has come as a massive shock to most countries in America’s orbit. European leaders who have long banked their national security on US military protection are beginning to lose confidence in their most powerful ally. Last month the new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz declared that his priority was to &quot;strengthen Europe&quot; and become independent of the US and other Europe countries are following suit. But there is one American ally that has been planning for this potential eventuality for decades. &#10;&#10;France has long been sceptical of how much America can be trusted and now they may be the only safe refuge for countries looking for new security guarantees. So how did they see this about-face coming? And what capacity does Paris have to be the new security guarantor for global democracy?&#10;&#10;Watch all episodes of If You're Listening - in our playlist here:    • If You're Listening | ABC News In-depth  &#10;&#10;Subscribe: https://ab.co/3yqPOZ5&#10;&#10;Welcome to ABC News In-depth, where you'll find our long-form journalism and other videos to help you understand what's going on in the world around you.&#10;&#10;Watch more ABC News content ad-free on ABC iview: https://ab.co/2OB7Mk1&#10;&#10;For more from ABC News, click here: https://ab.co/2kxYCZY&#10;&#10;Get breaking news and livestreams from our ABC News channel:    / newsonabc  &#10;Like ABC News on Facebook:   / abcnews.au  &#10;Follow ABC News on Instagram:   / abcnews_au  &#10;Follow ABC News on Twitter:   / abcnews  &#10;&#10;Note: In most cases, our captions are auto-generated.&#10;&#10;#ABCNewsIndepth #ABCNewsAustralia" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="one of the things that sucks about election night coverage pretty much everywhere is this bit so we should be hearing from the prime minister uh pretty soon obviously we're still waiting to hear from Kla Harris it's the bit where the result seems pretty clear but you've got to wait around for ages until the leaders do their speeches and we're waiting to see John Trump appear himself and that's obviously what the crowd there are waiting to see well this bit doesn't happen in Germany all this waiting around is way too inefficient for the Germans they bring all the party leaders into one room at 8:00 on election night and make them answer questions about the race good good to everyone when this chat was underway during the election just last month it was pretty clear that opposition leader Friedrich Mertz was going to be the next chancellor and he decided to start his transition into office with a bang [Music] absolute he says &quot;My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that step by step we can really achieve independence from the USA it's clear that the Trump administration is largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.&quot; People were stunned usually a German leader needs to be at least three schnaps deep before they start heckling their most important security partner but Germany could no longer afford to ignore Trump's actions since taking office forcing Ukraine to agree to a ceasefire threatening to annex Greenland and saying that US allies have to pay up if they want US protection no I won't protect if you're not paying uh if you're delinquent or if the money isn't paid uh why would we do that one person who would not have been surprised at all by what Trump is doing is the French statesman Shal de Gaulle the dominant figure in 20th century French politics de Gaul thought it was only a matter of time before America would become as the chancellor says indifferent to the fate of Europe now America's allies are calling France and asking two questions one how did you see this coming and two can you protect us from a rising Russia and China if America won't i'm interested in finding answers to these questions too i'm Matt Beavenon and this is if you're listening this is the sound of desperation it was mid 1940 and German forces were at the gates of Paris and the French Prime Minister Paul Reo took to the airwaves to beg America for help he had already failed in his attempt to get the US to join the war against Germany and now he was begging for a cloud of planes to be sent to stop the Nazis planes had been promised but they weren't ready in time america would not save France the following day on the same frequency where the prime minister had begged for help the French national anthem laes played for the last time [Applause] you can hear attempts by the Germans to block the frequency with their own broadcasts paris had fallen france would surrender within [Music] days shortly afterwards though there was a new French voice on the airwaves broadcast from England the voice was unfamiliar even to most French people it belonged to General Shal de Gaul a minor cabinet official who had flown to London rather than surrender declared &quot;I am France,&quot; and urged people at home to form a resistance against Nazi occupation initially the Americans ignored him but he made that very difficult to do he was an imposing figure 6'5 with the physique of an asparagus and he wouldn't take no for an answer general Dal leader of the free French forces inspects French naval vessels now in English ports and soon to go into action against the Axis eventually he was accepted by the allies as the leader of the French resistance and joined the allies in liberating France i take this opportunity to thank the American people for the wonderful effort they have made to win this war like many French people D Gaul did not like speaking English but to rally support for France he would do anything today us in 1918 your American boys are fighting side by side with the French soldiers this kind of speech makes you think that de Gaulle was a big fan of the Americans together we are marching on the road to Berlin to Tokyo to a final victory but he wasn't it's not that he was anti-American he just didn't trust them he never forgot their lack of response to the plea for help in 1940 [Music] looked very different and America had a new president paris in the spring of 1961 at the time of President Kennedy's visit was as beautiful as ever de Gaul was now president of France but he hadn't changed at all he was still stubborn proud very tall and skeptical of American leaders it was John F kennedy's first overseas trip as president and it was off to a great start two million people gathered on the streets of Paris mainly to see the glamorous French-speaking American first lady i do not think it altogether inappropriate to introduce myself to this audience i am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris and I've enjoyed it but it wasn't all fun and parades for President Kennedy he had 7 hours of meetings scheduled with de Gaulle and they were not expected to be easy after all the two had many pressing issues to discuss the attention of an anxious world is focused on East and West Germany and Berlin the Soviet Union was consolidating its military position in communist East Germany and De Gaul wanted to know what would happen if they sent their forces into democratic West Germany france West Germany and the US were all members of the NATO alliance which meant that if one was attacked by the Russians all of them would retaliate together but de Gaulle was skeptical would Russian troops on Allied territory be enough to trigger a nuclear response from Washington if Soviet troops marched all the way up to the Ryan River the border with France would Moscow be flattened by an American bomb de Gaul thought it should be he thought that Soviet troops on the bank of the Rine was an existential threat to France but he thought that at the critical moment Kennedy would chickenen out &quot;the Rine is much narrower than the Atlantic,&quot; said De Gaul &quot;this was basically de Gaulle's position on the entire Western Alliance the Americans talked a big game but if push came to shove they'd abandon Europe and focus on their own problems.&quot; France has suggested that the US might no longer be willing to meet its commitments in Europe mr kennedy pledged that the US will remain in Europe as long as desired or required kennedy assured to Gaul that the US would always defend Europe as if it was part of America we cannot fail these commitments we cannot surrender the freedom of these people for whom we are responsible he went all the way to Germany and declared all free men wherever they may live are citizens of Berlin and therefore as a free man I take pride in the words binina [Applause] but de Gaul was never convinced after all he knew what happened last time the French begged for America's help when you're convinced that America is going to leave you high and dry again there's really only one thing you can do france developed atomic weapons undergo and he insisted on her right to be an independent nuclear power to build nuclear submarines and maintain a fleet of bombers while other European nations were reliant on the US for much of their military technology France spent an enormous amount developing its own force defra which is a military thing and not an ice coffee military independence was stressed when withdrew from NATO de Gaul was so confident in France's military capacity that he demanded that all foreign troops including Americans leave French soil the US Secretary of State asked him if that included all the Americans buried in French military cemeteries after dying to liberate De Gaul's country the Americans decided just to wait for De Gaul to die which he did in 1970 in 2017 incoming French President Emanuel Macron had his official portrait taken in his office as they prepared to take the photo he turned to the desk and grabbed a book opening it to a specific page and laying it on the desk so that it would be by his right hand in the picture pretty unoriginal thing to do arranging relevant books on your desk to make a point about what you're talking about but anyway it's fair to say that Macron hasn't moved on from De Gaul the book was Shaul's memoir and he was placing it on Shaul's desk we want to be open we want allies we want good friends we want partners but we always want to be in a situation to choose them not to be 100 person dependent on them macron wants to be able to choose France's partners not be dependent on them of all of America's partners one country has an almost opposite approach to France america has no better friend anywhere in the world than Australia australia signed up to the US defense subscription service at the end of World War II and has never missed a payment buying American weapons helping their spy agencies sending soldiers to fight alongside them in distant war zones but much like you used to only need one streaming subscription to watch everything and now you need like five Australia started shopping around this is the largest and most ambitious military project in Australia's history and it is a matter of great moment a deal struck with France to provide Australia with a fleet of submarines a dozen submarines known as the attack class to be built over decades with a $50 billion price tag the deal made perfect logical sense if your aim was to buy submarines to protect the Australian coastline the submarines would be diesel electric meaning they run on batteries which are charged every few days by a diesel generator which needs refueling every few months they are perfect for patrolling the continent that their home base is on meaning they're perfect for defending Australia and yet 2 years after the contract was signed the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison was saying this to President Macron i made it very clear that a conventional diesel-powered submarine was not going to meet Australia's strategic requirements in 2021 Australia tore up the contract with the French government and announced that it would be entering a new one with the UK and the famously stable and reliable US as part of an alliance called Orcus thank you Boris and and I want to thank uh that fellow down under thank you very much pal for the French this was yet another betrayal by the Anglo president Macron accused that fellow down under of lying to him do you think he lied to you i don't think I know despite Australian claims that the submarines were no good or that they were going to go way over budget there wasn't anything actually wrong with the French subs there was no cost blowout they have been terminated because our requirements have changed so Australia's requirements just changed like when I bought a five seat car before finding out that our third kid was twins and we would actually be needing six seats so now instead of needing diesel electric submarines to defend our coastline we apparently now needed nuclearpowered submarines which are capable of operating anywhere in the world staying underwater for months and only need refueling every 25 years submersion ship dive I dive dive instead of paying $7 billion per sub we were now going to be paying up to $46 billion per sub it's like replacing a ferry with an ocean liner it's massive overkill it makes no sense at all unless you look at it from an American perspective i think particularly for the United States their aim in in making this really significant gesture from their point of view of giving us access to this very sensitive technology is to enhance our capacity to support them in a war with China this wasn't really about submarines at all it was about upgrading our standard US defense subscription to the premium package someone threatens Australia well they're our partner saddle up cowboys we're going to go and help them out we have now strategically moved firmly back to our traditional western alliance partners how do you like them palms de Gaulle almost from the very beginning though there were some questions about whether or not this was a good idea but then putting the orcs in orcus be discussing Orcus with the prime minister sir what does that mean orcus the Australia US defense alliance yeah well we'll be discussing that as President Trump was making clear that he didn't know what our $300 billion Orcus partnership was the Chinese Navy started circumnavigating Australia you know just to show that they could they're testing us as US allies they're testing the prime minister and then well Trump abandoned Ukraine see our last episode h what's that noise this is Sha de Gaul singing by the way the guy apparently loved a singalong of La Masay six decades after Shald was the thorn in America's side because he was convinced that they would abandon Europe it now seems like America might be abandoning Europe can no talking while the US president hasn't officially torn up any global alliances yet everyone who relies on the US is in a panic and looking for someone else to protect them in early March this year Emanuel Macron who sadly does not love leading singalongs addressed the French [Music] people he said that thanks to choices made by his predecessors de Gaulle France has a special status with Europe's most effective military and its own independent nuclear deterrent he said after a request from the incoming German Chancellor Frederick Mertz he was opening a discussion about France protecting its European allies with its nuclear capabilities he said &quot;I want to believe that the United States will remain at our side but we must be ready if this is not the case.&quot; Viva Republic Viva France and other European powers have followed suit announcing that they will be dramatically increasing their defense spending meanwhile in Australia defense and security experts are recommending that we might need to find alternative sources of submarines because they're concerned those Orca subs may never arrive much like the cloud of planes never arrived in France in 1940 america is back thank you so much even if Trump never officially abandons these defense arrangements the ironclad confidence that America's friends had in their alliance with the US is gone and it will take a long time to build back up in the meantime the countries that currently rely on the American nuclear deterrent like Japan South Korea and Germany are seriously considering acquiring their own nuclear weapons this is all while Donald Trump says that he wants to talk to Russia and China about decreasing the global number of nuclear weapons we were talking about dnuking dnuclearize dnuking and uh President Putin and I agreed that we were going to do it in a very big way a lot of US allies are concerned that they've made a terrible mistake in putting their trust in America does France think that we've made a mistake i don't think I know so does anyone have the uh the number for that French submarine company [Music] [Applause]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="it started at 1:46 p.m. with a tweet US President Joe Biden announcing he is quitting the presidential race Joe Biden sent the tweet from his beach house in Delaware where he was isolating with Co for months he had been angrily swatting down questions about whether he was up to the challenge of beating Donald Trump in the November election with each call for him to stand down met with increasing levels of White House rage but Co ATT terrible debate and some catastrophic looking poll numbers were the final straws as he sent his withdrawal tweet the action began at the Naval Observatory the residence of the vice president Kamala Harris just 1 minute after Joe Biden's tweet she was on the phone drumming up support she kept dialing Congressional leaders fundraisers friends Rivals she called them all at 2:13 p.m. Joe Biden endorsed her as his successor on the ticket at 4:48 p.m. the paperwork was filed converting the Biden campaign into the Harris campaign and she kept dialing averaging one call every 6 minutes for 10 hours she told each person I wasn't going to let this day go by without you hearing from me by the following afternoon her campaign had reportedly raised $81 million in donations a record amount in one day by the time Joe Biden gave his actual resignation addressed to the nation Kamala Harris was in the clear endorsed by not only the president but all of her potential Rivals for the nomination as well this is extraordinary for many reasons not least the fact that in the last two presidential election Cycles there has been a bitter War over who will be the Party's candidate with sometimes more than two dozen people in the running but not this time and there's a good reason for that see a situation a lot like this has happened before 56 years ago after a late announcement from the president that he wasn't running for reelection the statement on his own future came as a complete surprise even to his Close Associates the Democratic party launched into a bitter Civil War a catastrophic error that threw the party Into the Wilderness for more than two decades today the tale Democrats tell each other instead of ghost stories around a campfire the story of 196 68 and why if they want to beat Donald Trump they can't let it happen again I'm Matt Bon and this is if you're listening so don't worry about it come on secrets are hard to keep in presidential politics but president Lynden Baines Johnson had a big one and he managed to keep it for years only he his wife and four aids knew the secret on the 31st of March 1968 he was about to reveal it and tell waled I saw him and thought he was very good today at 2:00 in the afternoon he was in the White House rehearsing for TV address a cut out this a here the teleprompter which at this point consisted of a scroll of paper a little winch and a mirror bolted to the front of a camera had 40 minutes of text on it but no ending gosh this is hard to read J you have no idea as he read through the text asking for changes here and there he didn't seem too stressed he was coughing and snorting though he had one of his very frequent CS he finished the rehearsal and went off to get ready good night at half 7 his press secretary arrived with five pages to be typed onto the end of the prompter scroll the five pages of text had been sitting in the president's pocket for weeks he'd had them on him during the State of the Union Address but decided at the last minute not to use them as the final page was typed onto the prompter a White House Aid opened his mouth in shock his pipe which had been in his mouth at the time fell to the floor Johnson was not running for reelection he and his wife had decided this 4 years earlier Johnson was only 59 but he'd had a massive heart attack when he was 46 at the time there were fears that he would not recover it was at this time that he gave up smoking while he managed to give up his three pack a day habit his health had been bad for years and then he became the president Mr Johnson and taking over from the assassinated President Kennedy on November 23rd 1963 began his reign with the overwhelming support of the American people in the Congress the stress of the presidency only made his health worse President Johnson has had a series of gallbladder and kidney troubles he and his wife lady bird made a PCT he'd run for re-election in 1964 but not in 1968 it wasn't a hard promise to keep despite outnumbering their Enemy by 3 to1 and with vastly more advanced technology the US and their allies were losing the Vietnam War many Americans were refusing to be drafted and many more wanted him to bring the troops home this chart shows the huge slide in popularity more and more Americans have become cynical about the nature of his leadership and his personal sincerity as a man so after his 40-minute speech on the state of the war in Vietnam incidentally the first ever live satellite broadcast scene in Australia he told the world that he was done I shall not seat and I will not accept the nomination of my party for another term as your president LBJ had kept his cards close to his chest nobody had seen it coming the election was 6 months away and the other side already had a presumptive candidate Richard Nixon let's win it for America and for those who want peace and freedom in the world let's go polling indicated it was a tight race but Johnson was losing support from inside of his own party this should feel uncomfortably familiar at this stage it's almost exactly the situation the Democrats are in now except on a much shorter timeline on the 23rd of August 1968 a pig was arrested by police in Chicago a black and brown pig named pigasus a crowd of anti-war protesters had gathered in downtown Chicago to nominate pigasus as their candidate for US president and if you're going to nominate a pig to be the president Chicago is the place to do it the Chicago Union Stockyards was both the home of the 1968 Democratic National Convention and the Beating Heart of the American Meat industry at its peak it could Slaughter 160,000 Hogs and 24,000 cattle a day 80% of America's meat came from the yard the Democratic party's convention was set to be held in the Stockyards Amphitheater in amongst the avatars but nominating a pig to be president in a mock party convention that's not the kind of nonsense that was allowed in mayor Richard J Daly's Town Police seized the pig and arrested about 10 of the yippies on charges of breach of the Peace Chicago had seen multiple riots and protests in in the leadup to the convention and mayor Daly a tough non-nonsense Irish Catholic Democratic party power broker had ordered the police to shoot to kill any arsonist or anyone with a Molotov cocktail in their hand in Chicago to fire a building because they potential murderers and to shoot to main or [ __ ] anyone looting any stores in our city Chicago was kind of a mess strikes protests riots but mayor Daly insisted he could still host the Democratic party's convention successfully we will not permit anyone to create disturbances and to create riots in our city usually the national conventions are merely a formality the party decides who their presidential candidate will be through the primary voting process primaries are an American peculiarity the booby trapped obstacle course over which people who want to become president of the United States must run I'm not going to go into how it all works because it's complicated and it's changed a lot since 1968 but basically both regular Rank and file members and top party officials get a say in who the nominee is the convention is basically a coronation ceremony to give the candidate a final boost into the home stretch to election day but by pulling out of the race in March Midway through the primary process President Johnson had started a free-for-all for many many their favorite prospective candidate was John F Kennedy's little brother Bobby so far at least Bobby Kennedy's bandwagoning seems to have struck the right notes will the glib speech and teeny boa hairstyle be enough to handle the presidential campaign but Bobby Kennedy had been assassinated just as his campaign started Gathering serious momentum so RFK is dead LBJ isn't running who's next Senator McCarthy of Minnesota is trying to defeat him he has given no chance at all Senator Eugene McCarthy prickly bitter fiercely anti-war had won the popular vote in the primaries after Bobby Kennedy's death but he almost certainly wasn't going to be the nominee LBJ had decided who he wanted to win and it wasn't going to be the guy who had been calling him a war criminal he was backing his own vice president Hubert horao Humphrey Jr as his successor a man who sounds like a Simpsons car chore of an Old Tommy politician let's just talk just a few moments about this grand old politics promise them anything but forget it in Congress he ran an old timey campaign with old timey entertainment at his fundraisers wasn't it fun wasn't it great wasn't it marvelous entertainment the kind of fun the Democrats like and he said weird old timey things like this and if any of you in this room are delegates and haven't made up your mind I wanted you to know that these young ladies up here will be talking to you about support for Hubert Humphrey Humphrey didn't even enter the primary voting process instead he was counting on support from the party heavyweights once the convention got going it's a bit like an election for school Captain sure the kids get a vote but the teachers actually get to decide who wins and President Johnson was like the principal Humphrey was the principal's favorite and all the teachers liked him too McCarthy didn't really have a chance but as the party officials arrived things were very very tense you Fells are all good football players to make sure the proceedings weren't disturbed by anti-war protesters mayor Daly had pulled out all the stops he built bwire fences put the cops on 12-hour shifts deployed the National Guard and covered sewer grates with tar to stop protesters popping up like Oscar the Grouch and so on August 26th 1968 in a fortress surrounded by slaughter houses the Democratic Convention began Chicago Illinois the convention of the democratic party nominating tonight its candidate for the presidency Hubert Humphrey was nervous while the delegates were theoretically his they could choose to vote for someone else but mayor Daly and President Johnson had Humphrey's back the convention was set up with Humphrey supporters closest to the podium to shout out supportive stuff like this to the next president of the United States Hubert H their microphones were turned up louder when other candidates delegates tried to interrupt proceedings they were shouted down Wisconsin is not recognized for that purpose and mayor Daly himself ran around the convention hall as stage manager trying to overwhelm the chaos with his own personal form of chaos outside the anti-war protesters were angry tens of thousands of hippies yippies yappies flower children Etc set up camps in Chicago's Parks unable to get close to the amphitheater the whole world is watching camps on the side they clashed with police outside the Hilton Hotel where most of the delegates and media were staying the air was thick with tear gas and stink bombs inside the convention the air was thick with tobacco smoke from thousands of angry delegates horrified at what may Daily's police were doing to the protesters outside and with George McGovern's president of the United States we wouldn't have to have Gusto's tactics in the streets of Chicago mayor daily sat inside the Convention as leftwing delegates accused him of allowing police brutality how hard it is to accept the truth Humphrey knowing that most Democrats were against the war wanted to include a promise for peace talks with the vet Kong in the party's platform Johnson refused to let him punch on began on the floor take your hands off of me unless you plan to arrest me wait a minute wait a minute water as you can see CBS news reporter Dan rathera got punched in the stomach while reporting I'm sorry to be out of breath but somebody Bel him in his stomach doing that I think we've got a bunch of thugs here Dan outside the Hilton Hotel a shocking battle took place between police and protesters as the news cameras were rolling the convention finally ended with miraculously no fatalities but hundreds of people were arrested and wounded Hubert Humphrey was confirmed as the Democratic Party's candidate but he now led a party that was hopelessly divided he went on to be defeated by Richard Nixon in the election in November the Democrats would lose four of the next five presidential elections the current situation with the Democrats is staggeringly similar President Biden forced out by health concerns like Johnson has left the race too late to hold an Open Primary process to find a candidate he like Johnson wants the party to nominate his vice president Kamala Harris to be the candidate the rank and file Democratic party supporters and members will not get a say on who the candidate is there's also a time in a place for new voices fresh voices yes younger voices and that time and place is now the Biden Harris Administration ation support for one side of a foreign war not in Vietnam but in Gaza is a hot button issue Israel has a right to defend itself and how it does so matters the party's convention is even being held in Chicago as well also in late August though thankfully not amongst those slaughter houses their opponents Trump and Nixon are similar too though Nixon had yet to get to the committing potential crimes to steal an ction game the Democrats can't afford to repeat the violence and bitterness of the 1968 convention though so despite the fact that there is a whole s of ambitious potential presidents waiting in the wings the party is coalescing as quickly as possible around kamla Harris and with only 100 days to go and the memory of 1968 haunting their nightmares they really have no other choice Mr Democrat behind inat [Music] allat all" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="Microchips run everything and the  best microchips are made by TSMC.  The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.  TSMC chips have put Western tech companies, and   militaries, streets ahead of China, and China  is not happy about it. TSMC is so important,   the world could go to war over it. I'm Matt Bevin and this is If You're Listening. TSMC's story starts in 1958  in, where else but, Dallas Texas. [Music]27 year old Morris Chang was  at work a microchip Factory belonging to Texas   Instruments. it's a company that made AM radios and  calculators and gear for the US oil industry, hence   Texas, and Morris had a problem. See the  factory was supposed to make microchips   to go in their products and it wasn't. See  microchips are incredibly difficult to make.   The process of manufacturing a microchip is so  complex and intricate it's hard to believe it  was ever developed. At the factory Morris was working in almost none of the chips they were   making were working correctly. Morris Chang was  a Harvard educated engineer. He fled from China   as a teen. He had worked hard to get where  he was and now it was time to prove himself.   He started fiddling with the factory settings  for how they made microchips - turned down the   temperature here, increased the pressure there,  combining these chemicals with those ones.   Within weeks the Factory's yield was  up to 20 percent and then 30 percent.   His bosses noticed how successful he'd been  and started promoting him. Texas Instruments   paid for him to get his PhD. They gave  him bigger and bigger responsibilities.   He was apparently a pretty tough boss. He had a short temper and getting screamed at by him became a bit of a   rite of passage at Texas Instruments. He was also famous for  the fact he was almost constantly smoking a pipe.   On top of electrical engineering he's one of  the world's best players of the card game Bridge.   Morris is just one of those guys who seems to  be really good at anything he puts his mind to.   Ten years later Texas Instruments was  doing so well they were looking to set   up more factories in other countries, so Morris  Chang and a colleague went on a tour of Asia. His colleague's name was Mark Shepard. The son  of a Dallas cop, he looks like an AI generated   generic Texas businessman. They made a stop in  the Taiwanese capital.   [DOCUMENTARY] Taipei the capital is a modern city with many Western habits including the mini skirt and a fear and hatred of communism.   Neither Morris nor Mark had ever been to Taiwan  before. Mark Sheppard made that abundantly clear by   throwing a tantrum in a Taipei restaurant after  he was served a steak with soy sauce instead   of barbecue sauce. Didn't they know he was from  Texas? Later, Mark and Morris met with Katie Lee - sorry,   Mark and Morris met with K T Lee, a minister from  the Taiwanese military dictatorship government,   and the meeting didn't go well at all. Minister Lee  accused the Texan of being an American imperialist,   which you know he was, but you don't just say that.  They all left in a big huff, but Morris managed to   convince both men it was in their best interests  to make a deal. For Texas Instruments, Taiwan was a   great place to get some cheap workers, and for  Taiwan building microchips for America might   provide protection against communist China. The  United States tends to try and defend places they trade with. [DOCUMENTARY] The move now in Taiwan's industry  is up market into higher technology.    Foreign investment and foreign technology are welcome. [MATT] And so the first microchip Factory in Taiwan was built.   Morris resumed his work back in Texas and  it was here that he gradually developed   an idea that would change the course of  his life and the future of the world. You see, just like Texas Instruments, all the  tech companies around at the time were expending   enormous amounts of time and effort figuring  out how to run good in-house microchip factories.   Morris Chang thought that was silly.  Microchips are probably the hardest   thing in the world to manufacture. They require  unbelievably complicated and expensive machines   running in the cleanest environment on Earth.  You see a microchip is a circuit board like   the green ones you've seen in pretty much  everything electrical, except    [DOCUMENTARY] ... the electronic circuits simply cannot be seen by the naked eye. [MATT] Back here on my shelf I've got an old 1950s ... hang on ... I've got an old 1950s microphone  amplifier. if I open it up you can see   it has about 60 transistors, little electronic  switches welded by hand onto a circuit board about   the size of a block of chocolate. If you were to  make a microchip of the type that's in your phone   or laptop in the same way you'd need a circuit  board about the size of an International Airport.   That's how incredible today's modern chips  are. The secret to how special they are is   that we can make them very, very small. To make  a microchip you need to use a laser to print   billions of transistors and connections onto a  thing the size of a thumbnail. [DOCUMENTARY] The circuits are a series of elaborate patterns etched into the surface of the silicon, layer by layer.   [MATT] You see? Super hard to make. Morris thought  all the tech companies should focus on   designing the microchips and outsource the actual  manufacture to a company that specializes in it.   It's like if everyone in town was trying  to learn how to do their own dentistry,   instead of just outsourcing it to an expert dentist. The results would be quite [PERSON SQUEALING] unpleasant. Morris suggested this to Texas Instruments over and over but they never budged.    Morris rage quit. [CARTOON RANTING] In the early 80s, years on from their first meeting in Taipei, the Taiwanese Economy Minister K T Lee gave Morris Chang another call. While Mark Sheppard may have put Morris out to pasture K T Lee saw him as the future. He made  Morris an offer. K T Lee was offering   him a blank check to build a company that would  make Taiwan the microchip capital of the world.   Make Taiwan the dentist, the place that all the  tech companies go to get their chips made. The Taiwanese government put in half the money. They  bullied wealthy Taiwanese businessmen to chip in too.   The plan wasn't to design a perfect microchip.  They were going to design the perfect microchip  factory. [PROMOTIONAL VIDEO] TSMC pioneered the dedicated semiconductor foundry business model. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was born with Morris Chang at its head. 40 years on from when it was founded, TSMCis making the smallest chips in the world and the labs they're made in are incredibly high tech.   Earlier this year the ABC's East Asia  correspondent Bill Birtles struggled   a bit with all the protocols for getting into a  Taiwanese microchip lab. [BILL BIRTLES] So you sort of step into it ... like a onesie. It's quite a process just  getting into one of these labs. [EXASPERATED SIGH] [LAUGHTER] [MATT] He put on a hat, gloves, special shoes and  got into an airlock where jets of air blew   off any particles that may have got stuck  on his clothing. The worry wasn't that he   would catch something from inside and bring it  out, the worry was he would bring something in.   [DOCUMENTARY] it looks more like a hospital than a factory  because a single speck of dust can ruin a chip. They are in fact cleaner than a surgical theatre.  Even the machines are specially made so that   they don't shed particles. Having dust specs in a  microchip factory is like having rhinos running   around in a car factory. These transistors  and connections are barely wider than atoms   and in the chip world, smaller means not only  that they take up less space but also it makes   them more energy efficient and more powerful and  TSMC can make these tiny chips more quickly than   anyone else. It's the most valuable company in  Asia and last year was the eighth-most valuable   company in the world. It's responsible for five percent of Taiwan's GDP and seven percent of its electricity consumption. [NEWS STORY] TSMC pumps out close to 60 percent of the semiconductor chips used around   the world and makes 90 of the most advanced ones. [MATT] it's kind of an extraordinary situation. You've got a resource that's needed for basically everything in the modern world all coming from one place, [NEWS STORY] ... making it the most valuable and  indispensable chip company in the world. TSMC is so essential to the global economy that Taiwanese  media calls it the &quot;sacred mountain&quot; protecting the   island from Invasion by communist China. But is it  actually protecting them or is it a giant target?   Let me tell you a little story. Centuries ago  a cluster of 11 small islands in Indonesia was   the world's only source of the spice nutmeg. Nutmeg  could be used not only for flavour but to preserve   meat and Europeans thought that it could also cure  diseases. it was worth more than its weight in gold.   That was fine for a while, but eventually the Dutch  decided that instead of buying it from Silk Road   Traders they would invade the islands, kill almost  everyone there and take the nutmeg for themselves.   Now imagine you were relying on the  Silk Road Traders. What happens if your   precious nutmeg falls into the wrong  hands? Taiwan? They've got the nutmeg, and China wants it. And tension is increasing between mainland China and Taiwan. Beijing has conducted massive military exercises close to the  island, raising fears that Chinese President Xi Jinping will fulfil his promise to take control  of Taiwan either with an invasion, or with blockade. To try and get around that the U.S, Germany and  Japan have convinced TSMC to start construction   on factories in their countries to ensure  the supply of chips to the U.S and its allies.   Just last year Donald Trump's former National  Security Adviser Robert O'Brien appeared at an   event for the Council on Foreign Relations. ROBERT O'BRIEN] I think the TSMC situation is a little provocative for China right now and doesn't provide security. In fact it counter-intuitively lessens the security of Taiwan. [MATT] He's saying that China does not like that Taiwan has such a precious resource and that it's provoking China to attack. O'Brien then said that Winston Churchill decided to sink the French Fleet rather than allow the Germans to capture it during World War II. So if China invaded Taiwan he suggested that the U.S should follow Churchill's example to stop Xi Jinping taking control of the TSMC factories. [O'BRIEN] Can we allow the you know  the equivalent of the Germans taking   the French Fleet, uh Churchill didn't allow  that. Could we allow that? [MATT[ Robert O'Brien's statement made headlines in Taiwan. He tried to clarify it saying that he didn't think that the   U.S should promise to blow up TSMC if China tried  to invade, but clearly some in America are afraid.   The ramifications of letting China take over that  company could be massive. They would control one of   the world's most valuable resources. America's fear  is that they could stop selling us the chips if   they liked or sell them at such high prices that it  makes non-Chinese companies unprofitable. After all,   it's happened before. That's what the Dutch did  with the nutmeg once they seized those islands.   In 2022 the world's most successful investor,  92 year old Warren Buffett, bought more than   four billion dollars in TSMC shares and then  in 2023 he sold them all at a loss. He said he   didn't like the company's location. He said the  risk of confrontation with China was too great.   Morris Chang is not afraid of a Chinese  invasion. He is now also 92. He retired   as CEO of the company he built in 2018, but still  appears at public events. He can't smoke his pipe   anymore, but he still plays Bridge, something  else he has in common with Warren Buffett.   The two men talk a lot about how much the  game has in common with business,   but as for TSMC it remains to be seen which  of the two has made the right bid [Music]   G'day Matt here.

country's president Ilan alv this Dam can provide very safe transit for goods for passengers and tourists given how seriously the work is being carried out I think it will take less time than originally estimated which was almost 3 years then report began to emerge that the president's helicopter had to make what was referred to as a hard Landing that there had been an incident finally it was confirmed the aircraft had crashed in bad weather on board president RI foreign minister Hussein Amir abdulian a provincial governor and their security details the helicopter went down in a forest in a remote mountainous region near the village of Uzi in the east asab Province a third of Iran's armed forces and more than 70 search and rescue teams sprang into action with Turkish Hightech night vision drones providing support from the sky but Darkness thick fog and the rugged terrain hampered search operations across the country from tan to the president's hometown of mashad Iranians came out to pray nearly 20 hours after the helicopter disappeared from radar the wreckage was discovered State television delivered this message to the nation the hardworking and Relentless president of the Iranian people who did nothing but serve the people on their way towards progress kept his promise and sacrificed his life for the nation there's been no official word yet on the cause of the crash one Aviation analyst says changing weather conditions can pose challenges even for experienced Pilots you know the issue is when you're taking off and the weather is clear and then you're in mountainous rugged uh Forest likee terrain uh there could be fog developing in areas that you don't expect fog to develop but the age of the helicopter may also have played a role the US manufactured Bell Helicopter had been in service since 1971 Western sanctions have made it difficult for Iran to obtain spare parts or new aircraft supreme leader Ayah Ali ham has declared 5 days of mourning according to Iran's Constitution a council comprised of the speaker of parliament chief justice and first vice president have 50 days to call elections for the next president Mike Lael Al jazer well let's bring in Hamid Resa aizi he's a non-resident fellow at the Middle East Council on global Affairs he joins us now from Berlin Hamid R let me start by asking you to ref reflect perhaps on R's Legacy and and particularly how Iran's foreign influence has evolved during his time in office uh yeah sure I mean uh first of all um according to the Constitution uh the president uh is not the highest ranking official in the country so he's actually the second uh figure in the uh Power hierarchy uh second to the Supreme Leader uh and that means that when it comes to uh strategic directions of the country be in foreign policy or domestic politics uh the cabinet in general and president in particular uh they have more of a kind of executive role and basically in the sense that they have been implementing uh the directions of the supreme leader uh when it comes to the person of RI I mean uh he used to be known as basically the weakest president in the uh history of the Islamic Republic because uh he was basically a loyalist to the system of of course uh but when it comes to U A Clear Vision for foreign policy uh there was no such thing um so uh they boasted about uh the unity and coordination between different branches of the government especially the Revolutionary guards the irgc and the administration and also when it comes to domestic politics he was quite in line with the ideological vision of the supreme leader h uh for example what we recently saw in the latest round of the Crackdown for hijab um so these are basically the legacies of the of President ra so being a loyalist to the Supreme Leader um and also U supporting the work of the irgc in the region and more broadly in the foreign policy of the country well in supporting foreign policy in recent years it feels like Iran's had much closer relations for instance with Russia I see President Putin has already been on on the phone to the interim president uh yes uh that was one of the uh important developments of the past few years uh it had to do of course with uh the conservative faction also president RI being uh his main representative as a president U basically U overtaking uh the whole branches of the government so it gave some assurances to Iran's Eastern Partners particularly Russia and China that uh the partnership or better to say the Strategic view on the Iranian side for partnership with these countries is going to remain intact and even strengthen so in that sense we should interpret President Putin's word but the absence of raia I don't think is going to have any substantial impact on that direction in the parliament uh in I mean the supreme leader himself for example is one of the P supporters of goer relationship with Russia so as I said the Strategic directions are going to remain the same as as it was as they were on the race Hamid there a non-resident fellow at the Middle East Council on global Affairs thank you so much for joining us on the aler news hour thank you for having me well let's take a closer look at what actually happened with regards to the helicopter and the Crash we can speak to Alex macheras he's an independent Aviation analyst and consultant he joins us now from Doha Alex obviously lots of questions are still being asked and I want to start with the helicopter itself it's decades old how much would sanctions have affected maintenance I know they've taken a real toll for instance on Commercial Aviation well you're right I mean the helicopter involved was acquired over 40 years ago and if we look at Iran as a whole Iran is home to the world's oldest commercial Aviation Fleet it is a similar scenario to those aircraft that are owned privately and given that they are so old they are deteriorating the stats speak for themselves around 2,000 Iranians have died in aircraft crashes since 1979 this is a country that because of the sanctions has struggled to obtain spare parts and in aviation spare parts are fundamental in order to provide adequate maintenance not least to Young Jets but especially to the older jets that need uh that need that extra care and so we know that when aircraft are not receiving the maintenance that is required you end up in into a territory that uh puts ultimately the lives of those on board these older aircraft at risk so it's likely that it could have played a role if there is such a an awareness of the the poor maintenance of of the aircraft Fleet in Iran if the weather was as bad as it was why did the helicopter take off at all and given that there were two others in the Convoy that made it why not this one well this is of course the the question that I think will leave to the investigators that will trying to determine the exact cause but what I will say is that as is often the case in aircraft accidents it is a variety of different contributors that come together ultimately to form that final outcome rather than just one single thing so it is likely that when you combine something like the deteriorating older aircraft in need of Maintenance with something like poor weather which can of course complicate even the most ordinary a flight never mind that in a region that is mountainous for example then then you quickly begin to see how again that risk level is increasing Alex when we heard the initial reports of the incident the presidency was talking about a hard Landing now when you look at images of the crash site the disintegration of pretty much the whole aircraft except for the tail what does that tell you and what implications does that have for the investigation well something fundament to has obviously occurred some some something drastic it doesn't appear to be um so consistent with that initial report I will note that later they were referring to it as a crash rather than just what they referred to it in those early hours as the quote hard landing and you know helicopter and travel by helicopter is generally less safe than traveling on a fixed wing commercial aircraft or a private aircraft so already you've got a slightly increased risk there and as I say with the backdrop of having the oldest Fleet of aircraft under those us sanctions they only were able to import new craft into Iran during that brief period in the Obama Administration where the Iran nuclear deal was active Airbus managed to get some new jets in and some other stakeholders and then of course Donald Trump at the president at the time pulled the plug and uh and Iran's aircraft Fleet continues to deteriorate now so as I say it's likely to be a contributor of all of these things and that's what the investigation will probably focus on I'll be following that very closely indeed Alex materas there an independent Aviation analyst and consultant always great to get your insights than for joining us again on aler Alex thank you very much thank you make sure to subscribe to our channel to get the latest news from

          <attvalue for="7" value="while much of New South Wales was being pelted by floods farmers across large parts of Australia have been praying for rain The drought is so bad they need help to keep their animals fed There is a solution So why isn't it happening we need hay is what it amounts to All of our own fodder reser reserves were exhausted 6 or 8 weeks ago We've got a real fodder crisis at the moment that I don't think Australia has ever experienced before A jetty leading to nowhere but cracked dry land And on nearby farms endless paddics of bare dirt this sunburnt country is in desperate need of a downpour After a tough spring and virtually no rain over summer the drought in southwest Victoria has pushed farmers to the edge and fast Part of the mindset was that we might be okay And do you still feel you might be okay we're definitely not going to be okay Cattle farmer James Knight has been working in the Sisters since 2016 A small settlement 3 hours west of Melbourne where his core business is beef production It could very easily get worse over the next 3 months With a wife and young family James is hanging on He's got 1350 pregnant females and another 1,250 young growing stock but his fodder reserves ran out 6 weeks ago So how does this affect your family um I reckon um you know George and I really tight team and best mates Um I can only start to think that you know like yeah seeing husbands or wives that um you know aren't sleeping or stressed um would be challenging for them James soon realized weathering this dry spell wouldn't cut it He needed a plan that you have to supplementary feed your animals with feed that needs to be bought in or you put wheels underneath your livestock and you send them off farm We have purchased foder as much as we could in the bale form which is now basically non-existent We're very fortunate to have water for livestock at the moment There are a lot of people There are a heap of people I know that are a lot worse off than us Gary Kelly from Bellman Water is run off his feet He's on his 12th delivery for the day dropping some 26,000 L of water per load to properties across the region like Bernie Freeze dairy farm It's unheard of It's that dry Bernie's had to call in about 12 loads of water since February usually only needing two or three for the year We uh got to grow some grass for them which is uh becoming very challenging this year So what do you need more than anything else to keep these cows alive here we need the bales of hay that we're dragging in So how much of your income from dairy farm is now being spent on feeding the cows um 60% last month and it'll be up to 80 90% next month So surely that's not sustainable Um no it's not not sustainable in the long run Being able to afford the feed is one thing Finding it is another We buy it off a fellow that delivers it as well and um at the moment he can't uh he can't source any for us So there's no more hay Well that appears to be what the story is at the moment Farmers across the borders want to help prepared to haul hay wherever it's needed most But this declared pest presents one of the biggest challenges of all the green snail From Western Australia it attacks a myriad of plants including crops A biocurity risk other states don't want We need hay is what it amounts to and it's not available So we need the government to be actually talking to us about what the other solutions are Farmer Brett Hosking has just been appointed a member of Victoria's new drought response task force We're looking at opportunities to bring some from Western Australia which has a whole lot of challenges amongst it or from Queensland or also looking at can we get it offshore can we bring it in from overseas and um uh there's some real critical conversations happening at the moment that have never happened before Brett says rigorous quarantine rules are delaying desperately needed feed while farmers try to keep animals and their businesses alive How do they recover their pastures how can they rebuild their farms how can they restock stock that they've had to had to sell as well so they're our next challenges While pushing for faster testing of WA hay Brett has also got word there's shipments of palm kernel coming from Malaysia to fill the gap Until then decisions will have to be made selling cattle Well I think we're going to offload another 50 um in the next 2 to 3 weeks If mother nature is going to show these farmers any mercy she'll need to unleash a soaking of above average rainfall But ask meteorologists and that's not on the cards The next couple of months rain here is forecast to be below average and we may all pay the price It might get deer for the consumer And as sundown brings farmers one day closer to rain They know the relief won't be instant With winter comes slower growing grass The sooner it rains the better And if we have a mild winter that'll be even better Jeez it's just so dry And we wrote to the Victorian government asking if it had a plan to help with hay delivery We've had radio silence" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="How Iran’s Ayatollahs Captured Power | Flashback with Palki Sharma&#10;&#10;In 1979, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned from 14 years in exile to declare an Islamic Republic in Iran. He had led a nationwide revolution that overthrew the pro-Western Shah of Iran. What happened next was a consolidation of power in the hands of Iran’s Shia clergy. From parliament to president, Khomeini created a system that would give the illusion of accountability yet place ultimate power with him. Today, the supreme leader of Iran is the most powerful man in the country. Only he can declare war and peace in the country. But how was this power structure created? How did the Ayatollahs accumulate power in their hands?

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] the year was 1979 the date February 1st it was quite a foggy morning in thran but cutting through that fog a plane landed at the airport a chartered Air France flight slowly the plane came to a standstill and from it emerged a bearded figure a firm look on his face a turban over his head and a black robe trailing behind the figure was unmistakable it was Ayatollah ruhullah Ki he had returned to Iran after 14 years in Exile he spent that time in Iraq and France but that Thursday morning he was back it's probably the most important day in Iran's modern history millions of people turned up to welcome him they cheered his every move and word Ki would go on to declare an Islamic Republic in Iran it ended almost 2,500 years of the Persian Empire not to mention changed West Asia forever but as historians say Revolution is the easy part building a country is much harder so how did the Ayatollah set about creating modernday Iran how was the country's power structure made time for a flashback you cannot understand modern Iran without understanding Ki the country is built in His image by the 1950s and 60s he was already popular his claim to fame opposing the Sha of Iran the Sha was a western Ally he tried to create a secular and liberal Iran but Ki despised this his Hardline politics eventually got him exiled in 1964 he moved to Iraq it was was here that Ki created the foundations of an Islamic State but every state needs a glue in democracies it's the people in monarchies it's the royal family what would that glue be in Iran keni settled on the Shia Muslim clergy this concept was called V faki or guardianship of the Islamic jurist he explained it in a series of lectures which became a booki said God created Islam to be followed as per the Divine Law what is called the Sharia and who knows the Sharia best the Muslim clerics so he said it's natural for the clerics to rule Iran this concept was added to Iran's Constitution but not without drama by 1978 it was clear that the Sha's regime would fall it was only a question of when so K's allies began making a draft Constitution it was said to be a progressive one separation of powers United Nations Charter no vaki and no supreme leader Ki brought this draft with him to Iran in public he said it was a nice document and this is where we see shades of heni the politician you see the Iran of 1979 had many powerful groups you had the Kurds you had the working class you also had the marxists SOI did not want to rock the boat at first but slowly he made his intentions clear first he organized a nationwide referendum and the question was simple should Iran be an Islamic Republic or not 98.2% voters said yes so keni announced his next step he canceled support for a proposed constituent assembly this assembly was supposed to ratify the draft but Ki said no need instead he formed another body the Assembly of experts around 72 delegates were elected to this body 55 of them were clerics you can guess what happened next this assembly overhauled Iran's draft Constitution it enshrined V faki focused heavily on the Sharia and made Ki supreme leader for life this constitution was put to the public in late 1979 it was implemented the next year and thus the Islamic Republic was formed after which Ki shifted to his next goal reshaping Iran's society and po it would take up the final 10 years of his life the country was very liberal back then the clothes the music the college was all of it was quite Progressive so humi went about dismantling it he banned most democratic political parties he shut down several magazines and newspapers and in 1981 he began a cultural revolution universities were shut for 2 years in this time the syllabus was totally changed Progressive ideas out political Islam in almost 20,000 teachers were fired apparently they were too westernized now all of this did trigger some backlash Iran's liberals and marxists were not happy with Ki so he needed someone to crack down on them the Army was not an option in 1953 the Iranian Army had sided with Western Powers together they had toppled Iran's elected leader during the revolution the Army had promised to remain neutral but Ki was wary he did not trust them enough so the supreme leader turned to his own militia the Islamic revolutionary Gods it was different and independent from Iran's Army and it reported to just one man so supreme leader Ki by 1982 the gods got their own overseas wing and in 1985 a navy and Air Force all of this with K's blessings the guards were also deployed inside Iran sort of like a moral police they would go around enforcing the Sharia like asking women to cover their faces or forcing men to grow beards and all of this made one thing quite clear Iran's Revolution was not going to be Democratic or Progressive it was going going to be Hardline islamist which often led to political chaos Iran's first elections were held in January 1980 Abul Hassan bani sadder became president he was an adviser to H but he wasn't a hardliner not like the supreme leader just one problem though Banny s did not control the parliament most lawmakers belonged to the Islamic Republic Party a radical group formed by Kanani loyalists so pretty soon they clashed BN s proposed three names for his prime minister all three were rejected by Parliament Ki did try to settle these differences but soon it boiled over ban sad became a rallying hero for dissidents and Ki did not like this he supported the impeachment of ban sad so the president ended up fleeing to France What followed next was a purge opposition party members were arrested in the thousands many of them were executed some exiled Iranians say the regime killed 20,000 political prisoners of course sometimes they hit back like in August 1981 Iranian dissidents bombed the Islamic Republic party's headquarters they killed the new president and his prime minister so the first few years of the Revolution were quite violent Iran was still struggling with its identity but stability came in late 1981 after the bombing another presidential election was held the third one in 21 months this time Ayatollah Ali K was elected you may know him as a supreme leader today but in the 1980s he was the president K served two terms until 1989 Iran's politics during this time was very complicated mostly because of the power structure on the one hand it was a theocracy sovereignity did not lie with the people it Lay With God on the other hand it was a revolutionary Republic so you couldn't ignore the people this hybrid structure led to a lot of complications not to mention bickering first you have the president he decides economic and administrative policy but he does not control the military then you have the parliament it has around 290 seats all lawmakers are directly elected by the people but the parliament is not absolute its laws are checked by another body that is the Council of Guardians now this Council has 12 members six of them are appointed by the Supreme Leader the rest are suggested by the Judiciary you can guess where these suggestions really come from but the council's job is very important say the parliament passes a law this Council will see whether it conforms with the Sharia if not it can crack down so effectively the council has a veto over Parliament it also decides who can stand for elections just consider the 1997 presidential election 230 candidates wanted to contest only four made it to the ballot another powerful body is the Assembly of experts we mentioned this at the start it's the same one that drafted Iran's Constitution but now its job is different this assembly has 86 Iranian clerics they're elected to 8-year terms by the public and who decides the candidates again the Council of Guardians the assembly's main job is to elect the next supreme leader and I know the structure may sound complicated but one thing is quite clear all these bodies draw power from the same place the supreme leader of Iran of course sometimes there are squabbles like in 1988 the parliament was on one side the guardian Council on the other neither side was backing down so supreme leader Ki formed another body the experienc council it has more than 30 members and most of them are hardliners do you see the strategy here Iran has created multiple bodies and councils to distribute power to check and balance each other but in reality it's an illusion an illusion to Shield the real power in the country which is the supreme leader again let's look at the 1997 election it was a watershed moment in Iran because the reformists beat the hardliners Muhammad katami became president he was reelected by a landslide in 2001 so in the next election the guardian Council stepped in in 2004 they disqualified thousands of reformist candidates so the hardliners won the parliament we saw that again in the last election Hassan ruhani had been president from 2013 to 2021 he was widely regarded as a moderate so in the 2021 election the guardian stepped in again they disqualified 585 candidates only seven were left on the ballot all seven were hardliners so the trend is pretty clear every few years Iran has a moderate wave but it's snuffed out by the clerics and Guardians supreme leader one democracy zero the question is what does the future hold can any group challenge the regime in Iran the obvious candidate would have been the Army but it's a shadow of its former self from 1980 to 1988 the Army fought a war with Iraq they lost around 250,000 men and since then the Army has been stationed at the border far away from the Power Center plus it's been purged of dissidents thousands of officers were fired or detained in the 1980s their loyalties were questioned so the Army is weak what about a clerical power struggle Ayatollah K is almost 84 years old surely succession is on everyone's mind and the last one was quite dramatic K's chosen Heir Apparent was Hussein Ali montari and I told and disciple of fi but in 1988 he criticized the regime he opposed the detentions and executions so montari was stripped off his role the next year in 1989 fam died so the Assembly of experts elected a junior cleric Ayatollah Ali K as for who will succeed him it's not clear k has not named a successor but current president Ibrahim RI is said to be a front runner the Revolutionary regime is almost 45 years old which is young in relative terms it has done a lot to strengthen its position from domestic crackdowns to creating an alliance of proxies in the region but what it hasn't done is welfare Iran's economy has struggled to break free under the regime mostly because of sanctions there is also discontent about conservative laws like the ones around hijab so the key to sustaining the revolution could be modernizing it but the flip side is this A modernized revolution is a slippery slope we saw that with the Soviet Union when they modernized their Revolution the regime collapsed I guess striking a balance will be [Music] [Music] key for" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="60 minutes rewind on November 4th 1979 66 Americans were taken hostage by Iranian students who seized control of the US Embassy in Iran two weeks later Mike Wallace interviewed Iran's spiritual leader the Ayatollah Khomeini's if there is some turmoil in Tehran there was none apparent this morning in the holy city of Qom 100 miles to the south there guarded by a lone soldier on a rooftop is the modest compound of the Ayatollah Khomeini this morning in his reception room the ground rules the interview were carefully spelled out no question could be asked unless it was approved ahead of time no questions about Iran's internal politics no questions about a lack of freedom under the Ayatollah but there seemed no pattern to those questions that were disallowed about half of those he proposed was simply forbidden the interpreter said he would refuse even to ask the Ayatollah any questions that he the interpreter deemed inappropriate to begin with of course we wanted to learn about the hostages held in the American Embassy compound do you still say him out that if the Shah the ex Shah is not returned to Iran that those American hostages in the American Embassy compound will not be freed in the name of God the most merciful and gracious this issue has to do with the people the 35 million population of Iran want this and we must investigate why the population wants the Shah return and unless he is returned the hostages will not be freed reading a prepared statement the ayatollahs interpreter told Wallace the Shah has to return and tell us where his money is and we have to know the extent of his treason against our people reasons for the people's insistence for the shortest return one that this is a nation with a poor economy that the wealth of these people have been plundered by the Shah and his relatives have been taken out of the country are being deposited in various US and European banks and these are the money which indeed belong to the people to these pool of people right and therefore he has to come he has to return and tell us where are these monies and why they are there the second which is even more important than the first reason is that we want him back to show the extent of the crimes committed by this person during 37 years of his rule we have to know the extent of his treasons in this country this is why that he has to return and he has to be troy and then the courts will decide but that is not an answer to whether the hostages will be freed I just gave an answer the people will it and we can't go against this will then they then the hostages will remain there in the American embassy compound what for life forever they will remain until the Shah is returned it is in the hands of Carter Carter can free them by returning the shah imam president carter accuses your government of practicing terrorism and says that your regime will be held accountable if those US hostages are harmed terrorists and was all recorded by 35 million people of Iran are terrorists as Carter knew interpret politics like this you call our people terrorists and then I've heard what Carter says of them and it doesn't make sense he says they are not students they are bombed they are terrorists you know these as terrorists this is an insult to students and people across the nation you consider our people terrorists if you want to understand them of politics is that we are a nation of terrorists we are Muslims if this is an insult among president Sadat of Egypt a devoutly religious man a Muslim says that what you are doing now is quote a disgrace to Islam and he calls you Imam forgive me his words not mine a lunatic I know that you have heard that comment that's yes that's that's what I heard president synapse say on American television yes that the Imam is a disgrace to Islam yes and he used the word a lunatics Sadat it the ie Islam you cannot so that states he is a Muslim oh yes LOM and we are not he is not for he compromises with the enemies of Islam so that has United with our enemies so that knows well what is occurring south of Lebanon and with the Palestinians he knows the crimes of Israel yet he still considers making a friend and himself a Muslim you must try to evaluate what he is doing then through Islam the Egyptian people do not back Sadat the official interpreter then read again from a prepared text I demand that Egyptian people try to overthrow him just as with it with the Shah he calls upon the Egyptian people he never throws Sadat he does the way the Iranian people overthrew the Shah exactly we hear you mom that today perhaps today some black hostages and some female hostages will be released from the American embassy compound is that true moon closer dears an hora here the freedom of the woman and blacks will be given women are given great dignity in Islam and the blacks have been oppressed in the United States great injustice was done unto them they were under pressure in the United States thus they came here we are doing this owing to the tents of this long in return we asked nothing further freedom we want the shot Carter must return him the world's international law agree with this principle I asked you as an American and a human being talking to an Iranian and another human being is there no room for compromise or is or is Iran now in effect at war with the United States sorry can't ask that first people that because that one was crossed out as a thing wrong Imam Imam are you is Iran in effect at war with the United States now has a thing wrong is you nobody nobody near on that was there a giant has giant looks Lucia's yeah not Salinas here it is what do you mean if you mean our armies against the United States Army no there is no such if you mean it is a battle of nerves it's as Carter's doing we are against war we are Muslims we desire peace for all Carter does not allow this Carter should put aside his so-called humanism and return the criminal shot so that we can conclude this matter the Shah is a criminal we all know this this - you called the US Embassy then can be returned to a place of humanism and diplomacy Carter must return the show we have nothing against the people of the United States but if the president says he refuses to return the Shah and if the Imam says he will not free the hostages then what what can be the answer I'm not sure if I can get the answer because this was not even the question please ask him I'm sure it's a very simple straightforward question somewhat but the moment is boring several Lutheran - no - no nice dish really enjoyed the component of in her nice dish he's not even going to listen to it because it's not in the year all right if the Imam was so convinced that the US Embassy was a spy a center why did he not close it down and break off relations with the United States why did he wait for this group of young Iranians to take it over well how'd it get it come on let me think here yeah we didn't think an embassy could be a center of spying I didn't realize this until our students found the necessary evidence I didn't realize Carter going against all international law tenants would allow this spying and conspiracy at the American Embassy now that our students have done this taken the embassy with the backing of all the people of Iran we have now realized we have now realized that the American Embassy has been a center for spying Imam could you would you permit me to go to the American Embassy compound and talk to the hostages who are there I can go it does not matter allow him to go and observe our young are there and they will show him does the Americans are safe and helps him there is no problem in going they are under protection and nothing will occur to them Islam protects the prisoner Islam is humane we are Muslims our students our Muslim students they will protect the prisoners I have asked my son to observe and ensure their safety he reported to me that they are all well I personally wish and hope for their safety the prisoners the prisoners at the United States Embassy must ask Carter to allow the Shah to return so they may again gain their freedom despite that apparent promise Mike Wallace was not allowed into the embassy" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] so i've been driving for a while and this is just like a massive expanse of land that has been mined out and is still being mined you can see a lot of uh workers are still operating here most of these people are actually a local guyanese but they're more recently some chinese miners that have come [Music] guyana is one of the smallest countries in south america the largely undeveloped nation is rich with gold timber and other natural resources that have attracted foreign investment recently from china this science is [Music] [Music] china's growing presence in guyana is part of its increased investment in latin america and the caribbean last year china's investment and construction projects in the region neared 16 billion dollars a four-fold increase since 2005. in that time chinese state banks have also loaned over 130 billion dollars to governments in the region loans to often fund infrastructure projects run by chinese state-owned enterprises much of this investment comes through china's belt and road initiative an ambitious push to bring development funding and soft power influence around the globe [Music] in guyana one of the flagship infrastructure projects is a hydroelectric power plant to be built deep in the rainforest we flew over the site with land rights activist michael mcgarrell who travels across the country mapping threats to indigenous territories so that's the road that leads to the hydro project site so this is where they're going to be building a hydroelectric plant and it's the chinese that are building this right yes the chinese are the ones who are doing it it's going to flood large swaths of lands the biodiversity that lives in this area will die indigenous peoples we hunt and we fish in this area i mean building a hydrodam will decimate that [Music] guyana's largely intact rainforest operates as a crucial carbon sink capturing more carbon dioxide than the nation emits keeping it intact is crucial not just for the tribes who live here but also for alleviating the effects of climate change around the world mcgowan brought us to the village of morowa where members of the patamona tribe are fighting to get legal recognition of their lands we want a land title so that not any company could come in and say oh this is our black or this because it belongs to us we the people the first people of this country it belongs to us not for a company from china not from america companies are staking claims including a chinese timber operation and license holders for mining gold on my gps here i can see the mining concessions around moreover yeah oh wow so we're actually in the middle of a lot of we're surrounded by mining concessions here does that mean at some point there will be mining happening yes there will be at some point is it not inevitable that as guyana's opening up this way of life and indigenous peoples communities are going to change yes things are changing the world is moving on but we must determine that rate of change guyana is changing faster than mcgarrell would like a huge discovery of oil has transformed guyana's economy into one of the fastest growing in the world china is poised to cash in not just from its 25 stake in oil reserves but by funding the roads hotels and other infrastructure needed to fuel that growth but there are concerns that china with its outsized influence could unfairly benefit from the country's rapid ascent leaving guyanese citizens behind chinese infrastructure spending in other developing nations has been criticized as opaque and a way of propping up corrupt regimes we wanted to see if guyana's development is being fueled by corruption so we switched to hidden cameras so i'm going to be filming undercover with my chinese friend who does not want to go on camera for obvious reasons he's going to be posing as a successful chinese business person i'm going to be posing as his secretary and we're going to be trying to uncover how the chinese are doing business with the miami's government me and my colleague who we'll call mr chan presented ourselves as investors looking to get involved in mining logging and construction [Music] we spent weeks working our way into elite business circles and captured conversations we wouldn't normally have heard eventually we're welcome to a private country retreat where we met influential business people including one timber exporter who offered us advice on how to best work the system foreign we need on our side is vice president barad jagdayo arguably the most powerful politician in the country he spent 12 years as president and still pulls huge political weight outside guyana he's been heralded as a climate hero promising to keep his country green even as it drills for oil we're told that the person who can get us in the room with him is a man named su jurong mr is a long time guyana resident he's one of the country's biggest land holders in timber and mining with stakes in the fuel industry as well but he was still eager to meet with new investors [Music] bragged about his influence with the vice president who owns the house sue lives in and whom su refers to as his boss and sue says he can help us in guyana for the right price foreign sue's not the only person to tell us that the service fees these middlemen take are essentially bribes for big deals [Music] this is a general manager of china's largest state-run construction firm who confirmed that companies use middlemen [Music] [Music] linked directly to the chinese communist party who win a lot of guyana's largest government contracts sky works for one of the biggest state-run organizations and the way that they're seeming to do business here is also very much under the table it does imply very much that the beijing authorities know exactly what's going on [Music] later sue showed us evidence of his own involvement in multi-million dollar deals between guyana's government and a large chinese state-run corporation including a contract for his work as an agent on a big road project and letters sent from the government about the same hydro power plant we flew over in the rain forest for our deal mr sue painted us a wide range of investment opportunities logging rights a stone quarry gold mining and the most promising of all land in a prime location where a hotel and casino could be built to cash in on the oil boom sue says the money we pay him under the guise of legitimate business will actually make it to the vice president [Music] foreign before we could pay su and the vice president we would need a way to get large sums of money into the country we told sue that like other companies he does business with our capital is tied up in china and china has strict controls over sending money abroad we'd need a workaround so there's been a lot of hints throughout our time here that the way that foreign companies are normally getting money into the country is through um different money launderers that operate here so we've managed to get hold of a couple of those guys who say that they are able to transfer huge sums of money into the country um and we're gonna meet with him now this man told us he works with a team to transfer huge sums of cash both for private clients and chinese state-controlled companies he says he's personally delivered cash directly to government officials the way he does this is called flying money in chinese money is placed in a bank account in china the equivalent amount minus a hefty fee is taken out in guyana getting around taxes and border restrictions now with our access to cash secured we moved forward with the deal as a final step sue took our colleague mr chan next door to meet the vice president himself thank you so much for seeing me yeah please have a seat jack doe avoided talking specifics but told us how close he is to sue do you understand our deal in detail i'm not getting involved in business but you will get the support soon is my friend he gets all the support we have to be clear about all the agreements sue deals with all the agreements i don't i don't i understand i understand the thing is that my um thing is that i am in government so i can i assess from government side that's it sue interjected telling mr chan this wasn't the place to talk about the bribe yeah give me time i hope i can see you again thank you thank you thank you thank you so much [Applause] my [Music] personal profit isn't the only thing at stake here china's expansion in south america has set off alarms in the us which has long held political dominance in the region china has an overall goal become the wealthiest country in the world and the most powerful country in the world that's not going to happen on my watch biden and g7 leaders recently pledged hundreds of billions of dollars in global infrastructure funding a direct counter to china's belt and road one fear is that generous chinese funding comes with geopolitical strings attached and last year that seemed to ring true when guyana made a policy decision that many saw as a direct result of pressure from china the island of taiwan which china claims as its own announced it was opening a trade office in guyana the u.s applauded the move but only hours later guyana pulled out of the agreement one of our business associates who had close ties with the chinese embassy told us that the reason guyana pulled out was because of chinese funding there's no possibility for taiwan to have any office in there it wasn't until months after our conversation that talk of a 1.5 billion loan made the news suggesting that our contact did have inside knowledge about what went down when reached my phone recently he said he didn't remember ever saying this vice president jagdayo said no loan was made and that china had never pressured them over taiwan or any other issue no financing from anybody comes with political strengths a few months later we confronted the vice president about whether the massive influx in foreign investment is plagued by corruption and if he himself has a part to play in that you know ghana has attracted a lot of foreign investment recently what is it that guyana has to offer the opportunity to make money that is why people are coming here so that's what i'm going to say some of the biggest infrastructure projects you have are being built by chinese state-run companies given the contentious issues between the us and china does it ever feel like guyana is being used as a pawn with it you know within these two global superpowers i don't think we're such a big player to have the arrogance to think that we're so important to the two parties to be users upon i think we're just a small country trying to do the best for our people and this year guyana dropped two points on the transparency international's corruption perception index which puts it among the most corrupt in the region do you accept that within this government and within this country there is a problem with corruption first of all i have a problem with the indices but we do have real corruption in countries like ours too this is like a blackness index the darker you are the lower you are on the index the developed countries hardly ever get on this index and they have more institutional corruption in my view what about within your government do you accept bribes no i don't you know we've spoken to a number of chinese business people in guyana who said that you do accept vibes and they have said that in fact it's the only way to get business done yeah well i i can't comment on that you can you can just sit there and fabricate that unless you say who the person is i can't comment on anonymous people okay well let's talk about specific individuals what is your relationship with mr sujurong su oh so my relationship nothing he is he's a tenant in my place yeah and he's a good friend of yours yes um yes yes he is a friend of ours he claims that through his very close relationship with you that he's able to get any deal done well i don't i don't do you use middlemen like sue in order to take money on on your behalf so that you can keep your hands clean no the answer is no we met with a manager from a chinese state-run corporation who confirmed that they use individuals like sue in order to get these deals done and that they pay them a consulting fee which essentially serves as a bribe to individuals like you i mean i don't know because again that's all you're building everything on what you were met and what people told you i don't know i can't comment on some anonymous manager now telling you something i mean these are these individuals why do you want to be business interesting countries why do you think yes so many people are telling us one thing about you know this is the way that deals get done you know when the reporters come from abroad this is their tattoo kind of thing you always want to make a developing country leader look her up so you've done your your bit will you investigate at least you know no no definitely i'm gonna ask about all of this but i can't i can't comment reasonably how can i comment on these these issues a few days after meeting with us jagdayo released our interview to the press seemingly to get ahead of the onslaught of public reactions guyana's president lept to jagdeh's defense i heard that the reporter had certain special interests neither the timber exporter we spoke to nor the chinese state-run firms mentioned in this piece responded to our questions but in a statement the chinese embassy called our reporting false and said all chinese companies operating in guyana follow local laws and international practices sue also claimed he'd never said this and released a statement saying that he'd never acted on behalf of any government official or promised any favor or business related reward [Music] since our interview negotiations over the contract to build the hydroelectric power plant which sue said he was involved in brokering have stalled and the vice president now says he plans to take legal action against sue for what he told us i'm going to take repetitional action i'm gonna i'm going to sue it and i'm looking to him to throw him out looking for him can't find him so far but as soon as i find him this will happen but others have called for jagday himself to be investigated the opposition believes that vp jackmail should do the descenting and resign to facilitate an unbiased investigation and the people of guyana they're still left with questions about who gets to buy their country and for what price somebody may be making corrupt deals to give away our lands basically because we're not benefiting from it but we will not give up because we see that the the system has been designed in such a way that it goes against you know what we're trying to do we will continue to struggle for our lands it is not for us now but we have to think within our children our grandchildren those who come after us [Music] i'm michael lehrman editor-in-chief of vice news too often traditional news outlets shy away from the real stories and experiences of those living through global conflicts not vice news our reporters are on the ground fearlessly covering the human stories that shape our world you and millions of others can continue to read watch and listen device news for free but we hope you'll consider making a one-time or

malaysia's sovereign wealth fund 1mdb i think he should be punished severely on the run since 2016 al jazeera's secured never before heard recordings of the malaysian fugitive jolo trying to bargain his way out of going to jail definitely she's the one person that would have records of everything hello hello hi joe how are you i'm good how are you you must be a very busy man yes trying to help a busy man [Music] the disarmingly cheery voice is malaysia's infamous fugitive jolo to be honest i'm happy to talk to you via whatsapp i'm happy to do a video chat because for me it's very transparent so i mean if you all need to record or not it's fine totally i've no issues not seen nor heard for five years what you've been listening to is a recording of one of a series of phone calls between jolo and the malaysian government that took place from may to november 2018. the recordings exclusively obtained by al jazeera have been independently verified as far as i'm concerned i just want to do whatever it takes distinctive accent is a legacy of an education at london's elite boarding school harrow and then wharton business school in the united states born into a rich malaysian family their wealth was nothing compared to what his became [Applause] notorious for his decadent lifestyle famous and powerful friends extravagant gifts luxury real estate and accessories a super yacht an alley jet one of the first to question the source of his mega wealth was malaysian mp tony poi i mean you you want to put him in jail i think he should be punished severely but you cannot help by be being impressed it could be mixing or partying with the top hollywood stars and tomorrow he will be able to have wine with some of the top leaders around the world to be able to make all these deals deals happen but in 2016 the paparazzi photograph stopped [Music] i've gone from at least being able to meet people now i'm like on lockdown jolo went into hiding as investigators around the world closed in on a shocking global crime at the heart of it was malaysia's sovereign wealth fund 1mdb set up in 2009 by the country's then prime minister najib razak today's case is the largest single action ever brought by the department's kleptocracy asset recovery initiative one mdb was created with the ultimate goal of improving the well-being of the malaysian people but unfortunately a number of corrupt 1mdb officials treated this public trust as a personal bank account joelo is the centerpiece of this scandal there's no question i think that he in part was the mastermind he clearly was the facilitator [Music] michael hirschman co-founded transparency international the worldwide organization exposes government and corporate corruption jolo was a consummate networker a real internationalist someone who over the years got to know the stepson of prime minister najib and through him became familiar with the prime minister himself now everyone close to him knew that they would benefit by the abuse of power and the corruption the plot to defraud 1mdb began in early september 2009 on a mega yacht in the mediterranean on board jolo najib his wife rosmar and their children the hosts two co-founders of a newly established saudi arabian petroleum company one a saudi prince within weeks the sovereign wealth fund signed a 2.5 billion joint venture with the saudi company one mdb agreeing to invest one billion dollars almost all its funds at the time when you put one billion dollars in a single company for a sovereign fund that raises a lot of alarm bells by the end of september one mdb had paid its first installment of 700 million dollars but the money never made it to the joint venture instead it was diverted to a swiss bank account controlled by jolo it was just the start of the scam that would see 4.5 billion dollars stolen from the sovereign wealth fund our approach is to fundamentally question how quality is created jolo set up an international investment company jinwal capital in hong kong and touted his integrity and business acumen [Music] i do believe that this jolo felt that he was free to do anything he wanted and that he couldn't be touched because he had air cover coming from the prime minister's office and the prime minister's family [Music] najib's government threatened and silenced 1mdb whistleblowers and even tried to derail the u.s investigation it turned into a campaign of trying to get us to stop conducting the investigation newly retired fbi agent bill mcmurray led the u.s 1mdb case from july 2015. the evidence was very compelling and it's really the ultimate sin of a public public official to to take the money out of the hands of the people that you were elected to serve for your own good and then to do it on a scale that was done on this case is just sickening so sickening for the malaysian public that in may 2018 they voted out najib razak's corrupt government and his party that had ruled malaysia for more than 60 years police raids on najib's family homes seized hundreds of millions of dollars worth of handbags jewelry and cash the bottom line is as prime minister he profited handsomely from allowing jolo to mastermind this scam [Applause] former prime minister of malaysia has been convicted of money laundering in connection with the one mdb scandal in july 2020 najib was convicted of 1mdb related corruption sentenced to 12 years jail subject to appeal it's a fate jolo's been desperate to avoid only a day after the 2018 police raids on najib's homes he was on the phone from his hideout to the new malaysian government led by mahatya [Music] possible muhammad the market that i really believe that the change in government does present a real opportunity to resolve these 1mtb related issues and i am committed to achieve that in may 2018 although not yet facing criminal charges in the united states jolo was fighting off civil lawsuits aimed at seizing more than one billion dollars worth of assets from masterpieces to the 250 million dollar mega yacht equanimity all bought with 1mdb money on the phone he claimed that just before the malaysian election he'd been on the brink of a deal with the u.s government basically i agreed to give him all the assets and the us sells it and the monies will be used to directly repay 1mdb us dollar bonds okay [Applause] [Music] but they've been a major roadblock nadjie brzak's kleptocracy was still in [Music] [Applause] the malaysian power so they said we're not going to send back the money and that wasn't all najib's government feared incrimination if jolo agreed to give back assets if i signed the deal basically the malaysian government would would say okay so are you now saying that you know the monies are allegedly from one mtb when the position is not correct but my position i told them look you know in the us you can sign settlement agreements which have no ambition of wrongdoing would we love it an admission of guilt absolutely but it's not a must-have deborah la provot is a former veteran fbi agent she was part of the initial 1mdb investigation he may not accept responsibility or admit guilt but that doesn't mean that there isn't enough evidence out there already to prosecute him without an admission of guilt [Music] we made a strategic decision here that we would go forward with the civil action because it gave us an opportunity to lay out in great detail a lot of the evidence that we had of how the money was stolen where it went what it was used for i think we're very confident that we will be able to prove jolo's involvement and his position in this scheme singapore had already laid charges against jolo for his involvement in laundering 1mdb funds through its financial system but the fugitive claimed he'd almost sealed a deal with the city-state as well brokered by none other than najib's hand-picked attorney general the same man in 2016 cleared the then prime minister of any wrongdoing in relation to one mdb attorney general had numerous discoveries in singapore and they actually agreed to close off those charges in return i agreed to weigh my claims to all the assets and then they also agreed to basically lift the interpol right notice because they have singapore's also put around office office that's why i have travel restrictions but he says once again the deal fell through still determined to get his international arrest warrant lifted he now wanted the new maharia government to help i have given up a lot of the assets and there's still a portion they haven't given up so i think if singapore hears from malaysia they say low missile is going to wave all these claims i can do it within the next five days okay obviously in return then i need you know singapore to lift my interval red notice which they were willing to do and that you know in future they can't file any new notices on me but if they want to file new charges on me that's their business [Music] and making demands on singapore was just the start of what the fugitive wanted the new malaysian government to do for him i'm willing to waive all my rights to all the assets and then effectively say the malaysian government can take all of it and then in return basically you know i would need malaysia's undertaking that you know because of my cooperation uh that that you know this is settled and there will be no future proceedings against me and so on so forth and that wasn't all he wanted malaysia to then negotiate on his behalf around the world [Music] i think that was his best shot in getting out of jail but there is no chance at all that we will agree to drop all charges charges against him because he's he's pretty much like the most wanted man in malaysia i think he's delusional you know it's like the bank robber who gets caught and he's like well if i return the money then i don't want to be uh charged with robbing the bank well you still robbed the bank and in this case you robbed the development fund think of all the good that should have been done for all of those years that weren't done because of joe lowe he's someone who masterminded a 4.5 billion dollar fraud he knew what he was doing right he knew that brides were being paid he knew that he had friendly bankers in his pocket so i i think there is there's still the arrogance of i can buy my way out of this [Music] and that arrogance extended to a belief his help was indispensable to the u.s department of justice we're trying to be cooperative in terms of liquidating the assets as quickly as possible okay so typically what happens is we're trying to sell all the assets yeah it makes it easier for the doj and malaysia basically so you all don't have to deal with the asset level the us seized jolo's mega yacht equanimity in indonesian waters a few months earlier but as far as jolo was concerned he was still at its helm navigating its [Music] to try and sail it from indonesia to the mediterranean because we think it can get a much higher price than the us because as you know the summer season is easier to sell a boat so that i think when the time comes we may need your help to talk to the indonesians uh but that will of course you know be with the doj yes okay it's like he still thinks he's calling the shots right i'll get them the best bang for the buck but the us they don't need mr lowe's assistance to get the best price for the yacht again i think it's him inserting himself into the investigation you know this was all just some large misunderstanding and uh of course that's not the case today is charged with corruption with najib razak's stunning four from grace ever the opportunist jolo was ready to turn on the former prime minister ultimately i have no authority to make any decision he put the blame for the 1mdb scandal firmly on najib who crucially was not only prime minister but also malaysia's finance minister when billions of dollars were siphoned from the funds jolo is not alone on the run many other 1mdb accomplices also fled malaysia and are still wanted by the country's authorities to curry favor with the new mahathir administration jolo offered some of them as potential witnesses for future prosecutions of najib and his wife rosmar who'd also soon contest charges from money laundering to soliciting bribes of more than 45 million dollars to be honest i know most of the people that can be very helpful if the objective is you know let's look at black and white who's at home is the prime minister at fall is the first lady at fault then i think everyone can go back and prepare the documentation the u.s department of justice revealed that between 2011 and 2015 more than one billion dollars of 1mdb money flowed into the former prime minister's personal bank accounts and of that only 80 million dollars came from the saudi arabian government but najib claims it all did i i want to say this that the only reason why i accepted it because i had assurance you know from king abdullah that he would support me i do not have any knowledge beyond that please that is a fact not according to jolo he corroborates the us findings so i'll just give you the reality the reality is it is true that king abdullah actually agreed to give a donation to the pm but that was a small portion of a larger portion so i think what they're trying to do is take first section and paint it all over you know in general okay and jolo suggested a particular fellow fugitive could reveal what najib knew about the true origin of the money nick faisal had authority over najib's personal bank nick accounts point is he's happy to sign a statutory demonstration i'm going to make sure this that is consistent to the factual events and if that is agreed you know he'll sign it and then he just wants [Music] when it came to assets bought with one mdb funds jolo was determined that if he had to return his his co-conspirators must also return theirs i think the most challenging part is trying to identify the flows you know used to purchase all this jewelry in july 2013 najib's wife rosmar met jolo and a new york jeweler on another mega yacht in the mediterranean the u.s justice department asserts she was there to view a 22-carat pink diamond jolo paid 4 million dollars just to rent the yacht and a whopping 27 million dollars for the diamond for rosmar all from 1mdb money but incredibly the former prime minister maintains the jewel was a gift from sheikh mansour the brother of the crown prince of abu dhabi joe law presented this as a gift from shayman so okay there's a culture in the middle east that expensive presents are given [Music] when the police raided najib's home the pink diamond was nowhere to be found but some 12 000 other pieces of jewellery valued at more than 100 million dollars were according to jolo that's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to jewelry purchase for rosmar on the 1mdb expense account i don't have like an accurate number because i think you know this thing happened over time yeah but i believe you know the number is north of half a billion dollars there's a huge number come again how much the number i think is to track down the more than half a billion dollars worth of jewels jolo urged the mahathir administration to seek out rosmah's trusted shopping guru natasha mapuri and he sent copies of her and her husband's singaporean passports to help find her this natasha lady is the central person that literally kept books on everything definitely like she's the one person that would have records dating back years and years off and i'm pretty sure she kept it as leverage and the fugitive even suggested mapuri may have committed a crime i mean you know i think it's pretty easy because she did you know make money off uh you know i think things like that so i'm sure there can be like you know charges against if you wanted to but i mean y'all can figure out what's the best way [Music] in early 2019 the malaysian police placed mapuri on a wanted list she's still at large and most of the 500 million dollars worth of jewelry remains unaccounted for [Music] i mean that's a lot of bling right you know a lot of my kleptocrats liked portable assets and you know they could be spread out in safes in different countries they could be going into private auction and liquidating those assets even if you're getting 50 cents on the dollar and it was a half a billion that's a quarter of a billion so it's it's not you know it's not chump change coming up jolo betrays one mdb's partners in the middle east and reveals how he's protected by the united arab emirates and china" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="or Isahar thanks for joining us you're with the IDSF tell us about the IDSF and why you feel it's so important right now yeah good to be with you Chris um our mission is really to think about Israel's national security interests not for the next 5 minutes but the next five generations that's really what we do so our edge or added value would be our host of generals retired and reserved generals from the IDF Mossach and Bet police together with 40,000 Israelis who joined the movement they generally believe like myself I'm not big a big shot general but I came for the military and security industry and I uh firmly believe in Israel's right to self-defense and uh how we make sure that Israel thrives for generations that's through the education system by founding a a premilitary uh program of our own and through the speaking in high schools and giving uh policy papers and advice to to decision makers in Israel and abroad um all this combined media social media uh we became sort of a powerhouse of Israel's right to self-defense talking about self-defense right now the Trump administration is negotiating with Iran over their nuclear program uh do you have concerns about this i do but I think we we need to give the president a chance look I learned Farsy i have been studying Iran for several years now they're very good at what they're doing they understand very well that confronting the president is far less productive than sort of sweet talking him into a bad deal that's really the danger the sort of the sweet talk of Iran taking out one of the bizarre merchant you know haggling skills and they know what they're doing so basically they're trying to do three things they're trying to convince the president that a good that a bad deal is actually a good deal sort of not really dismantling the nuclear deal but giving vague promises number two they're offering business opportunities what do you know like let's you know doubling down and saying you know what let's construct 90 new nuclear power plants in Iran sort of making the president face a dilemma and number three trying to create daylight between Israel and the United States they recognize that Israel is the main roadblock to a deal or a bad deal um and they sort of try to accuse Israel for uh for um holding back the deal my fear is that either either two happens either a bad deal and sort of the anti-neocons in Washington so to speak will tempt the president into signing a bad deal or Iran simply fudges a time buys time it's a delay tactic it's a well well-known strategy and sort of clutches nuclear bombs uh under the radar in secret that's my main concern you talked about number two about 19 uh nuclear reactors in uh that's what she said and the foreign minister said you know what i mean this could be uh you know billions of dollars were up for grabs for American companies why not and I think he's trying to sort of la or allude to the sort of business background of the president i don't think the president is that naive and I I think he's disillusioned by Iran's sort of malign activity he saw how they tried to take his own life and and he knows very well he was the one of the you know main uh opponents of the original JCPOA deal uh by Obama so it remains to be seen but I think that he needs to lead a hard line against Iran demand accountability and if they fail to do so yes then yes military action is very much on the table so while these negotiations going on what position does that uh or dilemma does that give for Israel so Israel is currently facing a dilemma whether or not to sort of back up the efforts of the president into signing a deal and I do believe that Israel will have to face you know the reality of it which is the president wants a deal but he doesn't rule out military action we cannot compromise on Iran's nuclear program they have to absolutely demolish it uh otherwise there is a big shadow hovering over the Middle East they stated you know widely I mean openly that they intend to destroy Israel and they say it on a weekly basis and they act upon the promise i don't think we can risk it so uh Israel is facing either two e either one of two choices either we lead a military action and sort of update the president but I think with this president will be far more complicated we need to keep good relations or we sort of you know uh um provide backup to the president's efforts but in a way that will ensure the complete dismantlement of the nuclear program this is not something you can compromise on it's like sort of an arbitrary debate they threaten to destroy Israel with a whole host of nuclear weapons so that's not something that Israel can compromise on and uh the prime minister wants the Libyan model where all of the uh reactors centrifuges would be destroyed you you know that's interesting because Iranian the Iranians are are amazing at haggling and they know they even the Iranian government spokeswoman said we want to manage the narrative her words right so disinformation is some sort of a you know considered to be a bad word in today's day and age and I'd like to think of it as narrative engineering they try to control the narrative and they say look uh Israel is trying to offer the Libyan model he's trying to pull you away from like you know peace talks with Iran trying to prevent you from this amazing signature diplomatic achievement come to us build nuclear power plants and let's sign a deal that will be reasonable for both sides it doesn't work like that you cannot negotiate with terrorists uh this the dismantlement of their own weapons uh you can negotiate with them only to find out that in the end of the day they don't intend to dismantle the nuclear program they want to control the Middle East and becoming nuclear is their uh instrument to achieve that end how do you see the Middle East right now in terms of you have since October 7th how would you define what has happened since October 7th tectonic shift absolutely full stop i mean we saw how the war changed the way people see and feel you know the regional architecture security architecture uh me the Middle East air defense has proven very much on the table with the Iranian attack sort of Arab countries providing intelligence to US Sentcom against Iranian missile attacks on Israel and on them so I am optimistic about the Abraham Accords about normalization with Saudi Arabia maybe even normalization with Lebanon possibly with Syria this these things were unheard of so I think sort of reshuffling the cards and presenting us with novel ways to look at the region reach out to the Drews and Kurd minorities create a network of alliances between Israel and the pragmatic Arab world but there is one caveat to this which is the Iranian nuclear program you cannot have uh nuclear weapons in Iran the one reason why they're not going to fall peace with Israel yes they want some concessions on the Palestinian front we can talk about it definitely not a Palestinian state but we can talk about concessions with Iran there it's a no-go zone you need to destroy your nuclear program otherwise uh we can all start counting the minutes with the fall of the Assad regime and the rise of the new regime right there uh many people are concerned not only of that but also the rise of Turkey and its influence on Syria and its threats against Israel right so Syria cannot become a Turkish sphere of influence much like it used to be an Iranian sphere of influence and I think in that regard we should look at the rebels or I should say those who rebelled past tense now they are in power HDS and realize that they actually are a wolf in sheep clothing yes but they do have interests so I think the West can work with them but they need to need to show much more sobriety about it they want to bring back all the Syrian refugees back to Syria that's that's great ir Israel wants to maintain some sort of a cold ceasefire with the Ashara that's fine um let's not drag us all into war deliberately i don't think Ashara wants that number two the Drew community should defin be on the table and they're closed with Israel the fact that Netanyahu and Israel say whoever hurts the Drews hurts us that's amazing progress and number three Turkey as you said they cannot become the new landlords in the Middle East they shown quite a bit of a you know tough rhetoric i think Israel and Turkey should have some sort of emotus vendi learn how to live together it's not really Israel's fault it's Erdogan's hardline rhetoric um Netanyahu is a Hitler i'm going to invade Gaza and so on let's avoid this scenario and sort of ease and moderate Turkish the Turkish influence in Syria while uh building new regional alliances talking about Iran again how fragile is the regime and uh and how strong is any opposition against them and could an attack on the nuclear sites actually lead to the fall of the regime look I um I cannot predict the future but let's not even live in fantasy world uh I don't think the regime is in any danger right now anything can happen we learned that from October 7 my understanding is that the regime is very much stable and and nuclear weapons are the means for it to maintain power what Israel and the West the United States need to do is sort of disconnect the direct link between uh nuclear weapons and the survival of the regime they need to learn if they want to maintain the stability of the regime they need to throw out the nuclear program uh they their the nuclear program for them is an instrument to maintain the regime uh I can see there's opposition in Iran i can see that you know Iranian exiles sort of are very vocal in Western media and so on it's a nation of 90 million people it's half the size of Europe i don't foresee that happening anytime soon but I do think that the regime is very much stressed about that uh eventuality and um I don't know if that's a strategic goal for Israel or the West top of the regime i don't I think we should really be aware of that simply deny them the capability that's all no nuclear weapons no missile program yeah any other thoughts at war well I think we're facing really exciting times right now in the Middle East because the war is kind of a blitmas test sort of uh surfaced all those who are anti-semitic on the one hand or sort of anti-Israeli activists and the real interests of the region saudi Arabia all those countries who are much more programmatic than what we'd like to think and right now we can create interconnectivity in the Middle East we can create really an alliance of peace- seeeking nations inter interestbased coalition with the United States Israel and the pragmatic Arab world this is where we should be heading based on energy and on peace deals and on trade and trade routes the IMC the India Middle East Europe corridor all these things can really work to our benefit i hope we can make it happen hope so too or isart thanks for joining us thank you very much" />

United States was the focus of protests and commencement speeches this week as universities like Harvard held commencement ceremonies the Trump administration's now directed federal agencies to review all contracts with Harvard after it already cancelled nearly $3 billion in federal research grants for the university and moved last week to revoke its ability to enroll international students harvard has two separate suits pending against Trump arguing the moves violate due process as well as free speech protections under the First Amendment because they target the university staff curriculum and enrollment in his address at Harvard's commencement ceremony Thursday Stanford University professor doctor and novelist Abraham Bergiz praised the school's defiance of Trump and spoke to students facing threats of deportation or having their visas revoked when legal immigrants and others who are lawfully in this country including so many of your international students worry about being wrongly detained and even deported perhaps it's fitting that you hear from an immigrant like me perhaps it's fitting that you hear from someone who was born in Ethiopia when it was ruled by an emperor someone who then lived under the harsh military leader who overthrew the emperor someone who had at least who had at least one of his medical school classmates tortured and disappear more than a quarter of the physicians in this country are foreign medical graduates [Applause] so a part of what makes America great if I may use that phrase is that it allows an immigrant like me to blossom here just as generations of other immigrants and their children have flourished and contributed in every walk of life working to keep America great that's the novelist and medical doctor Ethiopian Indian American Dr abraham Vergiz addressing Harvard's commencement ceremony on Thursday his latest book The Covenant of Water meanwhile down the road in Cambridge the IndianAmerican class president at MIT the Massachusetts Institute of Technology spoke about how MIT's undergraduate body and graduate student union had voted overwhelmingly to cut ties with Israel mega Viruri wore a red and white kafia and said MIT students would never support a genocide and praised them for continuing to protest despite quote threats intimidation and suppression coming from all directions especially she said your own university officials last spring MIT's undergraduate body and graduate student union voted overwhelmingly to cut ties with the genocidal Israeli military you called for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and you stood in solidarity with the pro Palestine activists on campus you faced threats intimidation and suppression coming from all directions especially your own university officials but you prevailed because the MIT community that I know would never tolerate a genocide [Applause] right now while we prepare to graduate and move forward with our lives there are no universities left in Gaza we are watching Israel try to wipe Palestine off the face of the earth and it is a shame that MIT is a part of it the Israeli occupation forces are the only foreign military that MIT has research ties with this means that Israel's assault on the Palestinian people is not only aided and embedded by our country but our school as scientists engineers academics and leaders we have a commitment to

comes as Galani Cobb the dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism another school facing attacks by the Trump administration writes for the New Yorker magazine this week about how quote academic freedom in the United States has found itself periodically under siege in his piece headlined A tumultuous spring semester finally comes to a close he describes how he consulted with Ellen Shreker a historian and the author of No Ivory Tower McCarthyism in the Universities along with other deans at Colombia they spoke about government repression on college campuses in the 1950s through to the present shreker told him quote &quot;I've studied McCarthyism's impact on higher education for 50 years what's happening now is worse,&quot; he quoted her saying well we begin today with Ellen Shreker in person joining us in our New York studio she's the author of Many are the crimes McCarthyism in America No Ivory Tower McCarthyism and the Universities shreker is also the author of the right to learn resisting the right-wing attack on academic freedom and she just wrote a piece for the nation headlined worse than McCarthyism universities in the age of Trump shreker has been active in the American Association of University Professors AUP since the 1990s i should note she has three degrees from Radcliffe Harvard and formerly taught there she's a graduate of Radcliffe 1960 ellen Shreker welcome to Democracy Now it's great to have you with us um as we look at these universities under attack you've studied higher education for over half a century let's talk about what was happening then and what's happening today okay uh the main thing that happened then to universities was that about a hundred faculty members most of them with tenure were fired and blacklisted that happened in every major institution of civil society within the United States and although the uh universities pride themselves on academic freedom whatever that means uh they collaborated with the forces of repression uh through that were actively imposing a climate of fear and selfcensorship throughout American society today what's happening is worse so much worse that we have to really find a new phrase for it i don't know what it'll be but um during the McCarthy period it was attacking only individual professors and only about their sort of extracurricular political activities on the left uh in the past and in the present then present uh today the repression that's coming out of Washington DC it attacks everything that happens on American campuses i'd like you to start off we have a very young audience we also have their parents and their grandparents around the world and I'd like you to start off by talking about who McCarthy is what do we mean by the McCarthyism of for example the 1950s okay that's a very good way to start because McCarthyism unfortunately is misnamed it is not just the career of Senator Joseph McCarthy who came in onto the stage of history in 1950 after uh the ism that he gave his name to uh had been really dominating American domestic politics since the late 1940s 47 is when the Truman administration imposed a loyalty test uh an anti-communist loyalty test on its employees so uh if we wanted to name this phenomenon of political repression anti-communist political repression and I want to specify that it didn't attack randomly people on the left but very specifically people who had some kind of connection usually in the past with uh the communist movement uh that during the 1930s and 40s was the most dynamic dynamic force on the left even though it was a very flawed very flawed uh uh political group it was nonetheless uh very uh influential on the left and um if we wanted to give that political repression of the 1940s and50s a name it should have been Hooverism after the FBI director Jay Edgar Hoover um you know the move uh the movie Good Night and Good Luck um they showed real black and white footage of McCarthy and test audiences thought he was too harsh unrealistic not realizing it was actual footage and now you have Good Night and Good Luck on Broadway uh George Clooney starring in it um and it is the financially most successful Broadway show we've seen is going to be now for free on CNN in a few days but the significance of that that that what people feel today was a cartoon character was in fact much harsher and sharper than people ever dreamed yeah um he was beyond the pale because like the current president he had no guard rails as it were not to mention Roy Cohen his sidekick in the hearings who would later go on to mentor Donald Trump until at the very end of his life Donald Trump rejected him when he was dying of AIDS exactly so there are lots of similarities with the fact that uh there's this very aberrant character at the heart or at the uh sort of public heart in of this repressive movement but what we should have known in the 40s and 50s and should know now is it's not just a one-man show it has been this moment of trying to crack down on dissent constitutional disscent free speech uh the ability to say uh what Israel is doing in Gaza is a terrible thing uh that is something that has been uh building up for decades and what that was the same thing during McCarthyism there was a kind of network of right-wing activists uh similar to groups today like the Heritage Society that brought us the uh 2025 project blueprint for Trump's attack on the institutions of civil uh liberties and uh civil society uh that uh has come to fruition since he uh entered the White House so I mean you speak as a Jewish author active member of the American Association of University Professors would you say that the McCarthyism of yestery year is the charges that President Trump with his sidekick Elon Musk giving the Hal Hitler salute charging anti-semitism for what he's doing anti-semitism is a pretext we know that Trump has been all his life a racist uh clearly befriending these uh fascist individuals and groups uh for years and uh what we're seeing is a kind of uh a melding of uh Trump's own uh right-wing proclivities reactionary proclivities pro-fascist proclivities with a uh long-term attempt within some pro-Zionist organizations to eliminate uh all uh uh support for Palestinian freedom and Palestinian liberation from American uh universities uh in particular but from uh within American society you have uh earlier this month a federal judge Jeffrey Crawford ordering uh the release of Columbia University graduate Palestinian activist Mosan Madawi from uh prison in Vermont he was picked up by masked hooded ICE agents at his naturalization interview in Vermont he was beyond holding a green card um the judge writing in his ruling quote &quot;Our nation's seen times like this before especially during the Red Scare and Palmer raids of 1919 1920 and during the McCarthy period of the 1950s and I I wanted to take it beyond that um you note that you know that we're not just talking about individual professors anymore we're talking about current attacks being much broader and you write that um this interesting paradox quote despite higher education's much larger footprint within American society today the academy is in a much weaker position to resist political intervention why is it weaker it's weaker for two reasons one because the state is stronger the state does much more in with regard to higher education than it did in the 1950s you know it supports most important basic scientific research it regulates things on campus with regard to uh shall we say diversity equity and inclusion uh with trying to uh ensure that all Americans have a good shot at higher education that was a push by the federal government so you can see that uh the government is much more involved it funds student loans most uh smaller universities without huge endowments rely on students who have to get federal loans in order to pay tuitions so what he's doing by withdrawing federal money from higher education is essentially threatening to destroy American higher education today i wanted to turn to the clip of Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaking in March following the arrest of the Colombia graduate student now graduated graduate student albeit he was in jail in Louisiana when he got his diploma at Colombia mahm Khalil if you tell us when you apply hi I'm trying to get into the United States on a student visa i am a big supporter of Hamas a murderous barbaric group that kidnaps children that rapes teenage girls that takes hostages that allows them to die in captivity that returns bo more bodies than live hostages if you tell us that you are in favor of a group like this and if you tell us when you apply for your visa and by the way I intend to come to your country as a student and rile up all kinds of anti-Jewish student anti-Semitic activities I intend to shut down your universities if you told us all these things when you applied for a visa we would deny your visa i hope we would if you actually end up doing that once you're in this country on such a visa we will revoke it and if you end up having a green card not citizenship but a green card as a result of that visa while you're here in those activities we're going to kick you out of course uh the Trump administration not proven any of this um and a number of students have been released from prison with very angry judges talking about where are the grounds for these people to be imprisoned mahmood Khalil has been now imprisoned for three months as his little baby was born um here in New York uh if you can talk about what this leads to these kind of harsh attacks when it comes to speech and when it comes to universities you were just addressing the deans at Columbia University some compare Harvard not uh fighting Harvard fighting back against the Trump administration and Colombia conceding and the pressure it's put on its students yeah um this has been a constant in the history of American higher education to collaborate with political repression uh they universities do not fight back they didn't fight back during the McCarthy period they're not were not fighting back until of this miracle it really was a miracle totally unexpected of the president at Harvard saying no I cannot uh go along with what you were asking and what they were asked the Jewish president right Alan Garber who um President Trump has accusing of anti-semitism well of course we're all anti-semites as long as we feel that maybe you shouldn't be killing babies in uh Gaza every day but uh what we're seeing is the beginning of a push back against uh what Trump is doing what his entire apparatus of hoodlams I think is trying to do to the universities and that wonderful quote you had from Secretary of State Rubio when he said you know paraphrasing these supposed terrorists that they wanted to shut down the universities he's doing more to shut down the universities than probably anybody else in America at this moment threatening to revoke the visas of all international students what about the role of your organization the AAUP the American Association of University Professors we are a group that is over a hundred years old and when we were founded it was a period very much like today where outsiders politicians and especially very wealthy business people uh on boards of trustees were interfering with what faculty members were saying and doing with regard to at that point there was a lot of labor unrest and attempts to create unions and university professors were sort of saying well look at the working conditions under which uh American workers are are uh being uh oppressed uh let's do something about industrial accidents and things like that uh today we're seeing uh that uh in every way uh the federal government state legislators interfering with the academic work of university professors and that is what my organization is trying to do is to protect the integrity and the educational value of what goes on on American campuses do you hold out hope in this last minute we have together uh yes because unfortunately we have no model we can follow from McCarthyism because there was no push back but today we're seeing people marching to commencement at Harvard uh wearing labels saying you know enough is enough President Trump we're seeing uh huge crowds showing up to welcome uh Mosen coming back from uh Vermont after having been picked up by ICE we're seeing a growing movement within civil society that has to be maintained and has to be maintained for years i mean the damage that the Trump administration is doing is absolutely beyond the pale and has never never been equaled in American life with regard to higher education so we've got to get out there in the trenches and even begin to think some more about okay if they're not paying attention to the judges if the Supreme Court folds and let us pray that it does not um what do we have to do we're going to have to leave it there ellen Shreker author of Many Are the Crimes: McCarthyism in America No Ivory Tower MacArthurism and the Universities also the author of The Right to Learn: Resisting the Right-wing Attack on Academic Freedom we'll link to your piece in the Nation headlined Worse Than McCarthyism Universities in the Age

          <attvalue for="7" value="hold on tight guys cuz today we're talking about  one of the boldest and most talked about Mossad   operations ever to take place the incredible the  elaborate the complex assassination of Isma deep   in the heart of Tehran and the reason we're here  talking about this today is because this operation   showcases the ability of the Israeli Mossad to  penetrate deep into the heart of Tehran under   the nose of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps  to carry out an execution against Ismael Hine one   of the heads of Hamas inside a compound that  is supposed to protect the very guests of the   Iranian Revolutionary Guard this is the kind  of operation that up till now it's been over   a year since this took place that till this very  moment still puts fear in the hearts of people   still the enemies of Israel wake up sweaty at  night thinking that this too might happen to   them so today we break down this incredible  story this is a new version of a story we   call it boots on the ground explainers trying  to break down the incredible stories behind   the news of what happens here in this part of  the world now before we go any further pause   for a second and make sure you like share and  subscribe so you never miss another one of these videos okay so here's what happened in this  operation this is a really interesting story   make sure uh to watch this through the end because  it's unbelievable how this was carried out so   first of all let's start with who was Ismael  Hane well Ismael is one of the symbolic heads   of the Hamas terrorist organization and was so  for many many years but for the majority of that   time he wasn't on the top of the target list  for the Israeli forces or Israeli intelligence   organizations because he resided mostly outside  of Israel outside of Judea and Samaria and outside   of the Gaza Strip and wasn't considered to be  a immediate threat to the state of Israel or   the people of Israel much higher on the list were  names like Muhammad def an arch terrorist you know   that resided in different places but then in in uh  in the Gaza Strip uh let's call it the head of the   military arm the man who carried out executed  and planned the October 7th attacks uh and ha   is something different he is this very symbolic  character he's the head of sort of the diplomatic   office of the kamas and he resides mostly in  Qatar or Dha the capital of Katala a small uh   a small country or oil kingdom uh in the Arabian  Sea and this is where the story gets interesting   this all changes on the day of October 7th 2023  when Israel is attacked by kamas who invade our   land break through our borders uh murder mutilate  assassinate uh and kidnap the citizens of this   country everything changes on uh for the state of  Israel and a decision is made that also this man   uh hane also needs to be removed from the table  he's one of the people behind the scenes working   on this he's one of the people uh funneling  the money in and that means he no longer gets   uh to reside with the rest of humanity because of  what he did so here's what happened on July 31st   2024 so about a year plus uh ago uh the end of  the story is is Ha who's sleeping inside a guarded   compound in the heart of Tehran the capital of  Iran mysteriously blows up by an explosive charge   and let me contextualize what is happening here  he's in Iran for ceremonies related to someone   else who was assassinated uh Kasamsulimmani  anyway long story uh he's in uh in Iran as a   dignitary who's visiting and he's sleeping within  a compound controlled by the Iranian Revolutionary   Guard Corps an important party to remember here  and what they do they're sort of the executive   arm let's call it of the the Islamic government  or the radical Islamic government that rules   the country of Iran and is their official  guest traveling on business as they say   uh to Iran he's sleeping within a very guarded  very secure compound this is a place he's visited   before multiple times and as he sleeps there a  charge goes off killing him and injuring others   in the area and the big story here is how did the  Mossad get to Isma initially it's expected to be   and the Iranian government if I remember correctly  even says that it was an accident that had to do   with a gas leak or some madeup story along those  lines but very quickly uh the facts come out the   the facts surface and it's clear that likely the  Israeli Mossad and possibly others were behind   this assassination and think about this picture  one of our biggest enemies the Iranians in the   heart of their capital Thran in the most guarded  compound that they control that their elite   forces the RGC controls one of their top guest is  eliminated by Israeli intelligence and what that   tells you is the level of penetration that took  place into the int intelligence apparatus of the   RGC the level of intelligence that we were able  to extract in that time and the level of lethality   uh that our intelligence organization is  able to carry out this isn't something of   uh um let's call it a a nuclear scientist who's  um blown up on the way to one of their nuclear   facilities this isn't a guy who lives in Iran this  is a visitor that in exact timing as he's entering   into a guarded compound is assassinated by again  the Israeli intelligence organization so h how   does this happen so the facts are mind-blowing it  turns out that months before this visit Israeli   intelligence and again I don't know if this is  Israelis on the ground in Iran or Iranians that   were hired or convinced or someone else uh a bomb  was planted in the very bedroom that Ismael Hane   was going to sleep in and this bomb is planted in  a way that even though they look for bugs and they   sweep these rooms and there's security everywhere  all the time uh in many many different ways a bomb   is planted in a way that is it goes undiscovered  for multiple months and again let's get to how   this thing works when he enters the room we get  intelligent that he is indeed within the room in   the bed he's supposed to be in and then a charge  is remotely detonated so there's communication   going in and out of this compound uh that wasn't  caught there's a bomb that was planted multiple   months before that wasn't spotted even though they  swept this room and searched for it multiple times   they didn't have exact information but they have  security protocols in place for these kind of   things and even though all these things were done  the Israeli intelligence was able to eliminate   him in his sleep in the heart of this compound  so there's another point here that I forgot to   make which is that part of the reason that Israel  decides to go after Ismia in a more aggressive   manner is because it becomes very apparent when  the October 7th war breaks out that he isn't just   this figurine that stands in the head of the  organization the man is is deeply uh involved   in the planning the execution and the funding of  the egregious acts of terrorism against Israel in   October 7th and because of that it's clear what  needs to be done with him he needs to be removed   from every position of influence and also removed  uh from a citizen of this earth and that's exactly   what happens to him i think this is a just and  understandable action and it was also done as a   show of power by Israeli intelligence to send a  clear message that any terrorist and especially   the leaders of terrorist organizations that comes  against Israel his fate his uh his uh justice will   meet him sooner rather than later we need to ask  another question which is why this assassination   takes place inside Iran and not in another  country so Isma travels mostly in three different   locations he resides in Dhaqatar so within a  country Qatar is a tricky relationship uh because   Qatar is both a what we call it a friendmy of the  state of Israel uh they're the people behind El   Jazzer they're the people that funded Kamas but  they're not purely enemies of the state of Israel   they've even been involved on multiple levels in  much of the negotiations that have taken place   between Israel and between Hamas and other uh  entities Palestinian entities uh over past year so   they're not distinctly an enemy and it would have  jeopardized the relationship with them to try and   assassinate him in Katal proper another option is  Turkey he frequented Turkey turkey by the way for   many years was a uh sort of safe haven for kamas  high level delegates but again Turkey is a very   big a very powerful another friendmy of the state  of Israel and even though they've been on the path   of escalation the path of uh ever escalating  violence against the state or the people of   Israel it's not official war we still do negotiate  with them we still do cooperate with them and I'd   say in a larger scheme of things are also to a  certain degree allies of many European countries   and the Americans and they're not the kind of  country you want to carry out assassinations or   targeted attacks uh on its own soil it would  be an absolutely huge uh diplomatic incident   or and that leaves us with Iran iran as funny as  it may seem uh assassinating someone on the soil   of Iran isn't high stakes for Israel they're our  sworn enemies uh this comes from them by the way   not from us we have nothing personal against them  but their entire uh agenda their entire philosophy   is all about destroying Israel and destroying the  US uh so we would have no problem carrying out an   attack on their soil and we've done so many times  before and thus the uh location is chosen to carry   out an assassination within Iran so one might ask  ourselves how did Israel know that Hanya was going   to be in the exact room in the exact compound on  that date and time and this is where I think he   sort of handed us a unfair advantage uh it turns  out he was a creature of habit and I guess the   Iranians were too in in the way they uh hosted him  where he would repeatedly visit the same compound   and possibly stay in the exact same room and I  say this because it is possible and I don't know   this as a fact that there was more than one bomb  but what we do know is that he repeatedly came   back to the same place uh at least seven or eight  prior times to this visit which allowed us to plan   uh plant the bomb plan the attack plant the  bomb uh and then carry it out knowing that he   just was a creature of habit and kept going back  to the same uh place uh I think most people that   try you know that know that there's a target on  their back they try not to create a pattern that   is predictable and in this case it really played  into the hands of the Israeli Mossad the fact that   Haniah did exactly that carried out a pattern  that was repetitive and predictable so right   before we go into the events of the the night  of the attack uh on Isaiah that that ended the   life of Ismaia Israel's sworn enemy I want you  to pause this video for just a second uh after   I say this next bit uh and consider supporting  this channel i don't say this lightly uh we keep   running because of the support of viewers like  you and this channel has seen growth and it's seen   uh incredible you know response over the past 18  months but for multiple years now we deeply value   every type of support that we received and I want  to ask you to take just one second and consider   supporting this channel TBN Israel to keep helping  us create content and tell the truth from Israel   that is something that now now more than ever is  needed around the world and we need you at home   to help us keep that happening there's a link at  the bottom of the screen uh in the description   of every single video that we create it doesn't  take much just a small donation and especially an   ongoing small donation makes a huge difference the  operation was planned down to the last detail an   explosive device larger than originally planned  due to technical constraints was planted in   Hania's room in advance in fact multiple months  in advance as we know now that means Mossad's   shadow operatives bypassed security undetected  and gained unrestricted access without arousing   any suspicion for multiple months the MSAD created  an entry into the room into the facility and into   the room itself to plant the charge and then were  able to conceal its location for multiple months   but at the last moment everything almost blew up  pun intended due to a simple technical malfunction   the air conditioner in Ha's room broke down and  he had to leave imagine that just seconds before   the detonation the operation was hanging by just  a thread there was a concern his room would be   replaced but in the end the AC was repaired  and he returned to his original room until   he ascended to heaven or wherever he went around  1:30 a.m so in the middle of the night a massive   explosion shook the quiet compound understand  this in a hospitality facility there's a first   aid team they hear the blast and rush inside  only to find a scene I don't think any of them   imagined they would find after about a minute the  medical team pronounces him dead so clearly there   wasn't much consideration over situation  the precision assassination in the heart   of Tehran s unprecedented panic in the Iranian  leadership and understandably so the Kud's force   commander Kani disappears for three entire weeks  essentially going underground for fear of his own   assassination no one saw him if Khani is scared  it's as if the whole regime is expressing fear   from the situation the question still troubling  the Iranian leadership today is as it was many   months ago when this took place who helped the  Mossad in this complex operation and if you   want to know too click the subscribe button cuz  we're about to tell you so the big question that   the Iranian uh Revolutionary Guard the Iranian  government has in their head after this takes   place is how did they do it and you would say well  here's the technical details and stuff like that   but that's not really the question how does the  MSA Mossad gain access to get the intelligence   needed how do they get into the room how do they  get out of the room and how do they maintain   communication and knowledge of what's happening  in there and this all summarizes or boils down to   one word that's called a mole clearly there was a  mole or multiple moles within Iranian intelligence   organizations which is what allowed Israel to gain  that level of access and that level of information   and since this has happened you know it's very  hard to to underestimate how much panic and how   much fear this put in the heart of the Iranian  government they go on this witch hunt looking   for moles etc but just imagine in your head the  level of distrust and level of fear that it gives   people to see such a thing happen and I think  that's a logical thing i mean after the attack   of October 7th that Iran is absolutely behind to  a certain degree hamas executed but it was part of   their greater plan and after decades of fighting  against Israel it makes sense that this is the   kind of response they would get and I think on a  psychological level this seems like an incredibly   successful operation seems that an operation of  this magnitude couldn't have been carried out   without significant help from the inside from  inside Iran and the Iranian government this   kind of thing requires a network of operational  capabilities and apparently something involved   many people betraying their country by the way  knowingly or unknowingly cuz if you've tracked   the MO of the Mossad over the years they've been  very very clever about doing these kind of things   without people knowing they're helping Israel  and when you think about Supreme Leader Kamayi   uh hearing that this happened under his watch  within his country I mean forget the fear you   know they they did the usual thing of saying  &quot;Let's attack Israel let's retaliate Israel.&quot; Uh   but there's a huge embarrassment here where Israel  is able to penetrate deep into the organization uh   and they realize that whatever missiles whatever  forces they have were still able to work within   their cities themselves and this kind of operation  is exactly what tells us the incredible story of   the Israeli Mossad how time and time again and the  stories are countless we're going to go into many   of them in the future time and time again the  Mossad is able to reach the enemies of Israel   at the farthest corners of the earth and do so  quietly and without leaving tracks behind in fact   unless our minister of defense at the end of last  year would have publicly admitted that we were   behind this it wouldn't have been known till this  time that Israel was officially behind this attack   i think we're at the end of this video if you've  lasted so long thank you and thank you for being   with us take one more moment to like share and  subscribe to this channel and if you are a praying   person put in a

          <attvalue for="7" value="the plan as we've heard it now was simple smuggle 100 or so Ukrainian drones behind enemy lines along with specially modified containers built to deploy those drones load those containers onto the backs of trucks drive them right up to Russian air bases then open the retractable roofs outfly the drones packed with explosives and the rest is now history ukraine says it carried out largecale drone attacks on multiple air bases truly something out of a spy movie a reminder despite Russia's overwhelming strength in numbers that Ukraine is a resourceful determined enemy ukrainian and Russian social media are now filled with video like this circulating widely claiming to show the attacks and the damage from them according to Ukraine's domestic intelligence agency the attack caused 7 billion worth of damage badly compromised Russia's strategic cruise missile capability and according to Ukraine's president involved a level of covert infiltration of Russian territory that if true might even be more daring than the attack itself i'll explain dubbed Operation Pavutina or spiderweb Ukraine's goal was to do maximum damage to a part of Russia's war machine that has been in a very real way almost untouchable until now more than 40 aircraft are known to have been hit including strategic bombers and one of Russia's very few remaining surveillance planes the target Russian warplanes capable of hitting Ukraine from very long range so able to fight without ever actually entering Ukrainian airspace and staying therefore well out of range of anti-aircraft fire this required more than a year and a half of planning and organization according to Ukraine's president and once put in motion the suggestion seemed to be the whole thing could have unraveled at any moment the FSB that's Russian intelligence specifically counter intelligence and surveillance by Ukraine's account the operation took root right under Russia's nose you're hiding right under the nose of the giant the last place the FSB is likely to look is the apartment building across the street now at this stage I should warn you we are getting into the realm of details the ultra clandestine stuff that's just impossible for us to independently verify where possible I'll make clear where we're getting our information from just so you can judge for yourself but just remember these are two countries at war and in every attack there's not just strategic value but also propaganda value so let's keep that in mind okay so Ukraine's president says 117 drones were used in the attack at least some or potentially all of which would have been smuggled in from Ukraine according to the Associated Press but we should bear in mind that these are relatively smalls size flying bombs in effect so putting them together in a container or distributing them among different loads would not be such a huge task but then actually making sure that they were ready to fly and preparing for the attack completely undetected by Russia's own security and intelligence services would have been a more complex task we can see from these unverified photos that those drones were eventually hidden in the roofs of these large wooden containers some media have described them as sheds except the roofs are retractable by remote control which would allow those drones to fly straight up and out and towards their targets so in theory once these containers were fully loaded with explosive carrying drones they could be loaded onto the backs of trucks driven to the outer perimeters of Russian air bases far far away from the Ukrainian front line the roofs pulled back and out come the drones flying straight to their targets russian intelligence apparently none the wiser all of that is a very complex operation which could have gone wrong at any number of stages we've heard different reports of how these drones have been being controlled there's been a lot of talk of ill use of AI for managing and for targeting and locating the targets but we've also heard that they were individually controlled by people actually sitting in Ukraine this photo posted by Ukrainian intelligence shows one facet of this plan a layout of the airfield to be attacked and overhead imagery of the specific targets these red X's possibly marking weak points fuel tanks most often in the wings sometimes in the fuselage that if hit could make the plane a complete loss and several videos show in real time what these attacks might have looked like how much damage they might have caused and what vulnerabilities they might have uncovered electronic warfare systems air defense systems those are quite expensive and the Russians don't have the capacity to be able to defend the entirety of the depth of Russia with those systems russia will have been prepared for nighttime missile and drone attacks against their aircraft in a specific range from Ukraine what they won't have been prepared for is an open daylight attack using these short range drones that had to get very close to the target and also of course at ranges that were immensely greater let me show this to you on a map because Russia's Ministry of Defense has confirmed the attack identifying five regions that were targeted all within a very short span of time now two things worth pointing out here first that Russia says it repelled attacks at these locations this contradicts the Ukrainian account which is that four bases were successfully hit but the other thing worth pointing out here and what makes this attack so incredible is along the lines of what you just heard how far from the war some of these bases are thousands and thousands of kilometers away from the front line deep within Russian territory the range of this attack is so important because it shows that there's no place you can park these strategic bombers that Ukraine can't theoretically reach so what that means is it's it's changed the chessboard and Russia has to decide where do we move these planes now in order to keep them safe but now let's talk about what Russia has reportedly lost [Music] the number widely cited now by Ukrainian defense analysts and security sources but which we can't independently confirm is that more than 40 Russian warplanes with long range strike capability were hit among them the Russian TU95 originally designed to carry nuclear weapons but since reconfigured to fire cruise missiles from very far away they take off they reach a certain altitude they open their Bombay doors and then Russian missiles come out of them and have long glide paths to be able to get into Ukraine and also at higher altitudes altitudes that make it difficult for anti-air to hit them it's long been recognized that the best Ukrainian approach would be to actually eliminate these flights in the first place and that is what Ukraine has done in spectacular fashion take a major chunk out of the fleet of aircraft that Russia has been using to pummel its cities according to Ukraine security service the attack hit 34% of strategic cruise missile carriers parked at Russia's various air bases and experts say these will be difficult to replace maybe even difficult to repair they no longer produce these bombers uh and they have a limited amount of uh parts in order to repair them so a large chunk of whatever was hit this weekend is going to stay inoperable there's just no way around it now what we will only come to understand with time is just how big of a setback for Russia's war effort this really is ukraine has had other similar surprise successes the sinking of the Mosva the flagship of the Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet was one the invasion of Russia's Kursk territory was another but Ukraine remains at least militarily very vulnerable what this is however is a major propaganda coup one of the biggest problems Ukraine faces is a widesread assumption outside the country that it is on the ropes that Russia is winning that Ukraine only has a certain amount of time before it will have to surrender this will be a major breakthrough in terms of showing that Ukraine is very much still in the fight and is able to carry that fight to Russia and let me point out one more thing about the timing this attack came just hours before Ukrainian and Russian negotiators were set to meet in Istanbul to discuss among many things how to make a ceasefire real experts say hopes were never high for these talks to begin with but if Russia has been hesitant to make serious concessions up until this point it's hard to know how its stance may change or perhaps harden after what Ukraine has just done to it [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="In late summer 2022, Russia was trying to surround and destroy Ukraine's main force in the Donbas in a grand encirclement from north, south and east. Ukraine wanted to stop this, so planned a two-stage assault to break up the northern flank. First, a diversionary attack was launched on the city of Kherson, in the south. That drew in some of Russia's best units, before a second assault was launched eastwards out of the city of Kharkiv. In a little over a month, this lightning offensive reclaimed 5,000 square miles of territory, and rattled Putin so badly that we now know he considered dropping a nuclear bomb in order to stop it. This is the Kharkiv counter-attack, and this is Battle Board.&#10;&#10;#battleboard #kharkiv #counterttack #ukraine #russia" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="this is the kiv Counterattack the single most successful offensive that Ukraine has ever mounted which saw it recapture 5,000 square mil of territory in a little over a month we're going to analyze the offensive and the tactics behind it in just a moment but first let's look at the Ukrainian plan this is Ukraine as it was in August 2022 Kev is over here Russia is over here and here are the areas occupied by Putin's troops at the time Russia's attack on the Ukrainian Capital has failed but it has taken the city of marup and is now trying to capture the rest of the dbass region located here to do that Russian generals are trying to encircle Ukrainian troops in this area with a three-pronged attack from the south north and east the ukrainians want to stop that from happening so they are planning two attacks of their own the first is down here in hant this is the only Regional Capital that Russia has captured since the beginning of the war and the only city it occupies to the west of the denpro river it is therefore important but also vulnerable because it is separated from the rest of Russia's Army by the river in August Ukraine loudly announces that it is going to attack the city and begins massing troops in the area but this attack is actually a clever ruse designed to draw some of Russia's best units out of the East and into the South Russia takes the bait and throughout August almost all of its best trained and equipped units are moved the stage is now set for Ukraine's second secret attack a sweeping charge East out of kiv and across the northern flank of Russia's donbass assault among the key targets are Logistics bases like balac clear and Chev chanov River Crossings like those at kupiansk and horok Katka and headquarters located in ium the aim is to sever crucial supply lines fueling the donbass assault saving these soldiers from being encircled and destroyed on August 29th Ukraine launches the haon phase of the operation claiming an immediate breakthrough and making sure the eyes of the world and especially Russia are focused down here that opens the door for the second phase of the operation to get away almost unnoticed up here this is the battle where after months on the defensive Ukraine took the fight to Russia with devastating results this is the HEV counter offensive and this is Battle Board here is Ukraine's harv region as it looked in the late summer of 2022 the city of harv is here the oscill river is here the cerski donet river is here and here are the areas Russia occupies just a few weeks ago there were around 18,000 Russian troops gathered in this this area but the hon diversion has roughly halfed that number to Just 9,000 in the north around the village of Chev chovet are the 36th 254th 488th motor rifle and the 59th tank Brigade in the area around balac clear the 18th and 27th motor rifle brigades the 47th tank some Russian national guard units and troops from Russia's national military Reserve they are joined by the sth motor rifle Brigade and 202nd Reserve Brigade of the luhansk People's Republic and the Ninth Marine assault Brigade of the donet People's Republic these are sham governments set up by Russia in the occupied parts of donbass that may look like a lot of units but these are some of the weakest that Russia has at its disposal they are short on men equipment and fighting experience in fact the only Elite unit in the whole area is the 137th Airborne regiment in the South near the city of IAM are fewer but better formations the 37th and 423rd motor rifle and the fifth and 13th tank Brigade facing them down is a Ukrainian assault Force the Alexander sersi the general who would later Mastermind The Assault on K has built up right under their noses this force is divided into three sectors in the north he has positioned the 14th mechanized Brigade along with the 103rd 112th and 113th territorial defense brigades in the South are the 71st Air Assault the 518th Special Forces 10th Mountain assault and 107th territorial defense brigades along with the second and third volunteer battalions and the 132nd reconnaissance Battalion and in the center leading the charge are the 25th Airborne 80th Air Assault third and fourth tank 92nd and 93rd mechanized brigades along with the Kraken Special Forces these troops are equipped with lots of armored vehicles including American Humvees and mraps and Soviet era bmps and btrs making them extremely fast and mobile they are backed up by artillery units wielding some of the Best Western kit that Ukraine had available at the time polish Crab German panah halza and British fh7 guns firing NATO standard artillery shells along with American High Mars and m270 rocket launchers all in all we think this Force totals around 18,000 men meaning the ukrainians Outnumber the Russians roughly 2 to1 though exact figures are very hard to get hold of on September 4th a week after the hon assault gets underway in the South cersi begins his attack in the north with a huge artillery bombardment for 2 days straight Ukraine pounds Russian command posts and ammo dumps in this region hitting shev Chen kov bacle and kupiansk one High m strike on IIM even manages to Kill Colonel Boris tokov commander of all Russian Artillery units in this area this reeks Havoc behind the Russian lines and once cersi senses that his opponents are in disarray he launches the ground assault the initial aim is to create a gap which the elite 8th and 25th Air Assault can punch through right here in the dawn hours of September the 6th Ukrainian troops in the north attack towards the key Logistics Hub of shenen kov the Russians try to block this attack by moving into the town of chalov but at the last moment the ukrainians swing around this town and it is now the Russians who are blocked from moving any further south meanwhile in the South kraken's Special Forces accompanied by the 71st air assault and third tank pinned down the 137th in the town of bacle another assault towards the town of savian pulls in Russian units in this area and bogs them down in fighting on the banks of the cerski donet river with both flanks now pinned down the Gap that the main Force has been waiting for is wide open led by the 25th and 80th Air Assault they break through Russian lines right here north of balaca rather than charge the enemy head on the ukrainians used their fast armed vehicles to cut through Russian lines before unloading troops behind them these soldiers then double back to surround the Defenders causing the inexperienced troops to panic if they are able to they flee if not they surrender the vehicles keep moving giving the Russians no time to regroup and the following morning they take the town of Lo if y these troops are now clean through the main Russian defensive line and can spread out into the poorly defended rear the 25th and 80th now split up the former continues the charge northward and the following day takes the town of sheriff chanov the latter swings southwards trying to cut off Russian troops in bakle fearing they are about to be surrounded the Russians try to retreat back towards the town of savian but the retreat turns into a disorganized route as the ukrainians begin launching ambushes on the fleet troops even when they reach savan the Russians are not safe Ukrainian forces in the South again move to block them in allowing the 25th and 80th to rejoin and push through the center by Nightfall on September the 8th this Vanguard has reached more or less all the way to the oscill river in the north Ukrainian troops managed to push the Russians out of chalov the 36th motor rifle and 59th tank Brigade flee all the way back across the Russian border while the 254th and 488th motor rifle bades High tail it back to kopans with the ukrainians hot on their tail meanwhile in the South the 93rd Brigade flanks around Russian units in savan most units managed to avoid the Trap but the elite 137th get surrounded in the town rather than give up the paratroopers choose to fight to the death and are completely wiped out on September the 9th Ukrainian troops in the north succeed in pushing Russian troops out of the western half of kopans they capture most of the Town intact and raise their flag over it but the bridge is destroyed in the fighting meanwhile in the center the 80th Brigade swings South and races towards the other crucial River Crossing of horo Katka managing to take it and its Bridge intact reinforcements which were being rushed to the front line from inside Russia are now stuck on the Eastern side of the oscill river in the South Ukrainian troops Bear Down on ium the main Russian command center for the entire Northern flank of its donbass assault fearing a complete encirclement a hasty Retreat is ordered along the one road Russia still controls Russian commanders saved their own skins first then the following day on September 10th they they issue orders for their soldiers to follow them this Retreat is far more orderly as the Russians use artillery and land mines to stop the ukrainians ambushing them as they go 2 days later on September the 12th the ukrainians have captured all territory on the western side of the oscill river in just a week Ukraine's men have recaptured more than 2,000 square miles about the size of the state of Delaware but they're not done yet rather than dig begin Ukraine rearms and prepares for Phase 2 this is the wider kiv and donbas region here's the area we've just seen Ukraine recapture here is the ill River and Russia still occupies all of this territory following the collapse of their old defensive line Putin's men are now trying to organize a new one running from lman in the South to the half of kupan they still control in the north defending the Northern end of the line are the remains of the 18th 254th and 488th motor rifle brigades and some Russian national guard they have been joined by reinforcements from the third Army Corp which have been rushed into Ukraine fresh from the training ground in Russia in the South are the 53rd and 752nd motor rifle regiments along with a unit of Russian Splat Special Forces two units of Russian military reservists and units from the LPR and DPR that survived the initial Onslaught all in all including reinforcements Russia probably has somewhere between 7,000 and 10,000 men spread out along this front line As for the ukrainians in the north are the 25th Airborne 14th and 92nd mechanized brigades and the Kraken special forces in the center is the 8th Air Assault Brigade while Ukraine's Southern flank has been reinforced by units that were previously holding back Russia's attack Southward from ium these include the 79th and 95th Air Assault brigades the 81st air mobile the 66th and 30th mechanized and the 103rd territorial defense Brigade having suffered few casualties in the opening phase of the attack Ukrainian forces now likely number more than 20,000 they have already accomplished their original goal of stopping Russia's assault on the donbass by capturing izy but rather than let their enemies dig in and perhaps launch another attack from Li man they're going to try and break their defensive lines a second time their first success comes in the north where small units are able to cross the oscill river and get behind the Russians these are only Scouts but the jumpy Russians assume their enemies have got the drop on them again and Scatter that allows the ukrainians to cross the river in force and by September the 16th they've captured the whole of kupat in the South Ukrainian forces also waste no time in getting across the osil and the cerski donet river and by September the 19th almost all forces are on the Russian side however Russian forces down here are much more organized than those in the North and the advance quickly bogs down on the outskirts of lman again rather than take their foe head on the ukrainians send the 95th air assault and part of the 81st to flank around the city to the north just as happened in phase one they find a weak point and successfully break through into the Russian rear where they spread out kev's men now tighten the news and by September the 30th lman has been almost totally surrounded with 5 and a half thousand Russian troops still inside their commanders should have given the order to retreat days ago but held off trying to save face that indecision proves fatal by the time they give the order just one road towards Kina is still open but well within range of Ukrainian guns soldiers try to sneak out under the cover of Darkness but by the time the sun comes up on October the 1st they are still on the move and shells quickly rain down on top of them the retreat turns into a massacre the true death toll is unknown but some Russian units are thought to have lost 34 of their men with L man and kupan now in Ukraine's hands Russia's second defensive line unravels the 80th Air Assault crosses the river at hakka and sweeps North by October the 4th it has captured more or less the entire East Bank Ukrainian forces also push outwards from kopans and Chase Russia into the surrounding Countryside the Russians are once again on the run but the ukrainians need to be careful they have advanced a long way in a very short time their supply lines are stretched and the further they move the more vulnerable the units at the front become if the Russians manage to get in behind them they risk not only losing all the territory they've already gained but at the attacking Force being destroyed for that reason in mid- October Ukraine's commanders give the order to Halt just short of the cities of sesk and Lans the Russians bring up more reinforcements and ultimately stabilize the front line running from the city of crina at the southern end up to svka at its northernmost point in a little over a month Ukraine has pulled off a stunning offensive that has retaken 5,000 square miles of territory about the size of Connecticut including 500 Villages towns and cities as Russia fled its troops abandon scores of armored vehicles tanks and artillery guns along with tons of ammunition which Ukraine can now use itself in fact Ukraine has captured so many tanks that it now has more of them than it had at the start of the war after months on the defensive Ukraine has proved it can go on the attack a much harder task and retake territory from the Russians meanwhile the humiliating defeat forces Russia to rethink its entire war effort Putin sacks a slew of high-profile commanders and appoints Sergey Surin a tyrant nicknamed General Armageddon to oversee the war effort instead the Russian despot is also forced to call up Russia's military reserves press ganging 300,000 people into the Armed Forces to make up for his losses this Sparks the most serious wave of protest against his rule since the War Began and sees roughly double that number of Russians flee the country in fact Putin is so rattled by the Ukrainian advances that we now know he seriously considered dropping a nuclear bomb in order to stop them but what or who Putin would have targeted has never been revealed now let's clear the board and take a look at the tactics that led to Ukraine's Victory to understand how K's troops were able to recapture so much territory so quickly we need to understand the art of the Breakthrough we're now back at the start of the offensive with the opposing armies facing off against one another there was a line of Russian troops here a line of Ukrainian troops here and an imaginary front front line between them somewhere here just to either side of that front line is an area that military commanders refer to as the close this is where most fighting units are located and where much of the combat takes place behind the close is what armies refer to as the rear this is generally where command posts ammo dumps and other vital Logistics are located this is much larger geographically but has far fewer troops in it these soldiers carry ammunition to the front and casualties away from it when reinforcements become available they move through the rear to get to the close as troops battle each other in the close they may gain or lose ground by advancing or withdrawing but this is not a breakthrough a breakthrough occurs where one side is able to punch through the enemy front line breaking out of the heavily defended close and in two the lightly defended rear breakthroughs are hard to achieve they require just the right mix of speed surprise coordination and concentration of Force if an enemy sees the attack coming then they can reinforce before it is launched an attempt to block it if the attack is badly coordinated or slow moving then they can regroup to stop it in its tracks but if the attacker gets it right they can break through the line and Rush troops into the poorly defended rear this this is doubly devastating first the attackers can gain a lot of territory very quickly and at minimal cost because there a few enemies to stop them second it cuts off the main enemy force in the close from resupply and reinforcement this can cause an entire defensive line to rapidly collapse as these units scramble backwards through enemy fire to try and establish a new front line with a secure rear looking at the car Counterattack we can see the ukrainians pulled off this feed not once but Twice first they punched through the Russian defensive line running from IIM to Chev chanov forcing them to abandon everything west of the oscill river then they punched through another Russian defensive line from lman to kopans driving them back from the Eastern Bank of the oscill as well with more resources and Manpower the ukrainians could well have recaptured far more territory than they did perhaps even up to the Russian border which might explain why Putin considered pressing the nuclear button in the event Ukraine's Advance became too stretched and rather than risk losing it all commanders decided to dig in and hold what they had already taken and that is how Ukraine's troops managed to retake so much territory so quickly thanks for watching if you like this kind of content and want to see more in your feed don't forget to hit like And subscribe or

          <attvalue for="3" value="Join the discord Server:   / discord  &#10;&#10;I want to examine the Ukraine war update on the front lines gray zone area where the battle in Kharkiv has unfolded on its 5th day as the fog of war starts to lift. News of the world even has traveled fast. Then I want to take a look at if Russian forces might be planning to invade Sumy next. We’ll also cover any recent diplomatic changes in messaging on either side or their allies.&#10; The first thing you need to know is that In the Kharkiv direction, The number of border villages Russia claims to have captured in Kharkiv has now increased to between 9 and 12. &#10;The number isn’t important, what matters really matters is how close is the closest one to Kharkiv city? One such close proximity town that was captured appears to be (Loo-k'yahn-tsee) Luk'yantsi. The reason this is concerning from the Ukrainian defenders point of view is because the next town in line is (Lee-pt-see) Lyptsi. If that were to fall it could theoretically put Kharkiv within Artillery range. This is why I think the Ukrainian intelligence general said to the new york times quote ““The situation is on the edge. Every hour this situation moves toward critical.” However  It’s unclear what the end goal is for the Russian assault at this point. Do they plan to continue forward with what Moscow has described as a buffer zone? &#10;&#10;Evidence that these claims of Russian advances are likely accurate comes from The Ukraine’s general of staff who said quote&quot;At present, the enemy has tactical success&quot; then we can take a look at a video that has gone viral of what appears to be two Russian platoons marching within 3 meters of each other. Normally if you expected to receive fire you would be space out much further instead they appear to be walking into Kharkiv oblast which seems to possibly support the reports that initial defensive lines did not work as anticipated. &#10;&#10;Before we continue I have a small disclaimer for you, keep in mind that the situation on the ground is developing rapidly and the information is subject to change. This report I’ve put together for you here, is a curation of various different sources all of which have their own biases, I made sure some of them are from the Russian perspective and some are from the Ukranian one. I too admittedly have my own personal biases. But I think that’s part of being human, especially if you’re talking about something you care about. However, It’s important for you to be aware of those biases. I’m here to share with you my imperfect view of the battlefield so I can hear your feedback and constructive criticisms, both of which I appreciate as it helps me improve. &#10;&#10;We’ve seen reports of major shake ups in both the Ukrainian leadership. On May 11th just one day after the invasion of Kharkiv, the Ukrainian Commander responsible for the defense of North Eastern frontlines General Yuriy (Ha-lush-kin) Halushkin was relieved of his command and replaced by General (Mick-high-low Drah-pah-tee) Mykhaylo Drapatiy. Dprapatiy was responsible for leading the combat operations in recapturing the city of Kherson in 2022. The fact that the former commander in Kharkiv was replaced could be seen as another indication that the initial defensive operations did not go as planned. Newsweek reportedly spoke to Ukrainian military and local officials in vovchansk who said that Russian artillery shelling on the border made it difficult for them to build proper fortifications. It’s tough to bring in civilian construction equipment and lay down dragons teeth and drudge up trenches when you’re under explosive artillery fire. What remains to be seen is if defensive lines were created further back from the border in safer places, this is something we will find out in the coming weeks. &#10;&#10;#UKRAINE #WAR #KHARKIV" />

trenches when you're under explosive artillery fire what remains to be seen though what I would be curious about is if the defensive lines were created further back from the border in safer places this is something we will find out in the coming weeks to that point another viral video that I want to bring your attention to shows the opening moments of the assault from Ukrainian defense point of view inside a defensive fighting position you can see them firing their AK-47s and saying they're Russian and there's a lot of them you can even hear what appears to be Russian forces shouting at them to surrender these Ukrainian soldiers are outnumbered and within hand grenade range as they continue to return fire new information has come out that Ukraine claims 30% of Russia's total 50,000 forces in this direction have been committed to the attack so according to this report from ABC who spoke to Ukrainian military leadership roughly 60% of Russia's total combat power has been committed so far if you trust that Source it could be probing to see how Ukraine responds Russia might be waiting to see where Ukraine pulls reinforcements from along the front so they can choose how to redeploy that remaining 40% of soldiers it's also possible a portion of those troops were Logistics and it's also possible that they could be redeployed a 2 and 1 half hour drive away to kers oblast inside Russia so they could assault into Tumi oblast inside Ukraine as we'll talk about soon the town of V chonco has become the focal point of the harke assault a report by Deborah Haynes of Sky News actually had the chance to speak directly with a Ukrainian defender on the ground in that town the Ukrainian solders shared Drone footage of the battle and said quote they are advancing in residential area of vonk and and are moving into people's houses this is just the first wave they're testing our defenses they're preparing their artillery and then when they completely enter the town they will bring in their reserves he even explained the tactics that were being used by Russia saying they're deploying small three to five man teams this is a unique strategy that we've seen used by both sides recently in Iraq for instance we only ever moved in groups no smaller than a 40-man platoon size unit with four armored vehicle and this was the same tactic used at the beginning of the war for Ukraine and Russia which has evolved over time the reason for this distributed approach is likely to spread out and exhaust Ukraine's defenses it also increases the number of artillery shells Ukraine needs to expend per assault team It lines up with the trend of Russian troops apparently using more Chinese made ATV vehicles and motorcycles these light attack vehicles and recent assaults partly because it's more difficult to locate and Target an ATV with drone attacks we've seen this increasingly being adopted by the US military as they acquire thousands of infantry Squad vehicles and motorcycles themselves a move that shocked people a few years ago when that transition started to what they now call anti-tank hunter killer teams in the Infantry the downside is of course they're more vulnerable to direct fire according to reports Northern vul chonk has Russian infantry inside of it and it's currently being contested if you found the report valuable so far in any way spare parts Army please hit the like And subscribe button to promote it to more people a lot of people ask me what spare parts Army means it's a reference to my old Squad in the Army we were made up of backfills stop-loss guys who had been out for years who were called back in and reclassed who were switched from Engineers to infantry that's how we got our nickname spare part Squad were there any changes in diplomacy and messaging at the state level due to Russia's advances in harke there was a surprise two-day VIs visit from US Secretary of State Anthony blinkin to Ukraine the fact that it wasn't mentioned in advance suggests it was in direct response to the situation in harke possibly from a diplomatic point of view the visit by Anthony blinkin is designed to show the Ukrainian people and military personnel that the US support is still there it was the first high-profile visit since the $60 billion Aid package was renewed Anthony blinkin tweeted that he discussed increases in anti-air assets like two Patriot missile launchers specifically for the har region blinkin said us weapon supplies should be reaching the front lines now on May 13th another update caught my eye that was issued by Denmark they gave an update on the timeline for when F-16 Fighters might arrive in Ukraine they stated it would be within 1 month but that was later corrected to within a few months that delivery has been stalled by over 6 months for unknown reasons Denmark and the Netherlands have said that would deliver 61 f-16s in total these updates on weapon supplies and surprise visits are likely not a coincidence they're probably time to show support to Ukraine how effective that support will be remains to be seen Ukrainian intelligence general banov made a comment to the New York Times and I'm actually curious to hear what you guys think about it because from my point of view I can't understand the reasoning behind it he said to the New York Times in a video interview on May 11th quote all of our forces are either here or in Chase are I've used everything we have we don't have anyone else in the reserves this appears to be breaking opsac or operational security he appears to be revealing information about the Ukrainian troop strengths to the public which from a strategy or intelligence point of view I can't understand sounds like either a blunder or it could be purposeful disinformation considering he's the head of intelligence anything's possible but if you have a theory about why he said that please share it with me on the task and purpose Discord server I'll be chatting with you guys there for a few hours after posting this Chase of Yar is of course the location about 10 km to the west of bmot where Ukrainian forces fell back after bmot fell the Strategic value of this location has been hotly debated with some saying it's just another town while many saying it's geography give it a Hilltop view of the surrounding area and make it an ideal springboard into deeper Ukrainian territory so far though as of May 14th Russian forces have yet to make an operational breakthrough in Ukraine's front line and it appears this assault in harke is an attempt to speed that process up the head of Ukraine's Military Intelligence Agency general budanov made an assessment that he expected Russia to launch a new ground attack into sum oblast within the next few days whether his analysis is correct or not we've already observed signs of some crossborder intrusions and potential shaping operations here Russian assault units have deployed near the sui oblast further to the north where they just invaded Haro blast Russian troop movements here reported near the town of Sudan according to Reuters this is the location of the last remaining pipeline through which Russian natural gas transits into Ukraine to European customers after the nordstream pipeline was blown up we know that the Russian 128th separate guard motor rifle Brigade and the 71st guard motorized rifle regiment are deployed in the Russian KK oblast tier it's where the KK Airbase is located you Ukrainian drone attacks have repeatedly hit this Air Base as bombers fly from here to attack Ukrainian infrastructure the Russian 53rd anti-aircraft missile Brigade as well as the 448th missile Brigade is stationed here Russia has multiple repair and storage bases and Logistics centers that would be necessary for them to launch a ground assault from what we do know is that the Russian spetnaz units or essentially Special Forces sabotage teams have been operating in Sumi oblas that inreased rates in the last two months a pro-russian mill blogger named condo reported that they have systematically been eliminating Ukrainian border guards in sui in the past month the center for Eastern studies also corroborated these reports of spetznaz forces saying on March 17th Ukrainian forces prevented three Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups from penetrating deep into sui oblast Moscow claims these attacks were due to Ukrainian activity in the Border in KK region the reason we might see a Russian attempt at assaulting in Tumi is because they claim the Ukrainian Military Intelligence has carried out their own infiltrations into the KK side since March Ukraine has repeatedly hit electrical and oil refineries inside kers if moscow's goal is to create a buffer zone it would hypothetically make logical sense that they would make a move here based on their own stated line of reasoning reports on April 1st from Ukraine's military confirm these sabotage attempts were occurring in early last month in April however they reported repelling those intrusions Russia's artillery shelling and missile strikes have also increased in Sumi in the past month indicating potential shaping operations here within a 24-hour period on May 12 there were 21 missile attacks within Ukraine sum oost this includes airdropping landmines directly onto the small Border Town of serida airdropping landmines is a tactic that goes all the way back to World War II to and it could be used for various reasons include denying Ukrainian Defenders freedom of movement an attempt to pin them down in place could also see these tactics as seen them as shaping operations for an offensive or an attempt to prevent reinforcements from moving to harke only time will tell which one it is it might sound a little confusing but Sumi oblast is both the name of the region it's also the name of a city in that region that City sui has a population of 250,000 people making it the 23rd largest in Ukraine the city itself has come under frequent missile and Rocket attacks ever since Russian forces withdrew in 2022 after nearly surrounding the city during the initial Invasion according to a recent Wall Street Journal report Russia has increased their missile and drone strikes by 45% in the past 6 months at the same time Ukraine's missile interception rate has dropped from 73 to 30% largely due to a lack of anti-air Munitions from the West in response to that increased pressure in sui Ukrainian authorities issue a recommendation to two Sumi towns to evacuate 10 km from the border the pro-russian mil blogger K Adriel claims that the immediate border has already been cleared of Ukrainian landmines and Engineering obstacles by Russian forces although I couldn't independently verify that information from what I could dig up the picture here has quickly changed because only 2 months ago on March 18th a spokesman for the operational command north of Ukraine vadom meny said quote we are not currently seeing a large enemy group for a large-scale invasion of Sumi region he stated Ukraine was strengthening their fortifications with three lines of defenses here the reason this is potentially a significant development is because if Ukraine has to send reinforcements to harke and also Sumi oblast they'll be stretched out across the front line even further which many people believe that's Russia's goal to create an operational Breakthrough by spreading their troops out similar to some military leadership shakeups in Ukraine Russia just had their own the Russian Ministry of Defense Sergey Shu the Russian Minister of Defense Sergey shogo has been replaced after 12 years of service some say surprisingly by an economist without military experience named Bosa but other experts believe this makes perfect sense since Russia's pouring vast amounts of money into the defense industry now and it will require Financial experience to manage those resources before you ask no it doesn't seem like Sergey will accidentally fall out of window or end up on an exploding plane it looks like he's being given a lateral style move where he isn't technically taking into motion but he won't be involved in the day-to-day shaping of the Russian military when we think of a minister of defense it's easy to accidentally think of this position as an actual military planner or a field General when in reality none of those skills of an actual Soldier would really translate to be useful in this job in the USA for example the analogous role as a secretary of defense they're in charge of budget and big picture devotion of resources I think of it like I wouldn't want a really young athletic doctor I want the old dude who looks like he's been around and knows the game maybe I should pick doctors better though on the fifth day of Russia's opening up of a new front line there remains a lot of unanswered questions about how far they will attempt to push if they will try to start lobbing artillery shells into harke if they can it's still not clear if Russia intends to make ground assaults in Tumi but join our community in the task and purpose Discord server if you want to discuss this further with me I'll be chatting there with you guys for the rest of the night I'm your average infan Chris Cappy thank you guys for watching signing off this net time now" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="This tiny island nation is smaller than New York City, but it's the wealthiest country in Asia and one of the richest in the world. Its GDP per capita itself has surpassed the likes of the UK, the US, France and other developed countries. Over six decades, Singapore has transformed itself from a colonial trading port to a buzzing financial center that's envied the world over. And it's held up as an example for any country seeking to grow a robust, high-tech economy. Its wealth is the product of decades of planning by a party that's been in power since independence. So what's Singapore's formula for success? And as its leadership changes for the first time in 20 years, can it continue to prosper? When Singapore became independent in 1965, the first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, and other founding leaders recognized it had an economic problem: It had no natural resources. So if they wanted to develop an export-led economy and attract foreign capital, they would need to build up the country's manufacturing industry. Its location gave it an edge. It has access to the Strait of Malacca, to the Indian Ocean, to the South China Sea, which makes it a pivotal shipping hub. So it did this initially by transforming Singapore into a manufacturing base with a focus on labor-intensive industry at first to wipe out the high unemployment. But Lee only ever intended manufacturing as a stepping stone to a more developed economy. He laid the fundamentals, which is a solid financial and legal system, stable and largely clean government, making sure that the public transport system is efficient, has world-class health care infrastructure. In the 1980s, Lee started laying the groundwork for what is now Singapore's biggest source of wealth, finance. Following the lead of places like the US and UK, he liberalized the financial services industry with lighter touch regulation. The legacy of that approach is evident today. 4200 multinational companies have regional headquarters here. Low taxes are a big reason for that. Singapore's corporate tax rate is just 17% and can hit 13.5% or lower for some activities. That's also because Lee's successor, Goh Chok Tong, continued to lean into attracting big business. Singapore shifted emphasis to a knowledge-based economy that relies more on creativity and growing Singapore's entrepreneurs. In 2004, Lee Hsien Loong, Lee Kuan Yew's eldest son, took over the premiership. And he realized to retain the flow of businesses and wealth, it needed to be an even more attractive place to live in. With its prime location, Singapore had to become a destination in itself. That's been key to Singapore success. It had embarked on an ambitious land reclamation project in the 1970s. Over the years, that space was filled with not just offices and apartment buildings, but entertainment hubs, changing the city skyline in the process. One example was bringing in the F1 night race. The government also welcomed casinos or integrated resorts, as they're called in Singapore. And the timing was impeccable because the Chinese and Indian economies were booming. Singapore was ideally situated to attract the region's ultra-wealthy, who could then enjoy the casinos and nightlife, but also park their money. The results - the total value of assets under management in Singapore jumped from $420 billion at the start of Lee Hsien Loong’s tenure to 3.6 trillion in 2022. While Singapore has been an economic success, its leadership is criticized by some for the restrictions on civil liberties and the media. Freedom of the press, freedom of the news media must be subordinated to the overriding needs of the integrity of Singapore. Under Lee Kuan Yew's governance, one of the chief criticisms is that there was this climate of fear in Singapore. People were afraid to criticize the government. Subsequent governments also faced criticism for maintaining a tight grip. Protests are still largely illegal. The government is defiinitely cognizant that its population is changing. It is much more diverse. It is much more vocal. At the same time, Singapore needs to stay competitive as other countries learn from its model of growth. And climate change is becoming a threat to national security. This is the Singapore that Lawrence Wong is inheriting as the country's new prime minister. Wong, who grew up in public housing, earned praise for his leadership in the country's COVID-19 response. He is seen as having more of a common man's touch. We should build on what we have today. We should affirm and reinforce what works well for Singapore. While the People's Action Party still forms the ruling government, its popularity is declining. There will be that politicking that will happen much more intensely in the years to come than there was ever before. The build-up of wealth has brought problems of its own. Housing prices have increased. The cost of living has gone up. Part of Singapore's growth model has been to attract foreign labor. But too much foreign worker inflow raises concerns by the citizens that the foreigners are taking too many of the good jobs. If you just look at the numbers, inequality has been reduced, but that's not how some residents feel. The country's rapidly aging population is also going to add pressure to workforce growth and government spending. So whether it's managing discontent or guiding Singapore's continued evolution into a tech hub, Wong's job is to sustain the city-state's hard-earned success." />

that reached all the way to the shifa medical center the IDF is focusing its attention in the southern part of the Gaza Strip in the area of kadel bad and kanun and the Israeli Air Force is investing efforts to locate and Target Hamas terrorists and installations in these areas it appears as if these locations have a strategic value for Hamas because its terrorists are fighting hard against these ready troops in and trying to hold their grounds after 24 hours of intense fightings the IDF was able to knock down a main communication route of Hamas this caused hamas's terrorists to give up on multiple locations and surrender to the Israeli troops it appears as if Hamas is concerned about the morale of its terrorists in the Gaza Strip because it sees so many of them surrendering to Israel and for the first time since the 23rd of November Abu abeda a Hamas official issued the statement praising the Hamas Organization for its military achievements against the IDF in the past 65 days since the war started he also stated that Israel failed in its attempts to release the Israeli hostages and failed in the ceasefire he made it clear that this statement was made in recent Days by stating the day of the war and mentioning the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas this is another lie that Hamas is telling this time to its own terrorists it's a pathetic attempt to twart the reality on the ground Israel is controlling the majority of the northern part of Gaza and more and more Hamas terrorists are surrendering every day the remaining terrorists are hiding in underground Terror complex without any ability to connect to the outside world and this is the future for the southern part of Gaza and for Hamas there the fighting against Hamas terrorists in Bia which is another huge Terr Hub of this organization is close to an end as Hamas terrorists are running out of ammunitions and weapons and many of them are surrendering but the IDF still is on high alert because Hamas terrorists can still pop out of underground Terror locations and hiding positions in the neighborhood of Kube south of Gaza the YF is engaged in Fierce battles against Hamas terrorists that are fresh because the IDF has not conducted operations in that area until now the IDF has been working hard in dividing the Gaza Strip into strips of land separating the terrorists from each other after the IDF is defeating Hamas in one area it is mobilizing his troops to carry out an attack against Hamas terrorists in another location that's why in the battle against the area of jabalia the IDF was able to bring additional forces from the area of beia in order to conduct a joint operation to neutralize Hamas terrorist s in that location as Hamas is withdrawing its forces from areas it cannot hold anymore it is always encountered by other IDF units in jabalia Hamas terrorists retre and were quickly engaged by Tank units from the coast of Gaza the IDF is stationed throughout the entire Gaza Strip and any attempt by Hamas terrorists to escape to the South is met by additional AA forces in the southern part of Gaza according to reports thousands of hamash terrorists are still hiding underground in underground Terror positions and pop out in order to carry out attacks against the IDF troops the battle in the south is going to be hard and it already is Taking Lives on the Israeli sides as more and more IDF troops are losing their lives in this war against Hamas and the majority of them are between the ages of 18 to 21 but the IDF is not giving up and their sacrifice is not for vain because we are not stopping until we will destroy Hamas and return our hostages in Israel's northern border in the battle against kisala the Israeli Air Force according to reports conducted aerial strikes that targeted kisala positions in Syria the Syrian defense Ministry stated that its aerial defense systems were able to neutralize the attacks but that severe damage was caused to the infrastructure the report further stated that the strikes targeted kisala and Iranian militias that were located next to the Damascus International Airport in Syria according to Lebanese reports unifil delivered a message on behalf of Israel to kisala stating that Israel sees any Target 3 kilometers from its border with Lebanon as a legitimate Target kisala responded by stating that if Israel will implement this new directive kisala will do the same on the Israeli side the situation on Israel's Northern front is very fragile and kisala and the IDF are on high alert because it appears as if both sides do not want to escalate into a fullon war but any wrong move can lead to another escalation the IDF spokesperson's unit released a recording of Yu elmi hamas's Communications minister in the Gaza Strip during his investigation in Israel he stated that Hamas is destroying the Gaza Strip and taking it back 200 years he also said that the people in Hamas are crazy and that they are following y Yousef stated that people in the Gaza Strip do not like y sin and that Hamas is responsible for the destruction of 60% of the infrastructure and buildings in the Gaza Strip when asked about Yas War hamas's leader he stated that nobody in Gaza likes him and that he only likes himself and takes actions without consulting with anyone Hamas is a terror organization that does not care about the well-being of its own people or the future of the Gaza Strip This is the truth I know that if you're not here in Israel it's very hard to understand the reality mainly because the international media is not telling the truth about what's going on and does not share a full picture and that's why I need your help I need your help in Sharing what is happening in Israel and if you have questions please research ask people I'm not afraid of the truth because I know that I am fighting a righteous war against the terror organization and I stand by the Army and the values that I grew up on in Israel so please join me in prayer and happy hanuka from Island" />

that changes   your life that's right today on insights  Israel in the Middle East we discover what   it looks like to travel through this land  the Heritage the history the experience   that only the Holy Land can give someone  definitely so come visit us here in our home there's simply no other country like the  land of Israel this country packs in it an   incredible amount of history of archaeology  of holy sites and of spiritual significance   but those traveling to this land and  through this land have more than just   the ancient there's a modern state of Israel  the incredible technology The Innovation the   amazing Cuisine the adventures the desert  that are also worth visiting I can't think   of a single other country in the world that  carries so much significance so much history   so much spirituality and also offers the  modern the exciting the vibrant the young   lifestyle that this country has to offer today  we're setting out on an adventure an adventure   through the holy the ancient and the modern that  the state of Israel has to offer let's do this yeah we're Tech technically on the brink of  the desert and the view is exceptional that   was amazing for me to experience how Elijah and  David and and Jesus and the Israel Israelites had   wandered through that Wilderness they go to the  beach they have the Falafel within 2 hours they   can be up in Capernaum the headquarters  of Jesus's Ministry to experience God I   would trade any year of graduate school I  ever had for an 8-day trip to the land of   is really absolutely to that degree and  I studied at some good schools [Music] today I'm off to the old city of Jerusalem  a Timeless magnet for Millions worldwide I'm   meeting Pastor Alan Jackson who is currently  leading a group on pilgrimage to Israel you've   come to Israel many many dozens of times and  led people through the trip to this country   dozens of times why do you do that and what is  the transformation you see in the groups that   that makes you go through this every time but I'm  a pastor I've served the same congregation for 40   years and I've been bringing tours to Israel for  almost that entire time because I have watched   the impact it makes in their lives you know  I can talk to them about the Bible when I'm   at home but if I bring them to Israel I watch  the Bible change for them it becomes a living   book yeah I can't think of a better investment  I can make in the lives of people my job is to   grow people and Israel is a very important part  of their story even if they don't know it so   anytime I can come I'll grab a group of people  put them on a plane and off the Jerusalem we had but more than that the accommodations  are beautiful when I first came to Israel   many years ago it was a developing country  yeah when I was at the University we said   they would deliver the mail if the donkey  felt like coming down your street it's not   that anymore you're not just a first world  country you're a global leader in comfort   and convenience they have the finest fruits and  vegetables in the world they fill the vegetable   markets of Europe the hotels are outstanding  this is visiting the the finest expressions of   technology in our world that happens to have  a window into Antiquity which is just simply unparalleled unlike other destinations a trip  to Israel has the capacity to ignite and fortify   pretty much anyone's faith if you're a Biblical  literalist and you come here it will give you a   confidence beyond anything you'll ever get in a  library yeah if you're a skeptic it will open the   the doors of your mind to the possibility that  maybe this stuff really did happen it wasn't   a Disneyland creation when they come to have an  experience what they don't expect is to meet God   and I watched that happen over and over again and  their hearts are open to God in a new way we're   sitting at the southern steps and just around  the corner they've excavated along the walls of   the Temple Mount when I was at the University here  that was speculation we hadn't seen it yet we were   pointing at the dirt thinking well maybe every  time I come it's like my Bible is being exposed   again and it's affirming what we've taken by faith  when I visit Israel and I see how God continues to   uncover the story and affirm it if you're willing  to look at it with the eyes of Faith you go home   stronger with a greater commitment to your faith  than when you came I don't think the people at at   home understand the tremendous pressure that is  up on them to Discount the authority of scripture   you know they try to convince us it's myth that  it's just intended to be metaphorical learning   but once you have the experience you don't need  the argument because you know the truth and if   we can help the people have the experience  they don't even have to debate any longer   they've experienced the [Music] truth so how did  you first young Allen connect to this country my   first trip to Israel I was in the sixth grade  it was 1970 my parents had made a trip the   year earlier and they were so impressed by it  that they went home and brought my brother and   I back the next year it it made such an impact  in my heart I floated in the Dead Sea I saw the   Jordan River I walked the streets of Jerusalem  I mean I wasn't old enough to process theology   or to get all the names or the Kings or the dates  but I began to build an appreciation for what was   happening here and I understood at a very early  age that what I was hearing in The Narrative of   the world didn't line up with my experience even  as a child and that still holds true today in your   mind you again you you see people walk through  this journey in the land what are the messages   that are changing in their hand as they're  traveling through you know when they come the   first time they think they're coming for the Rocks  but what happens really quickly is they understand   the lands about the people and their story and  once once they understand that it becomes very   personal to them every group that's ever come  goes home with a commitment to pray for the   Peace of [Music] Jerusalem in America we tend to  worship at the altars of comfort and convenience   that encroaches in our churches as well and when  I come to Israel it's a sacrifice to live in the   land without your sacrifices I have no story to  tell I have no Messiah I have no scripture I have   no prophets and when I see the sacrifices you're  making I've got to go home and understand which   sacrifices I have have to make to make an impact  in the world where I live our Lord our King was an   observant Jewish rabbi and until you have stood in  the midst of the Jewish people and understand what   it means to be Jewish in the world just a little  bit there's no way we can fully understand but   if we can come watch and try to understand what  that means it helps us understand the king that   we worship so I would encourage parents you know  if your children are old enough to be baptized   to process their faith they're old enough to  understand the land of

who's been bringing people   more times than he can remember right how's the  experience been it's been amazing it's really been   surreal when I first came here I I expected you  know to see the sights the Sea of Galilee and the   places where Jesus walked but what I really feel  like God has been drawing my attention to is just   the history and the experiences of the people of  Israel and what they've been through and and what   that means the land was desolate for so many years  that they were disconnected from that and are just   recently returning and so being able to to come  here to to be witness to that to be witness to   prophecy actually being fulfilled currently that's  very important to be able to actually reflect upon   that and witness has there been one sit where you  visited the way you looked at Israel the Bible   the combination of those stories together really  transformed for you yes it's very unexpectedly the   desert in the desert you're completely dependent  upon God you were able to just exist and be and   there was more opportunity to actually abide  in Christ and to dwell and meditate upon God   and His word that I definitely think is lacking  from where I'm from it's fascinating to witness   the deeply personal yet impactful ways in which  Israel leaves its mark on each and every visitor   so Brendan this is your first time in Israel yes  sir how's it been it's been incredible it's been   I would say lifechanging it's opening my eyes  to the Bible I mean I can not have asked for a   better experience when I first started out I did  no research I thought it was more of a third world   country and then the thing that shocked me the  most was the Sea of Gile and places where Jesus   was and how beautiful it was I could not imagine  how beautiful what were you expecting I don't know   I was expecting TR not taking offense at that  yeah I know I'm sorry I hope I'm not offending   you but you know I I was I was expecting it to  be kind of like Gloom and you know not a very   beautiful water maybe a darker color than it was  and you see where Jesus was standing and looking   over the see of Galilee it was absolutely stunning  to me was something that was incredible to me do   you think other people should come to tour Israel  2,000% yeah anybody that's a Christian I would say   everybody you want to come and see this with your  own eyes I mean you know our country in the United   States of America is very young you see something  that's 100 years old and you're mesmerized oh my   God 100 years ago and then you come here and it's  thousands of years ago and I think it increased   your faith with countless destinations to choose  from making a decision can be tough and yet One   Thing Remains clear the magic that Israel offers  is unparalleled I would say whatever sacrifice   you have to make to visit the land of Israel whom  you go with how you go is secondary if you will   go with an open heart towards God and the spirit  of God I have seen it in the lives of thousands   of people my own included repetitively God will  bring change so what does 10 years from now look   like 15 years from now God willing 15 years from  now I'm still bringing tours um I'll be amazed at   what God is uncovering that what he's hidden for  people a decade from now that we haven't seen yet   God willing um I'll visit the land of Israel as  long as God continues to give me breath [Music] today with us we have ruven donon who's the  director of sell Academy the educational   branch of sell ruen what a great honor Shalom  the slogan of the ministry of Tourism for years   in here in Israel was visit Israel and never be  the same right do you really believe it's true   I do I do we have seen it with our work mik for  over 30 years in this industry and we see lives   transformed all the time one of the favorite lines  that many of our pastor friends tell us they say   listen ruven one visit to Israel is like a year  in seminary beautiful Psalm 34 tells us God tells   us taste and see that the Lord is good amen God  wants us to experience his goodness so he gave   us a land not an easy land the land of Israel  is is right on the land bridge between Africa   Asia and Europe that's why we have the greatest  bird migration coming through here twice a year   50 million birds shik fly over our heads coming to  visit the land coming to visit the land they are   the original pilgrims and they come to taste and  see that the Lord has provided A Feast for them   and so the invitation goes to all of God's people  to come and see where the words were spoken where   the Miracles took place to relieve if you would  the biblical story it makes your faith real you   know I met a lady that came on a tour and she told  me you know I raiseed Penny after Penny to come   to see the land yeah and she said now that I saw  the land I'm ready wow to go home it was like the   dream of her life Wow the thing that she needed to  do I believe it I like Simon righteous Simon who   stood in the temple right over the hill to bless  the baby Yeshua and he says now that I have seen   the salvation of the Lord I may depart in peace in  sell Academy the educational arm of sell tours you   have an episode on every site in Israel I think we  have like 52 different sites which site speaks to   you the most oh that's a bad question the southern  steps wow by hula gate by the by the Temple Mount   and I'll tell you why because of all the places in  Israel that are dear to our hearts because of the   biblical Motif and especially the places where  Yeshua our Lord the Son of God walked Among Us   in the flesh we only know of two for sure spots  where we know he stepped on these Stones one is   in magdala in the ancient synagogue that was  dug up in the last few years and the second   place is right here at the southern steps of the  Temple Mount because these steps were discovered   and une Earth this is the original structure and  let's be honest I think people are coming here and   it's like a magnet there's something here that ATT  touch them do you have any ideas of new itinerary   new things that they can see that they didn't see  on the first regular pilgrimage you got to take   the fign to capernum we have got to go up to the  Mount of Olives and to the Temple Mount Anda and   Bethlehem and so on yes these are the musty sites  that that you got to see them but once you've been   there a couple of times we love to take our  friends to off the road places where other   biblical Miracles took place where Abraham tended  sheep in the netive in the southern regions or   when Lot's wife turned into a pillar of salt right  below us here behind this mountain range we just   shot one of our educational videos for SEL Academy  on Mount Kabir which is in Northern Samaria it is   that place where Father Abraham entered the land  of promise for the first time in Genesis chapter   12 and 13 this is where he received the first  promise from God I will give you that land and   we not very many Israelis make it there but we  love to take our pilgrims perhaps even you next   time the friends are in Israel to those biblical  spots we want to see the Next Generation standing   with Israel and supporting Israel we need to  bring them here that they experience and they   see the miracle of the return of the Jewish people  to the land absolutely what do you think I believe   that Israel is one of God's greatest gifts to  the church in this generation we have to pass   the ban and we tell you pastors friends Ministry  leaders teachers doctors professors pass the batan   to the younger Generations there's a story to be  told in Israel puts the backbone puts strength in   the heart of God's people Israel is a source  of blessing amen and all those who come can   drink from that cup of God's faithfulness amen  ruen donon what a great honor pleasure thank you   thank you very much and to you our friends come  see and taste how good the land is and don't   forget to pray for the Peace of Jerusalem while  Israel boasts many celebrated destinations also   known as the a region is a lesser known gem  located in the southern Judean desert it is   characterized by its breathtaking Landscapes  agricultural communities and Rich historical significance we're sitting here at a place that  from what I can tell is one of the most impressive   archaeological sites in this country and yet I  would say not enough people come to this site if   I asked you what is the significance of visiting  this site in this region what would that sound   like first I would say that uh I agree about the  first part that not enough people are visiting   the place because it's isolated it's distant  it's far away those who come are very impressed   they explore something that they never knew would  exist susia was a thriving Community between the   years 400 and 800 CE the people who lived here  approximately 3 thousands of them there were a   refugees who survived somehow the destruction of  the second temple 70 CE the people who arrived in   susia were kohanim were priests they spoke Hebrew  we see the inscription here the mosaics are there   in in Hebrew like it was written today in mod than  Hebrew more than letters so the way of living here   was pretty similar to what we did today after  the destruction of the second temple the major   outcome was the establishment of the synagogues  as a central point of Jewish religion they came   to this place and they built very large synagogue  very fancy one they were very much connected to   their tradition they were very much connected to  Jerusalem you're describing a fascinating story   which I think doesn't exist in many places that  answers in a physical place the question of what   did Judaism look like after the destruction  of the temple and this city is that this is   the reason that susia was declared was defined as  the National Heritage site because it's the only   place that you can actually see how people lived  in that hidden period of time of the Byzantine era   the state of preservation of ancient susia and its  synagogue is truly remarkable this is the entrance   to the synagogue welcome to the synagogue of Susan  and what's equally striking is its resemblance to   synagogues in use today what you see here is  a beima if you visit every synagogue in Israel   you will see a Bea like that it's exactly like  we have today after the destruction there were   laws that were differentiated from the laws in  the time of P mikdash of the temple in order to   retain the traditions of the temple wherever  Jews are living one of them was that we blow   the shuar not only in Jerusalem which was  the tradition during the temple time but we   blow shaar everywhere a je Community is living  these were their hopes these were their dreams   to remind themselves that we are here but really  really really we are part of Jerusalem I find it   to be incredibly grounding that we can come back  and visit and the connection to the people that   came before us is so immediate it's an incredibly  powerful experience I agree it's a very special place many young families have moved to the the  area feeling this deep connection to the land and   their Heritage sealit and her family live in  shanila a quaint agricultural Community where   she grows berries and has a coffee shop called  the house of ptil which translates to House of   berries what a place toal thank you very much  it's a combination of the desert the forest   around us Antiquities and your berries all in one  place yes for Friday I have here a my own Market   we have a cake and coffee good coffee very good  coffee I sell my fruits and people come to buy   fruit and vegetable I'm still deeply impressed  we're here and what is technically a desert that   has been incredibly formed into a forest and  now you're growing berries yes of all places here these are the blueberries   this is almost the end of the picking we have  here 10 different types of blueberries yes in   this one place yes this is the Blackberry  you have to pick the big one I want to say   these are the best I've ever had in the country  they're absolutely amazing wow in the desert in   the desert yes in the sun yes in the summer and no  pesticides or anything anything like that nothing wow my final stop for the day is the atel forest  not only is it Israel's largest man-made Forest   but it was planted on the very edge of the desert  a meeting with many for a bike ride that literally   offers it all I think Israel has really Advanced  over the past 5 10 years it it's just become like   the mecca of bike riding especially in in this  area which is the biggest planted Forest near a   desert okay so actually the The Watershed the  water line where this is considered a desert   this isn't considered a desert is actually  right here you can actually see practically a line you mentioned that Israel's become a hot spot  for biking worldwide right what is it about riding   a mountain bike specifically in this country that  suddenly made it so popular okay so first of all   I'm going to use the cliche I'm sorry I have to  it's riding through history right just in this   area you know this is where king of David's some  of his soldiers were from even one of his generals   came from this area and obviously Israel is a  small country yes but geographically where it's   positioned you have so many different terrains  to choose from you can go up North and into the   Galil and you can go right in judan Samara and you  can go anywhere in the South and you have totally   different climates totally different views if you  can imagine now we have trees behind us but you   know you go 20 km to the South and you're in the  middle of the desert you have nothing yeah with   a short drive short drive I think that's dri  many have been waiting three seasons to find   a way to incorporate bike riding into a show we  finally done it let's do it thank you [Music] sir Delicacies nature sport ancient  history and warm Hospitality yatil   delivers a perfect day for every visitor  including [Music] myself hello this is   here in Jerusalem with TBN Israel this is y  Pinto from TBN Israel here in

          <attvalue for="7" value="this video was brought to you by Ground News it's easy to be pessimistic about Europe's economy growth has been pretty sluggish for the past few years bureaucracy abounds and the single market looks like it's getting less not more integrated over time nonetheless economic data published in the last week or so suggests that the EU is doing just fine and Trump's hesitations plus the prospect of structurally lower energy prices should provide cause for cautious optimism so in this video we're going to take another look at Europe's economy why it's doing better than you might think and whether this can [Music] last everyone talks about the left and right of politics but in Europe there's something new emerging a new right in the latest issue of our magazine we explain this new phenomena and run through some of the elections the new right have been winning read more by clicking the link in the description so let's start by looking at the data as we see it there are two pieces of recent data that should provide some optimism for Europeans the first is the most recent Euroat GDP data released on Wednesday which shows that the EU grew by 1.4% year-onear in the first quarter of 2025 now this was above expectations and the fastest growth rate since late 2022 now obviously this isn't a mind-blowing number and it's worth mentioning that some of this was driven by Ireland's 11% growth which was mostly as a consequence of American multinationals using Ireland as a tax haven equally some of this might have been driven by frontloading of European exports into the US in other words Americans desperately importing European goods at the start of the year before the tariffs came into effect which would create a temporary boost to GDP nonetheless it was still surprisingly good given the global economic slowdown and far better than say the US there are also some genuinely good numbers in there as well spain for instance grew by 2.8% yearonear having already posted some pretty impressive numbers over the past 3 years similarly in the most recent IMF forecast released earlier this week Spain was the only advanced economy not to have its growth forecast downgraded and the IMF now expects Spain to be the fastest growing advanced economy by quite some margin although these forecasts were obviously made before the power cut anyway the second piece of good data was Euroat inflation report which was published on Friday and found that year-on-year inflation in April came in at 2.2% slightly higher than forecast but still pretty close to the European Central Bank's 2% target this is obviously good news in and of itself but it's also extra good news because it should give the ECB the space to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy if Trump's trade wars put a further drag on growth in the future and again this stands in marked contrast to the US where while inflation did fall last month Fed Chair Jerome Powell has strongly implied that he won't be able to cut rates even with the US nearing recession because of the inflationary risks associated with Trump's tariffs a move which invited the president's eye interestingly almost all of this European disinflation was driven by lower energy prices which fell by 3.5% and this points to a wider cause for optimism for the European economy the prospect of structurally lower prices for context the past few years have proved pretty definitively that high energy prices are terrible for Europe largely because Europe is a net energy importer therefore high energy prices push up inflation undermine European industrial competitiveness and help Russia because oil and gas revenues give Putin more money to spend on his war in Ukraine now unfortunately for Europe energy prices have been pretty high since the pandemic you can see this just by looking at the price of oil which remains the most important energy source to any modern economy having hovered at around $50 per barrel for most of the late 2010s oil prices surged to well over $100 per barrel in early 2022 thanks to a post-pandemic spike in demand and Putin's invasion of Ukraine while prices came down somewhat in mid 2022 they only stabilize at about $80 per barrel which is still pretty high by historical standards this also understates the real costs for Europe because oil imports are usually denominated in dollars and the dollar was also pretty expensive trading at near par with the euro during this time period however in the past couple of months oil prices have come down significantly and oil is now trading at about $60 per barrel at the same time the dollar has lost ground against the euro and is now trading below 90 now both of these phenomena have been driven by Trump's unpredictable tariff policy which have slowed the global economy and therefore the demand for oil as well as undermining faith in the US and therefore the dollar this has all made importing energy significantly cheaper for Europe which has helped tamp down inflation and should improve Europe's industrial competitiveness in the medium to long term in more good news for Europe there are also reasons to think that oil prices will stay relatively low for the foreseeable future largely thanks to Saudi Arabia for context for the past few years Saudi Arabia has been trying to keep oil prices high in large part because the Saudis know that vision 2030 Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman's ambitious plan to modernize the Saudi economy is going to cost a lot of money this has required the Saudis to convince the other members of OPEC plus that is the international cartel of oil producing states to collectively cut production but high global prices and steep production cuts have made it increasingly tempting for other OPEC plus members like Kazakhstan Iraq and the UAE to essentially cheat the cartel in other words pump more oil than they should and rake in the cash this has forced Saudi Arabia to unilaterally cut production but their decision to unwind these cuts earlier this year suggested the Saudis have essentially given up on this project of structurally higher prices and are now accepting lower prices but will instead pump more oil to make up for the revenue shortfall now this might create some tension with Trump because lower prices will hurt American shale producers who could only turn a profit above $65 a barrel but it'll be great for both European industry and European consumers and things could get even better if Trump negotiates a new deal with Iran which assuming it involves sanctions relief would allow Iranian oil and gas onto the international market with Europe being the obvious buyer this is one of the big reasons that the EU has always been keener than the US on normalizing relations with Iran iran could really help Europe diversify its energy supplies especially when it comes to gas however while there's clearly cause for optimism much here will depend on Trump and whether the EU and US can negotiate a mutually beneficial deal that averts the looming trade war nonetheless Europe should still be boyed by the fact that going into these negotiations the European economy looks stronger than its American counterpart for the first time in a while which is not what anyone expected when Trump first threatened tariffing the block during his campaign but ultimately this is a complex and nuanced economic story and as such there's plenty more to read about it online with 121 sources reporting on this story exactly the issue is how can you be sure that what you're reading isn't hugely biased well that's a problem we face when making these videos too and luckily that's where this week's sponsor Ground News comes in for this story in particular they've identified that at least 15 left-leaning sources and seven right-leaning sources are reporting on it in fact in addition to this they've also shown the main differences in the headlines among left and right-leaning outlets with left-leaning outlets focusing on the more negative economic effects of Trump and his tariffs while right-leaning outlets focus more on Europe's own internal problems we're able to do that because of our sponsor Ground News whose incredible website and app lets you discover the news and pulls back the curtain on media bias that's because every story comes with a quick visual breakdown of the political bias factuality and ownership of the sourc's reporting all backed by ratings from three independent news monitoring organizations but one of the best parts of the app is their blind spot feed it presents you with stories and articles that haven't been reported on by one side of the aisle or the other helping you better break out of your media bubble and discover what those on the other side of the political spectrum are really saying this is all in addition to the bias distribution we mentioned earlier and together these fantastic features help you to figure out exactly who's behind the stories you're reading and what agenda they might have ground News is such a useful tool for our current media landscape and I think that an app like this will only become more essential as the media landscape continues to evolve so if you're interested in everything that Ground News has to offer you can get 40% off the unlimited access Vantage

          <attvalue for="7" value="this video is brought to you by Ground News after less than a year in office and following months of political infighting Herz Vilders pulled his freedom party out of the Netherlands ruling coalition after issuing a blunt ultimatum to coalition partners last week to sign a sweeping 10point anti-migration plan with VA's PV out of government the incumbent coalition is likely to collapse plunging the Netherlands into political uncertainty and will likely usher in fresh snap elections so in this video we're going to take a look at the ongoing chaos in Dutch politics why Vilders has decided to pull the plug now and what might happen next [Music] if you're a fan of the channel did you know we also run TLDDR Global our channel where we run down the biggest news stories from around the world including border tensions in Asia or wars in Africa to the economic issues facing the US and even why this South American leader is so unpopular check out the news from all over the world and subscribe today by searching for TLDDR Global first let's start with some context running on a Euroskeptic anti-Islam and anti-immigration platform in November 2023 the Dutch general election saw Vilda's PV win 37 seats in the 150 seat House of Representatives becoming the largest party in the parliament for the first time this was obviously a massive victory for Vilders who during decades in opposition had built a political career on calling for hardline policies against Islam and migration in the Netherlands unfortunately for Vilders other right-wing parties including the People's Party the VDD and New Social Contract or NSC signaled they wouldn't want to serve in a cabinet led by Vilders both because of his highly controversial and possibly unconstitutional policies and because they weren't confident they'd be able to cooperate with him in government as such coalition talks lasted for months and Vilders had to publicly concede he would not be the Dutch prime minister to get over the line luckily for Vilders after dropping some more radical policies like banning the Quran in July of last year he managed to finally cobble together a coalition with the VVD NSC and Farmer Citizens Movement or BBB with party neutral civil servant Dick Shu stepping in as PM however in their 11 months in office support for the PV and its coalition partners has declined marketkedly as recurrent infighting has led to a sense of political deadlock in March a survey by RTL News showed that just one in six voters had confidence in their government and only 10% of voters think the government is taking quote good measures the PV has seen a particularly market decline in the polls and recent projections put the Green Left Labor Alliance on basically the same seat count this is all apparently because voters think the PV has failed to deliver on most of its key manifesto promises such as fixing the country's ongoing housing crisis and radically restricting the Netherlands immigration policies this has led to a fair bit of infighting between Vilders and his coalition partners for example in October last year Versa sought to declare a nationwide state of emergency to push through stricter asylum measures without parliamentary approval the coalition ultimately agreed on a new set of measures but dismissed any additional proposals that would have required declaring a state of emergency over legal concerns something similar happened again in February when Vilders threatened to withdraw from the coalition and call new elections unless his asylum policies were immediately adopted and then again last week when VAS again threatened to pull his party out of government if his coalition partners didn't sign off his new 10-point migration plan which called for halting accepting any new asylum seekers temporarily halting family reunion for asylum seekers who've been granted refugee status in the Netherlands and the return of all Syrians who've applied for asylum or are in the Netherlands on temporary visas as they have in the past the other coalition members resisted VA's demands so on Tuesday morning at about 9:00 a.m dutch time Vildis took to X to announce that as a result of the migration policy impass his PV party would be withdrawing from the coalition of course this wasn't a total surprise vilders had warned at a press conference last week that if immigration policy was not toughened up the PV would be quote out of the cabinet and builders probably also calculated that leaving the coalition was the best thing for the PV electorally given that since entering coalition the PV's poll numbers have steadily declined nonetheless this went down about as well as you'd expect with WA's former coalition partners who accused him of engineering the crisis bbb leader Caroline Vanlass described VA's decision as irresponsible vvd leader Dan Yeshulgus went one further and described it as super irresponsible and NSE leader Nicolen Van Runhovven said it was incomprehensible still there wasn't much the other coalition members could do given that without the PV which was both the largest party in not just the coalition but Parliament more generally there was little chance of them surviving as a government for context after VA's withdrawal Shu's coalition only had 56 seats in the House of Representatives well short of the 76 required for a majority this is why after a brief meeting with the remaining coalition members at 1:30 p.m shu announced that the government had collapsed and tended his resignation to King Villim Alexander who then called for fresh elections so what happens next well as you can probably tell just by looking at the polls Dutch politics is both crowded and volatile so making concrete predictions is difficult for what it's worth Vilders will be hoping that by ditching the coalition he'll be able to return to the political tactic that served him so well in the past namely bashing the Dutch establishment he's presumably hoping that if he can burnish his anti-establishment credentials while arguing that he just needs a few more seats to force his radical policies through he'll be able to reverse the PV's recent poll decline this might sound a bit well optimistic shall we say given where the PV are in the polls at the moment but the PV's popularity in early 2024 when Vilders was playing hard ball in coalition negotiations and the PV were pulling around 35% might give him some confidence nonetheless at the moment polls suggest that both center right and center-left parties could gain quite a few more seats from new elections the Labour Green Left Alliance and the Liberal VVD Party have gained popularity since the 2023 election and are now polling just slightly behind VA's party the leader of the Labour Green Alliance which won most seats in last year's European Parliamentary elections has even said he wants elections as soon as possible suggesting that the party is pretty confident that they could make big gains in a snap election ultimately most Dutch voters will probably be hoping that whoever wins they win a big enough margin to guarantee some degree of political stability and avoid the chaos that followed the last election if you want to know more about this topic there's plenty of other outlets reporting about this online unfortunately it's sometimes hard to tell exactly which way these outlets lean politically making it difficult to understand exactly how your view of the world is being biased by the sources you're reading that's where this week's sponsor Ground News comes in their website and app developed by a former NASA engineer allows us to pull back the curtain on media bias and have a look at exactly how each story has been covered for instance this story about Vilders toppling the Dutch government has been covered by more than 97 sources we know that more than 25 of these have been reported by the left and nine of these have been reported by the right that's not all though ground News has tons of genuinely useful features take their blind spot feed for instance this shows you stories under reportported by one side of the political spectrum or the other for example if you lean right you probably missed this story that at least 24 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire on Tuesday near a USbacked aid distribution site in Rafa Gaza while waiting for aid here at TLDDR News we think that ground news is an incredibly useful tool for our current media landscape one that's constantly trying to attract your attention and sway you towards or away from certain political viewpoints having a tool that helps you spot this and helps you take action really is a gamecher if

Geert Wilders kapt ermee. Huh? Ooohhh... Ja. En dat betekent... ...dat ik direct hierna naar de koning ga om het ontslag van de PVV-bewindspersonen aan te bieden. Einde kabinet-Schoof. Politiek hoog spel van Geert Wilders. Roekeloze kamikaze actie wat hij doet. Ik begrijp nu dat ze heel boos zijn. Ik zag dat een collega fractievoorzitter mij met Bokito vergeleek. En hoewel hij er al wel een paar keer mee dreigde... Dan zijn wij weg. Daar doen wij niet aan mee. Voelt het toch alsof het uit de lucht komt vallen. Maar u vreest niet voor de stabiliteit van het kabinet of de kabinetsval als het zo doorgaat? Nee, helemaal niet! Of toch niet? Heel nauwkeurig geregisseerde crisis met de touwtjes die in handen waren van Geert Wilders. De man die al bijna twintig jaar hunkert naar de positie waarin hij nu zit. Namelijk... De grootste partij van Nederland! ...trekt de stekker uit van, wat toch wel zijn kabinet is. Waarom zou je dat doen? Het interesseert hem niet. In deze video... ...waarom het laten vallen van het kabinet... Ik heb getekend voor het strengste asielbeleid, niet voor de ondergang van Nederland. ...een klassiek 'Wildersje' is. Porren, provoceren, botsen én breken. Dat is eigenlijk de samenvatting van politicus Geert Wilders. Al sinds zijn begindagen bij de VVD. In zijn eigen woorden. Wanneer je iets wil bereiken, moet je uitdagen. Anders krijg je in dit gezapige kikkerlandje geen aandacht. Altijd drie stappen verder gaan dan eigenlijk gewenst is. Ik heb inderdaad in de gaten dat ik niet al te veel sympathie betuigingen heb gekregen... ...van met name de twee dames aan mijn linkerzijde maar verder was het ook niet altijd even positief. Vanaf het begin trekt hij de aandacht. Natuurlijk door z'n blond geverfde coup, die volgens de VVD-partijtop... ...te veel afleidt van de inhoud. En juist op die inhoud botst-ie met zijn partij. Hij is met afstand de meest rechtse VVD'er in de Kamer en roept binnen de partij... ...steeds meer weerstand op. Hij zoekt media-aandacht en mept steeds vaker en harder om zich heen. Oké, context. En vooral ook: tijdsgeest. Pim Fortuyn is vanavond rond 18 uur in Hilversum op het Media Park neergeschoten. Volgens ooggetuigen is hij geraakt door zes kogels. Nederland is namelijk in de ban van moord op Pim Fortuyn. Die de islam... ...een achterlijke cultuur noemt. Achterlijk betekent gewoon dat je niet bij de tijd bent. Nou, dat vind ik en dat heb ik ook aangetoond. En de wereld is in de ban van 9/11... Het politieke en financiele hard van Amerika is getroffen door een reeks... ...terroristische aanslagen die zijn weerga niet kent. Het was een grote explosie en het werd donker, alsof het sneeuwde. ...en terreur. Iets waar Wilders daarvoor al voor waarschuwde. Daarna wordt het zijn politieke speerpunt. Al is hij voor de islam als religie nog mild. De islam, daar is niets mis mee. Dat is een te respecteren godsdienst. Ook de meeste moslims in de wereld maar ook in Nederland zijn goede burgers waar niets mis mee is. Het gaat om dat kleine stukje moslimextremisme. Daarna draait hij. Zeg maar. Meer islam betekent minder vrijheid en minder tolerantie. In de Koran zit meer antisemitisme dan in 'Mein Kampf'. Ik ben ervan overtuigd dat als er in Nederland nazi-tempels zouden zijn... ...dan zouden wij dat ook, dan zou de wereld te klein zijn als dat toegestaan zou zijn. Nou dit is, gelooft u mij de islamitische ideologie is zo mogelijk nog gevaarlijker. Meer of minder Marokkanen? Minder, minder! Dan gaan we dat regelen. Maar in zijn VVD-periode gaat het hem vooral om fundamentalisme. Hij wordt feller, moet worden beveiligd en is op ramkoers met zijn partij. Kom ik hier uit? En uiteindelijk stapt hij eruit. Goedemiddag. Hoe is het met u? Een dubbel gevoel. Aan de ene kant nog steeds een kater want het is toch heel vervelend wat er gisteren allemaal is gebeurd. Maar aan de andere kant ook een gevoel van opluchting. Nu moeten we er wat moois van gaan maken. Ik ben mijn maatje kwijt. Wilders duikt in een politiek gat... Omdat de VVD geen antwoord had op Fortuyn. En Wilders wil nu een nieuwe beweging opzetten, die verdacht veel lijkt op die van Pim Fortuyn. Het gaat er niet om of ik de baas ben of een ander, het gaat er nu om... ...dat er wordt geluisterd naar wat de mensen in het land en op straat, in de steden en de dorpen vinden. ...en niet veel later heeft hij zijn eigen partij. Nou ja, ik ben Geert Wilders. Ik heb mijn eigen stijl, ik heb mijn eigen eigenschappen en authenticiteit. Hij begint op zijn meegenomen oude VVD-zetel als eenmansfractie, met de naam: 'Groep Wilders'. Hij spreekt een bepaalde groep aan. En dit... Regisseur, schrijver en televisiemaker Theo van Gogh is vermoord. ...maakt hem alleen maar populairder. Op een gegeven moment zelfs groter dan de VVD. Vanaf dat moment gaan al alle pijlen op de islam. En Groep Wilders wordt de Partij voor de Vrijheid. Onder meer... Voor een einde aan die toenemende groei van de islam in Nederland. Gaat niet zonder slag of stoot. Maar bij de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen haalt-ie... ...negen zetels! Breken met de macht, voor meer macht. Wie helpt Nederland de woestijn van de crisis door? Goedenavond dames en heren en welkom bij wat een heel spannende avond beloofd te worden. Verkiezingsavond, hier bij de NOS. Fast forward naar 2010, de tweede keer dat Wilders meedoet met de verkiezingen. Ze winnen... ...dik. Wat gaat Wilders doen? Hijzelf rekent op 25 zetels... En hij krijgt er 23. Nou, dat is voor hem een enorme overwinning. Die 23 worden er uiteindelijk 24 en voor het eerst zit de partij aan de grote mensen tafel. Maar dat roept weerstand op. Meneer Wilders gaat u met goed nieuws naar de informateur? Dat gaan we aan de informateur vertellen, het spijt me. Geen commentaar. Vanwege het anti-islamstandpunt willen andere partijen niet met hem regeren. Ik heb gezegd wat ik heb gezegd vrienden. Vooral het CDA twijfelt. Doe het niet. Doe dit ons land niet aan. Uiteindelijk wordt op het partijcongres ingestemd met een gedoogconstructie. Een feest van de democratie. En Nederland heeft een nieuw kabinet, voor het eerst met gedoogsteun. Daar is de koningin met de nieuwe premier van Nederland. Het wordt een kabinet... Waar rechts zijn vingers bij aflikt. En Geert Wilders is trots. Ik ben ontzettend blij dat het kabinet Rutte-Verhagen er nu staat... ...dat Nederland eindelijk toch op een keerpunt staat om te kunnen veranderen. Maar dat is van korte duur... ...want echt vrienden met z'n coalitiegenoten wordt hij niet. Doe eens normaal man, wat ach? Ja doe eens normaal man? Doe lekker zelf normaal! De PVV doet het niet goed in de peilingen... In de wekelijkse peiling van Maurice de Hond verliest de PVV vier zetels. Geert Wilders staat nu op 21... ...dat zijn er drie minder dan ze nu in de Tweede Kamer hebben. ...en Wilders strekt zich terug. Het kabinet Rutte I heeft anderhalf jaar geregeerd, maar vanmiddag kwam het ten val. Na 7 weken onderhandelen over een bezuinigingspakket van 15 miljard euro... ...trok Geert Wilders zijn steun aan de coalitie in. Hij vindt dat het pakket met bezuinigingen niet in het belang van zijn kiezers is. De PVV is gekozen door ongeveer 1,5 miljoen Nederlanders. En als wij vinden dat het niet in hun belang is dat de AOW'ers hard worden gepakt... ...dan is dat slecht voor Nederland. Rutte boos... ...en noemt Wilders een wegloper die zijn verantwoordelijkheid niet pakt. Het is wel tekenend dat het zwarte pietenspel is begonnen. Maar dat weglopen komt vrij onverwachts. We hebben dat in 2012 ook gezien, toen met het Catshuis. Stond hij ineens buiten, had niemand verwacht. Hijzelf volgens mij ook niet want z'n chauffeur was er nog niet eens. Hij gokt... ...en verliest. Want bij de verkiezingen van 2012 zakt de PVV... ...van 24 zetels in de Tweede Kamer. Komt nu uit op 15, een gevoelig verlies. 9 zetels levert de PVV in. ...terwijl de VVD een recordaantal van 41 zetels haalt. Voor ons een bijzondere avond. Twee jaar geleden met een overwinning, nu met een nederlaag... ...en ik beloof u dat ik er nog steeds sta als wij over een paar jaar als er weer verkiezingen zijn... ...opnieuw een klinkende overwinning zullen halen. Breuk twee. Kunnen we beginnen of moeten we tot 15 uur wachten? Zullen we maar beginnen? Goed! Vrienden van de pers. Mei 2025. Wilders legt een bom onder het kabinet. Ons geduld is nu op. Er moet wat veranderen. En snel. Zo niet? Is de PVV uit het kabinet. Dan zijn we weg. Z'n coalitiepartners lijken hem niet al te serieus te nemen. Het is ook niet de eerste keer dat hij zoiets doet. Ach, die manier van communiceren die kennen we ondertussen... ...en we weten ondertussen ook wel hoe we ermee om moeten gaan. U vreest niet voor de stabiliteit van het kabinet of misschien wel de kabinetsval als het zo doorgaat? Nee, helemaal niet! Maar Wilders blijkt bloedserieus. Hij kwam met een hele korte mededeling. Van hem hoeft het allemaal niet meer. Het interesseert hem niet, hij stapt uit de coalitie. Dus ik kon niets anders doen nu dan te zeggen dan trekken wij onze steun aan dit kabinet in. Ik ben ontzettend pissig. Ja, de tweede keer dat Wilders een kabinet laat sneuvelen. Dat-ie uiteindelijk in deze positie terechtkomt als... De grootste partij van Nederland! ...is als je terugkijkt helemaal niet zo vanzelfsprekend. In de jaren na de gedoogconstructie is het eigenlijk nooit stil rondom Wilders. Zo wordt hij bijvoorbeeld veroordeeld voor zijn minder Marokkanen-uitspraak. Dan gaan we dat regelen. Verliest daarna bij de verkiezingen 3 zetels. En ja ik had natuurlijk op wat meer gehoopt, dan de 17. Maar uiteindelijk zijn daar de verkiezingen van 2023. Korte terugblik. Er heerst veel onvrede in het land en in de campagne zegt de PVV-leider steevast... ...ik wil het Torentje in. Jullie worden door Den Haag schandelijk in de steek gelaten. En... ...de PVV wint... 35! ...en gaat formeren. Gaat wel moeizaam, vanaf dag één al. Weet je, ik word daar eerlijk gezegd een beetje moe van. Het zal me verder een worst zijn, dit is wat ik erover te zeggen heb. Ongepast. Wilders wil graag, en allerlei PVV-punten gaan die beruchte ijskast in. De ijskast. Uiteindelijk geeft-ie zelfs het premierschap op. Nou ja weet u... ...we zijn de grootste partij geworden dus ik vind ook dat ik premier had moeten worden. Na 223 dagen formeren is daar dan eindelijk... ...het hoofdlijnenakkoord. Nederland wordt veiliger en de zon gaat weer schijnen. En daarbij hoort een partijloze premier. De sleutel. Over met het drama... ...althans... ...zou je zeggen. Dat verklaar en beloof ik. Maar kabinet-Schoof wordt vooral... Een kabinet met als rode draad moeizame samenwerking, kleine relletjes en grotere conflicten. En ook dat is al vanaf dag één. Na een tweet van vicepremier Agema over hoofddoeken... ...krijgt Schoof bij zijn eerste grote debat direct de volle laag. Het is een circus, en geen serieus kabinet. Tijdens dit kabinet zet mevrouw Agema hier de boel volledig in de fik. Zijn grote woorden voorzitter. Nogal wiedes grote woorden. Dit is een bloedserieus kabinet. Niet alleen van de oppositie, maar ook van zijn partner Wilders. Ja, ja dat was dus slappe hap. Ja mag ik dat zeggen? Dat was slappe hap. Mijn bedoeling om nieuws te maken zoals ik dat vandaag heb gedaan... ...ik had de tweet niet moeten plaatsen en ik zal dat ook zeker niet meer doen. Tussen de partijleiders, die in de Kamer zijn gebleven, gaat het ook niet lekker... ...en bij de eerste onderhandelingen over Prinsjesdag gaat het al bijna mis. Het is echt ingewikkeld, complex. Wordt gefixt. Of zo. Ze krijgen wéér ruzie. Dit keer over het asielbeleid. Of asielcrisis zoals de PVV het noemt. De mensen ervaren sowieso in ons land een asielcrisis. Ze willen het noodrecht inzetten om dat aan te pakken. Maar dat wordt niet gepikt. Artikel 68 van de Grondwet. Sjongejongejonge. Maakten we een video over. Weet je nog? Maar ik ben beleid. Maar goed, ook daar komen ze uit. Nou, ik had liever gezien dat de regels waren uitgevoerd zoals ze zijn afgesproken... Om daarna weer in een nieuwe rel te rollen. Dit betekent dat ik vandaag aan de koning heb verzocht... ...om mij ontslag te verlenen. Bewindspersonen stappen op en anderen dreigen ermee. Tot diep in de nacht is er crisisoverleg en weer lukt het de partijleiders om eruit te komen. In de tussentijd komen grote problemen op de plank te liggen. En dan is daar de voorjaarsnota. Heeft u wel eens het idee gehad: we komen er niet uit? - Ja dat heb ik zeker gehad. Overleven ze ook. Maar al die tijd blijft Wilders boos. Want hij vindt dat het kabinet te weinig doet aan zijn thema: asiel en migratie. Dat mijn geduld nu wel op is. En dan komen we dus uit in mei. Dat de handschoenen van de PVV vanaf vandaag uitgaan. Die bom onder het kabinet is een eisenpakket, het zogeheten tienpuntenplan. En het is take it or leave it. Tienduizenden Syriërs terug naar eigen land en als je hier als vreemdeling fors over de schreef gaat... ...en je misdraagt, dan ga je het land uit. Ze overleggen en de coalitiepartners zeggen: Wij hebben aangegeven met z'n drieën dat alles wat in zijn plan staat al uitgevoerd kon worden. En dat wij niet in de blokkade zitten. Ik geloof dat iedereen er nu nog een nachtje over gaat slapen. Maar Wilders lijkt z'n keuze allang te hebben gemaakt. Nog één crisisoverleg. Mag ik doorlopen alstublieft? Ik ga eerst met mijn collega's praten. Tien minuten later is het gedaan. En z'n coalitiegenoten... ...voormalig-coalitiegenoten moet ik zeggen. ...die zeggen eigenlijk allemaal... *bliep* Hij kwam met een hele korte mededeling. Van hem hoeft het allemaal niet meer. Er komt hierna echt geen rechts kabinet meer. Waarom? Want juist dit kabinet is toch... ...een unieke kans voor Wilders om datgene wat hij al jaren roept wat moet gebeuren... ...nu zelf waar te maken. Net als in 2012 daalt de PVV in de peilingen en groeien de VVD en GroenLinks/PvdA. Daarnaast krijgen ook BBB en vooral NSC rake klappen. Ja, maar het is ook... Politiek hoogspel van Geert Wilders. Probleem van Wilders en veel populistische politici. Je belooft heel veel, eigenlijk te veel, en je belooft ook dat het heel snel kan. Daarmee kun je heel veel kiezers trekken maar op het moment dat je aan de macht komt... ...heb je eigenlijk bij voorbaat al je eigen teleurstelling gecreëerd. En het feit dat de andere partijen zeggen: stuur het plan naar je minister, werk het uit.... ...is natuurlijk geen garantie dat iets door een ministerraad of door de Tweede Kamer komt. En hij ergert zich kapot aan NSC. Nee u heeft ons tergend gek gemaakt. Het is Nieuw Sociaal Contract. Zoals uw partij heet. Maar als het zou heten... ...Nederlandse Sabotage Club dan had het ook geklopt. Ik vind dit een persoonlijke aanval en dat is precies de reden waarom... ...samenwerken met u zo ongelofelijk ingewikkeld is. En op deze manier... ...hoopt dat hij de volgende keer meer zetels haalt. Zelf de premier wordt, minder afhankelijk is van andere coalitiepartijen. En anderen de schuld geven... ...dat het een bewust opgezet idee is. Die tien punten maken we. Ik eis dat het mooi weer komt en als het niet gebeurt dan is het jouw schuld. Dus ja... ...tactiek. Het concept 'kabinet laten vallen' is een bekende politieke strategie. Is niet de eerste keer dat we dit zien. Normaal maak je de anderen zo boos dat die de stekker eruit trekken. Tenminste, in mijn Machiavellistische buien hadden wij altijd wel iets klaarliggen om coalitiepartners zo boos te maken... ...dat ze dan de stekker eruit zouden trekken. En die strategie werd ook Rutte verweten toen hij het vorige kabinet liet klappen. Ik vind het een heel zwaar moment. Wat ik vind, is dat je als kabinet bij zo'n probleem de verantwoordelijkheid hebt om het op te lossen. En het kan werken. Maar ook niet. Wilders is electoraal goed voor 25, maximaal 30 zetels, normaal. De vorige verkiezingen heeft hij veel meer gehaald omdat hij heel veel ontevreden VVD'ers... ...en CDA'ers heeft binnen weten te harken. Maar daar zitten heel veel kiezers tussen die zeggen: ja, je moet het nu ook wel laten zien. En als hij het nu niet laat zien door voortijdig te stoppen... ...zullen die kiezers niet nog een keer weer naar Wilders gaan. De grote vraag is: hoe reageert de kiezer? Als je tegengewerkt wordt kun je niks oplossen toch? Met die man valt niet te regeren. Wilders zelf is er in ieder geval klaar voor. Sterker nog: ik ga ervoor om de volgende keer premier van Nederland te worden. Om weer aan de verkiezingen mee te doen en zorgen dat waar kan de PVV groter wordt dan ooit. Ja, we krijgen in ieder geval nieuwe verkiezingen. En dat betekent dat... ...alle partijen in campagnestand staan. En in de Kamer is dat maar al te duidelijk. Geert Wilders laat Nederland in de steek. Dit kabinet heeft helemaal niets bereikt. Het is lulkoek, de PVV heeft zelf incapabele bestuurders geleverd. Wilt u wel een beetje fatsoenlijke woorden gebruiken? Ja voorzitter ik kom ook uit Rotterdam-Zuid. Als dat een excuus is. Maar goed, feit is wel... Links, rechts. Ze zijn het wel over een ding eens: verkiezingen, formatie... ...het zorgt voor maanden stilstand en daar heeft niemand wat aan. Ik was beleid. Ja. Wij gaan in de aanloop naar de verkiezingen in ieder geval heel veel voor je maken. Dus wil je niks missen, abonneer je dan even. Joe!" />

And joining me now is Seth Jones national security expert and president of the center for Strategic and International So, Seth, you have just returned from reviewing frontline drone f You've done that with top military leadership from Ukraine. So so you've seen things that none of us have actually se What stands out to you from that from what you saw, from what you heard about what r happened on those air bases? Well, Aaron, what what is really is how the Ukrainians used the Russian logistics system, including their mobile network, to first to smuggle drones into Russia itself and then to use the mobile syste and the satellite system from Russian territory as they, conducted strikes. So, I mean, it's not just gettin that, that those platforms into Russian territory, but it's also taking advantage of what was available in Russia to strike targets. And it really shows how vulnerable countries can be if those kinds of drones are smu inside of those countries, obviously more than just Russia. Right. Well, and that and that sends a very sobering t you just said there. So when you're with that top military leadership, though, you know, we have those big attacks overni some of the biggest since the war began in Kiev. is that it? I mean, what do they think Putin is going to do? I mean, Trump made it very clear that Putin was going to do somet and that she's fires off and which it was never really on But but you get the point. what does Ukraine think is going to happen Well, Erin, I think there are a few things. One is the, Ukrainian leadership And I talked to the head of the office of the president, while he was in Washington this They they do expect, the Russians to conduct a range missile, ballistic missile and drone strikes agains including Kiev. in large numbers. That's the way the Russians resp I don't think they expect to see any kind of a nuclear res although, Putin routinely threatens those. But I think at the end of the da the problem that the Russians ha is they they are not effectively conducting military operations. They're dying in really historic at least since World War two. And so I think that's what the that's the Ukrainian response is to keep fighting them on the And that's where the Russians re at their biggest weakness. Okay. So on that, you know, we haven't heard that sort of an in a while. In fact, what we've heard is that in a war of attrition, Russia will win because they have more men. And it's just that simple. And that it boils down to number and the numbers are horrible, but they don't favor Ukraine. So the longer this continues, the more it favors Russia, right That has become the narrative right out there. But you've got new reporting and and you're talking about struggles on the front line for Putin's forces to advance. you've got numbers on the equipm that they've lost a lot more equ than Ukraine, that the casualty numbers now approach a million for Russi In fact, you gave us a chart that shows the daily average of casualties since the war began. And it all challenges the narrative that Putin can just continue and afford to go on indefinitely You know, when you went through and looked at all these numbers right now, which do challenge the current narrative, what surprised you the most? Er, there were two things that, surprised me and the and one of them was, was one of the numbers that the president himself remarked out of our report in the Oval Office yesterday. One was just the sheer casualties that the Russians have suffered. nearly a million. They'll hit the 1 million mark by June or July. And and also in a historical per the the Russians have lost now, more than five times the number of soldiers than in all Russian wars combined between the end of Worl and the beginning of their, full scale invasion in February I mean, 77 year period versus a three year period a little over three year period. Still five times the number that they've lost over the last three years. I mean, it's just stunning in its, in its, significance. And also the other thing that wa that was interesting in what we found was how, little territory and how slow the advance of the has been slower than some of the most grinding and grisly offensive during World War one. Wow. And, you know, when we hear abou and just the the sheer death and suffering, in that war, trench warfare, where, of course, it's trench warfare here again. Seth, thank you so much. Thanks, Aaron." />

there Paul Adams paul what do you make of what the mayor of Harkiv had to say saying that this is the most powerful attack on the region since the start of the fullcale invasion how fair an assessment is that well it's not the most deadly there have been other uh attacks on Khib that have killed more civilians but it does seem to have been one of the most intense our understanding is that this all took place within the space of about 90 minutes uh in the hours before dawn uh and with reports of around 40 explosions including drones glide bombs that the Russians use uh particularly in areas closer to the front lines and also at least one ballistic missile so for that period of time that was clearly a very very intense and terrifying experience for the people of Kharkiv and the pictures that we have seen this morning of apartment blocks and private buildings on fire give you some sense of how grim it must have felt we heard there President Trump saying Ukraine gave President Putin a reason to go in and bomb the hell out of them following that spid web attack on Russia how are those comments being received in Kiev there you know Ukrainians are extremely weary of hearing this kind of language that somehow things that they do to attack Russia trigger retaliation i mean after all the night before Operation Spid Russia launched 472 drones over Ukraine you know this has been going on for more than three years what on earth does Donald Trump think that Ukraine has been experiencing night after night for all of this time i think it's clear that when he spoke to Vladimir Putin just a few days ago uh the President Putin bent his ear probably about Operation Spid which was clearly a massive humiliation for the Russian air force uh but also about an alleged attack on a passenger train inside Russia a train that was heading in the direction of Moscow uh that uh that crashed into a bridge that had been blown up killing seven civilians the Russians say that that was an act of terrorism by Ukraine they have yet to provide any evidence for that but clearly that's what uh one of the things that President Putin was telling Donald Trump about paul thank you that's the BBC's Paul Adams in Kiev there well let's bring in Mikolola Biliskov who's a research fellow at Ukraine's National Institute for Strategic Studies which is part of the Department of Defense Policy he's in Kiev as well thank you for joining us on BBC News so we've seen two days of major Russian strikes on Ukraine is this Russia's retaliation for that spiders web attack on its territory well well the way people are putting it as for me is a justification for the Russian acts there is a saying in Ukraine that demonstrates the absurdity of this uh justification that says that if Ukraine stopped fighting there would be no Ukraine and if Russia stop fighting there would be no war so we target everything that is used to terrorize Ukrainian cities Ukrainian infrastructure and it is within the right of self-defense so in that regard what do you make of President Trump's comments that Ukraine had given President Putin a reason to go ahead and bomb the hell out of them and what does that mean in terms of Kiev's relationship with Washington DC well that's incredible and that's a major frustration to equate uh the aggressor and the countries that suffer from aggression again we exercising the right of self-defense it is uh the 51st article of a UN charter and when someone even if it's US president as he think himself as a mediator put it in such a way unfortunately uh he is not creating conditions for the peace and for sure it's not good for US Ukrainian relations which we value so that's incredible and frustration and what do you make of these missile attacks is there a strategic value to them in terms of what's happening on the ground in the war because we keep hearing about a Russian summer offensive what's happening on the front lines at the moment well u these are two separate acts they exist in a parallel so Russia is waging so-called total war with total war you deliberately target civilians civilian infrastructure rare areas to undermine the moral to make life untenable maybe to create uh the situation when Ukrainian citizens would pressure Ukrainian government to negotiate on Russian terms uh but it has nothing to do with the front line and within the front line Russians trying to advance and we try to arrest them and uh these are just two parallel stories and Russian attacks against civilians it's part of the total war approach that thus far is not delivering to them but unfortunately Russians still don't come to the conclusion that it's futile to do this total war and we continue to see images coming in from Ukraine and we hear reports of civilians having to take cover when you have these constant constant missile attacks and of course those alerts for Ukrainians to really go into bunkers how does it affect the life of civilians in the country again that's a part of Russian approach to make life unbearable you know sleep deprivation it's a major problem and it has a cumulative effect when you do not sleep enough your cognitive and physical abilities decline and again it's very vicious intent of the Russians to undermine Ukrainian moral but thus far it proved to be counterproductive thank you very much that's Michiskov there from Ukraine's National Institute for Strategic Studies thank you" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="the 7th of October did not come out of the blue sky it came after 18 or 17 years of Gaza as a cage Gaza is the biggest open prison in the world and what did we expect will will grow there under this conditions if not terrible mutations no other way to to describe it of of people who came to murder to kill to to rape to to do terrible things now the killing of Gaza reports on a catastrophe is a new book from the award-winning Israeli journalist Gideon Levy who writes for the liberal newspaper has aretes in Israel he is one of the most outspoken and controversial critics of his country's war in Gaza and of its approach to Gaza over decades what he calls Israel's aparte policies against the Palestinian people in this book he brings together his on theeg ground perspectives of the events leading up to the 7th of October and the ensuing Devastation of Gaza Gideon Levy welcome to radio thank you for having me oh thank you so much for being here now Gideon you are a controversial figure in Israel and an Israeli because of the strength of your opinions against your own government's treatment of Gaza even after it started to become clear what had happened in Israel on the October 27th 2023 sorry October the 7th 2023 you wrote behind all this lies Israeli arrogance the idea that we can do whatever we like that we'll never pay the price and never be punished for it we carry on undisturbed the Gaza Palestinians have decided they're willing to pay any price for a moment of freedom is there any hope in that no will Israel learn its lesson no now not many Israelis or people in the media held or able to hold positions like that Gideon what makes you able to do so first of all it's very unfortunate that not many people in the media can hold those positions but for sure in Israel it is problematic because I covered the Israeli occupation for the last 35 years and I guess I saw things that no other Israeli was exposed to and you know my my positions developed throughout my my research my witnessing my permanent visits to Gaza and to the West Bank and what you see there you don't see in Israel and it's not shown in Israel so I think that much of my positions are due to to my trips to the occupied territories and witnessing the crimes and witnessing the brutality which is avoided for most of Israelis so you say this you say this in your book that that most Israelis don't see this you say that Gaza is hidden hidden from the view of the Israeli public and that anybody watching television in Nebraska or any news newspaper reader in Scotland is witnessed to more of what is happening in the Gaza Strip than the average Israeli viewer is that true does Israel really not know what's going on I invite you to watch Israeli channels and to read Israeli newspapers and you will judge by yourself it's weeks and weeks that Israel gets weeks it's now one year that Israel gets only a one-sided picture with information only about our brave soldiers and our casualties and the hostages all very important um facts obviously but there is also another people and there is also another suffer and in the last year the other suffer is so much worse than our suffer that it should be at least covered should be told many Israelis might might justify it many Israelis might blame the Palestinians for the OWN Destiny that's fair enough but not knowing is not a privilege of any intelligent person in a democracy and unfortunately most of the Israelis choose this option and the Israeli media is collaborating with this and I guess as a result of this uh you say that nearly all Israelis are united around this aspiration to punish Gaza um in its entirety and there's almost a lack of opposition completely to carrying on with the war and and list I imizing these extreme reactions yes Israel has a very devoted opposition to the Netanyahu government to Netanyahu in person Israel has a very vocal protest for releasing the hostages which is quite REM remarkable but there is no opposition whatsoever to the war and its cries this is hardly seen in Israel except of some very devoted groups but very marginal ones unfortunately Israel supports this war basically and Israel is not troubled by the crimes and the crimes are on a daily basis by the time we are talking now more and more suffer more and more crimes in Gaza in the West Bank and very little of it is reported to the israelies but I think Gideon certainly judging from the reaction that I'm already getting from listeners the idea that there is a context an explanation for what happens on October the 7th um you know from people in and outside of Israel who who've read and heard and seen what Hamas did on that day you is Unthinkable especially when we have families who have no idea what happened to their loved ones or or still where they are everything has a context and to deny the context means not to want to solve anything because without understanding the context nothing will ever be sto by saying that there is a context it doesn't mean that all the means were justified by all means not but the context must be understood the 7th of October did not come out of the blue sky it came after 18 or 17 years of Gaza as a cage Gaza is the biggest open prison in the world and what did we expect will will grow there under these conditions if not terrible mutations no other way to to describe it of of people who came to murder to kill to to rape to to do terrible things but you have to understand that this had a context and the context is the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and also Gaza in different ways and if you want ever to solve it you have to realize that there is a context yes there is a context but what would what would a proportionate response by Israel have looked like to you I mean some would say that the US responded in a not totally dissimilar way after 9/11 how do you respond to the biggest terrorist attack on your people within living memory so first of all I would offer to listen to President Biden who told Israel learn from our disproportional way or for our mistakes when we reacted on the N9 911 the American reaction after 911 what was tot out of proportion and at least the current president is regretting it same for Israel now the question is not the justification the question is first of all did Israel gain anything out of this one year of brutal attack on Gaza killing and destructing and punishing without any borders is Israel in a better place now is Israel a more secure place today than one year ago is Israel more beloved in the world than one year ago those questions should be asked by the Israelis and then should be also come the questions of legitimacy you know the fact that you are a victim of an attack does not permit you to do whatever you want there are limits there are legal limits and above all moral limits and killing 17,000 children is far beyond any limit and any justification so I to talk about the international reaction because you do say one thing needs to be clear without International involvement there will never be a solution Israel is not going to wake up one morning and say to itself or to anyone else the occupation The Siege and the aparte are not good let's bring them to an end so Gideon what should the International Community be doing and who if anyone do you see any signs of doing so so first of all the biggest leverage in is obviously in the hands of the United States the United States applied in this this year Israel with all the arms and the ammunition and the Diplomatic support that it needed in other words the United States told Israel go for this war be brutal as you want we will supply all you need all your needs for this and this must be clear because the rhetoric of the American Administration was the opposite one but rhetoric is one thing and policy and measures is another thing and Israel learned that the United States is behind this war and we have to realize that the United States is part of this war and part of the crimes of this of this war now what could the International Community do everything just let take a lesson from what the the International Community did Visa V the aparte system in South Africa look how just the voted and effective was the International Community when it dealt with the first first apartheid state now you deal with the second apartheid state and the world is doing nothing about it and this is not only a crime against the victims this is also very bad for Israel because Israel needs someone to to to repair it and it will not come as I wrote it will not come from within Israel Gideon leevy thank you so much for your time this morning the killing of Gaza by Gideon Levy is

          <attvalue for="7" value="this week on Worldview as the government builds its international narrative post operation Synindhur how high did political diplomacy score dozens of MPs that visited more than 30 countries abroad now returned So we're going to take a closer look at their mandate and whether it was mission [Music] accomplished Hello and welcome I'm Sasini Heather and this is World View Now after intense official diplomacy during that 4-day conflict of operation Sindur the government now fielded India's political diplomats Seven delegations with 59 members mostly members of parliament from across political parties to 32 countries They're now home or on the way Now such delegations have been sent in the past In 1994 when Prime Minister PV Narisimaro sent opposition leader Vajai and then former Kashmir Chief Minister Faruk Abdullah to the UN human rights council to defeat a resolution against India and they were successful Then in 2008 after the Mumbai attacks when Prime Minister Manm Singh sent all party delegations to make India's case against Pakistan they were armed with dossiers of Pakistan's complicity in the attacks and they were successful in building an international consensus in favor of India and want to bring Pakistan to account However this is the first time that the Modi government has actually done the same thing and that's possibly for a few reasons why in 2025 uh they decided to do it The first that while the world condemned the Pelgam terror attacks very few countries issued statements supporting India's operations against Pakistan uh particularly visible or audible I should say from the neighborhood unlike in 2016 and 2019 when the Indian operations on Pakistan were short this time the operations turned into an escalatory 4-day conflict so alarm and concerns worldwide also the narrative that India had lost its fighter jets or its planes something the government has now accepted alluded to but not fully clarified that has clouded the military success of operation Synindhindu for the media abroad The third that the Modi government really has been under criticism internationally for a democratic downslide and for increasing majoritarianism within the country So sending multi-party multiffaith delegations counters that India also wanted to counter the statement by US President Donald Trump that the US had somehow mediated to end a nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan something he's repeated a dozen times even though India has denied it and despite India's pleas that international organizations continue to give Pakistan space in particular uh as an elected member of the UN security council Pakistan was able to alter the resolution on the Pelgam terror attack and to remove references to the resistance front the TRF that claimed responsibility for the attack on April 22nd uh this month Pakistan has been elected chair of the 1267 Taliban sanctions committee that looks at globally designated terrorists and is the vice chair of the counterterrorism committee at the UN security council Now even during the conflict while that was on the IMF tier 2 loans uh two separate loans for a total of $2.4 $4 billion for Pakistan And despite Prime Minister Modi meeting with the Asian Development Bank chief the bank actually cleared $800 million in loans for Pakistan just in the past month Now for the missions of those delegations itself the countries that were chosen were nearly all either members of the UN Security Council or about to be elected to it China in fact was the only P5 member No delegation went to a special focus however was made on the US where the delegation spent a total of six days over two parts and a special effort was made to speak to Gulf countries and to Southeast Asian countries who are members of the organization for Islamic cooperation that has been particularly critical of India So it was important to address them The message that these delegations took was three-fold The first was really the message of the new normal that Prime Minister Modi has spoken about as Indian policy now One any act of terror will be seen as an act of war Second that India would not bow to nuclear blackmail And third in responding India will not distinguish between state actors and non-state actors The second part of the message was that India as a victim of crossber terrorism was justified in the operation Synindhuru strikes on Pakistan And the third that unlike Pakistan India is a secular pluralistic democratic country with a growing economy We have five political parties amongst my seven MPs and we would have had a sixth one if if a lady hadn't dropped out at the last minute We've got three religions We've got seven states It's a it's an incredible cross-section reflective of India's diversity And yet we've come with a united message We have nothing against that the people living over there but their government their deep state their ISI their pro selfro their promoted uh terrorist organizations are indulging in terrorism and and Pakistan has become an epicenter of takirism We are here to put our point of view Uh we are here to tell the world not just the United States but the world in seven different delegations in many many different countries that India has had enough and just like countries like the United States have every right to protect themselves have every right to take out terrorists whether they're state sponsored whether they're non-state actors India has that same right the national language of India is unity and diversity now the teams won many accolades for their efforts in many capitals They met with leaders ministers parliamentarians forcefully sent out their message to the public But they also faced some challenges Uh they faced questions about evidence linking Pakistan to the Pelgam terror attacks And while India has spoken about a broad uh body of evidence against Pakistan over so many years it is the specifics of the Pelgam terror attacks that they're waiting for The second questions about India's own record with regard to minorities and then on Kashmir and some questions in India about why these delegations spend so much time speaking to the Indian diaspora at Indian high commissions and embassies speaking not to local but to Indian media at all these places who don't need convincing In addition Pakistan ran a copycat move on a smaller scale if you like One special adviser to Pakistan PM Sharif Tarik Fatimi took a delegation to Moscow He met with foreign minister Lavro An opposition leader in Pakistan Bilawal Pau is leading a multi-party delegation to the US UK and Belgium Brussels where the European Union is headquartered and to the United Nations So what was their method or their mandate to call India strikes as illegal in international law to push for the restoration of the Indis water treaty and to counter charges against Pakistan's terrorism or support of terrorism by accusing India of supporting the Balo liberation army especially for the Jaffer train attack and to play up the panon nijer killings in US and Canada where Indian agents have been implicated or indicted that Pakistani delegation will be traveling until June 18 So we might see more of that So what's world views take given that countries around the world have faced terror attacks with some threat to Pakistan India's task in justifying operation Sindur is not a very difficult one and the impact of the MP delegations will of course be assessed over the next few months uh for results The twoprong task ahead of the government however is internally to investigate how the Pelgam attacks took place and how the terrorists have been able to evade Indian forces and externally to take India's quest to bring those terrorists to justice at the UN security council the financial action task force and at other international organizations So a tough road still ahead Let's get you some world worldview reading recommendations and of course uh you can get many more details about the delegations what they achieved whom they met on the Hindus website www.thehindu.com the hindu.com but here are some books uh many of them very recent books I hope you enjoy reading one is called Pakistan Ideologies strategies and interests by former diplomat DP Shvastav I haven't yet read this book I hope to tell you more about it soon but it's just out he's also the author of Kashmir the other side of the line of control a lot of personal experience there the second book called hybrid rule in Pakistan about the military polity uh relationship by Zahed Hussein a very famous columnist very well respected in Pakistan uh fighting to the end the Pakistan army's way of war this is by professor Christine fair and vigilant Islamist religious parties and anti-state violence in Pakistan by Joshua T White another scholar uh there's a book on the legal ramifications it's called unraveling the Kashmir not past present and future by Aman Hangarani who's a mediator and a book called Pakistan the Balojasthan conundrum by Tilik Dva Asher who has of course served in Pakistan as well So we hope you will continue to read and make up your own mind From the team at Worldview thanks for watching" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="the head of nier's presidential guard has been described as mysterious there's even debate about his name the tenuous consensus is that it's General Omar chiani so let's go with that General chiani became head of niger's presidential guard in 2015 he has defended the president from two separate coup attempts but something must have soured because lately rumors have been circulating that the president was planning to fight him now the classic phrase to pull out in circumstances like this is you can't fire me I quit but a few weeks ago General chiani went with a slight variation you can't fire me I'm firing you leader General Tiani has suspended the country's Constitution and named himself head of state ner compatriot and as for the president he's locked himself in his safe room and refuses to come out like seriously it's been weeks now and the rumor is he's still in there soon after the coup a small group of Nigerians not Nigerians Nigerians gathered in the capital the army they waved flags and chanted Long Live Putin down with France the flags they held were Russian the K ner is just the latest in West Africa there's been a seemingly Unstoppable wave of them lately washing along the edge of the Sahara gaining strength each time Western Central Africa's seventh coup in 3 years seven coups you see while everyone else has their eyes on the war in Ukraine West Africa is threatening to break out into war on this week's episode what are France and Russia doing in West Africa and could they end up in a foxy War I'm Matt Bon and this is if you're [Music] listening there's a long history of foreign powers Landing in African nations and laying claim to land resources and even people they come because there's things in Africa that they want and the City of arlet in ner is no different [Music] town called Alit a r l i t it's in the Sahara Desert it's very isolated right in the middle of nowhere it's a sand blasted place where temperatures are around 40° for half the year and it barely ever rains houses are built of sandstone with thick walls to keep out the elements there's no water there just sand and dirt but arage is also very unusual for an isolated City in ner its Hospital provides free First World Health Care to all 100,000 residents there's a modern international airport and a fully paved Highway running 900 km to the capital Western Products are for sale in the supermarkets and that's because While most cities in the Sahara are centuries old arlit is very new until 65 years years ago there was no reason to live there until French scientists arrived in 1969 extremely interested in the dirt it turns out if you dig up that dirt filter it smoosh it up then spin it very fast it'll start to get very very very hot hot enough to generate enough nuclear energy to power most of France 2/3 of n's uranium is sent to the nuclear power plants that Supply most of the energy for France and also its nuclear Arsenal this is why France is in ner for its resources it's beautiful glowy dirt video from the early days of arlet uranium mines looks like footage of the 19th century Gold Rush people in shorts sifting dirt by hand it was so cheap that everyone rushed in journalist Danny forson observed that in the west you need a bookshelf full of permissions and ific Ates in ner you give someone a spade and $2 a day and you're mining uranium the French built enormous mines and made enormous profits and for the most part Nigerians put up with it because of the health care the hospitals and the infrastructure in the early days arlet was a bit of a paradise but in recent years the French miners kind of just lock themselves up in a gated community and ship almost all of the profits offshore of the big companies have always had that approach that it's Africa we're you know this is a continent that we can exploit the French are of course not just in arlet they're not just in nijer they're all over West Africa one reason is to mine resources but there is another reason too see while arlet is a city you've probably never heard of before today let me tell you about a city you've definitely heard of Tim having combed through lots of archives for stuff about timbuk 2 my understanding is that when you talk about it you have to put on a very mysterious voice so suffused it was with the aroma of wonder that even to imagine it taxs the senses or you have to clarify that it's a real place timbuk to it's one of those places we've all referred to at some stage a place at the end of the Earth but Timbuktu is a very real City facing some very real problems if the Sahara is an ocean and eyelet is an Island timbuk 2 is like a port city it's in the area known as the Sahel which literally means Shoreline it's the southern Shoreline of the Sahara timbuk 2 is 1 a 12,000 years old it was for centuries the center of scholarship in West Africa despite it being even hotter than arlot 40° all year round in 2011 it was a vibrant desert community but then Islamic extremists arrived I saw soldiers and other people fighting because I was afraid I did not ask who they were I saw people running so I ran also they were running from militants from the twareg ethnic group their famous Sahara Desert Nomads Volkswagen has a crossover fiveo SUV named after them timbuk 2 is in their traditional land so is arlot And yet when Africa was carved up by colonialists they ended up without a homeland of their own for decades they've fought rebellions to claim one in 2012 with the help of terrorist group Al-Qaeda they laid claim to half of Mali named it the independent nation of aaad and imposed strict Sharia law on its new capital timbak 2 the islamist not only banned entertainment like football television and music they AR raised every depiction of human faces declaring portraits to be unislim for 10 months they occupied the city flogging people for things that were legal before they arrived women who had never covered their heads were punished if they didn't wear a hijab for some reason even this camel's face was deemed indecent the Marley government and Military were unable to stop them so they called in the French French fighter jets flew into their former colony of Marley and made Swift work of the nation of aaad French president was given a hero's welcome in timbuk 2 as women and girls took off their hijabs in front of the world's media but it's never that simple winning is the easy bit the subsequent islamist Insurgency caused a wave of refugees hundreds of thousands of people have fled Mari into camps like this one in neighboring ner conflict creates involuntary refugees then the refugees involuntarily create conflict and the cycle continues and the French don't want those refugees showing up in France so they stayed in Mali and settled in for a long War they called in support from their NATO allies and that's the other reason the West is in West Africa other than uranium they're fighting terrorists in some ways their presence helped at the government level West African countries built stronger relationships with each other and democracy and cooperation across the region significantly improved but for the people everything just got worse across the Sahel extremism has increased millions of people have been displaced and the Sahel is now the epicenter of global terrorism those refugees France didn't want came anyway West African countries were unhappy with their governments who were unable to control the terrorists and unhappy with the French who were unable to help and that's how a wave of coups began to wash across the Sahel the first first country to be hit was Mari the military in marlei has announced that both the president and the Prime Minister have been removed from their positions in 2020 Marley's new military government took power but they decided they needed some help running the place the French wouldn't do it they were being Party Poopers and demanding the democratically elected government be reinstated so they called somebody else on the last Market day before Ramadan in the Malian town of mura people heard the sound of helicopters coming closer four Choppers landed and dozens of soldiers got out marlean soldiers and unidentified armed white men confuse the villagers the white soldiers weren't speaking French or English the identity of the white men was not clear What followed in the town of mura was horrify ying a 3-hour battle broke out between soldiers and the jihadists occupying The Village once the soldiers had taken control of the village they turned their attention to the villagers they took 15 to 20 people they lined them up about 100 met from us they made them kneel down and they shot them over the following four days the soldiers tortured and killed hundreds of men they raped dozens of women they burned every motorcycle in town and then they left I thank God I got out of it a lot of my friends were killed [Applause] there days later the marleyan government boasted about it saying it was a necessary anti-terror operation others call it a massacre but still there was no mention of the white men speaking a mysterious language but we know who they [Music] were when Marley's military government needed help getting insurgents under control they called Russia and when Russian President Vladimir Putin needs a job done but doesn't want to get his hands dirty he sends in his private Army the Vagner group the head of US military operations in Africa outlined what he understood the deal to be I've got reason to believe that they Molly and government tab for Vagner Services is $10 million a month for context that's about 4% of Marley's entire government budget I don't know where the Mary and government comes up with $10 million a month the general said that Mary would need to pay with things other than Cash Gold and other minerals uh uh gemstones those kinds of things see Marley's dirt is special too it doesn't glow like ner it Glitters Marley for centuries has been one of Africa's top sources of gold Marley is now the second biggest producer of gold in Africa and Vagner gets a big cut once Russia's Vagner group had helped out Marley the generals in other countries across the Sahel thought this all looked like a pretty good deal the wave washed out of Mali and into the rest of the Sahel the epicenter is Mali in Mali and the neighboring regions in 5 months there were successful coups in Guinea Sudan and Burkina Faso all of those governments now have deals with Vagner or the support of the Russian government a few weeks ago there was just one final Sahel country to have a democratic government and a close relationship with France and the US it was ner but then like the others ner faced a coup attempt the president's bodyguard took power and the president locked himself in a safe room and some people in ner are hoping this will be the end of the West's involvement in the country the Roar of coup supporters fills the air at this stadium in n's Capital it was all done without the help of Vagner or Russia but that didn't matter supporters waved the Russian flag and attacked the French Embassy everyone is ready to sacrifice themselves these imperialists want our demise and in Shah it's them who will suffer with Western backing 11 surrounding countries who still have close ties to France and the US have threatened to invade niiger if the president isn't reinstated Marley and Burkina Faso who overthrew their governments and aligned themselves with Russia say if that happens they'll join the fight to defend the cou leaders the nerian president has not been reinstated in fact did I mention he's possibly still in his safe room oner is waiting to see whether West African nations will follow through on warnings of military [Music] intervention if the coup leaders in ner are able to hold on to power it will complete an extraordinary transition in global politics in less than 3 years Western influence in this key part of the the world will have collapsed now the Vagner group is obviously going to be a bit different now that their top leaders have all been killed in a mysterious plane crash in Russia but if whatever Vagner becomes now can secure ner as a client Russia will have a powerful position in West Africa and access to its enormous resources France the US and their allies in the region are desperate to prevent this a war in West Africa but between us and Russian allies is the last thing anyone wants the region is holding its breath" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="la luna di miele tra Donald Trump e Elon Musk è finita il presidente statunitense l'uomo più ricco del mondo si stanno insultando pesantemente sui social sotto gli occhi di tutti certo viste le personalità in questione forse la cosa non ci dovrebbe stupire più di tanto comunque questo promance sembra essere giunto al capolinea con Trump che minaccia di stracciare i contratti governativi con le aziende di MK e quest'ultimo che dice che ci sarebbe anche il nome del presidente nei famigerati Epstein Files i documenti su Jeffrey Epstein cioè il miliardario accusato di traffici sessuali e abusi sui minori morto suicida in carcere in circostanze strane alcuni anni fa quello che stai ascoltando nel caso te lo fossi perso il podcast di Fanpage io sono Annalisa Girardi ogni giorno ti racconterò la notizia più importante del momento quella di cui tutti stanno parlando oggi è il 6 giugno e cerchiamo di capire cosa sta succedendo tra Trump e Musk e quali potrebbero essere le conseguenze di questo scontro iniziamo in passato parlo proprio degli anni scorsi non sono in realtà mancati scontri tra MK e Trump però dopo l'attentato in Pennsylvania durante l'ultima campagna elettorale Mask ha deciso di sostenere pubblicamente Trump nella sua corsa alla Casa Bianca e da lì è stato sempre amore tra i due quando Trump ha vinto Mask si è guadagnato un posto nella sua amministrazione a capo del Doge il dipartimento per l'efficienza governativa in pratica il suo ruolo era quello di portare dei risparmi alla spesa pubblica una cosa che non è chiaro se sia riuscito a fare nonostante i numerosi tagli ad esempio quelli agli aiuti umanitari all'estero in tutti questi mesi non sono mancate voci di corridoio su presunti scontri battibecchi tensioni tra i due però pubblicamente entrambi hanno sempre avuto solo parole positive l'uno per l'altro e questo è stato anche il caso quando pochissimo tempo fa Mask ha abbandonato l'amministrazione ufficialmente il motivo riguardava Tesla il fatto che dovesse concentrarsi sulla sua azienda che da quando si è lanciato in politica sta andando decisamente male poi però è emerso anche dell'altro quando negli ultimi giorni Musk ha iniziato a postare compulsivamente su X contro il presidente Trump nello specifico Mask se l'è presa con una proposta di legge che in perfetto stile Trump è stata soprannominata Big Beautiful Bill che contiene alcuni tagli alle tasse per le alte fasce di reddito e altre misure sul budget misure non così orientate al risparmio e qui torniamo al nostro punto precedente con queste misure è previsto anche un aumento del deficit una cosa che evidentemente a Mask proprio non va giù e così arriviamo lo scorso 3 giugno quando Mask su X ha scritto: &quot;Mi dispiace ma non ce la faccio più&quot; questo scandaloso disegno di legge al congresso sulla spesa pubblica è un abominio disgustoso vergogna chi l'ha votato sapete di aver sbagliato e poi da qui è partita questa spirale di posting compulsivo in cui Mask è andato anche a ripescare dei vecchi tweet di Trump risalenti anche a diversi anni fa in cui il presidente criticava le leggi che aumentavano la spesa insomma un modo per sottolinearne l'incoerenza e a questo punto Trump è intervenuto in conferenza stampa lo studio Vale ha ammesso che ci fossero diciamo così dei problemi in paradiso ha detto che lui e Masca avevano un'ottima relazione che però non sa se sarà così anche in futuro da qui in avanti ha detto di essere molto deluso che lui ha sempre aiutato moltissimo Mask e che Mask conosceva questa proposta di legge nei minimi dettagli e non aveva mai avuto problemi a riguardo i problemi sarebbero nati così all'improvviso quando Mask è uscito dall'amministrazione una cosa che però il diretto interessato ha smentito sempre a colpi di post su X ha detto di non aver mai visto questo provvedimento che tra l'altro sarebbe stato fatto passare in piena notte in modo che nemmeno tanti membri del congresso avessero abbastanza tempo per leggerlo qui vi ho precisato una cosa però perché il motivo per cui MS odia così tanto questa legge non sarebbe solo ideologico di posizionamento rispetto al budget a risparmio sulla spesa pubblica no ci sarebbero anche delle ragioni molto più personali cioè il fatto che in questo pacchetto siano previsti anche i tagli degli sgravi fiscali per chi compra le auto elettriche una misura che colpisce direttamente Tesla che nel frattempo sta già crollando in borsa e questo è importante perché lo scontro si è ben presto fatto personale come era prevedibile trump si è messo a dire che il modo migliore per risparmiare in realtà sarebbe stracciare tutti i contratti governativi con le aziende di MASK e lui ha risposto parole sue queste sganciando la bomba cioè che il nome di Trump sarebbe nei famigerati Epstein Files cioè in questi documenti di cui alcuni ancora sarebbero segretati riguardo Jeffre Epstein il miliardario morto suicida in carcere alcuni anni fa in circostanze un po' strane accusato di traffici sessuali e abusi su minori mask l'ha detto però non ha fornito alcuna prova forse il punto era solo mettere paura al presidente e deve esserci riuscito perché la battaglia social è proseguita non vi leggo tutti i post altrimenti questa puntata dovrebbe durare ore e ore dico solo che tra i punti più salienti comunque la minaccia da parte di Mask di Dismettere Dragon cioè l'unica capsula spaziale che al momento porta gli astronauti statunitensi alla stazione spaziale internazionale e poi il post in cui di fatto si mostrava favorevole all'impeachment per Trump veniamo ad oggi prima il presidente ha provato un po' a calmare le acque al giornale politico che gli chiedeva di questa disputa con l'ex amico ha detto che non sarebbe niente di grave e poi dalla Casa Bianca hanno fatto anche sapere che si sarebbero telefonati in giornata poi però Trump deve aver cambiato idea perché è tornato sull'argomento dicendo che Mask vorrebbe parlargli ma che lui in realtà non sia così interessato sicuramente però qualche tentativo di mettere a posto le cose è in corso sì perché questo battibecco rischia di non essere solo un prevedibile scontro tra ego ma di creare scompiglio sui mercati sullo scenario politico più ampio stiamo parlando di due tra gli uomini più potenti al mondo le conseguenze non sono affatto da sottovalutare trump e Mask possono farsi parecchio male a vicenda anche se devo dire non è chiaro chi ne uscirebbe meglio da una battaglia frontale proviamo a capire cosa potrebbe fare l'uno all'altro in che modo potrebbe nuocere partiamo da Trump per prima cosa Trump potrebbe fare quello che già sta cercando di fare o ha minacciato quindi togliere i sussidi e gli sgravi fiscali alle auto elettriche e poi recidere i contratti governativi con le aziende di MK pensate che le aziende NIMASCA appunto hanno stretto contratti solo l'anno scorso per 3 miliardi di dollari con le agenzie federali insomma l'impatto sarebbe importante e a risentirne sarebbe soprattutto Space X certo bisogna anche considerare che rischierebbe di essere un boomerang questa strategia per il governo statunitense visto che gran parte delle sue attività spaziali dipendono proprio da Space X e quindi rinunciarvi significherebbe fare enormi passi indietro però Trump ha anche altri assi nella manica può colpire altre aziende come appunto Tesla che già di per sé non è in splendida forma la casa bianca potrebbe togliere tutti gli aiuti alle auto elettriche una cosa che in parte come abbiamo visto già sta facendo nel suo big beautiful bill questo avrebbe un impatto pesantissimo sull'azienda però non si tratta solo delle sovvenzioni trump potrebbe anche influenzare alcune policy ad esempio i regolamenti sulle auto guida autonoma e in questo modo andrebbe a mettere i bastoni tra le ruote in senso figurato letterale si potrebbe dire a Tesla oppure ancora Trump potrebbe colpire Mask in modo ancor più personale dando ascolto a Steve Bennon che è uno dei teorici della destra populista americana e del trampismo ecco ieri Bennon ha chiesto di lanciare un'indagine formale sullo status di Musk che è nato in Sudafrica ma è cittadino naturalizzato statunitense perché è convinto che sia illegale nel paese che andrebbe deportato immediatamente e non solo bennon ha anche detto che ci vorrebbe un'indagine sul suo uso di droghe e sul suo nulla osta alla sicurezza cioè questa autorizzazione ad accedere a informazioni riservate insomma Trump è il presidente degli Stati Uniti ha nelle sue mani dei poteri con cui potrebbe fare molto male a Musk però Musk non è un cittadino qualunque è l'uomo più ricco del mondo anche lui ha dalla sua parte una grandissima dose di potere e di influenza ora non sapremo mai se sia vero come lui sostiene cioè che senza di lui Trump non avrebbe vinto le elezioni però sappiamo che sulla sua campagna elettorale Mask ha investito 250 milioni di dollari una cifra gigantesca e se questi soldi andassero di colpo a sostegno di altri politici magari degli avversari di Trump che cosa succederebbe masc ha un potere economico gigantesco che ora potrebbe mettere contro Trump finanziando altri candidati altre campagne oppure potrebbe mettersi di traverso anche con le sue aziende appunto come dicevamo prima sfilando Space X da alcuni programmi fondamentali per l'amministrazione statunitense e poi Mask ha anche un enorme potere mediatico è il proprietario di X e anche attraverso questa piattaforma potrebbe influenzare la narrativa rispetto alla politica statunitense che non è da sottovalutare e poi infine in questi mesi Mask potrebbe aver avuto accesso a informazioni delicate che ora in un modo o nell'altro potrebbe usare contro Trump ad esempio queste cose che ha dichiarato su Epstein non sappiamo se siano vere o meno però i democratici si sono affrettati a metterle sul tavolo e a chiedere all' FBI se sia vero insomma dovremmo aspettare a vedere come andrà a finire questo scontro però la cosa che possiamo dire fin da ora è che entrambi hanno il potere di fare all'altro parecchio male questo era nel caso te lo fossi perso e sarà un

          <attvalue for="7" value="3 anni di guerra Oggi è l'anniversario per dare una lettura diversa a questa giornata che è una giornata molto importante abbiamo chiesto a Michele Santoro di intervistare il professor Orsini perché il professor Orsini come dicevo prima anche a Renzi Insomma è stato sempre nell'occhio del Ciclone individuato come uno dei personaggi reprobi Insomma Putignani eccetera molto discusso ha aperto centinaia di polemiche in questi anni e quindi mi sembra che aella che l'apparente verità sia interessante quindi Michele Santoro intervista il professor intanto intanto ringrazierei bianca bellinguer che ci ha permesso di fare questa intervista devo dire che sono molto contento di vederla Qui sia pure per una notte diciamo così quella che dovrebbe essere la casa di tutti i pensieri Dopodiché ho sentito l'intervista prima di Renzi dobbiamo fare una piccola precisazione ovvero che la decisione di chiudere le centrali nucleari in in Germania fu presa in realtà da Angela Merkel che sia pure con una linea completamente diversa e era il leader del partito oltre che del governo governo che ha vinto le elezioni oggi in Germania e scholz per un periodo proprio perché si è trovato al centro della guerra in Russia perfino tra la Russia e l'Ucraina ha perfino diciamo prorogata la la chiusura di queste centrali perché era nel pieno di una crisi energetica ora va bene che qui possiamo dire Di tutto insomma probabilmente il problema delle bollette che abbiamo oggi in Italia lo potremmo risolvere con le centrali nucleari Però fra una decina d'anni Perché nel frattempo il nostro problema Non deriva dal fatto che non abbiamo le centrali nucleari Certo se le avessimo fatte 20 anni fa Magari le avremmo risolto ma deriva dal fatto che c'è stata una guerra che ha fatto impazzire i prezzi delle materie energetiche Oggi siamo diventati dipendenti in larga misura proprio dagli Stati Uniti ora Parlando di queste bazzle diciamo di cui prima Si si diceva E io partirei proprio da Trump cioè partirei da questo ciclone che è un misto se vogliamo di Real Politic cioè di di prendere in considerazione le cose come Effettivamente stanno di cinismo e anche di una certa violenza tipica dello sceriffo che adesso è in città è l'uomo che ha la pistola in mano e che può sparare che quindi dice a zelewski tutto quello che che fino adesso nessuno aveva mai detto anche in una maniera se vogliamo imbarazzante per chi lo Ascolta Qual è la sua valutazione su questo Ma io credo che la ragione politica per cui Trump insulta zelenski e anche l'Unione Europea con tale veemenza è perché Trump deve nascondere il fatto che gli Stati Uniti sono in ginocchio davanti alla Russia Questa non è la Russia che sconfigge l'Ucraina Questa è la Russia che infligge una sconfitta strategica agli Stati Uniti più in particolare al progetto degli Stati Uniti di inglobare tutta l'Europa nella nato Molte persone credono erroneamente che la decisione di aprire le porte della NATO all'ucraina sia stata presa nel 2008 al Summit di Bucarest della NATO del 2008 in realtà questa è una decisione che fu presa il 13 ottobre del 1994 da Clinton quel giorno Clinton ricevette una nota manoscritta dal suo consigliere alla sicurezza nazionale Anthony Lake e su questo foglio di carta c'era scritto Caro Presidente Clinton io ti propongo di assorbire nella nato i paesi baltici e anche l'Ucraina e Clinton che è Mancino scrisse su questo foglio di carta che ora si trova negli archivi della Clinton library eh looks Good sembra un'ottima idea e a partire dall'ottobre del 94 gli Stati Uniti Hanno mosso i fili per assorbire tutta l'Europa nella nato inclusa l'Ucraina perché Clinton aveva deciso di assorbire l'Ucraina nella nato a partire dall'ottobre del 1994 però la strategia di Clinton era quella di procedere gradualmente cioè arrivare Sì all'ucraina ma come passaggio finale di questo processo di assorbimento totale dell'Europa nella nato quindi nel 1999 è stata assorbita nella nato la Polonia la Repubblica Ceca e l'Ungheria nel 2004 c'è stato un secondo round quindi sono entrati moltissimi altri paesi nella nato tra cui l'Estonia la Lettonia la Lituania e moltissimi altri paesi dell'Europa dell'est e poi dopo siamo arrivati allo show finale e il rovesciamento del presidente filorusso nel 200 14 Ma quando in Italia è stato detto l'Ucraina ha deciso di entrare nella nato perché nel 2014 la Crimea era stata conquistata dall Russia falso semplicemente falso perché la decisione di assorbire l'Ucraina nella nato risale al 13 ottobre del 1994 qui viene un'obiezione Insomma che si fa sempre a chi ragiona nella maniera in cui sta ragionando lei ovvero cioè quella diciamo che c'è stato comunque è un paese invasore questo paese è la Russia e Putin Io vorrei dire che perlomeno per quanto mi riguarda non mi nascondo affatto le responsabilità di Putin Riguardo a questa invasione che ha dato inizio alla fase più cruenta della guerra e vorrei capire come la pensa lei A questo riguardo cioè Fermo restando che Putin è intervenuto in questo contesto mutato sul piano militare e le cose militari non possono essere considerate una bazzecola perché non sono solo una questione di libertà se tu cambi gli equilibri militari evidentemente stai sconvolgendo gli equilibri geopolitici e costringi anche quelli che secondo il tuo punto di vista sarebbero i nemici a fare delle mosse delle mosse contrari però resta la responsabilità di Putin che forse avrebbe potuto fare anche qualcosa di diverso rispetto a quell'incidente passato Cioè poteva forse agire in una maniera molto differente rispetto a come agito lei come la pensa questa guard io darò una risposta basata sui documenti storici il 7 settembre del 2023 stoltenberg all'epoca segretario generale della NATO ha tenuto un discorso davanti alla commissione affari esteri del Parlamento Europeo in cui ha detto dall'inizio alla fine che la Russia aveva fatto di tutto per trattare con la nato per scongiurare l'invasione dell'Ucraina e stoltenberg è lui che parla ha detto noi orgogliosamente abbiamo abamo rifiutato qualunque tipo di compromesso qualunque tipo di dialogo con Putin abbiamo preferito esporre l'Ucraina a rischio dell'invasione russa piuttosto che trattare con Putin perché è sempre stoltenberg che parla in quella circostanza Perché la nato non fa compromessi con nessuno non rispetta le linee rosse di nessuno e stoltenberg chiama questo atteggiamento della NATO la politica delle porte aperte Quindi quello che ci dice la documentazione emersa finora documentazione scritta quella che Io generalmente prediligo ci dice che i tentativi da parte della Russia sono stati molteplici e copiosi è stata la nato che si è sempre rifiutata di avere un dialogo diplomatico con la Russia per arginare l'avanzata della NATO al confine stesso con la Russia mi lasci aggiungere un'altra circostanza importantissima tutti in Italia fanno questa affermazione falsa secondo cui la Svezia e la Finlandia avrebbero deciso di entrare nella nato dopo l'invasione russa dell'Ucraina Ma questo è semplicemente falso perché la Finlandia e la nato Mi scusi la Finlandia e la Svezia sono diventati membri di fatto della NATO molto prima dell'in russ quando ci sono state le famose esercitazioni militari Tanto è vero che la Svezia e la Finlandia hanno partecipato a una gigantesca esercitazione militare della NATO che si chiama Trident juncture che si è svolta nell'ottobre novembre del 2018 e quindi la Svezia e la Finlandia erano già interoperabili questo è il linguaggio che utilizza la Casa Bianca cioè la Casa Bianca quando assorbe un paese nella nato ha una fase transitoria che chiama fase della interoperabilità cioè un paese deve diventare interoperabile significa che deve avere già tutta avere fatto le esercitazioni militari tutte le strumentazioni adeguate Quindi in realtà quello che noi cittadini comuni vediamo e come passaggio iniziale della storia la Finlandia entra nella nato è soltanto la fase finale di una storia che viene tenuta nascosta ai cittadini comuni affinché non possano mettere bocca nella politica internazionale in quello che fanno i governi comunque c'è C'è un punto sul quale potremmo essere d'accordo Cioè comunque c'è stata Un'invasione una violazione dei Confini di un un paese sovrano e questa è una cosa che la Russia non avrebbe dovuto fare che ha portato anche delle conseguenze molto gravi soltanto che c'è un aspetto che quando si evoca questa circostanza che è assolutamente vera e che mi trova assolutamente Concorde nel denunciarla e ci si dimentica di dire che poi chi sarebbero i difensori diciamo del diritto internazionale perché qui c'è un passaggio che mi piacere che lei illustrasse cioè noi non abbiamo delle istituzioni internazionali che sono in grado di far rispettare queste regole Quindi in realtà di fronte a queste regole noi dobbiamo decidere se reagiamo con la guerra oppure reagiamo con altri strumenti cioè cercando di ripristinare una situazione di pace di collaborazione lì dove si è creata una situazione di guerra fermo restando il diritto di quel popolo di difendersi Ma questa guerra non è stata più una guerra tra l'Ucraina e la Russia è diventata una guerra mondiale sia pure combattuta diciamo soltanto dagli ucraini E infatti fa specie che in questo momento anche se vogliamo il coraggio degli ucraini venga calpestato dalle ragioni di Stato superiori cioè dal fatto che si dice va bene siete quattro insignificanti personaggi che hanno avuto per loro Sventura qualche centinaio di migliai di morti adesso la storia va avanti perché deve andare avanti e quindi si fa quello che avremmo dovuto fare noi come Europa parlare con Putin senza diciamo disumanizzare lo come invece abbiamo fatto subito chiamandolo Hitler e quindi impedendoci di stabilire diciamo un contatto che poteva evitare poi milioni milioni di Caduti come abbiamo avuto in quella guerra è la distruzione completa di un paese vedo gener che ci sta seguendo vi sta seguendo ma abbiamo un minuto anche Maria Elena Boschi che tra poco ascolteremo abbiamo un minuto di pubblicità 60 secondi e poi torniamo a parlare con Santoro e il professor Orsini 60 [Musica] secondi in poche parole che ci dà l'autorità di ripristinare il diritto violato ce l'abbiamo questa autorità diciamo così diciamo qualunque autorità morale dell'Occidente è stata completamente distrutta dal genocidio a Gaza oggi Noi viviamo in un tempo in cui nessuno può più raccontare a se stesso la storia secondo cui la civiltà occidentale è giuridicamente superiore alla Russia alla Cina alla Corea del Nord dopo quello che noi abbiamo fatto a Gaza Questo è un lusso che nessuno più può permettersi se lei Analizza la documentazione storica vedrà che negli ultimi 30 anni Le democrazie occidentali hanno violato il diritto internazionale e i diritti umani molto più di qualunque dittatura E questo proprio emerge in maniera nitida dalla documentazione storica relativa agli ultimi 30 anni nessuno ha fatto tante guerre illegali come la nato la nato ha condotto una guerra in violazione del diritto internazionale nel 1999 contro la Serbia la guerra ha bombardato gaddafi per il suo rovesciamento in combutta con I ribelli libici nel 2011 un'altra guerra in violazione del diritto intern nazionale per non parlare appunto di quello che abbiamo fatto a Gaza di quello che noi stiamo facendo a Gaza Noi abbiamo oggi un Occidente il cui leader Trump parla di una gigantesca pulizia etnica a Gaza parla di trasferire o deportare un milione e mezzo di palestinesi Quindi questo è un tempo in cui siamo tutti smarriti perché è un tempo in cui sono morti tutti gli idoli è un tempo in cui i giovani non possono più credere a quello che dicono gli adulti secondo cui le democrazie occidentali sono una civiltà moralmente giuridicamente culturalmente Superiore rispetto alle dittature Secondo me una delle questioni più importanti che noi oggi dovremmo discutere è l'Unione Europea perché la guerra in Ucraina ha causato la morte politica dell'Unione Europea Putin ha semplicemente ucciso politicamente l'Unione europea e questo accade perché come dico sempre le guerre svolgono in politica internazionale la stessa funzione che la ricerca svolge nella scienza servono a confermare le ipotesi un'ipotesi nella scienza si definisce come una SP azione provvisoria in attesa di conferma empirica ora le guerre Che cosa sono durante le guerre le classi dirigenti fanno delle ipotesi sulla forza dei nemici quando è scoppiata questa guerra l'Unione Europea ipotizzava che la Russia fosse debolissima e che l'Europa fosse fortissima invece la guerra ha disvelato i rapporti di forza i rapporti di forza sono che la Russia è fortissima e l'Europa È debolissima i rapporti di forza disvela da questa guerra sono che la Russia può schiacciare l'Europa con un pugno i rapporti di forza sono che Mark rutte il nuovo segretario generale della NATO ha dichiarato alcune settimane fa che quello che la Russia produce dal punto di vista militare in 3 mesi la nato lo produce in un anno intero da Los Angeles ad ancara Cioè vuol dire è Mark rutte che parla che 32 paesi della NATO Stati Uniti inclusi producono infinitamente meno dal punto di vista militare della Russia secondo di dati pubblicati anche dalla CNN quindi non sto citando il Cremlino gli Stati Uniti più l'Europa in insieme riescono a produrre 1,2 milioni di munizioni per l'artiglieria pesante la Russia in un anno produce 3 milioni di munizioni per l'artiglieria pesante quindi Provi lei a immaginare quali siano i rapporti di forza dal punto di vista militare dei soli paesi europei nella NATO contro la Russia e qui veniamo al punto forse più importante di questa nostra conversazione Allora arriva il ciclone Trump Trump dice Putin non è Hitler quindi noi ci dobbiamo sedere al tavolo con con Putin La guerra è stata finanziata dagli americani dice la verità tanto che arriva a disprezzare zelewski al punto di dire proprio se se se tu ostacoli quello che sto facendo tanto per cominciare mi devi ridare tutti i soldi che io ti ho dato che sarebbero secondo lui 350 miliardi che si aggiungono ai 150 miliardi tutte armi per più che abbiamo dato all'ucraina l'80 per di quei soldi sono rimasti negli Stati Uniti Ricordiamocelo perché non sono mai arrivati in Europa di fronte a questo sia l'ONU sia l'Unione Europea Paradossalmente che pure dovrebbero svolgere un ruolo però nella pace sembrano diventati quasi un ostacolo diciamo Dicono quasi no è meglio continuare la guerra ma Comè possibile che l'Europa possa continuare la guerra cioè In che modo l'Europa potrebbe aiutare l'Ucraina a battere Putin perché poi questo è il vero obiettivo di biden cioè diciamo deporre deporre Putin Questo obiettivo è fallito chi lo porta avanti l'Europa con i suoi mezzi è possibile una cosa del genere L'Unione Europea ha investito soltanto ed esclusivamente nella Guerra la posizione ufficiale dei leader europei di draghi della stessa Giorgia miloni di Macron di schotz finché c'è stato è la sconfitta della Russia il ritiro delle truppe russe senza condizioni Quindi l'Unione Europea ha basato tutta la sua politica sulla forza Siccome non ha la forza ha perso la politica perché se tu basi tutto sulla forza ed è quello che ha fatto l'Unione Europea ricordiamo che l'Unione Europea ufficialmente ha esecrato la diplomazia Ecco se tu basi tutta la tua politica sulla forza ma poi viene fuori che non hai la forza tu non hai nemmeno la politica Quindi questo è il senso della mia afferm secondo cui la guerra in Ucraina Ha ammazzato politicamente l'Unione europea e io non credo che l'Unione Europea potrà mai rinascere dal punto di vista politico a causa di questa guerra perché l'umiliazione la mortificazione è stata talmente grande e talmente evidente In Asia in Medio Oriente in Africa che l'Unione Europea non conta nulla dal punto di vista politico dal punto di vista casse a ricostruire Gaza e a ricostruire l'Ucraina l'Europa non può rinas invece che a continuare la guerra il problema politico dell'Europa è che l'Europa facendo questa guerra ha mostrato la sua nullità Quindi adesso L'Europa è costretta a vivere sotto la minaccia permanente della Russia per quale motivo perché noi abbiamo scoperto a causa di questa guerra che l'Europa non ha deterrenza nei confronti della Russia e abbiamo anche scoperto che Trump non vuole investire in una guerra con la Russia tantomeno in Ucraina Infatti in questo momento Putin è fortissimo ed è la ragione per cui io ritengo che Putin stia facendo finta di trattare a mio giudizio Putin non vuole trattare Putin vuole in realtà una finta trattativa per la resa incondizionata dell'Ucraina Tant'è vero che 24 ore fa la Russia ha condotto un attacco record un bombardamento record contro l'Ucraina ha lanciato 237 droni contro l'ina contro l'Ucraina la cui gran parte contro dessa che è l'ultimo sbocco al mare che è rimasto all'ucraina perché la Russia ha tolto all'ucraina Quasi tutto Lo sbocco al mare perché gli ha preso chiaramente donesk ha preso zapori gli ha preso kerson rimane soltanto Odessa quello che a mio giudizio Putin farà perché io vedo molto ottimismo anche Trump pochi minuti fa Ha lanciato Un Tweet dicendo la pace scoppierà fra qualche giorno molte persone immaginano che ci sarà una trattativa di questo tipo Putin ferma le armi e si discute Putin Io non credo che farà una trattativa così Putin farà una trattativa infilando un coltello in gola a zelenski Cioè lui tratterà parlerà mentre distrugge l'Ucraina mentre massacra migliaia di soldati ucraini perché vuole una finta trattativa lui vuole tutto quello che chiedeva per non fare la guerra e il grandissimo problema dell'Ucraina e la grande tragedia dell'Europa è che Trump non ha una via d'uscita perché Trump a questo punto può fare soltanto due cose o rientra nella guerra trasformandosi in un biden 2 e noi Ricordiamoci che Trump non fa altro che insultare biden oppure oppure deve cedere a tutte le rieste di Putin Allora diciamo che qui si apre un secondo capitolo diciamo della nostra intervista che faremo in un'altra occasione perché io non è che sono così d'accordo su questa fine dell'Europa e mi piacerebbe poter approfondire proprio questo argomento perché secondo me invece questo è il momento nel quale può rinascere un sogno europeo di pace Comunque la ringrazio per essere stata qui è stato un piacere E ridiamo la linea al telegiornale vedevo" />

fa serve si è disposta a fare qualsiasi sacrificio per un risultato tutto ciò che serve per la collettività dobbiamo farlo i suoi figli e sua moglie come l'hanno presa Eh quando erano bambini quando erano ragazzi non non non capivano ora negli ultimi anni ora sono tutti e due medici eh hanno capito capiscono perfettamente che se mancavo di casa Era perché ero in giro per il mondo che cos'è oggi l'androne è è l'unica mafia presente in tutti i continenti e l'unica mafia che è in grado di andare una foresta Amazzonica e comprare 1 kg di cocaina con un principio attivo del 98-99 per a €1000 Mentre le altre mafie lo comprano a 2000 e €2500 questo dato è importante non per un fatto economico ma per far capire il livello di credibilità che il Brand end drangheta ha nei confronti delle altre mafie soprattutto sudamericane soprattutto Cè Io mi presento come end drangheta mi fanno lo sconto subito è un pass partù Cioè iotto addirittura se all'androna eh 2000 kg di cocaina e l'r va col verbale di sequestro della droga e i cartelli colombiani gli danno altri 2000 kg senza pagar E perché questa credibilità e perché [Musica] l'androni lascia per rispetto al numero degli indang isti rispetto alle altre mafie durante il percorso durante il viaggio lascia per strada pochi collaboratori di giustizia Senta lei da procuratore di Napoli adesso deve occuparsi di camorra Ma è vero che l'and ranet è molto più potente della camorra Sicuramente è più ricca sono delle mafie ci sono tante camorre c'è una camorra che somiglia anche all'androna settimana scorsa la procura di Napoli ha sequestrato 1. 800.000 di Bitcoin che il giudice di Napoli è riuscito a trasformare in euro e già questi soldi sono nel fug nel fondo Unico della Giustizia Senta ma è vero che la Camorra compra la cocaina dall' andrangheta Ma no è soprattutto cosa nostra che compra da 25 anni Cosa Nostra palermitana Cosa Nostra catanese compra la cocaina dell'androna camorra Ma la Camorra la compra soprattutto in Spagna Dove ci sono colonie di colombiani che hanno depositi anche 10.000 kg di cocaina e uccide ancora o si limita a fare soldi Ormai son ricchi signori bisog non c'è bisogno di uccidere ormai le mafie ormai è più facile morire in casa che non per mano delle mafie le mafie non uccidono più perché oggi è più facile se c'è bisogno di penetrare la pubblica amministrazione la pubblica amministrazione si fa corrompere facilmente oggi non ha bisogno più di uccidere Senta ma è vero che il giro affari dellanno scorso solo rag è stato una ventina di miliardi una roba simile m Sì ma supera supera una finanziaria sostanzialmente si parla anche di 50 miliardi di euro solo droga no tutto il business dell' andrangheta supera i 50 miliardi di euro la cocaina è l'affare in assoluto più redditizio Eh perché ancora c'è molta richiesta in Europa e soprattutto nel mondo occidentale e l'r porta in Europa circa l' 80% della cocaina senta Lei va nelle scuole a dire che fare il mafioso non conviene che significa Sì perché io non vado a parlare ai ragazzi oggi in termini di morale o di etica si è perdenti oggi ai ragazzi che sono stati educati nel corso degli ultimi decenni dalle multinazionali dal consumismo in una società in cui oggi si conta in base a ciò che si ha e non in base a ciò che si è la cultura non è più un valore allora per essere ascoltati ai ragazzi Bisogna parlare di soldi bisogna parlare Quanto guadagna un corriere di cocaina Quanto guadagna un panettiere un idraulico solo con questi discorsi vi ascoltano Altrimenti se uno si mette a fare discorsi filosofici o di o di morale o di alta morale dopo 3 minuti giocano col te E allora perché non conviene ai giovani non conviene perché portare cocaina dalla Calabria A Roma si guadagna €1500 per

Citing dozens of experts, human rights organizations and judicial decisions, it concludes that Israel’s treatment of Palestinians “meets the legal threshold of apartheid.” Researchers found that Israel imposes “policies that are designed to ensure the perpetual racial subordination of the Palestinian people,” says Sandra Babcock, a clinical professor at Cornell Law School who helped author the report.&#10;&#10;Democracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on over 1,500 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

Amy Goodman with Nurmine Sh today Palestinians marked the 77th anniversary of the Nakba which means catastrophe in Arabic the mass expulsion of Palestinians in 1948 when Israel was created many Palestinians say they face a second Nakba today in both Gaza and in the occupied West Bank where Palestinians marched in Ramla to commemorate Nakba Day [Music] despite all of the circumstances we are maintaining our land and rooted here our right of return will never be forgotten and Palestine will always be Palestine this comes as Democratic Congress member Rashid Talib of Michigan the only Palestinian-American member of Congress has introduced a resolution to commemorate Nakba Day with support from a growing number of co-sponsors including Congress members Andre Carson Summer Lee Alexandria Casiocortez Ilhan Omar Ayanna Presley Dileia Ramirez Latifah Simon and Bonnie Watson Coleman this is Congress member Talib hello it's Congresswoman Rashidita Talib and this Thursday May 15th marks the 77th year of government of Israel's ongoing neba against the Palestinian people we all know that in 1948 the government of Israel destroyed hundreds of Palestinian villages towns and cities and ethnically cleansed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians for more we turn to a major new report released today by US academics that analyzes Israel's actions in Gaza under the legal framework of the crime of apartate citing dozens of experts human rights organizations and judicial decisions it concludes &quot;Israel's treatment of Palestinians quote includes mass killing arbitrary detention torture and the imposition of a legal regime that provides far less due process than that provided to Israelis living in the same territory meets the legal threshold of apartate,&quot; unquote we're joined now by one of the report's principal authors Sandra Babcock director of the International Human Rights Clinic at Cornell Law School where she is clinical professor and is joining us from now welcome back to Democracy Now Professor Babcock if you can talk about the significance of today the day you're releasing this report and your major findings thank you Amy it's so nice to be back on the show uh we are releasing this report that concludes that Israel has committed and is committing the crime of apartheid which is a crime against humanity on Nakba day because Palestinians are now living through the most brutal phase of the decadesl long occupation of their territory that the International Court of Justice has recognized is an illegal occupation we are our report confirms that there is now a broad international consensus that Israel is committing the crime of apartheid we're not the first people to say this uh but we are the first uh group of academics to analyze over 25 reports and judicial opinions against the backdrop of what is now happening in Gaza and our conclusions are that Israel is not only isolating Palestinians into segregated enclaves in the West Bank that it is subjecting them to a different legal regime than their Jewish settler neighbors uh that it is not only subjecting them to arbitrary detention torture and killings uh but it is doing this against a backdrop of policies that are designed to ensure the perpetual racial subordination of the Palestinian people well in uh Professor Becock in uh last year in 2024 you co-authored a report which found that Israel's actions meet the international definition of genocide so if you could elaborate on the links that you see between uh Israel's complicity in genocide and the fact that you found uh that it is an apartheid state uh you know I think there are important links between the two crimes these are both crimes uh they are both crimes that are recognized under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court uh and both what they have in common is a treatment of a group that is motivated in part by racism uh in the International Court of Justice has found that Palestinians are a distinct national ethnic or racial group that is um the sub that is appropriately the subject of the the crime of genocide and what we found is that Israeli leaders have for decades now and this is leaders at the top echelons the prime minister the former defense minister have made comments about Palestinians that uh evoke age-old racist tropes comparing Palestinians to animals dehumanizing them in a way that is very familiar to your previous guests who were speaking about apartheid in South Africa what I was really struck by in listening to the South Africans that you just had on the show is when they described the features of apartheid South Africa if you took out the word South Africa and you replaced it with Israel that would perfectly describe the policies and laws that Israel has in place today we don't often think of them as apartheid because our thinking of apartheid is rooted in our perceptions of how white South Africans treated black South Africans but in fact what is happening in in Israel today is reflective of exactly that same treatment that we saw in South Africa i wanted to ask you Professor Babcock about the significance of you along with dozens of other uh senior professors human rights lawyers uh taking part in this report you're speaking to us from Cornell University in Ithaca New York um talk about that as protests continue across the country uh students who participated in encampments um are arrested or put in ICE jails some judges have ordered those people released you know Amy it is a very tough time um to be issuing a report that is critical of Israel it has never been easy to criticize Israel but this is what we do we are human rights defenders we are human rights lawyers we are human rights professors and if we can't call out genocide and apartheid when we see it we can't call ourselves human rights defenders the there is a double standard when it comes to Israel when we criticize Israel however it is really important to recognize we are criticizing a state we are criticizing a government we are not criticizing its people this is what we do we call out human rights abuses and government repression where we see it and those of us who have authored this report have been involved in human rights work in every single continent um and we do not make an exception when it comes to Israel what universities have done um is instead of protect in instead of protecting students faculty and staff who are standing up and taking a very principled stance and a risky stance to protest Israel's policies of genocide and apartheid they are penalizing those students they are subjecting them to disciplinary sanctions for peaceful protests they are criminalizing them and jeopardizing their futures when under international human rights law which uh protects the right of people who are protesting against human rights violations anywhere in the world to their rights to freedom of opinion freedom of expression freedom of assembly instead of doing that the university is criminalizing them instead of um invest and I'm talking about universities in general mind you i am not speaking on behalf of Cornell University i'm speaking in my capacity as a professor who has witnessed the criminalization and disciplinary sanctions that are being imposed on students across the country and that is wrong and it needs to stop students are doing the right thing they are standing in the line of fire they are standing up for people whose rights are being subjected to the most horrific repression who are being slaughtered every day who are being starved um th this is what we should all be doing we cannot silence ourselves and we cannot silence we especially cannot silence ourselves when people are trying to censor what we say well we want to thank you so much Sandra Babcock for being with us clinical professor at Cornell Law School director of the International Human Rights Clinic co-author of the newly released report A Partaid in Israel an analysis of Israel's laws and policies and the responsibilities of US academic and other institutions she co-wrote a new op-ed in the Guardian today

He joins Democracy Now! to discuss his work, the necessity of advocating for Palestinian rights, and the violence of Israeli occupation. Abu Toha, who evacuated Gaza in late 2023 after being arrested, beaten and detained by the Israeli military, now resides in Syracuse, New York. He says that, while grateful for the platform granted by the Pulitzer, he cannot celebrate the achievement while &quot;my sisters, my brothers and my parents in Gaza are starving.&quot; Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip has trapped millions of Palestinians in famine conditions, unable to evacuate and under threat of daily bombings and Israeli troop movements. &quot;The only celebration for me is when there is an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza [and] the West Bank, and when justice and peace are served in Palestine,&quot; says Abu Toha.&#10;&#10;Democracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on over 1,500 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

Amy Goodman with Juan Gonzalez israeli strikes on Gaza have killed at least 11 Palestinians so far today with deadly attacks reported in Kanunis in Bethlia in Gaza City the attacks follow Israeli attacks that killed 54 Palestinians Monday health officials in Gaza say at least 57 Palestinians have already starved to death the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees in reported some 66,000 children in Gaza are suffering severe malnutrition due to Israel's total blockade of food and aid now in its ninth week some Palestinians have resorted to eating turtle meat grass rotten or expired food one displaced grandmother Um Muhammad Al Talka said it took her five hours of standing in a line at a community kitchen in Gaza's Nusadat district to get one meal to feed her hungry children and grandchildren i've been coming here since 8:00 a.m to the Takaya soup kitchen for food to alleviate our hunger and be able to stand up we are suffering from famine real famine i have not eaten anything since this morning i cannot speak because of hunger on Monday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outlined plans for the stepped up offensive on Gaza saying the Palestinian population quote will be moved for its own protection he says the whole population must move south netanyahu did not say how much of Gaza Israel plans to seize reuters reports it could include all of Gaza's territory we're joined now by the acclaimed Palestinian poet Masab Abu Toha on Monday he won a Pulitzer Prize for commentary for his writings in the New Yorker magazine he was praised for his quote essays on the physical and emotional carnage in Gaza that combined deep reporting with the intimacy of memoir to convey the Palestinian experience of more than a year and a half of war with Israel.&quot; At least 31 of MSab's family members have been killed by Israel in Gaza his books include things you may find hidden in my ear poems from Gaza and Forest of Noise first Mosab it's terrible to say in light of what's happening in Gaza to start off by saying congratulations but wow you just won the Pulitzer Prize talk about what this means to you and the statement you put out um as you learned of this huge honor uh first of all I would like to thank you Amy u appreciate your work appreciate Democracy Now thank you so much for your voice um uh this honor has u brought to me tears and joy uh I mean joy because uh this is um um I mean this is a big prize this is something that every every writer um I mean writer and and artist and journalist it dreams of uh winning uh but this is also very sad for me because the pieces for which I I won the prize the the four pieces I mean I wrote about seven or eight pieces for the New Yorker uh this prize was uh awarded to uh four of my pieces uh the four pieces are one for uh one about an article that I wrote about starvation in Gaza the other one was about the difficulty of traveling as a Palestinian the third one was about uh the loss of the refugee camp and the fourth uh was about um the Gaza we leave behind uh and unfortunately as I'm you know looking at the titles of these essays the situation in Gaza is worsening i mean not day after day but minute after minute and people are are dying I mean children are dying of hunger uh people are dying for lack of uh not only food but also medicine uh so this this this prize means a lot to me but it also reminds me that that there's a lot uh to work on not only um uh by writing but also uh encouraging uh people who have the power to take action to stop all of this and Mosab uh I wanted to ask you given the fact of the continuing attacks of the Israelis in Gaza and the complete failure of the world community to be able to do anything to stop Israel uh your sense of uh what you're seeing in terms of the American public uh since you've been in the United States in terms of its response uh to the war i think the American public uh and also people around the world are eager uh to learn uh they I mean the unfortunately the mainstream media is not doing enough uh Israel has been uh preventing uh people from visiting Gaza not only after October 7th but even before but especially after October 7th um uh journalists medics u a few a very very few little number of of of uh doctors have been allowed to go to Gaza i think the American people need to uh uh need to hear more and more voices i mean my voice is I mean is one is only one voice that uh that that is necessary to hear but there are so many other voices that that are there still in Gaza journalists and writers and artists and and and and um and university professors who have so many stories to tell my story is one story my story is other people's stories but we we need to hear more and more people and I think that the American public uh is truly eager and not only eager but I mean they they feel the necessity they they feel the the duty uh to hear and learn uh about more and more stories in Gaza and I'm happy that my power pieces that won these awards are uh stories that I wrote about myself about my people in Gaza about the refugee camp where I was born my family members who were killed my my my students my my my great aunt whose body is still under until today since last October um so there are so many other stories uh that are to be heard and I hope that the American magazines and newspapers and the American channels news channels would open up their spaces to let these writers and people in Gaza share their stories because this is what we should be doing at least i mean I mean killing people in Gaza is one crime but also not not giving them the space to talk about their pain and also demands because all the time we hear you know politicians yesterday we hear President Trump saying that I we want to we want to help the people of Gaza we want to we they have to move we will feed them but I mean come on i mean we are not people who need to be fed we are not hungry because we don't have food we are hungry because we are under occupation we are under siege we are we are under genocide this is not this is not what people in Gaza want it's not that they want only to eat they want freedom this is what they want masab Abu Tawha I want to turn to you speaking at the Jewish Voice for Peace National Meeting this weekend you read If I Must Die by the great Palestinian poet killed in Rafa Rafat Alar if I must die by Al if I must die you must live to tell my story to sell my things to buy a piece of cloth and some strings make it white with a long tail so that a child somewhere in Gaza while looking heaven in the eye awaiting his dad who left in a blaze and bid no one farewell not even his to his flesh not even to himself see the kite my kite you made flying up above and thinks for a moment an angel is there bringing back love if I must die let it bring hope let it be a tail if I must die mosab Abu Toha you referenced Rafat uh in winning uh the Pulitzer Prize yesterday talk about your relationship with him who he was and what he means for the people of Palestine yeah I talked a lot about Rifhat i wrote about him uh Rifat was a university professor uh who was murdered and this is not mentioned a lot he was not only murdered alone he was murdered along with his with two of his siblings and four nephews uh Rifat died while he was holding a pen in his hand while he was wearing his glasses uh reading poetry and writing more poems to us um asking us to continue his message which is the tale of every people in who are oppressed by occupation who are under siege who are dying in a genocide if I must die let it bring hope let it be a tale if he must die we need to tell Rafad's tale we need to I mean as I said before if I must die this is a crime to be to for someone to die to be killed by occupation and we have to remember here that 70% of the population in Gaza are refugees so these refugees they have stories it's not that they were killed by an occupation no they were killed as they have dreamed all their lives to return to their homeland so died with his with two of his siblings and four nephews and in the past he lost another brother in 2014 so Rifatwas was not only a writer he was not only a university professor but he was also a mentor for so many young writers he introduced me to the we are not numbers project in 2014 after the Israeli 51-day attacks on Gaza which claimed the lives of three close friends of mine about whom I wrote uh in my poetry and in my essays so Rifat was was was more than I mean it is a huge loss and this is why we have to honor his memory by continuing to tell the tales not only and when Rifhat said let it be a tale it's not only Rifhat's tale because Rifhat's tale my tale my grandparents tail are the tales of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and our tales are not only Palestinian tales it is a human tale of loss after loss loss after loss while the world is watching us so we refuse to die just like that we will we will fight to live not only to live but also to tell the stories of those who died before us who were who were who were meant to die in blindness to die in darkness no we will live we will fight we will continue to speak up because this loss the loss of Rifhat and so many hundreds of my friends and family members should not uh be a waste they we should tell the stories of these people because we don't want to lose more people when we write a poem it's not because we feel we feel pain for those who we lost but we are trying to stir people into action when they feel what we are feeling and uh Moab you you have been you have been telling the stories of what has been going on there through your poetry and writing but even in the United States it has not been easy there right-wing groups have called for deporting you uh and uh and President Trump is cracking down on non-citizens critical of Israel talk about the problems you've had even being able to speak at many universities um I mean I mean this is this is the tragedy of being a Palestinian or being a pro Palestinian human rights you are not safe living in Palestine for example in my case in Gaza I was wounded at the age of 16 in an airirst strike that killed seven people i lost three close friends of mine in 2014 i was abducted by the Israeli forces in November 2023 i lost my house which is the family my family house in in October 2023 two of my brothersin-laws in brothersin-law were abducted by the forces and we don't know anything about them so and I lost so many members of my family as I said and I survived by the way air strikes I mean air strikes that were just two houses away from me in Jabalia camp or in Betah so it is I mean to live in Gaza is is very dangerous so I didn't feel safe living in Gaza and now when I'm traveling outside of Gaza not only in the United States I don't feel safe because I mean we are not usually welcome anywhere it's not only in the United States but it's it's most of the world and now when when when we come to the United States you know to raise our families and to to share the stories of people who we lost i mean I'm not talking about I'm not talking about another people so this is this is what is different about me as Muslim i'm not talking about other people i'm talking about myself talking about my siblings about my parents about my grandparents i'm talking about the graves of my great my my grandparents who I will never find because Israel destroyed cemeteries i will not take my grandchildren and show them the kindergarten where I which I attended not my my university where where from where I graduated in Gaza i mean to come here and speak about these things is not even welcome so what should what should I do as Palestinian i mean I don't know no I mean uh we we I mean this word doesn't make sense in Gaza you will be you will get killed wounded or abducted when you go out and try to speak about these things you are uh being chased by these hate groups these extremist groups so what what is what do they want to from me and when they talk about deportation I mean I mean someone would deport someone to to to their homeland but my homeland is occupied i wish I could go back to Gaza but before you deport me back to Gaza I need to be in Gaza where Palestine is free i can't go back to a country that is not only under occupation but that is undergoing genocide so I would I would I would love to go back to Gaza i don't I mean it is it is not my my my biggest dream to live in United States my biggest dream is to live in my free homeland in Palestine to to be able to visit uh the the original home city and live in the original home city of my grandparents Yafa which is also the name of my uh 80-year-old daughter this is this is this is why where I would like to be deported i would like to go back and live in a free uh Palestine masab I want to thank you so much for taking this time to talk with us i'm so sorry also that you had to cancel your tour all over the country you apologized to people at all the universities where you were going to be speaking saying how much you looked forward to sharing a Forest of Noise with them i want to congratulate you on your son's birthday this weekend as you were at Jewish Voice for Peace uh speaking and reading your poetry and also ask if it's Syracuse University where you are now if they'll be holding a big celebration you are now a Pulitzer Prize winner as was announced yesterday yeah I mean uh yes I'm looking forward to celebrate but as but but as you understand it is not easy for me to celebrate anything i mean um I mean during the some some of the events people would be dancing on music I mean I I I do not feel fine you know celebrating something i am the only celebration is for me is when there is a an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and also in the West Bank and when justice and peace are served in Palestine this is the only this is the only reason for me to celebrate but I can't celebrate while I'm while I know that my sisters my my brothers and my parents in Gaza are starving you know I'm sending them this this good news telling them that this is my hope that my voice would reach more and more people who have the power to intervene and stop this suffering i can't just dance or eat you know cake or or just you know I mean it is it is not normal for me but what is what is what is good about this is that this recognition I hope would prove uh to be a step towards great under a greater understanding and would uh stir people in power to take action to put an end because I don't want to continue writing essays and poems about these these the these painful

for 972 magazine yal is also the co-director of the film no other land a document produced by a Palestinian Israeli Collective that looks at Israel's Mass expulsion of Palestinians living in musafer yata in the occupied West Bank this is the trailer [Music] you think they'll come to our home is the Army down there thousand Palestinians face one of the single biggest expulsion decisions since the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories began bosel come here come fast this is a story about power my name is BAS I grew up in a small community called mfata I started to film when we started to end they have bulldozers I'm filming [Music] you I need air oh my God don't worry I don't want them to take our home you're Basel yes you're Palestinian no I'm Jewish he's a journalist you're Isel seriously we have to raise our voices not being silent as if as if no human beings live here what the Army is here this is what's happening in my village now soldiers are everywhere who do you think you're filming you son of a [Laughter] it will be so nice with stability one day then you'll come visit me not always me visiting you right maybe what do you think if you were in my place what would you do the trailer for no other land codirector Ed by Israeli yal Abraham and Palestinian filmmaker basil Adra the film won the prize for best documentary at the Berlin Film Festival the Berlin alley in Germany this is a part of yuval's acceptance speech in two days we will go back to a land where we are not equal I living under a civilian law and Basel is under military law we live 30 minutes from one another but I have voting rights and Basel is not having voting rights I'm free to move where I want in this land Basel is like millions of Palestinians locked in the occupied West Bank this situation of apartheid between us this inequality it has to end you all Abraham received death threats for those comments I asked him about the film winning the top prize at the Berlin allei and what happened afterwards so you know we got this award for the film and we were very very happy me and Basel after we've been filming me and Basel and Rachel and hamdan they're also directors and you know for for for many years um and it was like a moment of of recognition and we felt that we got the audience award and and and the audiences were very moved by it and and the next day I I I I wanted to to to fly back back home and um I took a connection flight in in Greece and and then I opened my phone in Greece and I see that I'm receiving like dozens of death threats um for the speech and I saw that German politicians including the mayor of Berlin were were dubbing it as like anti anti-Semitism and and generally dis speeches um yeah and and this I decided to stay in Athens to to be because I was I was hesitant to go back and the next day like a group of people came to my my parents' house and threatened them my mother was really scared from it and she had to leave she went to sleep with my sister in Jerusalem and was very very scary um and I I felt many things but like one of the things that I felt outrage by was that you have you know German politicians who are not Jewish who you know label me as an anti-semite for for what for for for calling for a ceasefire for calling for equality between Israelis and Palestinians for for using the word apartheid which which should be common sense to describe these you know parallel systems of of inequality and and and and I felt I was thinking of my grandparents you know my grandmother she was born in in a concentration camp in Libya called called Jad her father was was murdered by by by Italy who were working the fascist Italy were working with the Nazis most of my grandfather's family in Romania were murdered by by Germans and like who who are you to to label me as an anti-semite and and I feel that you know this term is very dangerous because you know on the one hand it's very very clearly being weaponized to silence legitimate criticism of the state of Israel of Israel's policies and that's that's a big danger on the other hand for me as Israeli as a Jewish person you know if if you are labeling everything as anti-Semitism you're emptying it out of meaning and I think especially now when there is a rise in anti-Semitism and and we are seeing more and more cases of anti-Semitism you know happening everywhere on the extreme right on left like we're seeing it for me is even worse that that that that Germany is is is emptying that term out of meaning like that that and and I think that people you know like it's completely legitimate to to label Israel as apartheid it's completely legitimate to to call for a ceasefire and and and it was absurd and it was I hope things have changed since I don't think they have but you know your co-director Palestinian basil Adra called for the stopping of arming of Israel good evening everybody we're glad to be here and grateful it's our first movie since many years my community my family has been filming our community being erased by this brutal occupation I'm here celebrating the award but also very hard for me to celebrate when there are tens of thousands of my people being slaughtered and massacred by Israel in Gaza mfata my community is being also raised by Israeli bulldozers I ask one thing for Germany as I am in Berlin here to respect the calls and stop sending weapons to Israel youal Abraham that's your co-director you're an Israeli Palestinian team Basel Adra accepting the award for best International documentary can you talk more about what he said yes Basel Basel called for Germany to respect un resolutions and and to stop the the arming of of Israel and and and and and he spoke about you know the the tens of thousands of Palestinians um in Gaza who were killed and and and called for a ceasefire and and and and just you know I want to say one last thing maybe when when I got back home to Jerusalem I I remembered you know when we were working on the film me and Basel like Basel told me that when he was a young boy like he would always sleep with his shoes on because he knew that the Army can you know knock down the door at any time and arrest him and take his family and and and and he was so used to it as a child that he would have shoes on all the time so he would be ready to to to to run if if soldiers enter the village and when we were sleeping in masafat working on the film we would always have shoes on because the Army entered and and you know took the computer from the house and and and confiscated equipment and when my house in Jerusalem after all of these things happening I was thinking you know I don't have to sleep with shoes on there is no chance that a foreign military is going to enter to my home and arrest me and take me and and and and and I think again I felt this aparti reality this completely inequal reality when we are under two systems of law where only one people in this land have sovereignity and the other people do not and I think going forward again like this has to change we cannot continue to live here like this if if there is no full political equality and and and really full freedom to everybody who lives in this land then then there can be there can be no future here and and and and I and we are going to continue to fight to to change this and I hope people watch our film no other land when it comes out in the states and the showing of your film in the occupied West Bank area of Maser yata the subject of your award-winning documentary no other land what was it like yeah so you know people came and these are people who are living it's a community of villages masafat and and every week you know Israeli bulldozers come they pick a house of a family and they destroy it and settlers constantly attack this community like there's a lot of violence that is being placed on by the states to Evac to to to kick out to forcibly transfer this community to erase it from the map and I was worried you know these people are coming to see you know quite traumatic events that that are happening to to them and and and and what will they think and and and and in the end it was I think it was a very inspiring inspiring in night like like this this community especially in masafat is so inspirational because you know these are people that really Against All Odds Against really colonial policies and oppression and violence the they are staying on their lands and and and like living you know living their lives and raising families and and and then going to see the film and and and you know and looking at the old arai footage that we have and you know laughing at how they were children like 20 years ago and and look I don't know it was a very inspirational night and we you know there was a lot a big Community there were Israeli activist and international activist and Palestinian activist and and a lot of people who are united in you know being completely against this this occupation and this force transfer and and and yeah we're going to have to continue to to fight to to make a change" />

health ministry confirms Israel's killed at least 53,300 Palestinians in Gaza since October 2023 The death toll does not account for thousands of people believed dead including those trapped under the rubble nor those killed by the indirect effects of Israel's assault on Gaza In fact the number could be more than two times three times higher For more we're joined in Montreal by Muen Rabani Middle East analyst co-editor of Jud Jalia and a non-resident fellow at the Center for Conflict and Humanitarian Studies He's a contributor to the book Deluge Gaza and Israel from crisis to cataclysm Welcome back to Democracy Now Men Thanks so much for being with us um if you can respond to the situation right now the escalation of the attacks on Gaza Well the situation as anyone who's following the news can see is thoroughly apocalyptic Um there is not only an unprecedented siege but also an unprecedented intensification of Israel's genocidal military campaign in the Gaza Strip And judging um by the statements of Israel's most senior leaders it aims towards the complete occupation of the Gaza Strip and the destruction of everything that remains standing in the Gaza Strip and ultimately the mass for forcible expulsion of its entire population And the past few days have have been um particularly cataclysmic At the same time uh negotiations about a potential new agreement are ongoing and um this will be decided neither by Israel uh nor by the Palestinians but by the United States To the extent that Israel continues with this assault it means that it has a US green light for doing so uh to the extent that the situation changes that means that Israel has been instructed by Washington to change course Talk about Israel partially lifting the blockade What exactly does this mean after 11 months of a full blockade on medicine and aid 11 weeks at this stage it doesn't appear to mean very much according to reports um available this morning Um Israel is preparing to permit something on the order of 50 trucks to enter the Gaza Strip And we're talking about a population of between 1 and a half and 2 million people who have been deprived of any um uh goods entering from outside the territory since the very beginning of March So this is clearly um a drop in the bucket Uh I think the more important question is whether this is the beginning of a lifting of the siege under US and international pressure and just as importantly whether Israel and the US are going to move ahead with this hairbrain scheme that has already been denounced by the international aid community of setting up a aid mechanism whose purpose is to force the relocation of the Gaza Strip population to specified locations where they can um uh access limited humanitarian supplies under the watchful eye of US mercenaries acting on behalf of the Israeli military government Can you talk about the US plan that's been reported to move Palestinians to Libya yes it's interesting that this report has now been formally denied um by the US embassy in in Libya um uh I think as a precautionary measure given what happened to that embassy about a decade ago But we do know that um President Trump has repeatedly uh proposed an initiative whereby the entire Palestinian population of the Gaza Strip would be forcibly relocated outside the Gaza Strip Um it would be taken over and rebuilt presumably by US real estate developers um acting in coordination with Israel And there have been persistent reports that the US and Israel have been approaching a variety of countries both within the region and beyond to accept these uh forcibly displaced uh Palestinians And in respect of Libya um the reports are that the US has offered Libya to unfreeze billions of dollars in um Libyan funds that have been uh frozen in international financial institutions since the reign of uh Muhammad Gaddafi who was overthrown and killed over a decade ago If and only if Libya accepts um uh 1 million Palestinians on its territory this would increase the Libyan population by over 10% And it's effectively bri bribing Libya with its own money to participate in this war crime and crime against humanity But it seems to me exceptionally unlikely that Libya will even um seriously consider this proposal for one moment given um the impact it would have on on Libya's uh domestic uh politics which is very strongly pro Palestinian And I think the real issue here is not the extent to which this um initiative can actually be implemented but rather the legitimization it gives to Israel's determination repeatedly expressed to expel the Palestinian population of the Gaza Strip and further down the line from the West Bank as well On Friday President Trump actually said quote &quot;A lot of people are starving in Gaza under the Israeli blockade.&quot; He said the US wanted to help reduce the suffering What can the US do what can the world do you have up to a 100,000 people in the Netherlands protesting outside the H You have a number of Italian parliament members going to the Egyptian side of the Rafa border uh demanding that uh um the world stop arming Israel Can you talk about what the solutions are at this point well you had as you mentioned the 100,000 approximately protesters in the Netherlands um with reports of something in the range of half a million in London um uh the day before And there is um growing opposition and and disgust with Israel's engineered starvation policy and absolutely genocidal military campaign in the Gaza Strip And a number of European governments are now beginning to speak more loudly as well calling for example for a reconsideration of Israel's preferential trade privileges with the European Union But at this stage the decision really will be made not in London or Brussels or Berlin but in Washington because of the extraordinary leverage that the United States exercises over Israel And it will take no more than a phone call from Washington to the Israeli government to effect a complete reversal in Israeli policy within the space of a day Um that's really the only reason we're now seeing this limited very limited resumption of aid And with respect to the statements by um uh President Trump I think we also need to bear in mind we're dealing here with a quite erratic leader who can contradict himself in the space of a day or even an hour So what we really need to focus is not so much on what he says but what the United States does There are ongoing um negotiations for a new agreement and it's difficult to tell exactly what's happening there Of course they're being held um behind uh closed doors but we still need to find out the extent to which Washington is exercising genuine pressure if any on Israel to force it to um accept an agreement that will um uh res that will lift the siege lead to an exchange of captives and ultimately put an end to this genocidal war Uh let me ask you finally Drop Site News is reporting a senior Hamas official received assurances from President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff the US would force Israel to lift the Gaza blockade within two days after releasing the USIsraeli citizen um Edan Alexander Basam Naim a member of Hamas's political bureau said the Trump administration reneged on its promise saying they didn't violate the deal they threw it in the trash your response to the report and if do you think that's why they lifted Israel lifted it partially well these these reports may well form part of the background of today's developments that we've uh been discussing but at the time it was um you know Hamas said it was uh releasing this um Israeli soldier who's also a US uh citizen as a goodwill gesture on the eve of uh Trump's uh visit to the Middle East And the Americans also said they had offered nothing in exchange So um quite clear clearly there were no formal undertakings by the United States But I think it's entirely reasonable to suppose that there were informal assurances given and those once again ended up uh not not being worth um uh the paper they were or in this case were not written on Um but at the same time they could form part of the background of the developments that we're seeing now which is that negotiations seem to have been intensified I think it's very premature to conclude that they will succeed or result in a meaningful agreement but there's quite clearly more going on behind the scenes um than than we are directly aware of Muin Rabani I want to thank you for being with us Middle East analyst co-editor of Jadalia and

Amy Goodman with Narin Sheh we turn now to Gaza where more evidence is coming to light about how Israel has systematically used Palestinians as human shields in violation of both international and Israeli law that's the conclusion of a new investigation by the Associated Press based on interviews with Israeli soldiers and with Palestinians who said they were used as human shields to inspect buildings tunnels and other sites in Gaza and the occupied West Bank the AP reports the Israeli soldiers said the practice was used in part to spare combat dogs from injury or death one Israeli sergeant admitted to using Palestinians as young as 16 years old as human shields in February the news outlet 972 revealed how Israel used an 80-year-old man as a human shield troops tied an explosive cord around his neck then forced him to search abandoned buildings after he finished the mission he was ordered to flee but then another Israeli unit fatally shot him and his wife haratz and the Red Cross have also documented Israel's use of human shields the AP report is based in part on testimonies collected by Breaking the Silence a group made up of former Israeli soldiers opposed to the Israeli occupation the group's also released photos of Palestinians being used as human shields in Gaza we're joined now by the group's executive director Nadav Vimman he's a former Israeli soldier joining us from Tel Aviv thanks so much for being with us tell us what information you collected the Israeli soldiers you talked to and how exactly they are using Palestinians as human shields so Amy I've got to say that from the beginning of this war we got testimonies from soldiers that told us they they were ordered by senior officers to grab Palestinians next to them and to use them as human shields meaning that they were they were ordered to send Palestinians some of them were dressed up with IDF uniform cameras on their uh head or on their chest and then they were sent into tunnels and houses to check that there isn't any IEDs or explosive over there so the soldier could enter safely or clear the area and um we got testimonies from different units different times and different places in the Gaza Strip which shows as you said that it's widely spread this protocol and Nadav as far as you know how long has this practice been in place now um the first testimony that we have is from December 2023 meaning immediately after the ground invasion started and the last testimony that we had is from the beginning of this year beginning of 2025 just before the ceasefire and and it's something that the IDF is using more and more and more more units and more areas throughout the war and to what extent are you aware of soldiers resisting uh these orders to use Palestinians as human shields yeah so so it's interesting now every almost every soldier in the IDF learned about the fact that we used Palestinians as human shield during the second back then we called it the neighbor procedure when you come to arrest a high-ranking Palestinian or you know that he's armed so you grab the next door neighbor and you told the neighbor you knock on the door not me and maybe he will get shot and if nobody shot him then we told them get inside the house open all of the doors and open all of the lights so we will be more safe and that was banned by the Supreme Court in Israel in the end of the second father so the reserveist in the Israeli army grew up on that history that we did something it was bad but it was banned and that's it and now they got a command that is exactly that but I can say even worse actually right because he's dressing them up in IDF uniform some of the soldiers told us that it's maybe that they will be the target so they will get shot now the the thing is is that our testifier told us there was a debate inside their unit but it's our testifiers right i just read an oped in of an officer that served in Gaza and he said that almost every platoon is using human shields right so our testifiers told us there was a debate they came to their senior officers and told them hey you know that's we were trying to fight not to use human beings as human shields or that dea dehumanization of Palestinians or that's immoral or illegal or I don't know what but I cannot tell you what's going on in the greater IDF at the moment so explain the Dav why this is called the mosquito procedure and also talk about what these Israeli soldiers told you about what happens to the Palestinians many forced into houses buildings tunnels um that are suspected being booby trapped allegedly made to perform tasks like um looking for explosives uh in tunnels yeah so first of all a lot of things that uh the IDF has names for I don't know the reason but I can say that mosquito it's it's like it's a bug that flies in the air and like you can kill it who cares about it and that and that was the relationship a lot of times between the soldiers and those individual that were used and that's the word they were used right we have a testifier that called them a sub army of slaves now the the protocol is quite simple you need that individual with you for a period of time two days three days a week three weeks so it means that only when he's scanning a tunnel or an or a house or an alley so he doesn't have handcuffs or a blindfold the rest of the time when you're he's with you inside the house you need to feed him you need to take him to the bathroom uh but he's also handcuffed and blindfold so you need to help him in some unit there were um the mosquitoes inside the house were used to clean the house where the the soldier um stayed so it's not only you know don't only think about that time in the tunnel when they need to endanger their life think about the rest of the time the majority of the day that they they were living with the soldiers inside the house but again eventually they were supposed to be um released so it's um again I'm quoting that soldier a sub army of slaves and Nadav could you talk about the context in which this news has been coming out where there's mounting uh anger against Netanyahu protests all across the country yesterday uh for refusing to agree to a deal that would uh guarantee the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza if you could explain what the mood is uh in Israel uh the repeated calls for Netanyahu to step down you've said that he's acting like a dictator yeah so from the very beginning of this war we and other human rights organization we called for a deal to release our hostages ceasefire and enter humanitarian aid into Gaza now at the beginning we are we were a minority at the protest but as as this war it's hard for me to call it a war because as a soldier they told me that the war it's two armies fighting one another so is this intensive operation in Gaza went so long and we killed so many civilians and we lost so many of our soldiers and also we also some of our hostages more and more Israelis are resisting this war and if you look at polls in Israel at the moment you can see that the majority of Israelis meaning even BB's voters I believe are against the continuence of this war and pro- hostage deal and pro- ending this war and and you can see the atmosphere on the streets um what happened yesterday it was the 600 day uh of this uh operation or since October 7th and and we saw a lot of anger you know protesters in Tel Aviv took over the headquarters of the Liut party in Tel Aviv for a couple of hours right and they and they put signs they said it's the embassy of Qatar because of the allegation that Qatar paid for the close advisers of BB to support them more than anything else but but but I can say that what changed is in the mid mid-March when we returned fighting in Gaza when we continue bombing in Gaza and we broke the ceasefire and we stopped releasing our hostages the majority of of the audience in Israel understood that this is a war to protect BB's seat and BB's government not to release our hostages not to fight Kamas and not to defend our borders because if that was the case we will go to a hostage deal like um uh like Witkov help us achieve uh the minute Trump step into office now what we saw yesterday is more and more Israelis understanding that we are being lied to that our soldiers are sent to die and to be killed for themselves without any good reason without without releasing our hostages or ending this war i wanted to turn uh for a last example to the occupied West Bank israel admitting to strapping a wounded Palestinian man to the hood of an Israeli military vehicle during a raid on Janine relatives and neighbors of the man Mujahed Azmi said Israeli soldiers used him as a human shield instead of allowing him to get medical care after he'd been shot this is 13-year-old Alme speaking last year we told them we want an ambulance for the wounded person in the room so the army told us to bring him to them we got him outside and for about an hour or half an hour we kept asking for an ambulance then we called one 15 minutes later two jeeps came and they got in here the troops told us to turn around and not to look and they put mujah on the jeep's hood and took him after video of the incident went viral the Israeli military released a statement claiming the action was quote in violation of orders and standard operating procedures um Nadav if you can talk about how Israel is responding now to this latest news of this much more widespread use of exactly this kind of example now first of all I've got to say that IDF spokesperson a lot of times when they are confronted with something bad that soldier did that are against regulation they said it's against regulation we will educate the soldiers a mistake and that's it no investigation no nothing now I've got to say that that now the IDF announced that uh six investigation were opened after the IDF soldiers used Palestinian human shield in Gaza and it's a joke right because we have so many more incidents and even Yaniv Kubovich from Harit's newspapers published a couple of months ago that Helsi then commander-in-chief of the IDF was sitting in the meeting room while the mosquito protocol was discussed meaning that everybody knew now I've got to say that connects to something a lot bigger in the Israeli society and that's demonization of Palestinians right since October 7th it's even on steroids right we have government members that openly talking about genocide right when the head of the Labor Party Golan last week said that the right-wing politician likes to kill Palestinian kids and babies he was called as a traitor by our government you know we have ministers saying there isn't any innocent in Gaza that all of the Palestinians are assisting terror or terrorists by themselves and that sips down into the IDF into command that soldier are getting and if you connect that with the fact that we have more and more soldier officers and commanders in the IDF that comes from the religious rightwing or for the settler movement and believe that maybe it's a holy war uh not a war of defending ourselves you can understand why you have such a huge amount of those kind of incident dehumanization of Palestinians in in Israel uh became something so common that it also leads to this kind of practices inside the IDF nav want to thank you for being with us executive director of breaking the silence a whistleblower group of former Israeli soldiers democracy Now is funded by viewers like you please give today at

The Message is written as a letter to Coates's students at Howard University, where he is the Sterling Brown Endowed Chair in the English department. As part of the research for the book, Coates traveled to Senegal and visited the island of Gorée, often the last stop for captured Africans before they were shipped to the Americas as enslaved people. Coates also visited a schoolteacher in South Carolina who faced censorship for teaching Coates's previous book, _Between the World and Me_, an experience he says showed him the power of organizing. &quot;That, too, is about the power of stories. That, too, is about the power of narratives, the questions we ask and the questions we don't,&quot; Coates says of the community's response.&#10;Democracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on over 1,500 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] this is democracy Now democracynow.org The War and Peace report I'm Amy Goodman in this holiday special we spend the rest of the hour with the acclaimed writer and journalist tanasi coats author of the new book the message which is based in part on a trip he took last year to the occupied West Bank in Israel coats Compares Israel's apartate system to that of Jim Crow here in the United States he writes it occur occurred to me that there was still one place on the planet under American patronage that resembled the world that my parents were born into unquote in his book coats also writes about traveling to Sagal where he visited the slave trade Memorial at gory Island and going to South Carolina where school officials tried to ban his book between the world and me which won the national book award in 2015 team his current book the message is written as a letter to his students at Howard University where tanasi coats is the Sterling Brown owed chair in the English Department the message is coat's first collection of nonfiction since his 2017 book we were 8 years in power an American Tragedy democracy Now Juan Gonzalez and I spoke to tanasi coats in October I began by asking him about where the book begins senagal I asked him to talk about a journey he took there with great trepidation as you said you know we'll spend a lot of time talking about the occupied territories in Israel and the West Bank but it's good to start here because the the two parts are kind of paired to each other um a African-Americans are uh a group of people who have lived under the weight of a um um artifice a creation a kind of Mythology of what Africa is in our minds uh if all of the myths of racism all the justifications for enslavement all the justifications for Jim Crow at the end of their day they have their origins in these constructions of Africa as this Savage place the idea that you know having been brought here uh we're better off um very very typical of you know colonizing and conquering um um um movement and one of the things we've done to push back is create our own narratives our own Journeys our our own ideas of what Africa is my very name comes out of that which I'm very uncomfortable with as I talk about in the book and talk about it oh boy oh Lord um I wrote it I should be very comfortable talking about it um you know I was born in 1975 and that was a period in time coming out of black power uh coming out of you know black is beautiful like really discovering this idea that our sense of beauty our our our nose our lips our names our her that we had the right to take control over that um including our history and so my name is an ancient Egyptian name that refers to the ancient Kingdom of Nubia um the notion was that put very very crudely that if the West had its kings and queens if it had its great monuments if it had its great ideas so did we and part of growing older part of you know and I actually talk about this in between the world and Me part of becoming a writer actually is like our job is to be skeptical of clean stories and I learned that very very early on and the message is kind of a continuation of that of course the ultimate I would say I guess climax in that journey is going to see the continent itself and moving past um myth moving past the idea of constructed um um narratives even when they're uh liberatory even when they're emancipationist uh to see the people themselves and that is what took me to dhar and that is what I think took so long for me to go to dhar uh and in terms of uh What uh most surprised you uh in the trip could you talk about that yeah um what most surprised me is the thing that will not surprise any African-American watching this interview it was it was my deep sorrow is my deep deep deep sorrow and I think like much of what I you know just said in answer to Amy's question I'd already intellectualized before I went and so I was I was already thinking about this but thinking about something and being confronted with it is a totally totally different thing a great Mike Tyson said everybody's got to plan until they got punched and as soon as that plane started descending out of the clouds over daa and I saw the buildings uh rising up I was being punched it is one thing to think about the Middle Passage to think about your ancestors theoretically it is quite another to literally sit on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean um and look out and understand that this was even if only symbolically last stop and and when you went to gore you decided that you did not want to have a any of the tour guys you wanted to wander around on your own no talk about that experience well by by then it was it was like day three and so I understood that um as much as I thought I was going to see the continent I was actually going to see some sort of departed version of myself you know from hundreds of years ago I was walking with ghost the whole time and I just I didn't want to be talk to my family is from the eastern shore of Maryland not too far from Ocean City for anybody who knows that geography it's like right on the Atlantic Ocean and so to get back to synagog to get to dhar which is itself right on the tip of the continent you know I would look out and I would have these moments and I would say my God you know what I mean there's part of me all the way on the other side and there's part of me that's here and so again gory is a place that has a lot of story and a lot of myth around it and I I about that I thought I was fully prepared but I'm going to tell you brother you get on that boat and that boat pulls off and you think about all of your ancesters and it was 700 a.m. in the morning and I was alone on that boat and uh it is a very very different experience and back to your name tanasi and also which goes to your parents as well and how their influence on you your dad a former Black Panther and a publishing um uh a publishing press right in your house yeah yeah no and I think like what they were really trying to do and this actually goes to the core what the what the book is about how do you tell your own story how how do you free yourself from a history from novels from film from television an entire architecture that is designed to tell you that you are exactly where you belong because of who you are because of what you are either because of your genes because God said you know you belong there how do you construct something different and one of the things I'm trying to confront in the book is I think perhaps Step One is almost to make a mirror image of the people that that have put you in that situation well you say we're this we're actually that but I think one of the most difficult things is to Free Yourself entirely of that structure and to construct your own morality your own stories your own ideas that don't necessarily depend um on those who have put you in a situation to begin with and the the structure of your book is addressed to your students uh at Howard the decision to choose that form for your book you know I was to be honest with you I've not said this anywhere I was very worried about that because I'd done that like I'd written this letter in between the world and me and I thought people get oh my God he's going to do this again what between the world and me again but the fact of the matter is I am always trying to achieve intimacy with the reader that's that's the you know the the the primary job I you know I would tell my students all the time look you are dealing with readers who could be doing anything else they could be on their smartphones they could be playing video games they could be watching movies they could be watching TV somewhere making love they could be doing anything but reading you and so you have a responsibility to make them feel a sense of intimacy and immediacy and I was lucky in the sense that you know these were very very real conversation that IID had with my students so I had something to pull from you know and also you know the the the fact of just the letter form allowed me to do that it allows me to get you know a kind of intimacy with my reader talk about George Orwell why I write and um connecting politics and language in the promise you made to your students at Howard your between the world and me was written to your son Samari this to the students yeah so we usually start actually with politics in the English language that's that's that's the first essay that I have them read you know just to think about language as a political thing you know we we live in this world where um I feel that um often times we are taught not that everybody subscribes it it's that art lives over here and politics lives over here and that politics itself is actually very very limited that you know it happens every two or four years it's in the voting booth it's who you decide you know to vote for it's what issues you decide to activate on but one of the arguments that I make in the message is that there's an entire architecture outside of the world of mean politics that determin how politicians actually talk the choices they give you know Etc why does Camala Harris feel the need for instance to say that she has a gun what what is that actually based on and I would say it is based on archetypes of femininity I would say it's built based on archetypes of race archetypes of the cowboy and where do those archetypes come from they come from our art they come from our literature they come from our film our TVs our commercials you know and at their base they ultimately come from writing because somebody has to write those ultimately and in that world things that seem separated from politics never really are and so I wanted to start that that uh book um or this book the message with that Oilwell quote because that that's like one of the things he kind of is obsessing with in that essay and at the same time there's this beautiful tension that I often feel which is in a different world you know he would just write Beautiful Stories he would just play with language for the hell of playing with language but he doesn't live in that world and I don't feel that my students live in that world they live in a world of of as we'll talk about genocide partide segregation global warming you know category five hurricanes you know flood on one Coast fire on the other these are immediate issues and I I I don't believe that they as writers we as writers have the luxury of sort of sitting back in our salons and in our living rooms you know simply constructing beautiful language for the hell of constructing beautiful language it has to be engaged with how from cot you take us to Colombia South Carolina uh why that choice well I was writing this in a time where this um wave of book Bannings was happening um and I always wanted to write about that but I I felt that I was worried about making the writer the center of of the book Banning because even though the the work is directed at the writer the writer is actually not the person that suffers under the book band the teacher suff under the book under the book man it's the teachers who are under threat for losing their job it's the teachers who get harassed it's the Librarians who are under threat of losing their job it's the Librarians who get harassed it's the students who lose the ability to have access to different worlds and different ways of thinking and I was trying to figure out how I could write this in such a way um so that I would not be the center of it luckily you know I ended up in conversation with a teacher by the name of Mary wood uh from chapen South Carolina went to chapen high school where she teached um and where she was trying to teach between the world and me um and got into some amount of trouble for that um and she invited me down you know just to you know go to a hearing um and that's what I did and um it was quite it was quite eventful it was not the world that I expected it was not the um the audience I expected um it was interesting to see uh how much support actually was rallied behind her even though she's in a deep red area uh in a deep red State um and so that too is about the power stories that too is about the power of narratives the questions we ask and the questions we don't you write in the message about this experience in South Carolina I see politicians in Colorado and Tennessee and South Carolina moving against my own work tossing books I've authored out of libraries Banning them from classes I feel snatched out of the present and dropped into an age of pitchforks and book burning bonfires my first instinct is to laugh but then I remember that American history is filled with men and women who are as lethal as they were ridiculous now if you got one running for president right now you know lethal and ridiculous well you talk about um the area you were in 7030 split 70% for Trump and yet and this is what you were just talking about this 30% how surprised you were by the minority the power of it when it's mobilized yeah you know it's like one of these things like again like this goes back to to how we construct language it's either a blue or red District right even purple doesn't quite like carry the quite you know like the real connotation so you think it's red uh okay battle's over why am I here you know but 30% and 30% activated around an actual issue is actually a lot of people you know what I mean and and it was like like I could not have known that without seeing it like you have to and this is like one of the messages I have you know for my students in the book you you have to walk the land you can't you know sit on your but reading reports you know what I mean and even reading books like this one and say hey I'm going to be a writer you have to have actual experiences so I have to walk in that room you know and meet this you know white woman in her 70s you know who tells me in the wake of George Floyd we organized a reading group at our church for Black authors and I love cson Whitehead oh my God have you read him you know like I have to have that experience with somebody you know I have to have that that shock you know um and so I I I just feel like it was like really really important in in in in the message to actually model the work that I was articulating or model the lessons that I was actually articulating for my students when you just referred to president Trump can you elaborate further um he looks ridiculous but he is in fact quite lethal you know um and I think uh certainly in 2016 uh there was great great temptation to laugh you know what I mean um you hear these things you know you hear him say certain things you know you see him you know in certain places and there there's a kind of dis dismissiveness um but what we actually are dismissing is a kind of Darkness that I think lurks deep deep within all of us and can actually be appealed to it's not um comfortable to say that you can win through hate it's not comfortable to say that you can win through anger it's not comfortable to say historically it actually has been very effective at you know uh electorally to pick out weak people or people who are not in you know the most advantaged political space and to demonize them and use them as a tool that that actually has been quite effective for people in pursuit of power we would rather think that um good wins all the time that people see the best in each other it reifies our Notions of what America is our stories that we tell ourselves of what America is but it doesn't correspond with the actual history and the truth tanasi coats author of the new book The Message in a minute will return to our conversation and talk about Israel and Palestine" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="this is democracy Now democracynow.org War peace and the presidency I'm Amy Goodman on Sunday here in New York City more than 2,000 people packed the historic Riverside Church for a discussion about America and the war on Palestine it was hosted by the Palestine Festival of literature or palfest the church Riverside where Dr Martin Luther King Jr uh gave his speech on April 4th 196 67 a year to the day before he was assassinated the event yesterday featured several speakers including Palestinian human rights attorney Nora erot a professor at Rutter's University author of justice for some law and the question of Palestine another of the panelists was kianga yamata Taylor professor of African-American studies at Princeton University and contributing writer at the New Yorker magazine you can see our interview with Professor yata Taylor last week at democracynow.org in a minute we'll hear from human rights attorney Nora erot she was introduced by the moderator and author tanasi coats his new book the message in part about a visit he took to the occupied West Bank and Israel that was organized by members of palfest the sponsors of yesterday's event this is what he had to say when I think about being here I I think about ancestors and I think it would be wrong if I didn't if we didn't proceed without acknowledging that um first of all I was informed uh when I came here that this is where uh Edward s's funeral was um and so it's incredibly appropriate to be here in this moment um the second thing is something that yes me and I talked about and have't been talking about for a year even when we did the other event before um was the fact that this was also the place where Martin Luther King uh stood up against the Vietnam War uh and was so courageous and I want to acknowledge that in his time when he did that a lot of people did not applaud um I want to acknowledge that there were many people who he thought of as his allies um who left him um yes yes yes yes yes that's why I think it's very appropriate right absolutely um who urged him to U be silent as bombs were being dropped uh on on on helpless people um and he did not do that and so I think in that Spirit that's the spirit in which we proceed in our conversation yes um we're going to talk a lot about Theory today um not that theory is irrelevant but I do think it is important for us to ground ourselves in the reality of what is going on right now um and nor if you would just take a moment uh for us us um and speak to the ongoing genocide um the pain the life lost um frankly the role that we as Americans play in that um if you would just take a moment for us just to ground us so so that we are not forgetting so that we are not you know all the way up here thank you thank you tanassi thank you kianga into this audience again thank you for coming to find Sanctuary collectively I think that this was a concern that after more more than a year of watching Slaughter of babies this is essentially and continues to be a war on children uh in a besieged territory where 50% of the population is children so even before a bomb is dropped it is a war on children um that it's really easy to then pivot to the theoretical piece to make sense of it we want to make sense of it at this stage and what gets lost is what's happening and so I appreciated full full transparency tanasi asked me to do this just you know right before this event so I thought that the the proper way to do it was actually to read testimony from the ground um from a colleague um from a colleague who who uh in Gaza who is recounting as of 6:00 a.m. this morning one of his colleagues uh woke up to 32 members of his family who were killed in jabalia and jabalia is in the north which is now under now an even tighter Siege in a campaign of extermination and ethnic cleansing what he writes um upon waking up at 6:00 a.m. and finding his family slaughtered is that quote I live meters away from them it is a matter of luck I wish I died with them neither my heart or mind can tolerate this my Uncle his wife and three sons and grandson grandsons and daughters all deleted um his he also lost his brother earlier in the year and as we've been paying attention in this moment which is important to ground we're on Day 400 of genocide but we're on Day 36 of the siege of the North and the siege of the north is a tightening of the siege that already existed right and it's a siege that even predates the beginning of this campaign this genocidal campaign it's a Siege that's been in place since 2006 at the earliest thinking about a land Siege and a naval blockade but 1993 if you go back to when Gaza is first circumscribed by barbed wire as a way to prepare for peace the irony is that the preparation for peace was a program to isolate and separate the Gaza Strip from the rest of the question of Palestine and to call it the pal the Palestinian state Le and never to leave the West Bank to negotiation but it was done in the language of peace that this this double speak continues but now here we are of this third and 36 days of this particular campaign and we got the earliest indication of it on day six of this genocide when there was an order to evacuate the north to below the W line right the line that's the which was the order if you remember when 1.1 million Palestinians that's more than half the population besieged was ordered to leave the north to below the weine but note that that removal was a death sentence as the World Health Organization called it a death sentence how do you remove the immobile how do you force the sick to travel and those that did take the risk and travel were targeted on the on the humanitarian lines that they were given indicating to us on day six that there would be no safe quarter that this was a campaign of genocide and it's why um Holocaust studies scholar Ros seal the very next day published in Jewish currents this is a textbook case of genocide right and it's why 800 12 Scholars third world approaches to international law Scholars I I when people call me international law you know the constant question that I get is how do you still believe in the law and I'm like I'm a twail scholar we never believed in it we've been telling you it is a source and a sight of Oppression and Colonial domination my book tries to see that yes and tries to to to demonstrate how despite this colonial structure we can use it for emancipatory purposes under which circumstances right use it when it suit us abandon it when it doesn't create new law when we can it is a tool it is not the word of God it is not holy it is subject to change and to change by us so those 8002 Scholars who know that said raising the alarm this is genocide this was all within the first week all within the first week and now we're hearing something known as the General's plan the General's plan which is the the the the formula for Exterminating the north the 400,000 people total Palestinians left in the north 100,000 particularly in the area now marked for ethnic cleansing um the General's plan is the brainchild of General um I Gora what is his first name Gora Eland Gora Eland who proposes this plan Gora Eland was also the architect of the Elon plan in the early 2000s which competed with Ariel chiron's plan for unilateral withdrawal and disengagement which was the withdrawal of Israeli settlers and the withdrawal of military installations but the maintenance of occupation of Gaza that Elon plan in the early 2000s was to ethnically cleanse all of Gaza into the Sinai right so what the idea that he's now by the way Med so thanks to you know our partners Med have written wrote beautifully and and thoroughly about the Elon plan but you have the 1993 circumscription of Gaza and preparation for peace you have the Elon plan in the year 2000 you have the evacuation order on October 12th which was uh called a death sentence you have the calls that this is genocide since day seven you have now the General's plan we have a year over a year of bearing witness to what you know my my job and other people's job has been to to illuminate what can't be seen what's been ausc they have illuminated it for us at this point it is not about us telling you what you have to read between the lines it's literally about what they don't want to hear not what is not being revealed because they are telling us they have shown us it is evident they are defending it they call it self-defense and they call the completion of the neba as as the right to complete so it's less opusc right and now it becomes more about it's a battle of narrative who do you want to listen to nura erakat professor at rutr University author of justice for some law and the question of Palestine speaking Sunday here in New York at the his Riverside Church at an event moderated by author tanasi coats his new book The Message the event was hosted by the Palestine Festival of literature also in that discussion uh Kanga yamata Taylor Princeton University Professor to see our interview with her go to democracynow.org the next palfest event Palestine Festival of literature will be held in London November 20th to Mark the republication of Edward S book the question of Palestine followed by events in Detroit Philadelphia and Minneapolis"

          <attvalue for="3" value="Support our work: https://democracynow.org/donate/sm-de...&#10;&#10;We're joined by Israeli journalist Gideon Levy as we continue our conversation on the Israeli-Lebanon ceasefire. We take a look at the mood within Israel, where Levy characterizes the Israeli public as &quot;sour&quot; about what is seen as a premature deal. &quot;They would like to see more blood, more destruction in Lebanon,&quot; says Levy. &quot;Israel wants wars.&quot; This retributive stance is still being felt in Lebanon, adds writer Lina Mounzer, who says Lebanese people are &quot;very terrified of the day after&quot; and do not feel that they have been awarded peace, despite the terms of the ceasefire. Meanwhile, the Israeli government has unanimously voted to sanction the Israeli newspaper Haaretz_, claiming that its editorials &quot;have hurt the legitimacy of the state of Israel and its right to self defense.&quot; _Haaretz has criticized the move, which comes just months after Israel banned the international media outlet Al Jazeera, as anti-democratic. Levy, a columnist for _Haaretz_, says the sanction makes it clear that Israelis cannot take the freedom of speech &quot;for granted anymore.&quot;&#10;&#10;Democracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on over 1,500 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

          <attvalue for="7" value="I want to bring giddon Levy into this conversation in Tel Aviv um giddon if you could start off by responding to there was a um latest text from the Israeli negotiator Gan Basin um who wrote the ceasefire agreement which went into effect today is good news the agreement is between Israel and the government of Lebanon not between Israel and Hezbollah it seems that Hezbollah has been weakened enough um it says uh it seems that it's been weakened enough um that let's see if I can find this that it's been weakened enough to end the war in Lebanon before the war in Gaza has ended your response to this and also the response in Israel right now to I think it was about 4 a.m. that the ceasefire or this cessation in hostilities went into effect yes I wish I could tell you that Israel is happy about the ceasefire I wish I could tell you that there is even a relief in Israel but unfortunately in Israel everyone almost everyone is critical about this agreement I guess many Israelis did not have enough for sure the right Wingers for sure the most of the inhabitants of the north they would like to see more blood and more destruction Lebanon and therefore they are so sour today and the other Camp as usual is saying nothing and even one of the opposition leaders Benny gun even criticized the ceas he saw the war should go on in other words Israel wants Wars that's the inevitable conclusion when you see reactions to a ceas fire which puts an end at least partial end to suffer in both sides suffer which didn't lead to anywhere Israel didn't achieve anything in this war it will not achieve anything in the war in Gaza 10 times or 1,000 times worse and here I must emphasize that nobody should have any Illusions has no intention to put an end to the war in Gaza what happened in Lebanon will not happen soon in Gaza because if he goes for an agreement in Gaza he loses his government and that's his top priority and Israel at least part of Israel has very serious intentions to resettle Gaza don't underestimate those settlers the sky the limit for them they just wait for Donald Trump to get into the office and I will not be surprised if we very soon later see settlements in Gaza in other words nothing was solved yesterday accept of the the the punishment of of Lebanon which came to its end but also this is for a very limited time I mean when the prime minister speaks about the agreement and all he has to say are threats about Lebanon and kbal that if any violation will take place immediately Israel will attack again so we are going from one war to the other and from one viol confrontation to the other without even suggesting any other alternative nothing nobody speaks about diplomacy nobody speaks about touching the core issues both in the north and in the South our friend from from Lebanon our Lebanese friend just mentioned violations of the of the sovereignity of Lebanon anyone speaks about the fact that Israel I'm sure will continue to fly over Lebanon known for intelligence this will be kosher this will be legitimate and only the violation of of of Israeli sovereignity is never forgiven and get Lev I wanted to ask you in terms of the the the toll on the the IDF now over 800 soldiers have been killed in Gaza about the estimates are about 70 73 or 74 uh in in Lebanon on and those are the only ones the ones publicly acknowledged uh the what is the impact on Israel of continuing this war on the economy of Israel on migration on tourism and the other aspects of economic life in Israel the price is enormous but somehow Israeli accepted this is this unbelievable phenomena in which people are ready to sacrifice the dearest ones I mean who is more than your son without seeing a real purpose I mean they all tell themselves that they were killed sacrificed for the for the defense of Israel what what kind of defense is it if you bomb camp in Gaza what what does Israel benefit out of it the economical price is one thing I mean you mentioned tourism there's no tourism whatsoever there are hardly any International Airlines to fly in here but there is a much heavier price namely turning Israel into a par State you know it very well from the United States but everywhere else it's not only that netan and and the Gallant are now wanted all over the world every Israeli will feel it when he will go abroad now every Israelis everywhere will feel at least discomfort in presenting himself identifying himself as an Israeli and still Israelis are ready to take this only because they were told that we have to live from war to war to live on our sword and there is no other option which is a total lie because Israel never tried an alternative but brainwash like brainwash gon and I don't know if you can respond to this but the Israeli cabinet has unanimously voted to sanction your paper harat saying its editorials quote have hurt the legitimacy of the state of Israel and its right to self-defense unquote under the move the Israeli government will stop advertising in the paper cut off all Communications with haret haret has slammed the decision saying it quote is another step in netanyahu's Journey to dismantle Israeli democracy like his friends Putin eruan Orban Netanyahu is trying to silence a critical Independent Newspaper haratz will not bulk and will not morph into a government pamphlet that publishes messages approved by the government and its leader unquote this all comes 6 months after Israel banned Al jazer from operating in Israel and as the president-elect here in the United States uh Donald Trump threatens to go after major US broadcasters and Publications calling the media the enemy of the people get on you serve on the editorial board of harats I know you can't speak specifically about the sanctions against your paper but can you talk broader about these threats to the Press sure it's not that I can't but we decided that this this message that you just read now is is our reaction as a newspaper but I think that those sanctions tell much more about Israel and Israel's government than about the arids and here I think especially in the United States who always speaks about the shared vales about the only democracy in the Middle East so first of all it's questionable if if a state which rules in such a brutal way in five million people can it all be defined as a democracy but let's put the occupation the part they side even for us Jews in Israel who used to live in a quite liberal democracy things are changing right now from day to day from week to week legislations against freedom of speech against the legal system against any kind of Human Rights against any minority are being ruled and and nobody says a word I mean nobody can stop it at least as long as this government is there so what I would like to stress here Amy is that you have to also look at what's going on within the Jewish Israel it is Chang changing while we are speaking and the war in Gaza and Lebanon has a lot to do with it because the those two Wars with all their lack of legitimacy and brutality also influence the domestic structure and the domestic system of Israel and you see the outcome I don't take my freedom of speech and I have of speech total freedom of speech but I can't take for granted anymore well I want to thank you both for being with us and I want to give Lena munza just we have 30 seconds but the last word on what you expect to happen from here as you watch what has happened to your country uh at least for this moment from afar uh look we're very terrified of the day after Mr Levy talked about the effect on internal Israeli politics we're also very afraid uh Lebanon is a very fragile you know pluralist state but at the same time the Israelis also have known very much how to uh work on that so they've been specifically bombing where the refugees have gathered we've seen over the last few months that people have been Turning Away refugees these refugees are largely Shia from South Lebanon uh and from uh the southern suburbs of of Beirut so there's been a lot of hostility that has incurred uh so we're really really afraid of the day after in terms of you know the internal stability of the country and what's going to happen to it and I just want to say you know to go back to this idea of collateral damage this is something that the United States normalized you know in our region in Iraq the way to punish an entire country in order to change some sort of internal mechanism which then devastates the country because of course they have no idea what they're doing and this is not you bring about change so we're all also very afraid of now what's going to happen to Lebanon internally as we go on and as the pieces are picked up and a lot of anger and recrimination is going to start coming to the surface among the population so you know as we say in Arabic Al like we have no idea what's going to happen Lena muner we want to thank you for being with us lean's writer and Senior editor of the Arts and literature magazine the maraz and gon Levy award-winning Israeli journalist at harat's author of the new book The Killing of Gaza reports on a catastrophe we thank you so much both for joining us from Montreal and from Tel Aviv" />

The Message In which he Journeys to Sagal Israel and the occupied West Bank and he's joining Michelle Martin to discuss what he found thanks Christian Tana Housey coats thank you so much for joining us uh thanks for having me Michelle I'm sure a lot of people know your previous work especially between the world and me but in this new book you go to three different places you write about your trips to three different places to sagol to South Carolina and to Israel and to the Palestinian territories you've already gotten a lot of attention for this book some of it quite heated it has to be said but I want to start where you start in the book which is synagogue I mean this is your first trip there you describe these feelings of real disqui while you were there sort of fear just sadness and a kind of a heavy can you just describe why or or what it is that you were feeling and why you think you were feeling that you know I'm I'm of the generation of of of children born in I guess the 70s maybe it started in the late 60s where it became popular to give your kids African names um and to really you know raise children with you know different views and different Notions of Africa and different ideas of Africa and and and that effort really was to overcome a a very racist telling and stories of of what Africa was and thus to justify uh treatment of African-Americans and that in turn was counted with different versions of um of of of History some of them themselves quite mythical um but here I was confronted with the real thing no more stories no more narratives this is it buddy this is actually what it is you know and I was going to be crafting stories on my own to say nothing of the fact which I actually think I took for granted that this really was you know um in some profound way as cliche as it is you know the motherland like I that was really where where I was going and so um I just I I I was terribly affected and maybe I was not totally prepared to be affected can I throw something out or were you afraid that you would be disappointed disappointed no because of the age I went because the age I went and and I understand why a lot of people are afraid by that but actually as I'm reflecting on your question maybe I was one of the things I I talk about is lurking in the back of my mind was you know what if all of those racist narratives were actually true you know that's terrible to admit you know but I certainly that was in the back of my mind and something that that was Haunting me I I you know I didn't expect to be you know welcomed with drums and you know welcome home brother brother yes no no I I didn't expect any of that that wasn't what I was looking for um but like I said this is terrible to admit perhaps I feared that I would not find um a city in dhar of of human beings that is a hard thing to admit so what do you think you found there that you that that is important to the the overall narrative that you're sharing in this book you know that the first I say and I guess we'll talk about this in a minute and the last I say are kind of in conversation with each other um when you when you've had a a horrific violent event happened to you such that it really you know breaks lineage and breaks time how do you reconstruct yourself um how do you reconstruct yourself in a way that is truthful reflects your ethics tell the stories that you you really feel like um embody your sense of justice I think there is great Temptation um when you suffer through an experience like we have and the humiliation that that that comes with it um to go completely in the other direction you know and maybe you know ignore some of the reality that actually makes you a human being synagog was really my opportunity uh to to to confront some of those stories and some of those ideas that actually I was I was raised on myself that are embodied in my very name actually in story I guess as you were as as you would say in story they were embodied in story and that story kind of infiltrated you in ways that you perhaps were not really aware of so then may of 2023 you visited Israel and the Palestinian territories so in the book you draw parallels between Jim Crow America and the Israeli occupation of these territories you called it separate and unequal alive and well you say it's a place where the glare of racism burned more intensely than anywhere else in your life that you had ever seen so tell us a little bit about why you say that you know there are two sides of me while there's a part of me that they you know does not like you know mixing it up and you know you know fighting with people there was also a part of me that says um there is something dishonorable and actually unloving about witnessing certain things that you think are important and and not saying anything about them the fact of the matter is I went to the old city of Jerusalem on two different times the first time I went in the way that typically Palestinian Muslims go and we were held for about 45 minutes uh by armed guards before they you know gave us entrance um there was no you went to Ala the Ala Al and you know no reasoning was given or or anything like that they just held us just because they could and then when I came back in the way that an American Tourist might come or Christian typically typically might come it was so easy I just breathed through it was the easiest thing in the world and this you know control of time and space extended out into the West Bank where you know there roads for Palestinians and then there roads for Israeli settlers which immediately set off my child you got two different rules for two different classes of people so that that immediately sets off alarm Bells uh for me you you know you're seeing in the territory and you can see one place where settlements are and where settlers live um and and they're marked in a certain way and then you can see other areas where they Palestinian Villages and hamlets and where they live and you can see that these are completely separate uh you go to the old city of heon as I've talked about and there's streets where I am allowed to walk down if it is made clear to the guards that my mother was a Christian that I am a Christian and that my grandmother was a Christian but my Palestinian guides do not have have access to that's just in brief what what I saw I saw much more but that sets off certain things for me and then I came back and had to do the reading and the research on top of that to understand the governance and and and and and the structures that are beneath that that make that possible and in some ways mandate that and I was left with the conclusion and in fact what I was witnessing was separate and unequal that it was you know the closest that I would see in my time to the Jim Crow that my parents were born into so is there a point at which you said to yourself I I can not only just see this I have to write about it and accept whatever comes with my writing about it in this way was there like a pivotal moment or was that always the plan that was always the plan but I Knew by saying I'm gonna like I I just knew I this is gonna be this is gonna be hard this gonna be what's hard so say more about what's hard what what is hard I don't like hurting people's feelings man I just I that sounds I'm kind of laughing but it's actually true I I don't like I don't enjoy telling people things telling people unpleasant things and it to to be really I guess direct with you there are people who I have had in my life who I care about um some of whom have been colleagues of mine you know I've spent very intimate time around um whose feelings this will hurt very very different view of the state of Israel than than I do have ties to it you know I I believe that what I witnessed was an immoral apar regime that that those are my conclusions that's what I say in the book um I don't take saying that lightly I I I would rather not feel like I have to say it but but but I did based on what I witnessed and what I read afterwards so your core conclusions are it's an apartheid regime the life there for Palestinians is unbearable it's unbearable it's demeaning it's to humaniz Ing and it's morally unjustifiable is that would that be that that would be correct that would be correct and and I just um you know I want to add two things to that the first thing is this this I know this word apartheid you know is is Harsh and it's one that FR yeah it tracks a lot of debate I don't want people to think that I'm just throwing you know that around casually um it was not just what I observed it was reading uh the the reports of Amnesty International where they made the case for aarth it was reading the reports of the human rights the Israeli Human Rights group uh betm where they made the case for a partti it was reading Human Rights Watch in their reports it was reading the reports of alhak it was actually doing that it was actually reading the words and the quotes of people like uh a former a prime minister ah ahud Barack or ahud Omar and them warning that Israel was in fact tipping into athe um that that is really what it was rooted in so I I know that is a heavy word for a lot of people but I don't want them to think that I'm just sort of casually you know lobbing grenades for the heck of it so let me go into just some of the some of the criticism of the work already the book is just out but a lot of people have already read it some of the criticism is you went for 10 days you went for 10 days this is a a nation state that has existed in its current form for 75 years at this point but this is these are people who have indigenous claims to this land for centuries you have two not just the Palestinians have indigenous claims to this land but also the Hebrew people the Jewish people have indigenous claims to this land and the these borders have moved back and forth for centuries this is one of the things people often criticize journalists for they say you go someplace for 10 days and then you're entitled to tell the world about it so what do you what do you say to that what what what I say to that is there there are things that we hold at at our moral quote that we witness that um context 600 word books reports even more time won't make okay uh I this's there's nothing that I can imagine that I will see that will make it okay that one group of people uh lives in a settlement and another group of people lives in a village and there is perhaps a half a mile between those two group of people and one group has direct access to water and the other does not um there's very little that I'm that I can imagine seeing there's nothing that I can imagine seeing that allows for a society in which there are tiers of citizenship and at the top tier of that is is a group of people be they Jewish or who whoever but in this case because it's Israel they Jewish who have the top tier of citizenship and everyone else is something less there's not something that I would have seen in in 30 more days and and I will add that even that criticism is familiar to me because in fact during the Civil Rights Movement what white Southerners would often say is you white Northerners who come down St stirring up trouble you don't know the Negro like we do you haven't been down here you don't live down here you don't really know what it is you don't understand the situation you don't understand the situation but if you ask the black folks there they would tell you you understand it perfectly you know um and so I just um you know I I get it I get that you know I would like to know more like to do more but I can't help but feel that if I had a different political perspective on this um the very people who are who are who are criticizing my just you know only going there for 10 days uh we would think 10 days were actually quite enough the other criticism is you did not in include in the book people who defend the government um in fact you criticize the idea of what we call what we have started to call both siding the issue especially in journalism but I still want to ask you about your unwillingness to include for purposes of this report other views because you know we are constantly being instructed especially in this very polarized time that that's fundamental to empathy and if we don't at least engage in that practice that we're not being true to that fundamental value of trying to see other people as human so how do you answer that the first thing I would say is um the uh pro-israel point of view the Zionist point of view um those who view the Zionist project as as as a good thing as a moral thing as a as a just thing uh they are not unrepresented um in the the uh the vehicles of American Media and our in our newspapers and our magazines and our and our our television shows that that Viewpoint is not unrepresented on the contrary it's one that I was very much exposed to and what the purpose of that last essay really is is I am someone who went somewhere and saw something and came back struggling with how it could be that what I saw was so different than what than the story that I was consuming in my media on on a regular basis and and and I really wanted to understand why and I thought that the way to do that my tool for doing that was to privilege the words of those who I believe have been you know unjustly pushed out of the frame and that is you know the the the the Palestinians um my feeling is that many of the Publications that would Lodge that criticism would do well to look at their own by lines and count how many Palestinians they've published over the past 10 or 15 years um and so it it is it is quite Rich to me that I am being criticized or that I would be criticized for not talking to people who would defend what I believe to be an unjust order you know in Publications that I think are actually part of how that order maintains itself when you don't allow people to speak when you don't allow them uh a place not just in your individual work but in the entirety of the conversation it becomes a lot easier to do things to them you know I I'm wondering if though you is the fundamental problem here that one Faith group is privileged over other Faith groups or is the because that is not unique to Israel Israel is not the only country that privileges One Faith group over another Faith group is the fundamental problem here that Israel is seen as different that Israel sees itself as different I just want to make sure I'm not excluding a very important group of people and that's Palestinian Christians uh who I you know I interviewed some of and felt as discriminated against as anybody else there's a there's a you know incident I describe happening in heon where I'm asked my religion but you know what was very interesting about that I was also asked my mother's and my grandmother's religion and when you start asking that you are asking something besides do I accept Jesus Christ as my personal savior there's something deeper going on you know there was great evil in this world you know and and and I I am wary of singling you know Israel out as somehow uh uh singular or more evil or or whatever but the point I would make is that I am responsible as an American and particularly as a citizen of a country that takes somebody like Martin Luther King as its patron saint that walks around talking about you know with great pride about the triumphs of the civil rights movement and equality how can I then go to a country where we boast about our special relationship with and see a two- tiered Society literally with citizenship is decided by ethnicity religion and rights are decided by ethnicity and religion and then just say you know what there's a lot of other evil in the world too and and turn my back I I just don't have that in me to do that before I let you go and I've been struggling to find this passage but it's this is when you were walking at yadvashem which is the memorial to the victims of the Holocaust you say that it hurts to know that in my own writing I have done to people that which in this writing I have invaded against that I have reduced people diminished people erased people I want to tell you that I was wrong I want to tell you that your oppression will not save you that being a victim will not Enlighten you that it can just as easily deceive you I learned that here in haa in rala and especially here at y vashem so this is another story about writing about power about settling accounts a story not of redemption but of reparation who are you talking to myself but I was talking to my students um I think that your imagination has to be slightly ahead and maybe even more ahead than the present politics and I think there is great great danger in thinking that because you lack power in a particular moment you don't have the ability to hurt and damage other people um I am not in that case making a narrow critique of Israel or of Zionism this is I think a very very human impulse to think that because you went through some horrific experience you therefore have a kind of moral Authority and are therefore then not capable of inflicting Horrors on other people um and as much as I feel like I saw that you know what I mean in my travels over there you're I mean I was talking to us too I was very much talking to us too um and I think that was like really important for me to say t hassy coats thank you for speaking with us thank you Michelle thank you so much [Music] [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="democracy depends on a free press please support our independent journalism at democracynow.org/g this is democracyow democracynow.org the Warren Peace Report i'm Amy Goodman with Juan Gonzalez we turn now to the Empire of AI that's the name of a new book by the journalist Karen How who's closely reported on the rise of the artificial intelligence industry with a focus on Sam Alman's Open AI the company behind Chat GPT karen How compares the actions of the AI industry to those of colonial powers in the past she writes quote &quot;The empires of AI are not engaged in the same overt violence and brutality that marked this history but they too seize and extract precious resources to feed their vision of artificial intelligence the work of artisan writers the data of countless individuals posting about their experiences and observations online the land energy and water required to house and run massive data centers and supercomputers.&quot; She writes &quot;Karen House book comes at a time when Republican Congress members are trying to block states from regulating AI the House recently passed Trump's so-called big beautiful budget bill that contains a provision that would prohibit any state level regulations of AI for the next decade.&quot; In a major gift to the AI industry Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green has criticized the provision even though she voted for the bill she wrote online quote &quot;Full transparency i did not know about this section i'm adamantly opposed to this and it's a violation of state rights and I would have voted no if I had known this was in there.&quot; She says she won't vote for it if it remains in there after the Senate votes to talk about this and much more we're joined by the journalist Karen How whose new book again is just out Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares and Sam Alman's Open AI former reporter at the Wall Street Journal and MIT Technology Review she leads the Pulitzer Cent's AI Spotlight Series program for J training journalists on how to cover AI you should train everyone on how to understand AI karen it's an amazing book why don't you start by talking about the title what exactly you mean for a lay audience for I suspect a lot of our audience are lites um so you really have to explain what artificial intelligence artificial general intelligence is so AI is a collection of many different technologies but most people were introduced to it through chatbt and what I argue in the book and what the title refers to empire of AI it's actually a critique of the specific trajectory of AI development that led us to chatbt and has continued since chatbt and that is specifically Silicon Valley's scale at all costs approach to AI development ai models in modern day they are trained on data they need computers to train them on that data but what Silicon Valley did and what OpenAI did in the last few years is they started blowing up the amount of data and the the size of the computers that need to do this training so we are talking about the full English language internet being fed into these models books scientific articles all of the intellectual property that is being created and also massive supercomputers that run tens of thousands even hundreds of thousands of computer chips that are the size of dozens maybe hundreds of football fields and use practically the entire energy demands of cities now so this is an extraordinary um type of AI development that is causing a lot of social labor and environmental harms and that is ultimately why I evoke this analogy to empire and Karen could you talk some more about not only the energy requirements but the water requirements of these huge data centers that are essence in essence the backbone of of this uh widening industry absolutely i'll give you two stats on both the energy and the water when talking about the energy demand McKenzie recently came out with a report that said in the next 5 years based on the current pace of AI computational infrastructure expansion we would need to put as much energy on the global grid as what is consumed by two to six times the energy consumed annually by the state of California and that will mostly be serviced by fossil fuels we're already seeing reporting of uh coal plants with their lives being extended they were supposed to retire but now they cannot to support this data center development we are seeing methane gas turbines unlicensed ones being popped up to uh service these data centers as well from a freshwater perspective these data centers need to be trained on freshwater they cannot be trained on any other type of water because it can corrode the equipment it can lead to bacterial growth and most of the time it actually taps directly into a public drinking water supply because that is the infrastructure that has been laid to deliver this clean fresh water to different businesses to different homes and Bloomberg recently had an analysis where they looked at the expansion of these data centers around the world and twothirds of them are being placed in water scarce areas so they're being placed in communities that do not have access to fresh water so it's not just the total amount of fresh water that we need to be concerned about but actually the distribution of this infrastructure around the world and most people are familiar with chat GPT uh the consumer aspect of AI but what about the military uh aspect of AI where in essence uh we're finding Silicon Valley companies becoming the next generation of defense contractors one of the reasons why OpenAI and many other companies are turning to the defense industry is because they have spent an extraordinary amount of money in developing these technologies they're spending hundreds of billions to train these models and they need to recoup those costs and there are only so many industries and so many places that have that size of a paycheck to pay and so that's why we're seeing a cozying up to the defense industry we're also seeing Silicon Valley use the US government in their empire building ambitions you could argue that the US government is also trying to use Silicon Valley vice versa in their empire building ambitions um but certainly these technologies are not they are not designed to be used in a sensitive military context and so the the aggressive push of these companies to try and get those defense contracts and integrate their technologies more and more to the into the infrastructure of the military is really alarming i wanted to go to the countries you went to or the stories you covered because I mean this is amazing the depth of your reporting from Kenya to Uruguay to Chile um you were talking about the use of water and I also want to ask you about nuclear power uh but in Chile um what is happening there around these data centers and the water they would use and the resistance to that yeah so Chile has an interesting history in that it's been under it was under a dictatorship for a very long time and so during that time most public resources were privatized including water but because of an anomaly there's one community in the greater Santiago metropolitan region that actually still has access to a public freshwater resource that services both that community as well as the rest of the country in emergency situations that is the exact community that Google chose to try to put a data center in and they proposed for their data center to use a thousand times more fresh water than that community used annually and it would be free and it you know I have no idea that is a great question but what the community told me was they weren't even paying taxes for this because they they believed based on reading the documentation that the taxes that Google was paying was in fact to where they had registered their offices their administrative offices not where they were putting down the data center so they were not seeing any benefit from this data center directly to that community and they were seeing no checks placed on the fresh water that this data center would have been allowed to extract and so these activists said &quot;Wait a minute absolutely not we're not going to allow this data center to come in unless they give us a legitimate reason for why it benefits us.&quot; And so they started doing boots on the ground activism pushing back knocking on every single one of their neighbors doors handing out flyers to the community telling them this company is taking our freshwater resources without giving us anything in return and so they escalated so dramatically that it escalated to Google Chile it escalated to Google Mountain View which by the way then sent representatives to Chile that only spoke English but then it eventually escalated to the Chilean government and the Chilean government now has roundts where they ask these community residents and the company representatives and representatives from the government to come together to actually discuss how to make data center development more beneficial to the community the activists say it is the fight is not over just because they've been invited to the table doesn't mean that everything is suddenly better they need to stay vigilant they need to continue scrutinizing these projects but thus far they've been able to block this project for four to five years and have gained that seat at the table and how is it that these uh western companies in essence are exploiting labor in the global south you go into something called data annotation firms what what are those yeah so because AI modern day AI systems are trained on massive amounts of data and they're sc that's scraped from the internet you can't actually pump that data directly into your AI model because there are a lot of things within within that data it's heavily polluted it needs to be cleaned it needs to be annotated so this is where data annotation firms come in these are middleman firms that hire contract labor to provide to these AI companies to do that kind of data preparation and open AI when it was starting to think about commercializing its products and thinking about let's put text generation machines that can spew any kind of text into the hands of millions of users they realized they needed to have some kind of content moderation they needed to develop a filter that would wrap around these models and prevent these models from actually spewing racist hateful and harmful speech to users that would not make a very good commercially viable product and so they contracted these middleman firms in Kenya where the Kenyan workers had to read through reams of the worst text on the internet as well as AI generated text where OpenAI was prompting its own AI models to imagine the worst text on the internet and then telling these Kenyan workers to detail to categorize them in detailed taxonomies of is this sexual content is this violent content how graphic is that violent content in order to teach its filter all the different categories of content it had to block and this is incredibly uncommon form of labor there are lots of other different types of contract labor that they use but these workers they're paid a few bucks an hour if at all and just like the era of social media these content moderators are left very deeply psychologically traumatized and ultimately there is no real philosophy behind why these workers are paid a couple bucks an hour and have their lives destroyed and why AI researchers who also contribute to these models are paid million-doll compensation packages simply because they sit in Silicon Valley in OpenAI's offices that is the logic of Empire and that hearkens back to my title Empire of AI so let's go back to your title Empire of AI the subtitle dreams and nightmares in Sam Alman's Open AI so tell us the story of Sam Alman and what Open AI is all about right through to the deal he just made in the Gulf when President Trump uh Sam Alman and Elon Musk were there alman is very much a product of Silicon Valley his career was first as a founder of a startup and then as the president of Y Combinator which is one of the most famous startup accelerators in Silicon Valley and then the CEO of OpenAI and there's no coincidence that OpenAI ended up introducing the world to the scale at all cost approach to AI development because that is the way that Silicon Valley has operated in the entire time that Altman came up in it and so he is a very strategic person he is incredibly good at telling stories about the future and painting these sweeping visions that investors and employees want to be a part of and so early on at YC he identified that AI would be one of the trends that could take off and he was trying to build a portfolio of different investments and different initiatives to place himself in the center of various different trends depending on which one took off he was investing in quantum computing he was investing in nuclear fusion he was investing in self-driving cars and he was developing a fundamental AI research lab ultimately the AI research lab was the ones that started accelerating really quickly so he makes himself the CEO of that company um and and originally he started it as a nonprofit to try and position it as a counter to forprofit driven incentives in Silicon Valley but within one and a half years opening eyes executives identified that if they wanted to be the lead in this space they had to go for this scale at all cost approach and had to should be in quotes they thought that they had to do this there are actually many other ways to develop AI and to have progress in AI that does not take this approach but once they decided that they realized the bottleneck was capital it just so happens Sam Alman is a once in a generation fundraising talent he created this new structure nesting a for-profit arm within the nonprofit to become this fundraising vehicle for the tens of billions and ultimately hundreds of billions that they needed to pursue the approach that they decided on and that is how we ultimately get to present day OpenAI which is one of the most capitalistic companies in the history of Silicon Valley continuing to raise hundreds of billions and and Altman has joked even trillions to produce a technology that ultimately has a middling economic impact thus far and uh we only have about a minute left but the relationship between Altman and other rivals like like Google or Elon Musk it is accelerating the development of this technology that again I I mentioned has this middling impact we've seen through the history of OpenAI that all of the former executives that have left have created their own rivals so Elon Musk was one of the original co-founders created XAI ilia Sudskyver was the chief scientist created safe super intelligence mirror Morati was the former chief technology officer created thinking machines lab all of them are now competing to try and dominate this technology and try and make it in their own image and finally this um regulation within the so-called big beautiful bill that says AI can't be regulated by states for a decade this is absolutely going to enshrine the impunity of Silicon Valley into law i mean I call this these empires of AI because they are already quickly becoming the apex predator in the ecosystem able to act in their self-interest and that bill if passed would certainly codify that well we're going to do a part two posted online at democracynow.org karen How is author of Empire of AI Dreams and Nightmares and Sam Alman's Open AI tune in tomorrow on Democracy Now when we speak with the

LIVING WITH THE CONSEQUENCES. &gt;&gt; OF MUSK'S. &gt;&gt; TIME IN THE ADMINISTRATION. &gt;&gt; AND WE COULD BE. FOR SOME TIME, WHICH IS. &gt;&gt; WHY WE. &gt;&gt; NEED TO KEEP FOCUSING ON IT. &gt;&gt; AND TALKING ABOUT IT. I MEAN, REMEMBER. &gt;&gt; ELON MUSK. &gt;&gt; IS A MAN WITH A VENDETTA. &gt;&gt; EVEN MORE. SO NOW, A MAN IN. &gt;&gt; OPEN WARFARE WITH THE. &gt;&gt; PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND NOW HIS. &gt;&gt; STAFF HAS OBTAINED ACCESS. &gt;&gt; TO THE MOST SENSITIVE. &gt;&gt; PERSONAL DATA. &gt;&gt; OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. I MEAN, WHEN THAT 24 YEAR OLD FORMER SPACEX INTERN IS COMBING THROUGH THE SENSITIVE DATA, WHICH HE MAY BE NOW, MAYBE NEXT WEEK, WHO DOES. HE THINK HE'S WORKING FOR. &gt;&gt; THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR HIS OLD BOSS. &gt;&gt; ELON MUSK? I HONESTLY DON'T. &gt;&gt; KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. AND THAT IS A VERY FRIGHTENING PLACE TO BE. HERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION. WHAT PROTECTIONS DO WE HAVE THAT THIS DATA. IS NOT GOING TO WIND UP BEING FED INTO ELON MUSK'S AI PROGRAM? &gt;&gt; I MEAN, THAT'S A REAL CONCERN THAT ONE FORMER GOVERNMENT. &gt;&gt; OFFICIAL TESTIFIED ABOUT IN THIS. &gt;&gt; CASE. &gt;&gt; SAYING, QUOTE, IF SOCIAL SECURITY DATA HAS BEEN INTEGRATED INTO AN AI TOOL. &gt;&gt; OWNED BY ELON MUSK, THIS WOULD. &gt;&gt; CREATE AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE AND ALSO POSE SIGNIFICANT PRIVACY AND SECURITY RISKS FOR. THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. YOU THINK. VERY MUCH. &gt;&gt; IT WILL. &gt;&gt; THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; IS THAT ELON MUSK AND HIS COMPANIES WERE ALREADY SIGNIFICANTLY ENMESHED IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. &gt;&gt; BEFORE TRUMP TOOK OVER. &gt;&gt; NOW, TRUMP. &gt;&gt; HAS GIVEN MUSK AND HIS MINIONS. &gt;&gt; EXTRAORDINARY NEW ACCESS TO. &gt;&gt; EVEN BROADER SWATHS OF THE GOVERNMENT. AND AS THEIR FEUD. &gt;&gt; ESCALATES, MUSK. &gt;&gt; MAY HAVE FEWER AND. &gt;&gt; FEWER REASONS TO TREAD CAREFULLY AT ALL. &gt;&gt; THE NEW YORKER'S RONAN. &gt;&gt; FARROW HAS BEEN COVERING THE PROBLEMATIC RELATIONSHIP. THAT'S ONE WAY OF. &gt;&gt; PUTTING IT. &gt;&gt; BETWEEN MUSK'S. BUSINESS EMPIRE. &gt;&gt; AND OUR FEDERAL. &gt;&gt; GOVERNMENT FOR YEARS. I MEAN, BACK IN. &gt;&gt; 2023, LONG. BEFORE MUSK HAD EVEN ENDORSED. &gt;&gt; TRUMP. &gt;&gt; RONAN FARROW PUBLISHED A DETAILED. REPORT ON THIS VERY TOPIC, AND. &gt;&gt; HE'S. &gt;&gt; BEEN PUSHING THE PUBLIC TO VIEW MUSK'S RISE THROUGH THAT EXACT. &gt;&gt; LENS. &gt;&gt; LENS EVER SINCE. &gt;&gt; IN MY VIEW, THE REAL STORY HERE ISN'T JUST ABOUT MUSK. &gt;&gt; IT'S ABOUT A MODEL. &gt;&gt; OF POWER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S. &gt;&gt; FACILITATED HIS. &gt;&gt; RISE AND HOW PUBLIC. &gt;&gt; INSTITUTIONS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING. &gt;&gt; REPLACED BY. &gt;&gt; PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS. &gt;&gt; OPERATING WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY. &gt;&gt; IT'S ABOUT. &gt;&gt; WHY WE'VE. &gt;&gt; BUILT. &gt;&gt; A SYSTEM. &gt;&gt; WHERE SOMEONE. &gt;&gt; LIKE HIM. &gt;&gt; EFFECTIVELY SUBSTITUTES FOR THE STATE, WITHOUT. &gt;&gt; THE CHECKS. &gt;&gt; THAT. &gt;&gt; GENERALLY COME. &gt;&gt; WITH PUBLIC POWER. &gt;&gt; JOINING ME. &gt;&gt; NOW IS RONAN FARROW. &gt;&gt; HE'S AN. &gt;&gt; INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER FOR THE NEW YORKER. &gt;&gt; HE'S REPORTED EXTENSIVELY. &gt;&gt; ON ELON MUSK'S RISE TO POWER. HE'S ALSO. &gt;&gt; REPORTED EXTENSIVELY. &gt;&gt; ABOUT HOW DATA CAN BE WEAPONIZED AGAINST AMERICAN CITIZENS. &gt;&gt; RONAN. I REREAD YOUR 2023 PIECE THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; AND THERE. &gt;&gt; IS SO MUCH IN. THERE THAT IT INCLUDES WARNING SIGNS. IT INCLUDES REALLY. &gt;&gt; A. &gt;&gt; BETTER UNDERSTANDING THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT FOR ALMOST ANYBODY TRYING TO DIGEST THIS ONE. I WANT. &gt;&gt; TO TALK TO YOU. &gt;&gt; ALL ABOUT THAT, BUT I. &gt;&gt; ALSO WANTED TO. &gt;&gt; START BY. &gt;&gt; ASKING YOU ABOUT THE SUPREME. &gt;&gt; COURT RULING THAT THAT HAPPENED JUST THIS AFTERNOON. IT'S GOING TO ALLOW D.O.J. UNFETTERED ACCESS TO. &gt;&gt; DATA AT THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION. &gt;&gt; AS I MENTIONED, YOU'VE ALSO DONE A LOT OF REPORTING ON THE WEAPONIZATION OF DATA. WHAT WHERE DOES YOUR MIND GO FIRST ON WHAT THAT MEANS? &gt;&gt; WILL YOU. &gt;&gt; MAKE. EXACTLY THE RIGHT POINT? &gt;&gt; DATA CAN. &gt;&gt; BE WEAPONIZED. THERE IS. &gt;&gt; A. &gt;&gt; REASON WHY PRIVACY LAW. &gt;&gt; EXISTS, WHY. &gt;&gt; THIS IS A REALLY. &gt;&gt; IMPORTANT BODY OF. CASES THAT. &gt;&gt; THE SUPREME. &gt;&gt; COURT HAS RULED ON OVER. &gt;&gt; THE. &gt;&gt; YEARS. &gt;&gt; AND WHY WE'VE SEEN INTERNATIONALLY. WHEN YOU AGGREGATE DATA AND YOU PUT IT INTO HANDS WITH LITTLE OVERSIGHT, IT CAN AND VERY OFTEN WILL BE ABUSED. I MEAN, I'VE REPORTED ON THAT IN MANY PLACES AROUND THE WORLD. BUT JUST TO TAKE AN EXAMPLE OF A CURRENT SUPERPOWER, WE'VE SEEN HOW CHINA HAS CENTRALIZED DATA IN AN UNRESTRICTED WAY AND USED THAT TO CREATE A SURVEILLANCE APPARATUS THAT REALLY HAS BEEN USED TO TARGET ETHNIC MINORITIES. YOU CAN TAKE THIS KIND OF PERSONAL DATA, WHICH INCLUDES HEALTH DETAILS, MENTAL HEALTH DETAILS, FINANCIAL DETAILS, AND YOU CAN USE IT TO TARGET PEOPLE, TO COME AFTER PEOPLE, TO CATEGORIZE PEOPLE AND TAKE ACTION AGAINST THEM, DENY THEM RIGHTS. SO THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF, AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THE MINORITY IN THE COURT TODAY REALLY SOUNDING ALARM ABOUT THIS. YOU KNOW, JUSTICE JACKSON SAYING THE COURT HAS LOST ITS WAY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PRIVACY PROPONENTS ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT FOR A VERY LONG TIME. THEN YOU COME TO THE HANDS. WE'RE PUTTING IT IN DOGE. THIS IS AN UNPROVEN AD HOC ORGANIZATION. THERE ARE STILL UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS LEGAL STATUS. THERE'S NOT A LOT BY WAY OF CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT OR RESTRICTIONS. THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS STAFF. A LOT OF THE DOJ'S STAFF IS HIRED UNDER THE SAME STATUS. ELON MUSK WAS HIRED UNDER AS SPECIAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, BASICALLY MEANING THEY COULD FAST TRACK THE HIRING OF REALLY YOUNG, REALLY INEXPERIENCED PEOPLE. THIS OPENS UP A WHOLE LOT OF RISKS AND VULNERABILITIES, WHICH WE CAN GET INTO. &gt;&gt; NO QUESTION. &gt;&gt; ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; WE JUST TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THAT. I MEAN, AND ONE OF THE GOALS OF DOGE HAS. ALWAYS BEEN TO SCOOP. &gt;&gt; UP DATA. &gt;&gt; I MEAN, THEY HAVEN'T. &gt;&gt; MADE ANY SECRET OF THAT. &gt;&gt; I SPOKE WITH SOMEONE RECENTLY FROM THE WHO USED TO WORK IN THE IRS, WHO SAID SOMEONE FROM DOGE TOLD HER IN A MEETING THAT DATA IS THE MISSION, THAT GETTING DATA IS THE MISSION. I MEAN, YOU'RE AN EXCELLENT INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER. YOU'VE MENTIONED SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU YOU WANT MORE INFORMATION. &gt;&gt; ON, BUT. &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE WATCHING, OR WHAT ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU THINK PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; SHOULD. &gt;&gt; BE ASKING ABOUT THIS ACCESS AND WHAT THEY COULD BE DOING WITH IT? &gt;&gt; THE POINT YOU MADE THAT DATA IS THE MISSION IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE FOR ALL OF US TO SIT WITH, JUST AS CITIZENS CONCERNED ABOUT ALL OF OUR SAFETY AND FREEDOM. SILICON VALLEY HAS SHOWED US THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN, THEY ARE ON A MISSION TO AGGREGATE DATA ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS IN ORDER TO MANIPULATE AND MONETIZE HUMAN BEHAVIOR. WE ARE COMING TO A RECKONING ABOUT HOW SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS DID THAT. WE ARE STILL TO COME TO A RECKONING ABOUT HOW AI COMPANIES WILL DO THAT. ELON MUSK AND HIS STAKE AND ROLE IN DOGE CONNECTS DIRECTLY TO ELON MUSK'S STAKE AND ROLE IN GROK. THROUGH HIS COMPANY, XAI. THERE IS EVIDENCE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TRANSPARENCY ON THIS. WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS, BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT HE IS FEEDING A LOT OF THIS SENSITIVE DATA INTO HIS OWN AI PRODUCTS, USING THEM TO TRAIN HIS OWN AI PRODUCTS. WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF THAT DATA MAY BE EXITING WITH HIM, MAY SHOW UP IN HIS SYSTEMS IN YEARS TO COME, WHICH ARE SYSTEMS THAT ACCORD TO HIS PRIVATE INTERESTS, WHICH ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE INTERESTS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. AND ALL THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE THAT DATA COULD BE AND GO WITH SOME OF THESE OFFICIALS STILL IN THE GOVERNMENT IS A HUGE, HUGE, HUGE ONE. YOU DID. I MENTIONED I REREAD THE EXTENSIVE PROFILE. EVERYBODY ON OUR TEAM REREAD IT TODAY ABOUT. IT'S BASICALLY ABOUT HOW ENTANGLED MUSK HAD BECOME AT THAT POINT IN TIME WITH THE NATIONAL SECURITY APPARATUS OF THE UNITED STATES. IN SOME WAYS. &gt;&gt; HOW POWERFUL. &gt;&gt; HE HE HAD BECOME. I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, THAT ENTANGLEMENT HAS HAS ONLY GROWN DEEPER IN MANY, MANY WAYS. I MEAN, AND YESTERDAY, MUSK THREATENED TO DECOMMISSION THE SPACECRAFT THAT BROUGHT BACK TWO STRANDED ASTRONAUTS. UNCLEAR WHERE THAT SITS AT THIS POINT, BUT THAT WAS A THREAT. KNOWING AND FOLLOWING AND INVESTIGATING AND REPORTING ON HIM AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE. IF HE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE THINGS PAINFUL FOR TRUMP, AND REALLY MORE IMPORTANTLY, FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, GIVEN ALL OF HIS COMPANIES AND ENTANGLEMENTS. &gt;&gt; WHAT ELSE. &gt;&gt; COULD HE DO? &gt;&gt; THERE IS A BIGGER PICTURE HERE, WHICH IS PART OF WHAT I WAS WRITING ABOUT OF WANING GOVERNMENT POWER AND OF RISING PRIVATE POWER. THERE ARE A LOT OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL FACTORS THAT HAVE LED UP TO THIS POINT, BUT WE ARE IN A STATE NOW WHERE THERE ARE KEY SERVICES THAT ONCE WOULD HAVE BEEN A GUARANTEE FROM THE STATE THAT ARE IN THE HANDS OF PRIVATE, UNACCOUNTABLE BILLIONAIRES AND PRIVATE, UNACCOUNTABLE COMPANIES THAT THEY RUN. YOU MENTIONED THE THREAT TO DECOMMISSION THE DRAGON CRAFT. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE HAVE TO FERRY ASTRONAUTS FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION BACK TO EARTH. THERE IS LITERALLY A POSSIBILITY THAT IF HE WERE TO ACTUALLY DO THAT, AND IT DOES SEEM LIKE SOMEONE TWEETED AT HIM AND SAID MAYBE NOT, AND HE SAID, OKAY, OKAY, FINE, I WON'T. BUT THIS IS THE THRESHOLD FOR DECISION MAKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT COULD LITERALLY LEAVE HUMAN BEINGS STRANDED AND FACING DEATH. AND WE HAVEN'T BUILT IN REDUNDANCY. AND WHAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WERE TELLING ME EVEN A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WAS, HEY, WE'RE ALARMED BECAUSE THERE IS AN ERRATIC PERSON WHO HAS HIS OWN COMPLICATED INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCES AND BUSINESS INTERESTS, WHO IS CONTROLLING KEY FUNCTIONALITY THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DEPEND ON. AND THAT'S NOT ISOLATED TO ELON MUSK. WE ARE SEEING THAT ACROSS THE BOARD. WE ARE SEEING COMPANIES LIKE PALANTIR RUN BY ANOTHER BILLIONAIRE MUSK DONOR, PETER THIEL, PLAY A ROLE IN AGGREGATING AND CENTRALIZING DATA ACROSS THE US GOVERNMENT, AGAIN BEING GIVEN UNPRECEDENTED ACCESS AND POWER TO TOOLS THAT REALLY CAN BE USED TO TARGET AND HARM PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; RONAN FARROW. &gt;&gt; I HOPE. &gt;&gt; YOU WILL COME BACK AND TALK WITH ME ABOUT PALANTIR AND PETER THIEL AND ALL OF THAT, BECAUSE DATA AND THEIR ACCESS TO DATA AND ALL OF THESE BILLIONAIRES IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT STORY TO FOLLOW RIGHT NOW, AND FEW PEOPLE KNOW" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="the end of President Trump's friendship with Elon Musk was never really a question of if but when and now we know the answer except maybe we don't for all we know they could be back together before summer meanwhile in the real world Russia's war against Ukraine grows more dire iran gets closer to nuclear breakout israel slides further toward crisis and at home the rule of law is in real danger next this is Washington Week with the Atlantic corporate funding provided by Consumer Cellular additional funding is provided by Coup and Patricia Euan through the Euan Foundation committed to bridging cultural differences in our communities sandra and Carl Delay Magnus Rose Hershel and Andy Shrieves Robert and Susan Rosenbomb the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and by contributions to your PBS station from viewers like you thank you once again from the David M rubenstein studio at Weta in Washington editor-inchief of The Atlantic and moderator Jeffrey Goldberg good evening and welcome to Washington Week i want everyone to know that I take the Trump Musk breakup drama seriously in part because Donald Trump gave his former best friend Elon Musk access to enormous amounts of secret government data and there's no predicting what Musk could do with it but the world at large is in a state of seemingly permanent tumult and so it's a good time for a general checkup my guest tonight is Thomas Freriedman a three-time Pulitzer Prizewinning journalist and foreign affairs columnist for the New York Times tom thanks for coming in for our seemingly annual annual checkup um the uh I I I want to ask you about this Elon Musk uh business um and maybe we can put it into some serious context before I before we we jump to that I want to read something that uh my colleague Charlie Warzel writing in the Atlantic this morning um had to say uh the sun rises every morning spring turns to summer water is wet Donald Trump and Elon Musk's relationship has ended with a post about Jeffrey Epstein and then of course you know he he tweeted &quot;These guys really do escalate quickly.&quot; Um uh Trump Musk tweeted &quot;Time to drop the really big bomb real Donald Trump is in the Epstein files that is the real reason they have not been made public have a nice day DJT um so put this into some kind of context that makes sense for ordinary people what is going on here well I I confess Jeff on the way over I thought you'd ask me about this and um the first thing that popped into my mind was the Iran Iraq war what did we say about the Iran Iraq war if only both sides could lose okay so uh there's no hero in this story um what it really is is the latest manifestation to me of the central truth of the Trump 2 administration trump one was surrounded by buffers trump 2 was surrounded by amplifiers and therefore stuff that used to begin at the Mara Largo bar and then get muffled in the Oval Office now goes from the Mara Larago bar right to the Oval Office right to you and me and whether it's what he feels about you know Musk or his role he wants him in the government but to me the whole must phenomenon is part of a much deeper and more disturbing phenomena from an American citizen point of view which is nothing here is modeled nothing here is stress tested everything is a riff the country is being run like the Trump organization today not like the United States of America and so as a result of that Jeeoff there's no second order thinking all right what's second order thinking i'm going to put on tariffs okay uh 10% across the board including Canada and Mexico even though I'm violating an agreement I signed with them when I was president last time uh second order thinking is oh my god you mean the Ford F150 only onethird of its parts are made in America um and the other two-thirds now are going to be tariffed i will bet any amount of money no one told him that and that's true now of everything and so you know for the first trimester of this administration you think the first three months all of this was kind of entertaining but now he's running up against a wall it turns out he can't solve the Russia Ukraine war overnight turns out tariff wars aren't easy to win uh turns out you know Musk is not going to you know do the revolution in the government form turns out courts sometimes don't like what you do exactly and so I think the second you know uh three months are going to get very interesting as he runs into this reality and I I don't know where it's going to go but I it it leaves me disqu that's interesting i was think as you were saying this I was thinking about John Kelly General John Kelly being uh and along with General Mattis and and others uh being those buffers or filters uh there's literally no one in the White House or in the whole system who does anything but amplify is that fair to say yeah I mean I I just don't Treasury Secretary I I I just don't see it you I mean yeah you hear these stories that the Treasury Secretary had to wait you know for um uh one of the other you know economic guys Peter Navaro to be out of the room for him to come in to try to change the tariffs this is crazy stuff now I happen to be in China twice in the last six months i've watched a lot of this from China actually and and when you see it from China I mean they say a couple things one is you know we are never going to put our president in a situation like Zalinsky in the Oval Office where he can be embarrassed number one the second thing they say Jeff is that this isn't cute we just saw Donald Trump tear up a trade agreement that Donald Trump made with America's two closest neighbors and allies Canada and Mexico what is the value therefore of a trade agreement with him now and um you know the Chinese uh uh these are these are you like them or hate them these are serious people you know and they are not spontaneous no exactly so when Trump put the 147 um 44% tariff on them they said &quot;Uh you talking to me you talking to me do you realize that we control 90% of the rare earths that make the magnets that go in every car you make do you realize that?&quot; Which he didn't which is why Ford and GM and Stalantis had to announce this week we may actually have to uh curb some production because we're running out of Chinese magnets right stay stay with uh stay with this Musk question for a minute and and and this this this this issue of Musk as a as a radical isotope in a kind of way he's been given access to government secrets across the board in order to cut government agencies through the Doge operation um that seems like an operational security nightmare if he goes rogue surprising to you i mean how h where does this where does this relationship go can they bring it back from the brink is there anybody who's trying to bring it back from the brink or is this just more chaos well you know I think the best way to understand this is not with the analogy of political science but World Wrestling Federation right and and those uh uh in World Wrestling Federation there are breakups and comeback and new teams and and and whatnot i I put this all in the area of entertainment you know not in in something ser we're dealing with two extremely unstable characters but what really is is more important is what's the wider world audience saying what's the wider world audience saying they're saying you know for for all of our lifetime Jeff sort of post-war America if I had an extra dollar and I'm a foreigner I'm going to put it in America if I have a extra you know brain power and and a and a brainy person I'm going to study in America and if I have a little extra dollop of trust I'm going to trust America now you take all three of those things away and you end up with a a very different relationship between America and the world okay so I have to ask you and by the way it's interesting right miami is Miami because it's a safe place for people money harvard is or was Harvard because people want to come from around the world and and so on and the United Nations is headquartered in New York you know you know I mean everybody for for a reason we were the we were the we wrote the the rules of the road for the post-war international order so the question is you're an ally or an adversary and you're looking at at at this uh clown show by the way on the weekend that marks the 81st anniversary of D-Day noting just for the record um you you put yourselves in the shoes of an ally and adversary are you thinking that this is a midlife crisis America's having um a nervous breakdown or is this some kind of weird terminal illness um you know I don't know which all I know is I'm completely disoriented if I'm an ally and I'm completely disoriented if I'm the foreign affairs columnist for the New York Times because I've never covered this world and you know um uh our friend you know Fred Zakari wrote a book um uh uh 15 years ago or so called the postamerican world and Freed's book was really about a change in relative power right you know uh between that there'll be the rise of Brazil and India and other countries so we won't have as much power as we had before what really if if I were writing a book today uh Jeff would be called the post America world okay that's what I'm really worried about because America stood for some things it stood for universal values uh it stood for stability it stood for the rule of law it was a loyal ally we were always against the dictator versus the people seeking freedom what really worries me that at the end of my you know career basically I'm I'm dealing with the post America world the America I grew up and loved and was devoted to and as someone who lived abroad like you have know how important that America is to the whole world american optimism and stability makes the world go around you you take us out of the equation it's not like anybody else comes in i'm sorry you have you have a no superpower world right you know right but but come back to this is this do you think that this instability that we're experiencing emotional political all the instabilities that we're experiencing could it be temporary or is this can we not come back reputationally to start well the thing I'm worried about most is that and it may seem like a simple thing but you know uh Donald Trump came in and he told all the Democrats on the board of the Kennedy Center you're gone now traditionally every president sort of left the other party's people there and then he put in his people so when you enter into a kind of zero sum politics now in America when you fire the head of the an NASA uh after you appointed him because he made a donation a tiny don donation to a Democrat um you're into a kind of politics that I grew up with in the Middle East what was that rule or die okay you're either in power or you're it's zero sum okay i'm on top or I'm in and and so there's a book about African dictators called It's Our Turn to Eat you know and we're just going to eat everything so then no no if you're a Democrat and and guess what we do have God willing if we still have elections rotations in power do they come in now and treat all the Republicans in these traditional bipartisan forum you know the same way and if that happens we're really off to the races then the whole thing just starts to What country does that remind you of that vision you know you you you you I mean so many dictatorships just in general that I' I've I've covered over the years that's what you come in you wipe out all the other guys people well that's not how we do things in this country right right let's talk about a country that's not democratic for a second um you know the the I I want you to watch this it's the latest analysis by President Trump of the current state of play uh in in Russia's war against Ukraine and it's he's talking about Putin here he got hit he's been doing hitting so I understand it but he got hit hard and I don't think he's playing games i said &quot;Uh President maybe you're going to have to keep fighting and suffering a lot because both sides are suffering before you pull them apart before they're able to be pulled apart.&quot; But it's a pretty known uh analogy you you have two kids they fight fight fight sometimes you let them fight for a little while you see it in hockey you see it in sports not to Henry Kissinger but he's trying to impose his own real politique understanding of what is he misunderstanding from your perspective Jeff do you know how flatout crazy that is i mean that's like saying well you know I mean Hitler and Poland they fight they fight they come back you know what I mean um Trump came in and said I can end this war all right um uh there's one way to end this war you say to Vladimir Putin um if you don't stop the war um uh and and we agree to the ceasefire terms I dictate we are bringing Ukraine into NATO in 30 days which part of that sentence don't you understand now you want to mess with me test me that's how you end this war what you just heard of Donald Trump that sounded like a commentator on Fox TV he's not that commentator he's president of United States well he hit him and he hit them well he hit this guy invaded a country he's basically tried to rape a country that's what Putin did okay and the Ukrainians with incredible bravery stood up and defended basically the Western Alliance on something that's very important because if Ukraine were able to join the European Union Jeff then you have a Europe that's really whole and free that's actually a big deal for Europe and for us and this guy's talking about it like it's some schoolyard fight and they're morally equal it's nuts and it's it's disgusting right is there any issue from a foreign affairs columnist perspective is there any issue in which Trump is not transactional have you ever seen Have you ever seen a sign of um what we would think of as in a bipartisan way American idealism out of Trump um none comes to mind what I would say I where I thought you might be going is um uh you know some things are also true even if Donald Trump believes them and by the way his transactionalism sometimes can also be an advantage for instance I'm glad he's sitting down with the Iranians let's see what you got i'm glad he told the Syrian president um uh I'm going to give you a reputation to live up to i didn't mind him talking directly to Hamas if I can get the hostages out so there is that transactional side of him that I think could be an advantage but if not grounded in any moral you know framework of what we stand for as a country and what we've always stood for um if it's just a kind of free floating thing it it becomes very very dangerous yeah in in his non-sophisticated analysis of the current state of play uh in Russian and Ukraine uh he didn't really talk about the drone attack that Ukraine launched on Russian aerial assets deep in inside Russia does that change this war um you know you know Jeeoff I'd say two things and again it's part of the craziness of this moment let's start at 30,000 ft and then come down to the battlefield at 30,000 feet you and I are having this discussion on the eve of the greatest technological revolution in human history we are very close to uh birthing a new species not a new machine a new artificially intelligent species um and it's going to be with us under some sometime while Trump is president it is not going to change one thing it's going to change everything we are not talking about that at all so that's I would say number one under that technological revolution um and you know one of the things they say about AI it'll actually be mankind's last invention because once we invent that it will invent everything else that's going to be a big deal under that though we're seeing a revolution in military affairs basically Ukraine um spent $20,000 to to knock out you know uh $20 million planes $20,000 that was probably because they couldn't get Costco online you know from Kiev and they had to buy them from Amazon you know um so the the the asymmetric warfare world that we're entering now um wow i mean if you're the US Navy and you're sitting with 12 aircraft carriers and you just recovered from the fact that the Houthis you know you lost an FA Hornet cuz you had to swerve your aircraft carrier and the and the plane fell off the back because you were getting out of way of not not a sterling moment in naval history because you're avoiding a Hooty missile a bunch of guys in flip-flops basically um in a country that's bas water starved the asymmetry we're going to be dealing with right now um uh I think we have we these these events are really disturbing and and going to require a huge revolution in how we think about military as I'm listening to you about AI AGI and and drone warfare I I'm just thinking that the the the preoccupation this weekend in America is the emotionally fearal relationship between this ketamine taking billionaire and our reality TV star president and it's like there there's something that's so deeply unserious about Yeah and I think I think it's been true of our country that basically everything became politics um and so we don't have just ESPN now we have PSBN you know sort of politics sports network right and it's it's it's a testament to the the underlying strength of our country Jeff that our economy goes on we still invent amazing stuff and we we think we can afford this and and you know what Jeff we we can't afford it until we can right let me pivot uh finally toward the Middle East um and and ask you this and and you know I've read your recent columns on this subject you're a severe critic of Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli prime minister and the way he's conducted this war and of Hamas which is No no no and I want and I want to get there but what I don't understand from reading you is this so Hamas and its allies seek the annihilation of Israel they state that it's not a secret yeah um how does Israel end the war without totally defeating Hamas in other words In other words is it I understand the criticisms but h how do they how do they coexist in a with a neighbor who won't allow coexistence um they don't um I'm all for Israel completely defeating Hamas militarily uh what I am not for are the three alternative choices that u Israel had after that defeat that Netanyahu refuses to make one choice is we defeat them and we Israel the Jewish state occupy Gaza forever that will be the moral and economic end of Israel another choice is we just leave and we turn it into Mogadishu that will also be terrible for Israel the third choice the one I favor is you create an Arab international peacekeeping force in partnership with the Palestinian Authority and over time you build an alternative to Hamas i'm what my criticism of Netanyahu is not fighting Hamas um not even crushing Hamas it's not creating any alternative Palestinian structure and therefore leaving the Jewish people with the choice Jeff of permanently occupying Gaza or having Mogadishu there and permanently occupying Gaja we know what that's going to do that's going to create a world where your grandchildren and mine are going to grow up in a world where they will learn what it is to be Jewish in a world where the Jewish state is a pariah and that is a disaster and that's what I'm fighting but it there is a double standard obviously in in the world um when it comes to judging Israel's behavior um but I guess you're just saying that you have to live with that that's the world as it is that's the world as it is um you quoted a hood Oldm merit the former prime minister of of Israel a center-right prime minister saying that Israel is committing war crimes and this is why he needs the the war to start do you agree that Israel is committing war crimes you know I have not entered into that whole linguistic fight because my position has been from the very beginning I'm here to do one thing figure out how to end this thing you know I'm old Jeff 71 i covered the Hama massacre so chhatila the American embassy bombing i've covered all of them okay and I said to myself I'm not going to be the scorekeeper of this i'm focused on one thing not who shot who who did the worst thing to the because they all do terrible things at different times i want to figure out how to end it and that's where I put all my energy from the very very beginning and and my if you've read my stuff on Hamas it's the same thing what is Hamas's position today very simple we want a ceasefire and we want Israel out of Gaza oh really what did you have on October 6th before this war started that's what you had so you fought this whole war you allowed 40 50,000 people to be killed to get you back to where you started shame on you but I can't you know control them i can't figure them out all I know I am I I do believe that if we want to see a Jewish and democratic Israel that's what I do care about palestinians have to figure that out you've got to find a way to get out of Gaza in a way that will create also in partnership with the different Palestinian authorities let me ask you one last question because you're an expert on this for many decades several decades many sounds too dire uh what does Netanyahu not understand about American politics and about American Jewish politics well I think Netanyahu is shocked by what's going on here because Trump Netanyao always could go around any American president and now he can't because he's looking for the Republican base she's pulling that lever and it comes off in kind of looks like a little bit of a sucker thinking that Joe Biden was bad for Israel exactly you know it turns out there are other worse things right and what about um what does he need to understand about American Jews you know I I think what he doesn't understand about American Jews is that you know they're ready to be with him they want Israel that's successful democratic um and um uh if you they are really important to Israel standing in America and you abandon them for evangelical Christians you'll regret that one day right right well um it's enormously complicated as is Russia Ukraine as is everything and thank you for coming on and not talking about Elon Musk only because I'm I'm a little already I'm a little tired iran Iraqi war Iran Iraq war um we're going to have to leave it there um but I want

          <attvalue for="3" value="Support our work: https://democracynow.org/donate/sm-de...&#10;&#10;As President Trump finally unveils his global tariff plan — setting a baseline 10% tariff on all imported goods, with additional hikes apparently based on individual countries' trade balances with the United States — economists like our guest Richard Wolff warn it will have grave economic effects on American consumers and lead to a recession. Wolff says the Trump administration's tariff strategy is borne out of an ahistorical &quot;notion of the United States as a victim&quot; despite the fact that &quot;we have been one of the greatest beneficiaries in the last 50 years of economic wealth, particularly for people at the top.&quot; In response to the growing economic fortunes of the rest of the world and the associated decline in U.S. hegemony, Trump and his allies are &quot;striking out at other people&quot; in desperation and denial of an end to U.S. imperial dominance. &quot;[It's] not going to work,&quot; says Wolff.&#10;&#10;Democracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on over 1,500 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

          <attvalue for="7" value="this is democracyow democracynow.org the Warren Peace Report I'm Amy Goodman Global stock markets are tumbling after President Trump unveiled the biggest hike in global tariffs in modern US history including a 10% blanket tariff on all imported goods from about 185 countries In addition many US trading partners including the European Union China and Japan will see even higher tariffs China now faces a total 54% tariff Trump announced the plan during a speech in the Rose Garden at the White House My fellow Americans this is Liberation Day waiting for a long time April 2nd 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn the day America's destiny was reclaimed and the day that we began to make America wealthy again Going to make it wealthy good and wealthy For decades our country has been looted pillaged raped and plundered by nations near and far both friend and foe alike American steel workers auto workers farmers and skilled craftsmen We have a lot of them here with us today They really suffered gravely They watched in anguish as foreign leaders have stolen our jobs foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream The impact of Trump's tariffs are expected to be felt around the world While Trump claims the tariffs will boost the US economy many economists fear it could lead to a recession or worse Trump's trade war could also shift global alliances as countries seek new trading partners China Japan South Korea have already announced plans to increase trading ties and coordinate their response to Trump's tariffs We begin today's show with Richard Wolf professor of economics ammeritus University of Massachusetts Ammeris visiting professor in the graduate program in international affairs at the New School He's the founder of Democracy at Work and hosts a weekly national TV radio program called Economic Update The author of a number of books including most recently Understanding Capitalism and the Sickness is the System: When Capitalism Fails to Save Us from Pandemics or Itself Professor Wolf it's great to have you with us again Well start off by responding to and were you surprised shocked or do you you guess that well about 185 countries were going to have see increased or tariffs On the on the one hand we knew something like this was coming On the other hand the sweep and the scope of it does make you stop Mr Trump is right It is a changing moment in American history and world history But I think his representation of what's going on is completely fantastical and has only to do with the self-promotion uh that he is engaged in most of the time It was never foreigners who did it to us This notion of the United States is a victim We have been one of the greatest beneficiaries in the last 50 years of economic wealth particularly for people at the top just like him Uh it has nothing to do with foreigners taking advantage of us This attempt to make himself strong and powerful relative to others to blame the foreigner These are cheap shots that a a real president wouldn't do And there's the most important point The American economy is in trouble The American empire is in decline We don't want to discuss it in this country We engage in denial and instead we are striking out at other people a sad way of handling a decline The British Empire declined before us So did all the others We are now at that point We had a great 20th century 21st century is different You have to face those problems That's not being done What's being done is to say we have difficulties but they're all somebody else's fault and we're going to solve it by punishing them I would like to point out as you suggest quite rightly Amy that the rest of the world is not going to sit by The United States does not have the power it had in the 20th century It is not in the position it seems to imagine itself when the secretary of of the treasury added to Mr Trump's comments that he warned the rest of the world not to retaliate That would imply that if they do there would be escalation Yes he said there will be escalation Well nothing will guarantee more escalation than if they do nothing because then it's an invitation to Mr Trump to keep doing it as each of these efforts doesn't work Given how dramatic this was yesterday is it possible he was deciding this to the very last second as they put this off And um explain exactly You're a professor you're a teacher Most people don't even realize how tariffs work Okay A tariff is a tax It's just a particular tax that got that name It used to be called import duty All it means is when something comes into the United States that was produced outside and is brought in to be sold it has to pay a tax as literally as it crosses our border into our country It is paid by the American company that brings it in which may pass it on to the consumer Usually what happens and the tax goes to Uncle Sam It goes to Washington Mr Trump loved to suggest that tariffs were paid by the others a little bit like Mexico would pay for the wall Never happened It's not going to happen here either It's an American tax Is there something remarkable that clues you in to how big a change this is That the Republican party which has branded itself as the anti-ax party for a century is now imposing the most massive tax imaginable Why this big change because we have big big problems and this kind of slapping the rest of the world is an attempt to solve a little bit of them but it is not going to work because we don't have the power to do it anymore I want to go to UAW President Sean Feain uh who supports Trump's new tariff saying last week we applaud the Trump administration for stepping up to end the free trade disaster that's devastated workingclass communities for decades Fain spoke Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation We've seen over 90,000 manufacturing facilities leave the United States We've seen uh in the big three alone in the last 20 plus years 65 plants have closed Um you know and so look tariffs aren't the uh total solution Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to uh get these companies to do the right thing and and and and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here uh and and you know invest in the American workers if they're going to bring jobs back here You know they need to be life sustaining jobs where people can make a a good wage a living wage have adequate health care and have a retirement security and not have to work seven days a week or multiple jobs just to scrape to get by paycheck to paycheck Well while UAW President Sean Feain praised Trump's tariffs he also said he had great concerns about President Trump's move to eliminate contracts for 700,000 federal workers the firing of workers at the National Institute of Health and other agencies I was a bit disappointed I like John Fain many of us do But this was disappointing to say basically I will support the president because he does something that might help my union Even though Sean Feain knows as most economists do that if you put a tax on the goods coming in they will go up in price because we have to pay that tax now And that will lead to domestic producers able to raise their prices because their competitors from abroad are stuck with this tax So we expect a boost to inflation which is going to hurt the working class of this country in in a very serious way especially if it if it builds on itself which often happens when you do tariffs like this And I want to remind everyone including Sean Feain that that the auto workers also represent workers in places that need export markets that produce in America and sell abroad When those countries retaliate as they likely will we will lose export markets and that will mean fewer jobs And no one let me stress no one now knows whether the jobs lost from this trade war will be greater or smaller than any jobs that are gained It is a big risk being taken by Mr Trump And if it doesn't go well it'll be very bad for the American economy It will produce the recession folks are worried about because if the prices go up people buy less and that loses jobs When you look at all of this this is an incredibly risky effort to blame the world punish the world and then cross his fingers which is what he's doing hoping it comes out all right Reminds me of a fed a football metaphor This is a Hail Mary pass You throw it down the field you hope it bounces into your team's hands but that's all it is a long shot And it's a sign of how troubled the American economy now is If you can put this in the bigger picture uh talk about the tax cuts and how they fit into the tariffs the what is it something like 4 trillion dollars in tax cuts and who benefits and then talk about the other issues that President Trump keeps saying that they're not going to touch even though uh what many call his co-president Elon Musk whether he steps back from being you know giving speeches or not uh going after social security issues like Medicaid Let me start with the tax issue The biggest single thing that Trump did in his first presidency was the tax cut of of December 2017 And when that tax cut was written into law it had a sunset It expires this year 2025 If that is expiration is allowed to happen corporations and the rich who were the big bene beneficiaries back then will face a big tax cut He doesn't want to do that because that's his base That's his donor support He doesn't want to have those taxes go back up Well then what is he going to have to do If he keeps on spending and he doesn't let those taxes go back up he's going to have to borrow trillions as we have been doing He doesn't want to be the president who keeps borrowing trillions in part because the rest of the world is a major creditor of the United States and they're not going to continue to do it the way they have So he's in a jam He has to do something So his hope is to savage the expenditures in this country Look what he's doing Mr Musk stands there with a chainsaw to give us the clear implication I'm I'm going to solve the problem on the backs of the working class I'm firing them all I don't care what the rest of the working class suffers I'm going to fire all these people without notice without plan Calling this efficient is a silly joke An efficient process takes time takes experts You're not doing that You're just wholesale firing Calling that efficiency is an attempt to fool people but shouldn't make any difference Mr Trump is now in a jam He can't get out of this without in some way solving the problem that has been built up And there is no way other than the one he's doing because it's the last gasp of how to take away from the mass of the people the ability to borrow I mean let's be honest If you put a tariff you make everything coming in from abroad more expensive That means people will buy less of it They'll shrink their standard of living If American companies take advantage of the tariff which they always do by raising their prices that will also hurt the working class you are emiserating your workers in order to try to solve the problem you haven't solved before But here's the irony that may in the end come back to haunt us Europe has been unable to unify under the umbrella of American alliances The enmity of the United States is bringing Europe together better than the alliance was able to do And as you pointed out very important China Japan and South Korea with long histories of animosity and tension are getting together to cope with this Wow We are unifying the whole world If you want the big picture in my judgment after World War II George Kennan taught us about containment We're going to contain the Soviet Union The irony which the philosopher Hegel would enjoy we are becoming contained We are isolating ourselves The votes in the UN are the United States alone or the United States and Israel and two or three other countries the isolation politically the isolation now economically We are the rogue nation for the rest of the world We may not want it We may not agree but it doesn't really matter if that's how they perceive us And that's what's happening You talked about South Korea Japan and China joining together One of the biggest announcement of tax cuts was against Taiwan It's just a little more complicated for Taiwan to join that group And also and also another one was Vietnam which got a very heavy whack I mean is there no recognition of what the United States did to that country Maybe you wouldn't want to crush them with this kind of a thing after I as I'm saying this is a change This is a sign to the world that as the United States empire declines This is a nasty place that's going to you know gesture and thrash around doing damage everywhere as it copes with its own decline Former Greek finance minister Jiannis Varafakus recently wrote a piece headlined Donald Trump's economic master plan He wrote quote this is what his critics don't understand They mistakenly think he thinks that his tariffs will reduce America's trade deficit on their own He knows they won't Their utility comes from their capacity to shock foreign central bankers into reducing domestic interest rates Consequently the euro the yen and the uh remend will soften relative to the dollar This will cancel out the price hikes of goods imported into the US and leave the prices American consumers pay unaffected the tariff countries will be in effect paying for Trump's tariffs Do you agree with that Professor Wolf No Even though Giannis and I do a lot of work together so normally I I defer to him He's wonderful in his analysis I don't think this is correct Is it a possible outcome Yes You know we're in a situation let me put it this way tariffs are not new They've been around for hundreds of years uh if you teach a course in international economics which I've done you you tell students here are thousand books here are 5,000 articles we know and the answer is when you impose a tariff you don't know what the outcome is because it depends on everything else going on Interest rates exchange rates of currencies rising or falling economies around the world You can't know in advance It's a very risky thing Which is why for the last 50 years we have had administered by the US something called free trade or neoliberal or globalization All of that is over now The United States can't win anymore in that system So it is reverting to economic nationalism And that's a fundamental shift that throws the world It was the accepted wisdom for 50 years 50 the last 50 years not to do what Mr Trump is doing now If you want you can think that everybody who thought that way for 50 years was wrong and Mr Trump the genius is correct But that would be a long shot Better bet he's trying to save his own political life and he's trying to cope to his credit with a declining economy without having to admit that that's the case This won't end well it it normally doesn't And what we're going to see is the fighting against one another of the Europe block the Asian block the American block at a time when the United States is weaker than it has been economically and politically Look at the debacle in the Ukraine as well The misunderstanding that the Russians could turn to the Chinese and the Indians to cope with the costs of that war in a way that hadn't been calculated and as turning out to shape the outcome And it's not a question of which side you're on but just watching how it lines up That's the problem 30 seconds As you often talk about are you seeing this as the beginning of the end of American empire Yes I think we are already in 10 12 years of that decline It can't Here's a single best statistic If you add up the GDP you know the total output of goods and services in a year for a country of the United States and its major allies the G7 it's about 28% of global output If you do the same thing for China and the bricks it's about 35% They're already a bigger block of economic power than we are Every country in the world thinking about building a railroad or expanding its health program They used to send their people to Washington or London to get help They still do but when they're done they send the same team to Beijing New Delhi Sao Paulo and they often get a better deal The world is changing and the United States could cope but as with alcoholism you have to admit you have a problem before you're in a position to solve it We have a nation that does not yet want to face what this all adds up to" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="this is democracyow democracynow.org the Warren Peace Report i'm Amy Goodman we spend the rest of the hour with award-winning journalist and author Naomi Klene she has a major new piece out co-authored with Astra Taylor for the Guardian newspaper it's headlined the rise of end times fascism it looks at the apocalyptic fervor of the far right in it they write quote the most powerful people in the world are preparing for the end of the world and and they themselves are frenetically accelerating that is not so far away from the more mass market vision of fortress nations that's gripped the far right globally from Italy to Israel Australia to the United States in a time of ceaseless peril openly supremacist movements in these countries are positioning their relatively wealthy states as armed bunkers naomi Klein writes she's also professor of climate justice at the University of British Columbia founding co-director of the UBC Center for Climate Justice her latest book Doppelganger a trip into the mirror world naomi welcome back to Democracy Now it's great to have you with us if you can start off by talking about um your piece and what exactly you mean um uh by talking about um the end times fascism well it's very good to be with you Amy um this isn't the most cheerful piece I've ever written um with Astra Taylor uh a a a very uh close collaborator uh founder of the Debt Collective and we were trying to kind of map what is similar and what is different about the type of far-right politics that we're seeing today uh and I should say the piece is not only grim uh it also looks at what this can mean for a response to this particular form of fascism because we can't fight it if we don't understand it so I think a lot of very good scholarship attempting to understand authoritarianism today whether it's Trump or figures like Duterte or Modi um have looked at similarities between these far-right figures and say Mussolini or Hitler um and and have taken a kind of a checklist approach of looking at what is similar to the past right and I think there's a lot of value in that but the risk of it is that it doesn't uh it doesn't look at what is new and what is particular to our time fascism always is an attempt by the right to resolve a crisis of its own era right so in the 1930s they were attempting to resolve you know in Germany the humiliations of the first world war the impacts of the great depression um and to propose a unity in the face of that you for the inroup but our moment is different and one of the things that makes it different I mean if you think about fascism in the 1930s this is before the atomic bomb it's before they understood climate change and we are in a moment where our elites whether they admit it or not do understand that our economic model and I've written books about this and talked about it with you in the past is at war with life on Earth right um we and they are barreling down this road of more and more extraction of fossil fuels of all kinds of you know basically anything they can extract from this earth and turn into energy and money uh particularly now with AI which is a energy and re resource hog water uh uh LNG um critical minerals all of it uh so so we're trying to understand how this is informing the kind of fascism that we're seeing and also we're trying to understand what unites this kind of strange Frankenstein coalition that Trump represents where he's bringing together these uh you know the richest people in the world who have ever existed with you know many workingclass people so what binds the vision right and what we come up with in this piece or what we propose in this piece is that they all have given up on this world like they all they all have bought into a kind of apocalyptic fever right whether it's Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and their investments in outer space and sort of writing off this planet whether AI which is willing to sacrifice this animate world in order to build an artificial world or whether it's the more populist MAGA vision of the fortress nation state right which is thinking okay um we know more and more people are going to be coming uh we know that disaster is on the horizon and I've listened to a lot of Steve Bannon for for Wright you know when I was writing Doppelganger and it's all very survivalist right it's you know all all the all of the the commercials pretty much are selling you know gold because the economy is going to collapse um you know ready to eat meals for 90 days because you never know what's going to happen so it it it sees the nation and the inroup as being inside the bunker and then it's exiling the outgroup to all of these um lawless territories that you've been covering on the show so it's not the same vision but what it shares is this apocalyptic fever and then of course all of it is following a similar structure like narrative structure to the biblical rapture and of course you have people who believe in that within the Trump uh uh coalition who are you know Christian Zionists like Mike Huckabe and Pete Hegsth who believe that the actual end times is coming and they think it's all going to go down in Israel and uh all of the horror that you that you report on so well and so committedly on the show you know these are all good signs if you believe in the rapture right because it means that the end is coming and the faithful are going to be lifted up to a golden city in the sky so you know what we're looking at is like the the the religious version of that story the the fundamentalist religious religious version of that story where you literally believe you're going to be saved and taken up to heaven or and but also the secular vision where your wealth protects you or your citizenship protects you and you get your own version of that golden bunkered city you mentioned Gaza and you just came from the Jewish Voice for Peace conference in Baltimore um where several thousand people gathered from around the country um our latest headline u the Israeli military calling up tens of thousands of reser as Israel's security cabinet unanimously approved plans this weekend to expand its assault on Gaza where Israel's already killed over 52,000 Palestinians and that's by far um an undercount for in the last 18 19 months israel's killed more than 2400 Palestinians just since it shattered the ceasefire in March um uh this comes as Israel's devastating blockade and food aid has entered its third months palestinian health officials say 57 Palestinians have already starved to death according to UNICEF more than 9,000 children have been admitted for treatment for acute malnutrition so far this year and aid groups like Norwegian Refugee Council blasting a new Israeli proposal to take control and distribution and put US security contractors in charge if you can talk as you so often do about what's happening in Gaza and the West Bank and what um the centrality of Israel in uh President Trump and the current US government although it was also the past president Biden's worldview and approach to foreign policy so I don't think there is a single answer to to understanding what what the driving forces are and this is what we're trying to get at is that there's a kind of an overlap of these different um apocalyptic worldviews some of them are religious and some of them are secular right so I think that people who subscribe to this like literalist version of of the rapture believe that all of this is good news in the sense that according to the story that they believe in that that the Israelites have to return to greater Israel those are the preconditions for the return of the Messiah they have to rebuild the third temple so you have this um convergence of interest between the religious extremists and the Netanyahu government who are absolutely committed to rebuilding the third temple they really want to do it they want to destroy Alexa this is why so much attention is focused on it um but then you know does Trump believe that i don't think Trump believes that i mean what he views for Gaza is he sees resources he sees money he sees a private you know reserve exactly um but you know this is what something I've been saying from from from the beginning i I think the the the interests have been fairly consistent in terms of what the end goal is which is a depopulation of of Gaza pushing Palestinians out whether through death or whether through forced exile whether through through through ethnic cleansing and under the Biden administration there was a denial that that was what was going on and under the Trump administration it's all out in the open so you know this is what is going on now what the what the reason for that is I think differs but this is what part of what we're getting at in the piece Astroni is that there's a confluence of interest in terms of what Israel represents some of the um the the supporters of the Trump administration in the tech industry are talking about wanting freedom cities for instance these these privatized corporate cities um and they talk about this as tech zionism um they they have a lot of admiration for the idea that Israel was created they say you know from a book um the Herzel's books um and they say well why can't we start our own country our own private countries why do we have to you know why do we have to abide by the rules of the nation state um so you know I I think part of the support for Israel isn't just our classic understandings either of Jewish Zionism or Christian Zionism Although that's absolutely going on it's also this idea of a very technologically advanced startup country right um uh you know Israel has marketed itself that way and a lot of these tech companies want to do that in San Francisco you know they want to push everybody out who doesn't agree with them who's poor have more needs um and create their kind of corporate privatized utopia uh so you know I'm not saying this is a coherent agenda um I'm saying that there's a lot of uh overlapping stories that that follow a similar structure and um and and share similar goals if that makes sense i mean yes i mean the overall issue obviously is hard to make sense of and most of Trump's supporters are neither wealthy nor are they Christian Zionists so why are they backing this whole approach well it's not clear the extent to which they actively back it but I think that they see a kinship in the ethnostate right because a lot of Trump supporters are becoming increasingly Christian nationalist about the United States and this has been you know carefully fostered by figures like Steve Bannon um and so when they look at Israel they see a country that is openly an ethnostate that is fortressing itself in a sea of its enemies um you know and they want to do something similar and they're sharing technologies they're sharing um you know legal precedents tools um so there's a you know there's a kinship and it you know and we we're seeing this now with India with its attacks on Kashmir following a you know using similar techniques um uh that you know Israel has used in Gaza so there is a kind of a solidarity of the ethnostates um and they are sharing you know they're even trading trinkets of you know golden pagers and swapping chainsaws you know this is something that we I I I think you know when you're inside um the crucible of it here in the United States under Trump it's hard to see the extent to which this is an international project on the right and they are influencing one another and what does unite them you know this whole fortress mentality is this hatred of immigrants uh you you have President Trump just saying uh he doesn't even know he's not a lawyer so he doesn't know if he has to uphold the Constitution he said right i mean this is what I'm trying to get at um about the awareness that we are in an age of consequences that when you don't act in the face of the climate crisis for decades after when when scientists have been warning you that more and more of the world becomes uninhabitable and lo and behold people move uh to try to find safety in the face of in the face of wars in the face of economic deprivation and in the face of ecological disasters and so that fortressing of the nation state and this is what I think um you know Israel's come to represent just as a very small nation that is extremely fortressed right whether it's with the high-tech walls the iron dome Trump says now I want a not an iron dome but a golden dome right um that that here um that all of this is is whether it's stated explicitly a military parade that'll cost tens of millions of dollars even as he uh slices es and dices the government on his birthday in June so the pattern is protecting the in-group and exiling and cleansing the out groupoups right and so that I think is is is you know if there is support among the MAGA base for Israel it's less out of a love for Israel than more out of an identification like they are doing what we want to do here you write um many things in your piece um and I just want to go to one of them uh you say in talking about um Musk's apocalyptic vision you talk about and also um detailing the end times fascism this whole issue of the rise of the city state the corporate city state I think this is a new concept for many they're not going to know what you're talking about in southern Texas star base just this group of people who are mainly workers at uh uh SpaceX have just voted to make a city right there yeah and we've had sort of I mean the idea of a of of a company town is not entirely new right um and Disney had Celebration Florida and you know that there are lineages to to this right um colonial line lineages to this you know I I I live in Canada which started as the Hudson's Bay Company right so it was it was a company before it was a country so there there is some precedent for this but I think what this is I've been following this out of the corner of my eye Amy because this is where the libertarians have been going for a while um there was an Peter Teal has been obsessed with this idea it's increasingly being called exit so exiting the nation and just starting your own country where you can set your own tax level you can set you can make your own regulations or not or not and countries and and and these little corporate countries will compete with one another to try to attract capital right so in a way it's an extension of the free trade zone right where it's and this is this is a a in a way like a denationalized country within a country but Trump started to float this in 2023 the idea that he would create 10 freedom cities uh on the campaign trail I don't think his base much knew what he was talking about but now you have all these lobbyists who fully intend to take him up on it and we're starting to see the beginning of this with the SpaceX city so you also write um about El Salvador's terrorism confinement center the notorious prison secut where so many hundreds of people um have been sent from the United States and at the same time in the last 24 hours President Trump saying he wants to reopen the notorious Alcatraz an island in San Francisco if you can talk about the prison as a model for what Trump wants to put forward and particularly in relation as we see motivating so much um to immigrants well this is an incredibly bleak vision so repression is always a huge part of any kind of fascist project right you need to contain the out group you need to disappear the out group so this part of it is not new but I think what is so worrying to me is that Trump was elected promising all kinds of things to his base right he was he promised to eliminate inflation he promised to bring these great jobs home he's not delivering on any of that so the sadistic part of his project is really all he has to offer right i think one of the most chilling things I've ever seen in the United States was Trump sharing that video at his 100 day rally of just pure sadism of just looking at prisoners as entertainment being shaved being shackled being paraded and he's not delivering on the price of eggs and he's not delivering on the jobs by the way because he's he's throwing all in he's going all in on AI so the jobs that are coming back are seem to be mainly for robots um it's not actually for his for his base and so this scales up the need for the sadism and and these spectacles right and and I think that that's what something like Alcatraz represents he he's he's a TV producer first and foremost right he's producing spectacles and the less he the less he has to offer economically tangibly materially the more he leans on the sadism uh you write the governing ideology of the far right has become a monstrous supremacist survivalism our task is to build a movement strong enough to stop them what would that movement look like or what do you see it's is being formed right now you know what we're doing in this piece by laying out the bleakness of the vision and when I say bleakness you know I think it's beyond something we've seen before because there's always an apocalyptic quality to fascism but fascism of the 1930s and 40s had a horizon like after the apocalypse people were being promised a future a pastoral peaceful little piece of land um where they could live out their lives you know even though Trump talks about a golden age there really isn't a future that that the base believes in you know and this is what I've learned by by consuming far too much MAGA media amy um they envision a future of endless war right this is why they're bunkering down this is why they're buying ready to eat meals to last this is why they're buying gold and crypto they think the whole thing is going down so and why Elon Musk is trying to have so many children at least 14 at this point but he's actually explicitly texted it saying &quot;We've got to do this much faster as he proposed to one of the women he has children with uh saying uh we got to start using surrogates.&quot; So they don't believe in the future is the bottom line um and that is you know I I think I've been in a lot of progressive spaces in recent months where we've talked about building these very broad coalitions including with people who we don't entirely disagree with i've never encountered uh a potential coalition more broad than the idea of how about if we believe in this world how about if we believe in the future because we're up against people who are actively betting against the future right not just actively betting against it but fueling the fires that are burning this world actively fueling it so I think that if we have the courage really to look at the bleakness of what they of what they believe in um which is an apocalyptic future then we have our work cut out for us of being the people who actually believe in this realm in this world in the beauty of creation and in of each other naomi Klein I want to thank you for being with us

          <attvalue for="7" value="right now on News4 Today hundreds of elementary students rescued as flood water rise in western Maryland The impact on schools today as the search continues for a Virginia boy swept away Shocks fired inside a DC wing shop One person killed What we know about the victims and the search this morning for the gunman Commuter alert Rail service getting back on track after a massive fire in Baltimore What you need to know if you have a train to catch today News 4 begins with a Storm Team 4 weather alert Good morning everyone Welcome into News4 Today at 4:30 I'm Jabanji I'm Melissa Malay We are waking up in weather alert mode Rain still lingering but it's nothing compared to what we're seeing in western Maryland Yeah we will have a look at the flooding there in just a moment It was intense yesterday but uh Chuck is here now with more It's just you know we had rain yesterday inside the beltway but you see what was happening in western Maryland with those rushing waters You bet Yeah And that was the forecast yesterday is for the heaviest of the rain to be west of the Blue Ridge up into the mountains because that's where the moisture could be more effectively rung out of the atmosphere That's exactly what happened yesterday Heavy duty rain across much of northern and western Maryland and a big chunk of northwest Virginia as well still have plenty of active flood warnings across the parts of the PTOAC up towards Harper's Ferry through parts of the Shannondoa Valley So be on the lookout for areas of high and standing water and do your best to stay away from it The old saying turn around don't drown If you can't see the pavement don't drive into the water because you just never know how deep it is So we're weather alert because of all the high water across the region this morning There is a little bit of a drying slot here for the first part of your Wednesday So you're going to get some time to let the water sort of recede a little bit Might even get a little sunshine today but sunshine will prove to be self-destructive and end up leading to another chance for rain and thunderstorms coming up this evening There goes that first batch of heavy duty rain that affected us yesterday That's lifting up into Pennsylvania Here's the dry time we're going to get for the first part of the day today You can see there's already more showers developing down across North Carolina So eventually that rain chance will arrive here as well For now though at least the heavy duty rain has pulled out of the region Still some lingering sprinkles and showers across but nothing all that heavy Temperatures are generally in the low and mid60s for most of the area And with a little sunshine today we should be able to make it into the mid70s But again watch out for rain and thunderstorm chances to return after about 3:00 today Mid70s though not too bad Even warmer and even more humid tomorrow and Friday That forecast coming up All right thank you Chuck We start with severe flooding in Alageney County Maryland All schools there are closed today after all of this here behind me Streets turned into rivers after they were filled with rushing flood waters from yesterday's heavy rain The flooding forced the evacuation of two elementary schools About 150 students and staff from Westernport Elementary had to be rescued by boat Emergency crews from multiple agencies across the state including Montgomery County were sent to Alagany to help in those rescue efforts Maryland not the only area hit hard by that flooding Later this morning first responders in Albamarl County Virginia We'll continue searching for a 12year-old boy reportedly swept away by flood waters Someone called 911 last night saying the boy was walking outside when he was swept away after a nearby creek overflowed its banks This is not too far from Interstate 64 in Crosseé Crews called off the search late last night once it became just too dark to see And with more rain in the forecast now really the best time Download that free NBC Washington app on your phone We will of course send you alerts straight to your device if flood warnings or watches are issued in your area Now to an update on that massive warehouse fire in Baltimore that caused delays and cancellations on Amtrak The fire is now fully contained Crews in Baltimore worked through the night to extinguish hot spots Several residents were evacuated from their homes yesterday as firefighters worked to contain the flames Officials say they are now working to help those people safely return home Meanwhile today the Mark trains will operate in full service on the Penn line but on Amtrak there are still some scheduling changes as a result of the fire Trains 130 and 119 remain canceled today Northeast Regional Trains 112 131 181 and 114 are all expected to run normally Some service did resume yesterday but many people say the fire continued to have an impact on their

through stricter eligibility verification work requirements and citizenship checks States that offer coverage to undocumented immigrants would receive additional cuts in federal funds An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would cut health care spending by 715 billion It says the bill would cause over eight and a half million people to lose health insurance in less than a decade The bill needs still needs support from all House Republicans before it can head to the Senate Well today President Trump is heading to Qatar as part of his highstakes trip to the Middle East The president will meet with the Amir of Qatar amid the controversy over the country's gift to Trump a luxury jumbo jet It's a gift that's drawn criticism from both sides of the aisle News4's Alice Bar joining us live from Capitol Hill with more details Alice good morning Good morning Jie And President Trump has already met this morning in a just a pull aside one-on-one with the president of Syria He's a former al-Qaeda member who left the group and has been working to moderate his image since taking over the government just earlier this year It's coming shortly after President Trump announced a somewhat surprised decision to lift sanctions against Syria And he said he was doing that in order to give the country a chance at greatness and that it came as sort of at the urging of Saudi Arabia's crown prince You saw there Muhammad bin Salman And uh President Trump has been meeting this morning with leaders from the Gulf Cooperation Council leaders of a number of uh Arab states there in Saudi Arabia still at this point as he's been working to strengthen business ties with the region's wealthy states On Tuesday he announced the Saudis are set to buy $142 billion worth of American military equipment part of a promised $600 billion investment in the US The president said that we've launched the golden age of America and that the golden age of the Middle East can proceed alongside of us Along with those announcements about the Syria sanctions President Trump has also been pushing Iran to abandon its nuclear program And notably in speaking about that and the possibility of negotiations with Iran he said that America should have no permanent enemies That's something that is likely reverberating across the Middle East And again President Trump's next stop is going to be in Qatar where he's facing those very serious questions about the government there offering a $400 million luxury jet gifted to the Pentagon to serve as Air Force One then transferred to the Trump Presidential Library at the end of his term The president again defending that move though a growing number of Republicans are raising concerns about accepting that $400 million foreign gift And the top Democrat in the Senate says he's not going to allow any judicial nominees until the attorney general testifies about the legal questions Melissa All right Thank you Alice Well meantime as DC's mayor and the commanders push to get support for the $3.7 billion stadium deal to have the commanders return to RFK opponents are ramping up their efforts as well At a community forum in W 7 Monday night hundreds of residents showed up to have their voices heard Their main concern the plan to spend more than1 billion dollars of public funds on the stadium deal As some people say the stadium currently serves as a community space Despite what a lot of people think it's not just an empty lot that's rotting There is a lot of community activity They just don't want to see parking garages directly on the community It really cuts us off from the Anacostia River Um it cuts us off from all of the recreational resources The deadline for the city council's approval is mid July So far the mayor has not sent any RFK legislation or next year's budget to the council for consideration Speaking of the Commanders the full regular season schedule comes out tonight Yes but we already know a few details about what could be one of the most exciting games of the season The Burgine Gold packing their bags and heading across the pond for the first time They're heading to Madrid this fall They'll take on the Miami Dolphins November 16th This is only Washington's second international game since the NFL began playing uh games overseas in 2007 but the Commanders are making history playing in the NFL's first ever regular season game in Spain Cannot wait Uh JP Finley will have reaction to the uh full commander schedule Also a breakdown of the schedule tonight on All Ears with JP Finley It airs on News4 streaming channel live at 8:30 You can also catch the show on YouTube and wherever you get your podcasts starting Thursday morning That is so fun Game in Spain Not that I would go but I've already volunteered to watch my niece and nephew that that very weekend of of all other Yeah So there's no plans have been made Plans have been made Okay Yeah But I see And I think I think I may try to go I know you will It's like right before I you know I'll come back to work Aren't you going to be raising your child i mean you're just going to leave this kid behind no she's not going to take her She's got commander gear She's got commander gear An infant on the plane What could go wrong says the poor guy who sits in front of you Well there are babies in this world They'll deal with it Yes there are And if those kids crying behind me I'm going to be crying right back All right Good morning everybody Uh cloudy skies are the rule once again There is another chance for some rain coming up here but most of today's rain chances stack up later into the afternoon and evening hours We've had rain overnight and so there are plenty of puddles and there are lots of areas of high and standing water across the region So be careful until at least between now and the time the sun comes up And remember to never drive over a water covered road We'll get some dry time this morning That should help most of the high water get back inside of its banks It'll be a little warmer today Nobody made it above 70 yesterday We should make the mid70s today However you're going to notice a little increase in humidity levels It's going to be quite humid the next few days and rain chances will be peaking again as we get into the day on Friday All these areas in green are where we have active flood warnings this morning So many spots up here in northwest Virginia eastern parts of West Virginia obviously northern and western Maryland and even down into parts of central Virginia Charlottesville to Co Pepper So be on the lookout for that high water this morning Now Storm Team 4 radar shows nothing more than a few sprinkles now in our Maryland suburbs here Those raindrops are northbound Not much rain thankfully currently across much of uh northern and central Virginia Temperature- wise or pretty much where we were all day yesterday in the low and mid60s You will get to see a little sunshine today Can't promise you a whole lot but it should be enough anyway to put temperatures back into the mid70s this afternoon However sunshine will lead to the development of rain and thunderstorms by late in the day and especially in the afterwork and evening time frame For tomorrow warmer still back up to around 80 tomorrow Not a huge rain chance tomorrow so they'll get another opportunity to dry out just a smidgen Future weather carries the little chances for rain out this morning Here's 130 Again not a big rain chance 20 30% chance that early but by the time you get to 5:00 here notice the coverage area of the rain and thunderstorm chances increasing quite dramatically between about 3 and 5:00 p.m and then hit and miss scattered thunderstorms likely well into the evening hours Then for tomorrow a dry start and notice a mostly dry day tomorrow Only an isolated rain chance mainly down to our south and west but I think most of us is are going to get a dry day on Thursday I'll put your rain chances at 25% for tomorrow but back to 80% chances for storms on Friday Friday and Saturday well look at that Woo mid80s and lots of humidity on Friday It's going to feel like summertime Then some cooler weather for yours truly to enjoy early next week All right thank you Chuck T R A N Q U I L Trinkle All right that I think she got that one right I knew that one

          <attvalue for="7" value="(upbeat music) - How the church is moving in some of the most contentious places in the world. Good evening and thanks for joining us for this special &quot;Faith Nation&quot; in Washington. I'm Jenna Browder. In recent years, countless protestors have been killed in Iran, a security force has cracked down on women who violate Islamic dress codes, many Iranians are fleeing their country and seeking refuge in Armenia where a group of Christians is awaiting to meet them. Chuck Holton has their story. (dramatic swooshing) (crowd chanting) - A groundbreaking cultural shift is underway across Iran. Months of protests against the regime have been brutally repressed by police leaving more than 500 dead. Hundreds of girl schools have seen their students hospitalized in a wave of poisonings. All the fear and uncertainty has left many looking for an escape. Thousands are now fleeing north to one of the only free and democratic countries in the region, Armenia. There are a lot of global geopolitical conflicts that are represented in this remote border crossing, you see in Iran right behind me. You have Russia, which does a lot of trade with Iran. A lot of the weapons that end up in Ukraine may come through this area and you also have Azerbaijan, which wants this corridor in order to reach Turkey and the West. And right in the middle of it all, you have this tiny country of Armenia, which is functioning as a safe spot for Christians and other Iranians who are fleeing persecution inside their country. - And then right here you see this river, it's called the Araks River. And the Araks River is the basically the border between Armenia and Iran. And if you go a little farther to the west, it's the border also from Turkey and Armenia. - And this is the only border crossing between the Iran and Armenia, right? - That's correct. This is the only border crossing that are Iranians coming in, they can come into Armenia only at this spot. So it's illegal in Iran to proselytize. So as a Christian, you're not able to go to Iran illegally to share the Christian faith and you're not even allowed to have a Persian Bible. It's illegal to have the Bible in the Persian language. So what we've found is that the Persians come to Christian Armenia and they're coming to look for what Christianity is. Find a church, find a Bible, ask questions and because this is the only border crossing and that they're able to, we find that thousands pass every single day. - And how receptive are they to the Gospel? - Those that are coming from Iran are so excited to meet a Christian and to listen. And in fact, we have seen many, I mean hundreds have come to faith in Jesus Christ. It's just that they need to hear, they need to have someone that is a preacher, an evangelist to teach them and show them that. And they're so eager to read a Bible as well as they're not allowed to have those in Iran. - [Chuck] But the journey can be full of risk. This bus full of Iranians caught fire while ascending the treacherous mountain road en route to Armenia capital, Yerevan. Fortunately there were no injuries. Even still greater concern to those coming here is that even after leaving Iran, their family and friends back home may be in danger. - I myself, you know, was beaten four years ago in Shiraz University because of hijab, because I took off my scarf. In Iran, women are, you know, suffering a lot because there are a lot of rapes, a lot of harassment and it is normal. It has been normal. No one understand that it is. It is harassment, it is rape. No one understand it. They say it's normal, you are a woman, so you must obey. - [Chuck] As conflict in Iran persists, Jacob and his team are bracing for an increased number of refugees seeking shelter here. And while Armenia faces its own ongoing problems with Azerbaijan, more Russians and Ukrainians are arriving in the country, fleeing that ongoing conflict. And no matter where they hail from, Jacob and his team welcome all with open arms. - Pray that the Lord would send his lost sheep from Iran to Armenia so that they would find him, the good shepherd of the sheep and that he would send these people to our church and to churches like us that are doing these outreaches - [Chuck] From Iran's border with Armenia, I'm Chuck Holton for CBN News. (dramatic swooshing) - [Jenna] Thank you Chuck. Taking the command to love your neighbor as yourself one step further. How believers in the South are praying for the people of the north in North Korea, next. Call now. (upbeat music) - [Speaker] Young people, millennials are flocking to church. - [Speaker 2] It's not an exaggeration to say that we love to meet them and that we love to know their stories. (upbeat music continues) - Since the Korean War ended in 1953, North Korea has become one of the world's most dangerous dictatorships. Today in South Korea, millions of Christians are praying for the freedom of their Northern neighbors and the reunification of their countries. Chris Mitchell reports from the Korean Peninsula. (dramatic swooshing) - This is one of the many barriers separating North and South Korea. This barrier is to prevent North Korean infiltrators. 70 years ago they signed an armistice dividing North and South Korea. Now 70 years later, millions of Koreans are praying for the reunification of the country. (crowd chanting) - We are praying every night for the liberation of those Korean people and all the country members should shout together for the freedom of those Korean people. - [Chris] Each night for the past 17 years, from 10:00 PM to 3:00 AM, intercessors like these with the Esther Prayer Movement have gathered to pray. Professor Lee says after learning of the horror in North Korea, he asked God to give him his heart for the people there. - Then for few days, I cannot eat, I cannot sleep. So many things on those Korean, what's happening there. The children are starving to death. So I decided until the those Korean people can freely listen to Gospel, the human rights be recovered, until the point I do every night prayer meeting continuously and also many intercessors, we made a decision to continue every day, overnight prayer meeting. - [Chuck] Professor Lee says North Korea unfortunately leads in many of the world's worst categories. It ranks the lowest in democracy, economic freedom and freedom of speech. It's highest in slavery, bribery and corruption, and it's number one in Christian persecution. For decades, North Korea has been led by a personality cult of three generations with millions in slavish devotion. - They have no chance to listen to Gospel but also they have to idolize their dictator. So we should make them free in their bondage. So we pray for them. - [Chris] He says the prison camps resemble Nazi death camps. These crude pictures show some of the horror. Guards put this small boy over a fire and some prisoners, many of them Christian, are subjected to chemical experiments. CBN News interviewed two North Korean defectors, who described what life is like inside the country, often called the hermit kingdom. We hid their identity for their safety and that of their family still inside North Korea. We'll call this woman A, one of the few ever to escape a prison camp. (A speaking in foreign language) - [A Translator] In the political prison camps, 70% are Christians. The crime of a Christian is espionage. - What is it like in the prisons? In the concentration camps? (A speaking in foreign language) - [A Translator] It is so hard, too awful beyond words. In places like Onsong Prison Camp, they're assigned to a forced labor and are fed watery and rotten porridge that stinks. Many people eat it and die. Places like Chongjin Prison, the cells are less than seven to nine square meters and up to 35 peoples are crammed into that small space. As a result, people die every day. They are also tortured, I can't express it in words. In the case of women, they're stripped naked and raped. - We interviewed B as he looked across the body of water into North Korea. (B speaking in foreign language) - [B Translator] In North Korea there is no freedom at all. Even though there is no iron fence in North Korea, the whole country's like a big prison. No freedom of movement, no freedom to see, no freedom to speak, no freedom to hear, no freedom at all. - Both defectors told us COVID brought a big change to the country. (B speaking in foreign language) - [B Translator] Many people died of starvation due to severe food crisis and many people got sick and died without medical treatment. They prayed in the name of Jesus and the sick were healed. When the people had high fever from COVID, they prayed in the name of Jesus and the fever went down. So the name of Jesus became very famous in North Korea. Now North Koreans who used to believe in Kim Jong Un and Kim Il-sung are now starting to say that the only one that can be trusted is Jesus. - [Chris] Despite the crackdown they report, the underground church has doubled since COVID to as many as 400,000. Now they spread the Gospel by floating bottles filled with rice money and a USB containing the Bible and Christian videos across the water to North Korea. Professor Lee believes that wall between North and South Korea will fall just like the Berlin Wall. - I'm economist, when I see the political economic situation, there is no answer. So delicate, so complex. Because of that, I was simply ask to the Lord, you are the perfect answer. Open your wisdom. So I perfectly rely on the Lord. He's opening the door to North Korea so they make my heart more comfortable. So I think his perfect wisdom will open the door and I think it is miraculously. - [Chris] On the 70th anniversary of the division of the Korean Peninsula, Professor Lee compares this time to when the Jews were freed from Babylon, he's asking Christians worldwide to join in praying for the people of North Korea to be free. - This time, to shout together, to pray together, to fast together then the Lord will break the will of North Korea and the authority of death over North Korea and the Lord will save North Korean people. - [Chris] Chris Mitchell, CBN News on the border between North and South Korea. (dramatic swooshing) (upbeat music) - [Jenna] Thank you, Chris. Up next, the unprecedented prayer movement sweeping through Taiwan and crossing all denominational barriers. Right after this. (upbeat music continues) - Tens of thousands of Christians praying around the clock. This unprecedented prayer movement is sweeping through Taiwan and crossing all denominational barriers. The Revival Prayer Group movement is an urgent response to China's increasing threat of war against the island nation, a war that could have catastrophic consequences on the global economy as well. George Thomas has more from Taipei. (rockets firing) (dramatic music) - [Speaker 3] The tensions are peaking. Beijing's belligerence is once again making Taipei jittery. - [George] China's military releasing this video recently showing what simulated attacks on Taiwan would look like. The tiny island off the mainland coast now facing almost daily Chinese military harassment. Meanwhile. - [Reporter] Taiwan is beefing up its military and training with new US weapons. - [George] All in preparation for potential full scale war. - To be clear, we do not seek conflict or confrontation, but we will not flinch in the face of bullying or coercion. (singing in foreign language) - [George] While the war drums grow louder by day. (crowd chattering) Taiwan Christians are taking to their knees by night. (Brian speaking in foreign language) - [Brian Translator] The united prayers and fasting prayers of the churches in Taiwan are much more than ever before. It's an unprecedented prayer movement. - [George] All across this island, people are meeting every day, 24 hours a day, to pray for revival, unity, repentance, and protection over their land. - I believe something so simple is start having such a huge impact upon people in the church and also the people around the church. (Gordon speaking in foreign language) - [George] Gordon Huang pastors one of Taiwan's most well-known congregations. His church sits atop this iconic landmark known as Taipei 101, in the heart of the capital city. He fears war with China is coming and wants Christians to be ready. - I think one thing for sure, people is gonna be so shaken and people want to hear the Gospel. Are you ready or are you gonna be on the run yourself? - [George] That theme of shaking, gripped Don Young two years ago. - That's hurt from the Lord, time is short, the hour is urgent, it's time to pray. Young served as an American missionary in West Africa for 15 years and has traveled the world teaching Christians how to have a deeper prayer walk with the Lord. In May of 2021, Pastor Young says he got a word from the Lord that there was going to be a shaking coming to Taiwan. He brought that message to the church leaders here on the island and that gave birth to a prayer movement that has today swept across Taiwan. (congregation singing in foreign language) The revival prayer group or RPG movement began, made up of a handful of people in groups, taking turns around the clock to pray for Taiwan. - Prayer is the only way that you can get through anything shaky. Jesus did everything by prayer. He did nothing apart from prayer. Before it was just kind of a a moment with God. We all have them. But now it was shaping up to become a movement for God. There's a huge difference between a moment and a movement. (Brian speaking in foreign language) - [Brian Translator] Because RPG has two or three people in a group. So if one day a war happens and there are no physical buildings that people can meet in, we can still pray in small groups so the church will not be affected. - [George] Peter Yang has pastored and planted churches in Taiwan since 1978 and says he's never seen the kind of unity now on display churches across denominational lines joining the initiative. (Peter speaking in foreign language) - [Peter Translator] What's happening today is so rare, every day, every week, a joint pastor from other churches, other denominations, and we pray for our cities, for our nation, for other countries. It's amazing, it's clearly God's doing. Unity will be the legacy of this movement. - [George] More than 100,000 revival prayer groups have sprouted up, with members of China's underground church movement also taking part. (Peter speaking in foreign language) - [Peter Translator] We want to have 300,000 RPG groups where we also unite with churches in China, coming together, all the leaders and members on both sides. So we can pray with the goal of impacting China as well. - [George] Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year sent a chill across this island nation of 23 million people, with many drawing comparisons between Putin's obsession with taking over Ukraine and Xi Jinping's determination to annex Taiwan. Many fear war can erupt here with little notice and it's prompting some to search for peace in the midst of constant threats from Beijing, - Many came and joined RPG because they hear so much testimonies of how God is answering prayer. So you have a lot of unbelieving people joining RPG and as they open their mouth and pray, they experience the Lord, said they're coming to the Lord as well. - [George] CBN News spoke with church leaders who set a potential Taiwan-China war would be like David facing down Goliath, bringing untold devastation and loss of life. They believe prayer can make the difference between war and peace. (speaking in foreign language) - [Brian Translator] We ask churches around the world to pray for this most dangerous place in the world today so that God's peace can come upon cross strait relations. Ethnic Chinese should not kill one another but instead we should together fulfill the end times missions movement, to bring the gospel back to Jerusalem. - [George] George Thomas, CBN News, Taipei, Taiwan. (dramatic swooshing) (upbeat music) - [Jenna] Thank you George. Christianity dying at record speeds and the mission to revive it. Where it's happening, still ahead. (upbeat music continues) That's 800-761-9403. (upbeat music) - I am Regent's first ROTC grad student. (upbeat music continues) - Finally tonight, in the 5th century, a missionary landed on the pagan island of Ireland to proclaim the Gospel. He would become known as St. Patrick and his ministry transformed Ireland into one of the most Christian nations in the world. Today, few there attend church but as Dale Hurd reports, a new generation of missionaries is bringing back the Gospel. - If there were a symbol of what happened to faith in Ireland, it might be this, the Church of the Annunciation just outside of Dublin. It used to be one of the largest church buildings in all Ireland, but it's been demolished because so few people attended services. Anyone over 50 in Ireland can still remember a nation where almost everyone went to church. But today live in a nation where in some areas almost no one goes to church. The Christian faith that has dominated Ireland for centuries died with surprising speed and as one leader put it, &quot;Today for the Irish, God has become irrelevant.&quot; They not only walked away from the church, they legalized same-sex marriage, abortion, and elected an openly gay Prime Minister. Nick Park heads Ireland's Evangelical Alliance. - It was very much a cultural religion but they were Catholic because they were Irish and the two were seen as synonymous. We were very arrogant as a church. - Patty Monaghan helps lead the Evangelical Catholic Initiative. - Sadly, it's taken the two referendums that we both have lost, one on same-sex marriage, one abortion to bring home to the Catholic Church in Ireland that they're now a minority church. - [Dale] Church buildings abandoned, some Catholic seminaries, almost empty. One clergyman wrote that the battle for faith in Ireland has been lost. But a new church is rising. (singing in foreign language) This is the largest church in Ireland and it is Romanian Pentecostal. The worshipers at Betania or Bethany Church came to Ireland to find work, but now realize they were sent to Ireland as missionaries. Betania church is exploding and is worshiping in a new $8 million facility. I talked to two of the pastors while the building was under construction. - We praying for this country, we're fasting for this country and I think God has a plan with us to be a blessing for this country and more people to know God and to be saved in this country. 'Cause God loves Ireland. - We realized God has a greater plan, a bigger purpose for our lives to deliver his message and his kingdom works for this country. - Batel, another Romanian Pentecostal church is also among the largest churches in Ireland. Betania Pastor Jurjea remembers when nations like Ireland sent Bibles to communist Romania. - And those Bibles are coming back now. - [Dale] African churches are also growing. The Nigerian redeemed Christian Church of God has grown to more than 100 churches in Ireland with several thousand members. And even though most Irish have rejected the institutional church, polls show many still believe the core of the Gospel. - Among Irish youth, I think it's something like 70% of them said they really believed Jesus rose from the dead. They really believed in heaven and hell. They really believed that Jesus was the incarnate son of God. So you still got these very high rates of belief in the facts of the Gospel. - When we were choked by religion and institutionalism, there wasn't much life. But now that we have those institutions crumbling, I think that we are in the land of opportunity. - [Dale] Monaghan says the Spirit is moving in some Catholic churches as well. - Do know there's a spiritual awakening happening in this country and some parish priests are really going born again filled with the Holy Spirit and getting a vision for what's possible. There's that spiritual heritage within this nation that I believe the enemy, Satan wants to destroy, but there's, I believe it's going to happen again. - [Dale] Ireland once a mission field, then a base for missions has become a mission field again. - So we are seeing such an explosion of of Christianity, but I believe the gifts and callings of God are without repentance and Ireland still has a call to be a missionary sending nation, and I believe Ireland will fulfill that role again. - [Dale] Dale Hurd, CBN News, Dublin. - And that is going to do it for &quot;Faith Nation.&quot; Thank you for joining us, have a great evening.

          <attvalue for="7" value="On 1,100 acres in the middle of the Arizona desert. Only one set of buildings rises above the horizon as far as the eye can see. We started construction well before the CHIPS Act came along, and that's in April of '21. This recently completed 3. 5-million-square-foot building is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's first Arizona chip fabrication plant– or fab- making history not only for its enormous size- but because it's by far the most advanced chip fab on U.S. soil. So pilot production has started in this building when we are here. Three years ago, it was steel beams and dirt. What kind of investment has it taken to get to this point? About $20 billion. When we first visited, TSMC was far from a household name. But the chip shortage and AI boom has thrust it into the spotlight. TSMC manufactures some 92% of the world's most advanced chips, in everything from Nvidia GPUs to Apple iPhones. And now, for the first time in history, TSMC is starting to make those advanced chips here in the U.S. customers like Apple are starting to make their chips here, with two more fabs planned by the end of the decade. The facility over here is our fab 2. You can see the steel has been completed. But bringing advanced chip manufacturing to the U.S. has proven difficult. Volume production, is supposed to begin this year, is delayed until 2025. The Commerce Department recently hit TSMC with new shipping bans after its chips ended up in Huawei devices, despite export controls. And incoming President Donald Trump stirred up fears when he expressed opposition to the CHIPS Act during his campaign. TSMC is getting $6.6 billion from the bill. The CHIPS Act was bipartisan and it had huge Republican support when it passed. Right now, we buy every single AI chip from one company in Taiwan. That makes America less safe, and so repealing the CHIPS Act would make Americans less safe, I just don't think they'll do that. CNBC visited northern Phoenix for an exclusive first look at TSMC's first completed fab – and asked its top executives exactly what's in store for U.S. manufacturing - under an incoming Trump administration, and ever-mounting need for advanced chips. Inside the huge new fab just completed in Arizona, there's enough concrete to make ten Empire State Buildings; over 15-million-feet of cable and wire that could stretch from New York City to Los Angeles; and steel that weighs as much as 970 Boeing Triple Sevens. Now, pilot production is officially underway. Running actual product through to make sure that the entire line works end to end. And then you use those wafers to sample the customer so that they can decide if we've met their standards. Now chairman of TSMC Arizona, Rick Cassidy has been with the company 27 years. And how close are we to full production in this building? Very close, very close. But according to TSMC's initial timeline, full production should already be happening. Getting the right talent and of course, doing so during a pandemic when there were shortages, you couldn't build a house, let alone build a chip foundry. It gives you some idea for like what is required to build like massive scale in this industry. Like, it's not a game for sissies. Like it's hard and it's expensive. When we came to the U.S., we knew we were going to go through a learning process. And I want to tell you, no surprise, we had a lot of learning that we went, whether it was permitting, learning how to work with the trades, learning how to work with the unions, local labor laws, lots of learnings that went on. Now we've overcome those. But maybe the biggest challenge that we had was MEP– mechanical, electrical and plumbing. The fab is filled with billions of dollars of machinery operating at the very edge of what scientifically possible – like these bus-sized EUV machines made by a single company, ASML - the only machines in the world able to perform the extreme ultraviolet lithography necessary for etching minuscule designs on the most advanced chips. So these are quarter-billion dollar tools. In order to hook one up requires something over 2,000 electrical connections, over two kilometers of cabling, 100,000 parts, 40,000 bolts. We're talking about massive. So learning how to overcome that challenge was something that was good for TSMC. Good for the trades, good for Phoenix, good for the U.S. And yes, we're dang near back on the original schedule. So far, TSMC has 2,000 people working around the clock to run the operation. Cassidy showed us the &quot;gowning&quot; building, where workers suit up in ultra-sterile &quot;bunny suits&quot; before crossing a skybridge into the new fab. Dust particles are the bane of wafer fabrication. If it lands on a wafer, it'll kill a die. And what kind of yield are you anticipating to get out of fab 1? You know, yields vary, but we intend to be right on par with our Taiwan compatriots. The yield - what percentage of chips coming out of the fab are usable – depends on that sterile environment and precision of the machines. But even with great yields, the biggest volume of chips will still come out of Taiwan for years to come. So the U.S. is far from self-reliant. It's difficult or impossible for the U.S. or any country to be fully self-sufficient in everything that they need to build semiconductors. I think that's a pipe dream. And although the first fab was originally slated to make 5-nanometer – it's now on track to pump out even more advanced 4-nanometer chips at a rate of at least 20,000 wafers per month. Wafers that cost upwards of $18,000 and continue to rise in price, taking TSMC's stock value with it. Over the past couple of years. We've seen TSMC been able to kind of name its price, and everyone's going to pay it because right now it's the dependability and the quality that is needed. Despite being the birthplace of microchips in the 1950s – and remaining a top chip design hub - the U.S. now manufactures only 10% of the world's chips – and none of the most advanced ones. When supply chain chaos collided with booming demand for consumer electronics during the pandemic, the resulting chip shortage exposed the big risks of relying on outsiders for such critical technology. How important is it for supply to come from elsewhere than just Taiwan? I think the pandemic is probably a good example that highlighted supply chain diversification requirements, and customers want us in the U.S., they want us in Japan, they want us in Europe. Talks with TSMC about bringing advanced production to the U.S. actually began in 2018, under President Trump's first term, and his then commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross. Well, it began with select USA, which is an annual event that the Commerce Department puts on to encourage U.S. investment by foreign companies. TSMC came to that session. TSMC has actually been manufacturing in the U.S. since 1998, at an older generation chip fab in Washington state, where Cassidy says TSMC is currently investing to upgrade and expand. But Ross says some major customers wanted advanced chips made on U.S. soil. I set up a phone call between the chairman of TSMC and the head of Apple, where Apple would became very strongly supportive of the idea of TSMC coming. By 2020, TSMC announced its Arizona plans, then broke ground there in April 2021. And now you've got, you know, atrium and building, and you'll be seeing all of the fab in the back. 26-year company veteran Rose Castanares is the newly appointed president of TSMC Arizona. It was one of my customers that had first requested that TSMC build a fab in the United States. They wanted supply resilience. The world's massive reliance on TSMC's fabs in Taiwan has made the global chip supply vulnerable to risks of the region. We can't be sure that we can make enough chips here in the U.S. in the event of, say, some sort of aggression between China and Taiwan, some sort of even earthquakes and events that take down that particular island for a period of time, the entire market, the entire world, could suffer from lack of availability of leading edge nodes. A deadly 7.4 magnitude earthquake in April briefly halted production and led to a $92 million loss for TSMC. We're used to earthquakes. We are well prepared for earthquakes. We build for earthquakes. We've overbuilt this structure because we use the same designs as in Taiwan. Relying on chips from Asia has also kept the U.S. from full control over its position in the constant race for technological dominance. Being the global technology leader in AI is the most important thing to preserve over the next two decades for economic prosperity. That's why President Biden has hit the chip industry, with export controls meant to keep China from pulling ahead with advanced tech. But in October, TSMC alerted the U.S. that some of its chips were spotted in Huawei devices, despite bans on selling to the Chinese company. This problem is as old as time. There's a lot of complex rerouting of goods to different countries that have limited access to Leading edge or the most advanced technology. But of course, TSMC, a big, successful company, is supposed to be a good partner to the U.S. It is seen as extra problematic that that happened. And of course that's going to be monitored very carefully. We stopped shipment right on schedule. We're very law abiding. Just down the road in Chandler, Arizona, another chip giant-Intel-is also building two huge new fabs. The U.S. company's business model is far different - designing and manufacturing its own chips, while TSMC is what's known as a pure play foundry, only manufacturing chips for others. Cassidy says the relationship between the two is solid. We meet with them weekly and the feedback is, is we're helping them increase their ranks. We're helping them train on the most advanced stuff. So I think they're pretty happy with what we're doing. Both companies have delayed the timelines for full production at their new Arizona fabs. But where TSMC has remained the uncontested leader in advanced chips, Intel has stumbled time and again. They're in a tough spot, you know? And I don't want to see Intel go under like we need Intel. Intel is the largest recipient of funds from the $52 billion CHIPS act, signed by President Biden in 2022, meant to offset the incredible cost of building a fab to make chips in the U.S. TSMC has said the cost of U.S. construction could be at least four times what it would cost in Taiwan. Once complete, TSMC estimates all three fabs will cost $65 billion. If you take a look at the State Farm Glendale Stadium, that was roughly about $500 million. That $65 billion that we're committed to do on this site for three fabs means 130 Glendale stadiums, and that's a huge number. In November – after some complaints over delays - the Commerce Department finalized $7.9 billion for Intel, and days before, $6.6 billion for TSMC. So their deal is done completed. They're expanding hugely in Arizona. It's incredibly exciting. The race to complete the CHIPS Act deals has sped up in the weeks since the election. Trump criticized the CHIPS act as &quot;so bad&quot; in October, suggesting tariffs could be the answer instead. If there are tariffs, that will affect our customers, consumers and the broader economy, and we're at the foundational part of that economy where we are building chips that power data centers and computers and phones. So in that respect, everyone will be affected as well as TSMC. While federal funds start getting doled out to TSMC, Intel - and other recipients like Samsung, Micron, GlobalFoundries and Texas Instruments. They'll also be competing for another scarce resource in the U.S. chip industry: workers. When we finished the construction of this fab, it was really the first advanced manufacturing fab that had been built in the United States for at least ten years. And semiconductors is a very, very tough technology. You have to build upon what you learned in the previous node. And so once you stop with one particular node, you don't have the learnings to continue. The experience is just not here in the United States. So TSMC sent some 600 engineers to train in Taiwan – like Jeff Patz, who left in 2021 for an 18- month stint there. At the time, there was no facility in Arizona, and the purpose was to go and actually make things right? And learn how they're made. So you have to have a kitchen to cook, like to physically touch the $200 million piece of equipment. Like you can't do that anywhere other than at the Fab in Taiwan. Now, Patz has had the chance to see the EUV machines inside the new fab in Arizona too. I went in once very recently, and I think the 3 to 6 month gap of when I was on the construction team to where we are now, I think was astounding. It's like, oh, it looks like it did in Taiwan. TSMC plans to hire at least 6,000 workers by the time all three fabs are complete at the end of the decade. For engineers, we are actively recruiting at universities in Arizona and all across the U.S. ASU even has what they call a TSMC day. TSMC has also brought experts over from Taiwan on 3-year temporary assignments. Getting to meet like 20-30 year old industry veterans that brought us down from micron scale to nanometer scale, and get to have conversations with them about how we were going to do that in the U.S. We've brought that to Arizona. The biggest culture difference is Hawaiian Shirt Fridays, so we don't have that in Taiwan. Arizona, we have. Water scarcity, meanwhile, is something Taiwan. and Arizona have shared. A recent drought in Taiwan means TSMC is no stranger to recycling the massive amount of water it needs to make chips. TSMC says it will take 4.7 million gallons of water daily to run the first Arizona fab, but it will bring that demand down to 1 million gallons a day by recycling some 65% of that. We are working on an air WC in industrial reclamation water center. When we get that in place, we will have near zero discharge to waste, which means basically the only water we'll lose is through evaporation. Another concern: the massive amount of power it takes to make chips. TSMC did build solar on site –but it's not nearly enough to cover the 2.85 gigawatt-hours per day needed by the first fab –equivalent to the power used by roughly 100,000 U.S. homes. TSMC says it's purchasing renewable energy credits to offset all that. Still, amid the AI-fueled data center boom. Arizona's largest utility warned it could run out of transmission capacity before the end of the decade. That's also when TSMC plans to start production at its third Arizona fab. Fab 3, which you can't see, but it's down this way. It's probably going to be 2 nanometer and more advanced. The most advanced in the world? Most advanced in the world. Its global ambitions also reach far beyond Arizona. TSMC opened its first fab in Japan in February, broke ground on an $11 billion fab in Germany in August, and has been in talks about building in the United Arab Emirates – although nothing is concrete as TSMC navigates export controls on its chips into China, a UAE trading partner. Within the U.S., TSMC's plans are likely to grow too. What about other fabs in the future? There's space, right? Well, there's space for more. I don't want to speculate on what the future might bring, but we've got 1,100 acres here plus, so there's room for lots of fabs." />

George Thomas with this exclusive report getting to transnistria is no easy feat CBN News began the 5,000 m Journey from the East Coast stopping first in the tiny former Soviet Republic of moldova's capital chis now from there we drove along mova southe eastern border where Moscow has recently stirred up political turmoil we made our way through several Russian checkpoints through transnistria's Capital taspo where a huge statue of Lenin adorns the Town Square why did God call you to transnistria why yeah uh I don't know maybe because I'm um stupid enough the Lord put a burden on Yuri sanuk's heart to move his family to this volatile region in my heart I really uh I love people I like uh that is my passion serve to people I love God and I want to do something for him like all my life and after a while God told me Yuri I need you in one place that name is transnistria in 2000 Pastor Yuri his wife and three children decided to move from their home country in neighboring Ukraine to transnistria the first seven years of their ministry as a missionary family were not easy I was targeted by governments policemen KGB and guns the worse of course that is gunst because they tried to kill me they tried Kidnap My Children once I was kidnapped but praise God God let me escape this home video from May 2000 shows Simo first foray into preaching despite ongoing threats he continued to openly share the gospel often taking his message to areas controlled by gangs some gangsters they became Christian they became Evangelical their wives became Evangelical so they hatte it that's why they tried to stop us in 1990 transnistria broke away from mova to establish its own government currency and statehood and while it's not recognized by the International Community the Breakaway territory became economically politically and militarily dependent on the Kremlin Russia has some 2,000 troops stationed here moscow's agents soon began harassing pastor seuk but he was undeterred each morning I wake up and I I tell to myself Yuri you're still alive and you have one more day to preach gospel one more day you can do something for God's Kingdom from those humble and at times nerve-wracking Beginnings Church of Christ savior today is the largest congregation in transnistria oh we have unbelievable Revival so we're still alive 24 years later on the mission field we are still alive each Sunday hundreds pack the church with many hearing the gospel message for the very first time seuk says the secret to the church's growth is simple we love God we try to be very obedient into his words and to his spirit and because we love people we do everything what is possible to help [Applause] [Music] [Applause] people baptisms are a regular occurrence and during the week Church of Christ savior holds several youth programs for different age groups parents also get their Ministry time and when folks can't get to church members often hit the streets of teraso and neighboring cities holding Evangelistic rallies Sanuk says the church often reports signs wonders and miracles following the preaching of the gospel for example it's Can it can be cancer and cancer has disappeared or somebody has a problem with the vision God fix their Vision uh death people can hear I believe all this power in the gospel and all these Miracles happens because people preach the gospel that and God equip us for gospel to preach gospel make disciples meanwhile cbn's orphans promise partners with Church of Christ savior to run their School of Life project here in transnistria each week young people attend various classes including computer skills sewing photography English math and discipleship classes through Superbook some of the mothers [Music] take dance singing and cooking classes run by orphans promise volunteers many who attend cannot afford to pay so offens promise holds the classes for free in seo's church school of life we use the basement rooms and children they listen what's happened on the first floor when we have youth ministry teenagers Ministry Sunday Ministry and because that sound they join to the they just come to the sanctuary and they join to the church and after a while their parents join to the church so by that relationship with orphan promise we expand kingdom of God while the majority here would rather be part of Russia Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has many residents concerned that war could soon be on their doorstep as well Sanuk isn't afraid he plans to stay despite fears of conflict we know our God tell us

of the donkey we'll need some clean water quality animation relatable characters and translations in 60 languag es help Superbook reach children worldwide by drawing them into the power of God's word much of the dialogue is direct dialogue from the Bible lot of care making sure that there's biblical accuracy so we know that when kids watch super book they're getting a very very strong spiritual foundation and biblical Foundation it's the combination they're watching they're seeing themselves inside the stories they're relating to the characters and all of a sudden they believe they believe not only in the message but the lessons that they're learning that they can now apply to their lives on a daily basis it's that combination that we believe so many are finding God in the midst of their situations and learning how to trust him when kids believe they accept [Music] Christ according to projections from an audience survey last year more than 500 million viewers AR around the world watched at least one episode and more than 350 million report they saying the Salvation poem at the end of this show we know that the word of God changes lives and because Superbook is full of the word of God we see spiritual transformation happen when an episode is watched that spiritual birth not only changes Hearts it can change entire outlooks on life across multiple Generations we often hear about children who are involved in delinquent Behavior becoming excellent students in school we see children who pray in faith for their parents to not go through with a divorce and something changes in their favor they are transformed and then that transformation leads to them acting out their Christianity they begin to pray for their family they pray for their friends they pray for their parents Superbook is reaching families and so many times the door of Entry is through the heart of a child who has first recognized and accepted Jesus as Lord and then begins to pray for their parents Halfway Around the World Regional director Vana Boule sees super book as an Evangelistic fixture in her country of Croatia super book is used as as a as a tool as a resource in probably every single School in Croatia I mean those are thousands and thousands and thousands of children so those children fall in love with Gizmo and Joy and Chris Superbook is also growing in the place where so many kids hang out their phones it is why the app has been downloaded more than 35 million times the most coming from the US India and Brazil it is a strategic move on multiple levels as kids have count L options for video and many pointing them away from Christ there are specific worldviews under ging the content that's being put out there and then the devices are handed to children to sort of babysit them for a little while um so that the parents can get something done and then those children are being influenced what better thing to influence children with than the word of God and the love of Jesus Through the medium that is going to connect with them the best which is [Music] animation research shows that the biggest predictor of kids having a healthy Faith later on in life is Bible engagement it is one more reason why Superbook can make an eternal impact by Paving the way for a lifelong relationship with Christ Heather cells CBN News love it thanks Heather up next Revival in the UK Church growth is up prayer meetings are packed and people are on fire for the Lord welcome back reports of Revival are spreading across the United Kingdom the movement is marked by an increase in prayer as well as an increase in the number of healings One Pastor describes feeling the tangible presence of God Across the Nation take a look when God is here The Impossible becomes possible something has shifted in the last six months and it's it fails almost like it's a rising River Pastor Craig Cooney of Hope Church in Northern Ireland believes the spiritual drought brought on by the pandemic is over between 20 and 2023 I found myself often saying that I've never seen the church at such a low AB that it just felt like we were going through the motions postco it was just a lack of zil a lack of passion a lack of enthusiasm a lack of growth something shifted around the start of this year I would say and it's difficult to describe or toine Cooney who also reaches more than a 100,000 people on Instagram says the most noticeable change is a tangible presence of God as well as an increase in the number of healings there's this sense of God is in the room that has been birthed out of and is probably birthed prayer an increase in prayer and we have seen that in our own church about 20% of our church now come to our weekly prayer meeting it's at 6:00 p.m. on a weddingday it's not a convenient time but it's just an a of solid intercession and there's just people crying out for the lost people crying out for their families and every single week wow we are getting testimonies of healing from people who might not even 6 months ago believed in Divine Healing it's the people who when they say they're hailed you know they're hailed because they wouldn't be making this stuff up Reverend Liz Doyle founder and director of she leads America just returned from England where she prayed with a group inside Windsor Castle and as we were in St George's Chapel praying I felt the Lord speak to me and say I'm going to bring Revival into this place we were there for three days and three nights with 30 of our British counterparts Genesis chapter 28 is uh what the the vicer was was reading from that day Jacob's Latter and right next to us is Queen Elizabeth's grave wow and I felt that when he began to read uh Genesis chapter 2813 to5 if you read it it'll say on the ground where you're laid I'm gonna you know I'm going to bless the generations and I felt the Lord was saying I am going to begin to work in your children's lives Queen Elizabeth and they're going to be a blessing to the world Doyle and her husband pastored in England for 25 years and for her this was a full circle moment as she felt the Lord saying I'm going to bring you back to the land and give you the things I've promised and we left about 25 years ago so those two things came together and I just understood it to be that the Lord was going to move in St George's Chapel signs of Revival are also sprouting in neighboring [Music] Scotland in June Reverend Franklin Graham brought his God loves you tour to Glasgow it is good to be in Glasgow wow where more than 7,000 people turned doubt with many giving their lives to Christ you see God loves you and he's willing to forgive our sins but we have to come to him his way and that's through the cross of Jesus Christ I went up tonight because finally so powerful in he World it just he say up out your seat I had to get up out seat I had to get there I didn't realize it was going to be a 2 or 3,000 people by me gives me anxiety I I didn't care I'm going I'm going give it to the frost for Cooney this is a season he's waited a long time to see I kind of feel like the Lord says you will get what you go after and and there's this sense where I felt him say go after hailing go after haing and so we've gone after that in the first five months of this year our church has grown by about 30% 3 incredible 30% and we have done nothing different so are we in a Revival then I was thinking of Elijah where he keeps sending the servant back to see if there's rain coming and he said the seventh time I see a cloud the size of a man's heart and I believe what the Lord is saying is there's a cloud I'm I'm I'm showing you what's available and I'm showing you what's possible and I'm showing you what I would Delight to give you and I'm calling my people to prayer and I'm calling my people to Consecration and I'm calling my people to to a deeper level of commitment and if you will pursue me I will come for [Music]

          <attvalue for="7" value="well welcome to the 700 Club israeli fighter jets bombed Hezbollah drone factories in Beirut yesterday and Gaza has become even more complicated israel is turning to an unlikely source for help in defeating Hamas in Gaza julie Stall brings us the latest developments from Jerusalem israel has been arming a family clan sometimes called the militia in Gaza in order to strengthen opposition to Hamas israeli opposition leader Avidor Lieberman leaked that information to Israeli media and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not deny the report on the advice of security officials we activated clients in Gaza that oppose kamas what's wrong with this this is only good and saves the lives of IDF soldiers the publication of this only benefits kamas but Lieberman doesn't care the group led by Yaser Abu Shabbab has been documented operating in an area near the Kum Shalom border crossing that is under Israeli military control and where aid trucks enter Gaza it has about 300 members which Hamas sees as a thorn in its flesh that report comes as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has closed all of its aid distribution sites in Gaza for now saying they will be reopened later the sites were closed after shootings near the aid locations earlier this week meanwhile Israel has assured the US it will not strike Iran's nuclear facilities unless President Trump makes it clear that negotiations with Iran have failed according to Axios but in another sign that Iran is building up its military program the Wall Street Journal reports Iran has ordered material from China for hundreds of ballistic missiles president Trump says he cautioned Netanyahu not to launch an attack on Iran while talks are ongoing but Trump also said his stand could change with a phone call if talks with Iran aren't making progress in another show of US support for Israel Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced sanctions against four judges on the International Criminal Court saying they are directly involved in the Hague's efforts to prosecute Israeli and US nationals for alleged war crimes in Gaza the decision follows Hungary's earlier move to withdraw from the IC rather than arrest Netanyahu when he came to visit if you check the uh the voting records at the UN General Assembly you will find a few countries just a few countries from Europe opposing every and each anti-Israeli anti-Zionist resolution hungary is among those countries and in Lebanon Israel warned Lebanese civilians to leave specific areas before it struck Hezbollah drone production sites and storage facilities in Beirut and southern Lebanon used by the Hezbollah aerial unit the IDF says Hezbollah has launched more than a thousand explosive and reconnaissance UAVs at Israel since the beginning of the war the IDF says Hezbollah is working to produce thousands of drones under the direction and funding of Iranian terrorists as part of Iran's efforts to harm the state of Israel julie Stall CBN News Jerusalem well I'm sorry to report that the food distribution in Gaza has been shut down because of uh these Palestinian groups that have been armed and whether it's Hamas or this other group that was apparently cooperating with the IDF uh what they're doing is they're shooting Palestinians who are trying to get to the humanitarian aid and so the uh all the aid had to be shut down for the safety of the people you don't want to have a choice of you're going to be shot to death or you're going to get food it just it it just it's incredible to me that Israel would uh cooperate with some kind of militia gang in in Gaza on the theory that well the enemy of my enemy is is my friend and and we need some kind of counterbalancing force against Hamas this isn't the first time in Israel's history that this has happened as Israel withdrew from uh southern Lebanon back in the 1980s uh they had a similar alliance with militias in southern Lebanon that didn't work out and it's not going to work out in Gaza today there's a biblical precedent as well a king of Judah uh tried to hire other soldiers uh from Israel and in that a prophet of God came and warned them and this is the warning from 2 Chronicles 25:8 if you let them go with your troops into battle you will be defeated by the enemy no matter how well you fight God will overthrow you for he has the power to help you or to trip you up israel needs to be clean from this kind of activity not arming other militias in Gaza in some vain hope that it'll counterbalance Hamas the key for peace in Gaza is disarmament you that's not allowed to have weapons inside of Israel you have to be either part of the police or part of the IDF and that same standard should be the standard for Gaza we're seeing the aftermath of it where the humanitarian aid the food that was needed by the citizens of Gaza is now stopped because of this alliance let's not continue it i hope they shut it down and shut it down very quickly in other news one of the largest pro-Israel events in the US has been postponed indefinitely because of growing terror threats john Jessup has that story and more from our CBN news bureau in Washington john thanks Gordon the event called the Israel Summit was expected to draw more than a thousand people from across the United States and by live stream organizers had already uh had to move the event once because of threats israel Summit organizer Luke Hilton told CBN News what happened there were groups of jihadi Americans i mean honestly there's nothing else to call them because this is now uh spreading all across America calling to target quote target the Israel Summit and to target the venue and the organization that was hosting us and unfortunately because of this there was just no other option except to uh indefinitely postpone next week's Israel Summit um what it feels like is that Jews and Christians can no longer gather publicly in support of Israel and America despite postponing Hilton promises there will be a bigger better Israel summit in the US where people won't be afraid to come together to support Israel for more on this story and the full interview you can go to cbnnews.com well possible signs of a break in the war of words between President Trump and Elon Musk politico is reporting White House aid scheduled a phone call today to possibly broker peace between the two other political allies are also supporting a truce with Musk signaling his potential willingness to go along cbn's Charlene Aaron brings us this look at how the verbal battle escalated after months of solidarity and mutual praise between the two leaders the rift began with Musk's criticism of President Trump's big beautiful bill with both men engaging in a war of words on social media this massive outrageous pork filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination Musk posted on X Tuesday trump responding by saying Musk knew what was in the package i'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here better than you people he knew everything about it he had no problem with it all of a sudden he had a problem and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV minted but Musk says he was never shown the bill after the president said he knew what was in it musk who reportedly spent at least $250 million to help reelect Trump went on to claim &quot;Without me Trump would have lost the election.&quot; Something the president denies i think I would have won susie would say I would have won Pennsylvania easily anyway the president also posting &quot;Elon was wearing thin i asked him to leave i took away his EV mandate that forced everybody to buy electric cars that nobody else wanted that he knew I was going to do and he just went crazy trump also threatening to terminate Musk's government subsidies and contracts a move that could devastate the billionaire's bottom line tesla's stock sank Thursday on news of Musk and Trump's falling out in response Musk said he would decommission the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft a capsule used to take astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station but he later backed away from the idea musk also dropped what he called the really big bomb claiming that President Trump has ties to Jeffrey Epstein who was accused of sex trafficking musk didn't offer any proof but said the truth would come out when asked about the issue the president did not respond mr president the former head of Doge also suggested support for a new third party &quot;it's time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle,&quot; Musk wrote in a post on X meanwhile political observers expected a likely breakup between two such powerful personalities but maybe not in such a public fashion now many Republicans and conservatives are hoping that a reconciliation might be possible charlene Aaron CBN News thank you Charlene well right here in Washington the Supreme Court ruled nine to nothing Thursday that a Catholic charity in Wisconsin cannot be forced to pay unemployment taxes when other religious groups are exempt state officials argued the organization did not qualify for an exemption because its day-to-day work doesn't involve religious teachings the high court sided with a Catholic charities group after the organization argued the state violated its First Amendment guarantee of freedom of religion well locals say a move of God is stirring in upstate South Carolina and they're calling it the beginning of a revival it's bringing churches from across the state together for a big crusade this weekend cbn's Wendy Griffith has the story i believe you died for me evangelist Jacob Eversoul of World Harvest Ministry says something special is happening in upstate South Carolina what's happening right now is something that we couldn't even

overseas you know there's been prophetic words that the upstate of South Carolina would be a light unto the nations and uh we are starting to step into that now eversol an international evangelist who's preached all over the world said it was time to shine the light of Christ in his hometown the event starts that night June 6th at 7 but every night uh starting at 5:30 we're going to feed the city we're trying to feed you know 3 to 4,000 people per night it's something that the churches have come together to pull off it's a massive undertaking if you want to be a part of the gospel choir come early every night before 7 and we're going to worship together and what's so unique about this event is the unity congregations big and small crossing racial and denominational lines to preach the gospel literally churches from from Spartanber County the inner city uh where the crusade's going to happen have come together all different backgrounds denominations uh breaking down racial barriers it's the Lord doing it but it's it's it's it's definitely been something that we've worked very hard for their main goal to see as many people come to Jesus as possible and Jacob you're not

          <attvalue for="7" value="faith and Pope Leo the 14th. First month at the helm of the Catholic Church, we are joined by a leading Catholic voice in American journalism today. Ross Douthat is an opinion columnist for The New York Times, where he often reflects on the intersection of faith, culture and public life. A prolific writer, Douthat is also author of the new book Believe Why Everyone Should Be Religious, and he offers a blueprint for how someone can think their way from doubt to faith into belief. Ross, thank you so much for being here. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for having me. It's a pleasure. &gt;&gt; I want to start off now with a big picture look at our religious landscape right now. According to Pew Research Center, 62% of US adults identify as Christian. That's a 9% drop from 2014. And meanwhile, 29% of US adults are not affiliated with any religion today, a 6% increase from 2014. Though it does seem the decline of Christianity has somewhat plateaued in recent years. But tell us about why you think we're seeing these trends, and what do you hope your book addresses in this moment? &gt;&gt; I think what you already mentioned it right, that we are in this kind of interesting plateau in after a long period of institutional religious decline and secularization. So if you go back to the turn of the 21st century, the year 2000, and run the clock forward, you get like 15 or 20 years where year in, year out, the number of people identifying as Christian declines, the number of people going to church , going to mass declines. And then around the time of the pandemic or thereafter, it was like it hit a kind of limit. And for the last 4 or 5 years, you've had a certain kind of stabilization. And what I like to say to people is, it's not that America is having a religious revival, it's more that we're considering whether to have a religious revival. So you have a surge of interest in religion, and some of that shows up in traditional faiths. Some of it shows up in everything from UFOs to psychedelics. But it's a very unsettled but curious landscape. And the book I wrote is trying to be written. It's trying to work into that landscape, to basically say to a lot of people who were raised without religion, like, we're not dealing with lapsed Catholics anymore, right? I mean, we are, but we're not. But we're dealing with a generation, many of whom have come of age with no connection to institutional faith at all. They're interested, they're curious, but it's like, well, what is this religion thing anyway? Right. &gt;&gt; Well, and I want to hit on bring in some of that data that you hit on there. Is this yes. That trend in plateau of religiously unaffiliated. But many U.S. Dioceses this year saw an increase in the number of converts. If you look at the Diocese of Cleveland, about a 50% growth in converts from last year. Diocese of Winona, Rochester, Minnesota, up 67%. Diocese of San Angelo in Texas, up about 56%. That's just to name a few. So you don't think there's necessarily a revival going on per se. But what what do you think this speaks to? &gt;&gt; Well, and you have numbers like that actually in Western Europe as well. France has seen record numbers of adult baptisms. The United Kingdom, there's been data showing suggesting that generation Z, the youngest generation, is more likely to be churchgoing than generation X or the millennial generation at this point. But yeah, I think I think it speaks to that, that renewed interest. And in that sense, I think above all that, you know, certain promises were made about what a more secular world was supposed to look like. If you go back to the early 2000 and the heyday of the New Atheists figures like Richard Dawkins and so on, there was a sense that, well, of course, once we, you know, get rid of these hidebound Bronze Age superstitions, everyone will get along better. Politics will be less polarized, science will be held in higher esteem, and sociologically, people will be happier. Kids won't be afraid of going to hell, things like that. And obviously none of that has happened, right? The country is more divided, more polarized, and there's just more, frankly, existential angst that people have. Again, not surprisingly, in the absence of a supernatural horizon. So you have a lot of people, some of whom are coming into the church, others who are sort of exploring around the edges, who are reacting to that environment. &gt;&gt; Many people are hoping that Pope Leo, being a US born pope, will himself bring a bit of a revival of Catholicism in the US. What do you think about that? &gt;&gt; Well, you know, I'm from New Haven, Connecticut, where we have the body of blessed Michael McGivney, the founder of the Knights of Columbus. Right. So there's a hope fervently expressed by my parish priests after the new pope's election, that there would be a canonization of Michael McGivney and the pope would come to New Haven, Connecticut. So I have to say, if he comes to New Haven, if he comes to New Haven, an American revival is assured. &gt;&gt; Well, that's you. Maybe the Holy Father is listening. &gt;&gt; Maybe he. Maybe he is. &gt;&gt; Ross. The day after Pope Leo was elected, you wrote in the New York Times about the cultural state that we're in right now, the church that he has inherited. And you wrote in part, this is a much weirder landscape than the one in which liberal and conservative Catholics clash over contraception or gay marriage. And it's likely to get weirder still as we move deeper into a digital and virtual and artificial intelligence mediated existence. Can you expand on that? What is this weird landscape that Pope Leo now has to navigate? &gt;&gt; Well, he's already said, right? That one reason he took the name Leo was because Leo the 13th, the last pope with that name, was Pope at a time of huge industrial and technological transformation and sort of offered a distinctively Catholic witness for that age. And the Holy Father has said, you know, we're in a similar moment, potentially with artificial intelligence and digital life, and the church has to figure out what it wants to say about those set of issues. So it's not that the older culture war issues have gone away. It's not that abortion doesn't matter or anything like that, but there is this landscape that people live in online, disconnected or connected in new ways. Right? That is, I think, clearly perilous to the soul in various ways. It has deep effects on family and marriage and community, where you're trying to figure out how to raise kids in this environment. And there are fundamental questions of morality and spirituality that are bound up in how you relate to your phone. And I think it is really important for the church to figure out what to say about it. Like right now, you know, there's no bigger obstacle to people having kids and having families. Some people think, than digital life. Right? So it's not, you know, Humanae Vitae in the 60s is writing about contraception as an impediment to Christian marriage. You know, I'm not saying we're getting an encyclical about the iPhone as an impediment to Christian marriage, but like that, that is the kind of weird. That's one weird zone. The other weird zone is that there's just more interest in the supernatural. And again, this sort of is operating outside often of traditional religious paradigms, its people into UFOs, its people into all kinds of do it yourself spirituality. And there too, the church is kind of used to talking to a secular audience and saying, oh, you know, come on, you know, God really exists and so on. Now it's often talking to people who are like, oh, I believe in a spirit world. People who have sort of recognized in some ways without returning to Christianity. And that is itself a different challenge. &gt;&gt; Pope Leo is the first pope who personally had social media, so he probably has some insight into these conversations that are happening. It's been 12 years already since the release of your widely acclaimed book, Bad Religion How We Became a Nation of Heretics. You wrote in 2013 about how Christianity in the U.S. Had been taken over, not so much by atheism, but by heresy. Ross. Is that still the case today? What's changed here in the U.S. In the past 12 years? &gt;&gt; I think a lot of that landscape still exists. Right. So I was writing a lot about certain forms of prosperity gospel theology, sort of self-help spirituality that are kind of Christian ish, have sort of Christian elements, but end up being idolatrous in various ways, idolatrous towards money and materialism, idolatrous towards the imperial self. And look, I think you can look around American culture and say, all of that is still around. I do think, though, that there has been a shift where as Christianity institutionally has declined, and it has in since. Since then, you really do have a bit more, frankly, post-Christian spirituality. So if I was writing the book now, I wouldn't just be talking about heresy, right? I would be talking about forms of religion that just aren't Christian anymore and that are sort of or people. A different way to put it is that there are a lot of people seeking higher powers that are maybe different powers from the God of the Old and New Testament, and you see that in religion, you see it in artificial intelligence, where people are very self-consciously trying to build a kind of machine God. And all of that is what is new and novel, I think, in the landscape relative to ten years ago. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You were in Rome recently for the inaugural mass of Pope Leo the 14th, as we mark the first month of his pontificate, what have been your first impressions of Pope Leo so far? &gt;&gt; I mean, first of all, just to get elected pope without having anyone outside the world of intense Catholic media and even some people within that world have any kind of clear and definite impression of him, suggests a really interesting kind of dark horse sort of figure who's very good at making different groups of people feel heard and understood and very good, hopefully at promoting a certain kind of unity, which was the watchword of his, his, his words. And, you know, at the initial mass and elsewhere, you know, obviously there were a lot of conservative and traditionalist Catholics who were frustrated or anxious at various moments in the era of Pope Francis. And I think one of the lessons of the reaction to Pope Leo from people in those camps, when, you know, he hasn't really done all that much. Right. He's just it's been one month, but there's so far this sense of just sort of relief at a feeling of kind of stability and normalcy in the papal office, which tells you that, in fact, you know, the pope does not have to, you know, assume the chair of Saint Peter and immediately anathematize, you know, an entire flank of the Catholic Church in order for in order for conservative Catholics to feel just a little more relaxed. And I think that's the sense that I see a sense of greater relaxation among conservatives without, I should say, more liberal Catholics, having anything to be particularly freaked out about or anxious about. Now, all of that will change as actual dilemmas and controversies present themselves. But so far, I think he's been a tremendously unifying figure. And it helps that he's he's an American. I mean, one of the interesting, you know, behind the scenes claims about the conclave. And of course, we can't know any of this for sure. But one of the claims is that the American cardinals ended up sort of uniting behind the new pope. Now, the American cardinals, as you know, do not agree about very much. Right? It is a you know, we think of them as sort of a polarized group divided between more liberal and more conservative figures. So just that unity behind an American candidate is really striking. &gt;&gt; And I want to stay on this theme of unity. I mean, his episcopal motto, Pope Leo's is in the one Christ, we are one. So in your opinion, what should Pope Leo prioritize early on if he does, in fact want to bring about unity and healing in our divided church? &gt;&gt; I mean, I, I think that, you know, when Pope Francis before before his election. Right, gave gave a sort of gave remarks right that were that were often quoted and they were about the idea that the church can't just sort of be turned in on itself. Right. It has to go outward. And in many ways, Pope Francis was admirable and impressive in doing that, but often in the controversies that he wanted to open up, where it's like, we're going to have a synod on this and a synod on that and so on. It ended up sort of becoming almost like a circular firing squad within the Catholic Church, where it was like, we're going to now, we're going to have the argument about, you know, female deacons or something, and everybody turns on everybody else and fights. And I think avoiding that, avoiding sort of reopening arguments and reopening wounds and looking for places. And again, we were talking about changing landscape of digital life, artificial intelligence, things that people are anxious and concerned about, figuring out what the church says outward to the world that almost all Catholics can agree upon and bear witness to. I think that's the optimal goal for a kind of initial agenda for a new pontificate. &gt;&gt; It's been four years now since Pope Francis released his papal document Traditionis Custodes, which imposed severe restrictions on the celebration of the mass in Latin. Some might argue that these restrictions, which were intended for unity, in fact brought about greater division. What action do you think Pope Leo would? &gt;&gt; Some would argue that, yes. &gt;&gt; And you might argue that as well. What action does Pope Leo need to take, in your opinion, on Traditionis Custodes, and how much should he prioritize this early on? &gt;&gt; I think that there is an argument that because, in fact, that document was not received in the same way in every diocese, that there were lots and lots of bishops and archbishops who thought that it would lead to more division if they cracked down on the Latin Mass in various ways, that that that means that in a sense, the Pope could just sort of leave things alone a bit and basically say, all right, you know, we issued this document or my predecessor issued this document, but really it's up to the local church, and Rome is just not going to put pressure on people to enforce it, which seemed to be quite often what was happening. Now, of course, you then have cases like we've just seen in Charlotte, North Carolina, where you would still have specific bishops and specific local churchmen who decide that, no, they're they're going to use the document as a reason, a reason to crack down. And that is where I think a sort of hands off policy doesn't work. In the end, the Pope has to decide if he's going to place a few phone calls. I don't think I would not expect to see a formal rollback of the document. I think the more likely expectation is a kind of hands off approach, with some targeted moves to tell bishops that, in fact, the Vatican is not enthused about further crackdowns. Yeah, that would be my guess. But I'm I'm I'm just speculating. &gt;&gt; How do you anticipate Pope Leo and we've had on this already being the first U.S. Born pope. How do you anticipate that might affect U.S. Vatican relations? &gt;&gt; I mean, I think in part it just depends on what happens in US politics, right? I mean, we have two different political parties that each have areas of tension with the Vatican. I would expect, you know, under Donald Trump, there would continue to be tension between the Vatican's view and Washington's view on some issues related to migration. Obviously, if you get a Democratic president, the old issues of abortion and others become more important. I think the more important question is what it says, what the American model of Catholicism means for the world. Right? Because we've we've lived through a long era in the 19th and early 20th century where American Catholicism was seen by a lot of Catholics elsewhere, this kind of outlier, where the normal thing is for Catholicism to be kind of a semi-established, deeply culturally rooted church. And the American church, well, they're out there sort of making things up as they go along in a pluralist society. But in fact, in the 21st century, everyone is living in a pluralist society. Everywhere is basically American in that sense, even cultures that have these, you know, ancient roots in Catholicism. And I think to be optimistic, you would say that, look, we've elected an American pope for a time when if the church is going to flourish in France or Germany or South Korea or the Philippines or Africa or anywhere else, the way it's flourished in America is deeply relevant. There's not we're not going back to a world where, you know, you just have the Polish Catholic, you're Polish and you're Catholic, you're Croatian and you're Catholic. That world is gone. And the American model of sort of Catholic witness under pluralist conditions is here to stay. And now we have a pope forged by that reality. &gt;&gt; Well, related to that, the day after Pope Leo's inaugural mass, you sat down with U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance in Rome for your podcast, Interesting Times. And it was right after Vance met privately with Pope Leo. And the discussion hit on this tension that exists between Trump administration policy and what the Vatican thinks, especially relevant because Vance himself is a convert to Catholicism. And I want to play just part of your exchange with Vance for our viewers. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to pretend that I haven't struggled with some of this, that I haven't thought about whether, you know, we're doing the precisely right thing. So it's a fair point. And I know that you think you've you've got me trapped here. &gt;&gt; I don't think I. &gt;&gt; Have, you know I'm not. &gt;&gt; All right. Let me let me be perfectly honest. I'm not interested in in having you trapped. I we're having a conversation in Rome as a journalist and a vice president, but also as two Catholics. &gt;&gt; I'm. &gt;&gt; And I'm. I'm interested. &gt;&gt; Ross. Trust me, I think it's to be clear. I think it's a totally fair question. I'm interested in what. &gt;&gt; Politics does to people, to know. &gt;&gt; Okay. Your soul. &gt;&gt; It's always painful to watch your own, your own interviews slightly. &gt;&gt; But I feel that every week. But but Ross, based on your interview with Vice President Vance, what did you make of how Vance sees his role as a Catholic? You as vice president who has to be mindful of the Vatican's opinions? &gt;&gt; I mean, I think it's, you know, it's a tremendous challenge, right? Especially because he's vice president. He's not president. Right. So there's always a certain kind of tension between, again, being an elected politician in a pluralist, non-Catholic society and trying to be faithful to the teachings of the church. And that, again, has showed up most sharply for Democratic politicians and debates about abortion. But it has showed up for politicians of both parties in many cases over the years. When you're vice president, though, you aren't fully, you know, you aren't fully in control of your own agenda, right? So there's that there's that issue as well. And the vice president was trying to talk, I think about the idea that you're trying to basically find, especially on issues like immigration, where the church sort of has general principles but doesn't offer you a specific policy brief. You're trying to find a way to make sure that your views are influenced by what the Vatican is saying and by your obligations as a Catholic without again, assuming that there's like this five point Vatican plan that you have to put into operation. But look, I think I was pressing him because I think there is some real tensions here, especially in things the Trump administration has done in terms of sending people to the somewhat famous prison in El Salvador and so on, where I think a Vatican critique of the white House would carry some weight. And the vice president, you know, in this weird dual role, has to has to wrestle with that. &gt;&gt; Just two more questions for you, Ross. Ross, I think there are some Catholics who they look askance to converts to the faith, as if their opinions are not yet well formed enough to contribute to the greater Catholic conversation. Our vice president is a convert. You are a convert, which you detail more about in your book. Believe. How do you strike a balance as a convert between quietly contemplating an aspect of the faith and seeking formation, with then going out there and boldly speaking the truth? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, look, some some of the hostility to converts is just a matter of the fact that in this moment, a lot of vocal converts have tended to be more politically conservative. And so it ended up being this sort of part of the weird liberal conservative divide, right, where complaining about converts talking too soon, or speaking out of turn is a way to sort of complain about a conservative tendency or trend in the church without saying that exactly . At the same time, obviously you have cases where, you know, people become Catholic and six months later, you know, they're they they've discovered in, you know, a 13th century text that in fact, you know, the, the, the entire Western world owes total political obedience to the Pope. And good news, everyone, you're all you know, you're all in a state of heresy and mortal sin. I, the convert, have discovered it. So there's there has to be some kind of balance. Look. And I don't think anybody strikes it perfectly. I became a Catholic as a teenager because my family did. So I think of myself as being in the unusual position of being neither a cradle Catholic nor a true adult convert. But maybe, you know, maybe a bridge sometimes between between the two categories. But we have I think what's definitely true is that the, the pluralism of the world, the fact that the church exists in a highly competitive and fractured religious landscape, inevitably spills over into the internal life of the church. And you have arguments among Catholics at a pitch, including arguments that implicate the Holy Father himself. I've made some of these arguments myself in the past, maybe sometimes unwisely, right, that, you know, that are different from the kind of arguments that Catholics were having in the Catholic culture of 1957 or so. And there's a real temptation in that to sort of go too far and end up, you know, sort of failing at charity in profound ways. And just when I think about my own writing on the church, I sort of move back and forth between periods of intense engagement. And then I'm like, all right, this has gone a little bit too far. And maybe it's bad for my spiritual life. And I sort of pull back and but, but you're always you're always trying to find that balance because the church, a divided church is worth fighting over, right? You have to be willing to have fights and not just pretend to unity like we're all in the Communist Party and in 1937, and we're getting handed a handed a line that we all have to obey. It doesn't doesn't work quite like that. Catholicism is always somewhat contested, but I'm not giving you a full answer. I'm just saying you're always trying to find the right balance between sort of submitting your will and intellect and using your will and intellect in zones where things are uncertain and contested. &gt;&gt; It's a good reminder for us all. And finally, Ross, here we are, marking the first month of Pope Leo's pontificate. So if you had to look so far, what are the three words you would use to describe Pope Leo the 14th? &gt;&gt; I would describe him as so far unifying, charming, and I'm going to append a adjective so it'll be four words, but mildly inscrutable, which I think is also has been sort of part of the reason he was elected pope in the first place. There is still a hint of mystery to who the Pope definitively is and what he definitively thinks, and there may be a long period of time where that mystery gradually unfolds in the life of the church. &gt;&gt; Well, we're grateful for your voice along the way. Ross Douthat, author of Believe Why Everyone Should Be Religious. &gt;&gt; Everyone, everyone, everyone. Thank you, thank you." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="thank you everybody for joining and let me thank uh the many of you around the country who have attended the fighting oligarchy tours uh that we have been doing over the last two months uh as you may know so far uh we've been to Nebraska Iowa Wisconsin Michigan Nevada Colorado and Arizona and the turnouts I am very happy to tell you have been extraordinary uh well over a 100,000 people combined uh have come out uh and Republicans surprise surprise are taking notice they are quite concerned uh both Trump and Musk have had to respond and not surprisingly they've responded with lies uh Mr must claim that many of the 34,000 people who came out to our Denver rally were paid organizers and Trump was busy boasting falsely that his turnouts were always larger than ours not quite the case uh on Saturday this Saturday uh the next phase of the Fighting oligarchy tour begins uh Alexandria Accaziocortez and I will be starting off in Los Angeles uh we'll then be going to Utah Idaho back to California to two rural areas in in conservative districts and then we'll be finishing up in Montana uh and most of these events will be held in uh congressional districts that are represented by Republicans and there is a reason why we are doing that uh let me say a few words about what we hope to accomplish uh with these events number one uh in these extraordinarily difficult and depressing times I want people in the communities that we visit and people throughout the country to understand that they are not alone when they feel outraged by what Trump is doing to our country in fact when they stand there amidst thousands and thousands of their neighbors in opposition to oligarchy opposition to authoritarianism and xenophobia and attacks on the working class they very quickly understand that they are not part of some fringe minority uh who are opposing Trump but that they belong to a strong majority of Americans who want this country to move in a very different direction than where Trump is taking us uh what Trump and his friends claim they have this huge mandate nothing you can do about it and what these rallies are doing is proving them wrong and providing hope uh for people all across this country uh secondly uh what we do in these rallies is that given the nature of corporate media and the dominance of big money over the two major political parties the Democrats and the Republicans it is vitally important that we provide a progressive political and economic analysis that many people around the country have really never heard uh and one of the main reasons uh that the establishment is able to maintain the rigged economic and political systems that we have is they do that by deflecting attention away from the most pressing problems that working people face every single day and when people are not provided with rational explanations as to what's going on in their lives and in the world in which they live you know they say &quot;Nobody understands what I'm going through everybody you know is full of crap and why should I participate in the political process?&quot; And that is my friends exactly what the moneyed interests want they want you to give up they want you to believe that there are no solutions to the problems that we face let me give you just a few examples of how the establishment functions in that regard now I want you to stay with me here when is the last time that you heard a serious discussion or any discussion at all on television about the unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality that we're currently experiencing today in America three people three people Musk Bezos and Zuckerberg combined own more wealth than the bottom half of American society 170 million people think that's an important issue yeah I do i think that's maybe the most important issue that we face from an economic perspective but we don't talk about it you're not going to see that on TV you can watch TV 24 hours a day it is not going to be discussed because the people who own the networks don't want serious discussion about the immorality and the economic injustice that takes place when so few own so much and so few have so little and I'll tell you something else that we don't talk about but we do in these rallies and that is in the richest country in the history of the world which we are today 60% of our people live paycheck to paycheck and workingass Americans as a result of the stress they experience daily just trying to survive trying to put food on the table workingclass people have a sevenyear shorter life expectancy than the wealthy in other words being working class in America is a death sentence do you hear anybody talking about that horror i don't and we do and that's what I talk about when we go on this fighting oligarchy tour we talk about the reality that in America today unbelievably over 20% of senior citizens in this country are trying to survive on less than $15,000 a year think about it 80 90 years of age trying to get by on less than $15,000 a year we talk about the fact that some 800,000 people in America are homeless and 20 million Americans including many of you are spending 40 50% of your limited incomes on housing we talk about the fact that in America we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth all taking place in the richest country in the history of the world do you hear folks talking about it they don't and it's important that we talk about it so that people have an understanding of what is going on and why it is going on right now as I think all of you know progressives understand our current campaign finance system is absolutely corrupt corrupt as a result of Citizens United billionaires are able to spend unlimited amounts of money in the political process so Elon Musk spends $270 million to elect Trump as president and surprise surprise he gets the most important position in government only cost him 270 million that's not bad but it's not just Musk and it's not just Trump uh it is billionaires in the Democratic party who threaten uh candidates for from all over the country that if they speak to the real issues facing working people they're not going to get the campaign financing that they need so we have a corrupt campaign finance system that is hardly talked about at all but it is destroying American democracy well guess what we talk about it and we're going to help lead the fight with your support to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision in addition to what I've just said there's another reason why we're going around the country and that is it is absolutely imperative right now this moment that we mobilize Americans to defeat Trump's what is called the reconciliation bill uh that will provide over $1 trillion in tax breaks to the top 1% and pay for that by making massive cuts to Medicaid nutrition and other programs that working families desperately need these guys on top these oligarchs really have no shame uh their religion is greed uh and they want more and more and more uh and if they have to throw millions of kids off of the health insurance they have through Medicaid if they have to make it impossible for seniors to get into a nursing home because Medicaid pays a lot of that if they have to uh destroy or devastate our primary health care system by cutting funding for community health centers and Medicaid provides a lot of that funding that is what they will do so right now we're mobilizing people all over this country to tell their members of Congress do not vote for this reconciliation bill uh which will provide massive tax breaks uh to the very richest people in this country and cutting the programs that working families need further uh while it is absolutely imperative that we as progressives every single day go on the attack against Trump's horrific agenda and his authoritarianism it is equally important that we bring forth a bold agenda for the future we are again not only are we the richest country on earth there is as all of you know an explosion taking place in technology in terms of artificial uh intelligence and robotics the job you have will likely not be there in 10 or 15 years so how do we use that technology to improve life for working families rather than just make the very very richest people in our country that much richer so technology has the potential to improve life for ordinary people if for example we are significantly increasing worker productivity as a result of AI or robotics should we not be lowering the work week to 32 hours so that workers have more time to spend with their families more time for leisure more time for friends more time to do the things that they want to do in other words let's make sure that technology works for the vast majority of the people not just the CEOs uh and the people who own that technology furthermore uh furthermore I hope everybody understands that we are far far behind many other wealthy nations in terms of the kind of social safety net uh that uh citiz their citizens enjoy uh we are the only major country on earth for example not to provide health care to all as a human right uh right now uh what you're seeing is Republicans wanting to cut Medicaid which will be devastating to the whole health care system all aspects of the health care system that's what they want to do and Democrats are saying &quot;Well we want to protect the Affordable Care Act that's great.&quot; Well guess what we're going to fight any cuts to Medicaid but nobody I know thinks the Affordable Care Act is great the health care costs in America are now twice as much per capita as almost every other nation on earth we have 85 million Americans who are uninsured and underinsured we have over a half a million Americans who go bankrupt due due to medically related debt over 60,000 people die every year because they cannot afford to go to a doctor and our life expectancy is lower than any other major country on earth that is not a health care system that is working so our view and I think the view of a majority of Americans is we got to junk the current health care system we've got to move toward Medicare for all healthcare is a human right and we bring forth that agenda and we explain what it means to the American people when you can go to a doctor whenever you want you don't have to take out your wallet you don't have to take out your credit card i think that will be a significant step forward in terms of advancing good public policy and it works politically as well shortterm we need to expand Medicare to cover dental vision and hearing very very important for senior citizens we have got to cut the cost of prescription drugs in half how absurd is it that in some cases we are paying 10 times more for the same exact drugs as the people in other countries are paying and while Trump and Musk are trying to decimate the Social Security administration making it harder for people to access the Social Security that they paid into we have got to expand Social Security by lifting the cap on taxable income you do that you can extend the life the solveny of Social Security for decades and greatly increase the benefits by at least $2,400 that senior citizens in this country receive so when seniors are living on 15 20 $25,000 a year our job is not just not to cut Social Security it's to expand Social Security benefits and when we're talking about the needs of seniors uh we have got to rethink our whole pension system in this country you know what will shock some of the younger people to know that there was a time uh not so many decades ago when if you work for a large company the expectation was and millions of people did receive a defined benefit pension that means you knew as part of the benefits that you received you knew that when you retired you would have a pension there for yourself in addition to social security but over the last many years corporations have cut those back uh and as a result uh we have a lot of seniors who are really uh struggling it goes without saying that we've got to raise the minimum wage in this country which is now a starvation wage of 7 and a4 an hour to at least $17 an hour but I'm happy to tell you that last week as part of this budget resolution process we got every Democrat to support raising the minimum wage to 17 bucks an hour we got one Republican so we're making progress but we've got to win this fight millions of people are working for starvation wages and that is not acceptable and when we talk about the progressive agenda you and I know that workers in unions are able to negotiate decent wages decent benefits decent working conditions in a far stronger way than non-UN workers are able to do and that's why we got to pass the PRO Act uh to make it easier for workers uh to uh join unions there's a lot of else a lot of other stuff that's out there uh right now you know we have a president who thinks that climate change is a hoax well that is a very very dangerous uh situation because as all of you know climate change is not a hoax climate change is an existential threat to the planet and the United States has got to lead the world we got to work with China not against China in cutting carbon emissions and saving the planet so a lot of stuff that is out there that I think people want to hear not good enough just to go after Trump every day we got to do that but we have got to provide people with a vision for the future which says that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world all of our people deserve a decent standard of living and this my friends this is not utopian thinking you know this is oh my goodness we can do all these things many of these things many of these ideas progressive ideas that I've been talking about guess what they exist in other countries around the world in other countries around the world college is free medical school is free in many other countries that don't have the level of income and wealth inequality that we have because they're rich are paying their fair share of taxes so how do we go from here to there well one of the things that we are doing and is part of uh the um fighting oligarchy effort is to organize at the grassroots level and with your help we are hiring organizers all over this country we have just in the last few days talked to organizers and hundreds of people uh at the grassroots level in Iowa uh and in Nebraska and we're mobilizing these people to go out knock on doors to hold town meetings to make sure that their members of Congress do not vote for this disastrous legislation of tax breaks for the rich and cuts to Medicaid and ultimately uh you know as as I have believed for my entire life and what history tells us is that real change never takes place from the top on down it's always the bottom on up it's when ordinary people stand up and fight for justice and right now more than any other time in modern history that is exactly what we need to do we need to build a progress strong grassroots progressive movement uh we need a political revolution in this country where working people stand up and fight for their rights so that is kind of a uh a thumbnail sketch of what we are doing uh and as I mentioned we're going to be in a number of states uh in the coming days we're going to be in California uh Utah Idaho and Montana uh I hope if you live in those areas that you'll come and visit us uh and if not we'll probably come to a community near where you live at sometime uh in the next few months so once again uh thank you all for what you're doing a critical moment in American history uh let's stand up let's fight back we have the majority on our side we can take on the oligarchs we can take on Trump we can beat him if we stand together let's do it thank you very much" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="there's a lot of geopolitical flux not just in the Indopacific but certainly what we've seen here in India in the last month month and a half after the Pahelgam terror attack and then operation Synindur what is the global view on what has happened in this part of the world as also uh what happens now to the Indoacific the Quad I'm now joined by a very very special guest here on this special CNN News8 interview Mr richard Miles is the deputy prime minister and the defense minister of Australia thank you very much uh for joining us and welcome to India uh you incidentally are here on the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the India Australia strategic partnership how would you view these last 5 years well I think we've seen the relationship go to a completely different level and we're very grateful for the leadership of Prime Minister Modi uh but also Prime Minister Albanesei in taking forward uh the bilateral relationship over the course of these five years um I think particularly we've seen a huge uh step forward in terms of defense and security cooperation we are more strategically aligned with India today than we have ever been in our respective histories and it you know it's a long deep relationship with a lot of people to people links there's a a growing Indian diaspora in Australia um we we share passions like cricket and we we were here I was watching the IPL final last night and Josh Hazelwood um the uh but but you know so there's all that there but what we are doing is is creating a strategic dimension to that relationship much more work being done in respect of maritime domain awareness for example um and we have uh quite an ambitious agenda about taking that forward even further in the last decade we've seen a tripling of the exercises that our service personnel are engaged in together and we think there's more we can do together but together with other countries um and so that's exciting but uh economically as well I mean we have seen as India has uh grown its um trade with the the rest of the world um that trade to the growth in the trade to Australia is double what it is uh to the rest of the world and so amongst um its trading partners As Australia is is climbing the the ladder from the Indian worldview we we are hopeful that Sika which will be the the next iteration of our trade relationship is able to be concluded in the not too distant future as well so a lot's happened but as we meet and on on the fifth anniversary of the comprehensive strategic partnership what there also is is a momentum to go even further over over the next five years i I do want to ask you I mean the the momentous events that have happened in the last month month and a half here the Pelgam terror attack in which 26 civilians were killed and then India uh responded to that with operation Sindur and the feeling was certainly amongst the general public that major western countries have not come out and supported India uh for its right to defend itself against these terrorists and these terrorist actions how would you speak to that concern well well firstly we met the news of what happened in Palum with uh utter shock um uh this was uh an appalling attack and uh Prime Minister Albanesei spoke with Prime Minister Modi um almost immediately after these events to extend Australian condolences to India uh on behalf of in respect of the loss of life and you know and as I'm here today you know I we reiterated that and to say that our thoughts and prayers are very much with the families of those who uh lost loved ones s uh I mean we stand with India as we stand with all countries um to combat terrorism uh and um we we want to continue to work with India um in combating terrorism in all its forms around the world we do acknowledge um and welcome the stoppage in military activity we actually see that as an act of Indian leadership but you know we we continue to want to work with India uh as we confront the scourge of terrorism um in all its forms the concern among some quarters has also been that you know people tend to forget the act of terror which was the reason why the military action happened and now the focus is on some kind of equanimity between India and Pakistan again how would you address that concern oh well I mean we we see that there was an act of terror an act of terror that we condemn um and and in simple terms we uh you know we stand with India as we stand with all countries in seeking to con combat terrorism and uh and that's where Australia stands and we look forward to working with India to contend with and combat terrorism in all its forms around the world and and you would support India's right to defend itself against this kind of well well as as I say we we work very uh we we stand with India and with every country which seeks to combat terrorism um we condemn this terrorist attack uh and I and I stand you I'm here today very much um making that clear and as I say our prime minister was very uh quickly um expressing our shock at what happened and our condolences is extending our condolences to India you you did mention a moment ago that you did note the quick sessation of military action and you said that that speaks to India's leadership yes uh would you care to elaborate on that well I I mean we we we obviously we welcome um a stoppage in in military activity but you know we don't um take any of that for granted um these are difficult decisions and we see that fundamentally uh as an act of uh Indian leadership and and we wanted to acknowledge that uh in in the way in which we uh express uh our um appreciation for the stoppage in military activity in the same breath we you know we wanted to make clear that we do see that uh as as not an easy decision and and an act of Indian leadership the there's been a lot of chatter around the fact that it was the US and President Trump who brought about this ceasefire uh not the Indian government certainly doesn't agree to that point of view it was a direct negotiation between India and Pakistan how would you view that well in in the terms that I just said and and why I'm why we are um it's important that we express it in the way that I just have um I mean we every country has an interest in living in a peaceful world so um we all um appreciate uh the stoppage in in military activity but we acknowledge uh this as an act of Indian leadership and and and that's the point we want to make i I do want to talk a little bit about the Quad i I know the Quad sort of started some years ago it's now at the summit level uh India is going to be hosting this year's Quad Summit uh the feeling seems to be it's sort of digressed or lost its way a bit because of all of these events that have happened uh in the recent past well I I think this quad is very important um it'll be the first quad uh for example uh since the inauguration of President Trump uh and and so so it it it's one that matters look fundamentally we look back to the creation of the quad which actually happened in the aftermath of the uh Indian Ocean tsunami and four countries that shared values democracies seeking to work together uh to um improve the way in which we could respond to that disaster and improve humanitarian assistance and disaster relief within the Indoacific the Quad has expanded well beyond that but that is actually a good example of the the kind of activities that the Quad is about it is there to seek to uh improve the um the Indo-Pacific and look at ways in which these four countries which share values can work together in respect of that um it is not a military construct it it it never has been um now we have and you don't want it to be a military it's not what it is um but we have um a um military relationship um with the United States clearly an alliance partner with Japan but with uh India and and there are other mechanisms by which we can move that forward now at a bilateral level as we've as we've said in in respect of the comprehensive strategic partnership on this the the the fifth anniversary of that uh speaking to my counterpart minister Singh we see uh that the fact that we have uh elevated defense and security issues to being one of the most significant if not the most significant pillar in the bilateral relationship um is a profoundly important thing um it speaks to the innate trust that exists now uh between Australia and India and so we are progressing that that uh defense relationship and and we are similarly doing work with uh the United States which we've done for a long time but also with Japan but you don't end with quad becoming like AUS or or like the five eyes that's never the intention and that's not the direction in which all these four countries want to go it's not it's not what the quad construct is about okay um the the we work with Japan we work with the United States we work with India and and all of the four countries in one form or another work with each other in respect of defense there are other avenues by which we can uh pursue that cooperation um I mean we are democracies and we all seek to um build a a rules-based order u and a free and open Indoacific and so that you know we have that in common um and that does lend itself to defense cooperation and and and that is occurring but but it's not necessarily the quad which is the construct for that but but you know coming to to what you said about having a rules-based order in the Indoacific uh you know you're just coming off the Shangrila dialogue and there's been a lot of chatter there where the US defense secretary issued a pretty stark warning saying that the there is a real threat of of China and its behavior in the Indo Pacific and that he's urged countries in this in this part of the world to invest more in securing themselves um that was the reason why Quad came into existence in the first place wasn't it to try and ensure that the the rise of China or its behavior is is managed in a way in the Pacific in a sense that that's the point i I don't actually think that is the history of the Quad um but the you know we do see um China engaging in the biggest military buildup conventional military buildup that we have seen since the end of the Second World War um that that's no small matter um they're doing that without um a sense of strategic reassurance exactly why is it that that China is engaging in such a military buildup and this is a significant part of what makes the strategic circumstances deeply complex for Australia but for India uh for the countries of the region um we we want to work more with um with the countries of the region um and we we want to work more together with India but as I said earlier together with India and with other countries so the concerns raised by secretary he said you are affirming those concerns those concerns very real we have articulated for a long time our concern about China's uh increasing military buildup and that that is happening without any sense of strategic reassurance that's a that's a point that we've been making for some time and you can see the way in which that is uh shaping the the circumstances of the Indo-Pacific and the way in which countries are responding it it is part of uh why I I I make the the statement that I did at the beginning of this interview that our strategic alignment with India has never been never been closer has never been greater than than what it is now um and and we are seeking to work much more with India at a defense level as we are with Japan as we are with the United States but as we are with other countries um in the region as well i mean last year for example we signed a defense cooperation agreement with Indonesia um you know profoundly important uh agreement for a country right adjacent to Australia we're doing more with Singapore um providing its strategic depth doing more training of the Singaporean Defense Forces in Australia um and and we're looking at ways in which we can expand our uh defense cooperation with other countries the Philippines Korea I could go on it it it all of this um is about trying to um build um balance within the the region um and bring together those uh countries in differing ways in practical ways uh to assert the rules-based order we want a stable peaceful Indo-Pacific um in which countries mediate their issues and disputes by reference to the rule of law not by reference to might and power my my last couple of questions one is uh because there's a huge Indian diaspora in Australia and a lot of them happen to be students just in the last year or so or last couple of years there seems to be a bit of a clampdown by major universities or the immigration authorities in Australia uh how would you address that concern look that's not right i mean we um uh firstly that the the um Indian Australian community um is is an incredible asset for our nation uh there's a million Indian Australians now it's the it's the fastest growing community within Australia and there's a richness to life but just a sense of industry and activity which um is is really fantastic and and so we are very much the beneficiaries of that uh in terms of um Indian students coming to Australia to study that is something that uh we we welcome it it's it's a really important part um of our educational sector education is a significant export for our country uh and we want it to continue to be so uh so you know we we we welcome um Indian students in in Australia and we are very um excited about the the growth in the Indian Australian community uh one final word I know that Prime Minister Modi is a great believer in personal equations with world leaders he's had a great equation with Prime Minister Albanzy he's had it with past Australian prime ministers as well how does that change or elevate uh the sort of speed and impetus with which the other principles have to deal with the relationship yeah look I think it's a really good good question and and um personal relationships matter rapport matters i mean countries can relate to each other um without it but when you have it um it turbocharges things it it enables leaders to reach agreements to to to cut through red tape to make things happen and I think what you've seen in the personal relationship between Prime Minister Albanesei and Prime Minister Modi uh which is is deep and it is very warm is an ability to really turbocharge the Australian Indian relationship and it's why we've seen so much occur in the last few years and it's why we look with a sense of excitement and optimism into the future you said you watched the IPL final which team were you supporting well um I've got well there are a couple of Australians so um I'm very pleased for Josh Hazwood um I suppose if I'm being honest u the Punjab had Ricky Ponting as its coach we had Stinus Stinness and Josh Engless so I was kind of hoping that that they might prevail and and to be honest there's a a significant Punjabi community with amongst the Indian Australian community and and particularly in in my hometown of Jalong so yeah look the Punjab Kings is where but still um very and look you have to uh be um excited for Vera Kohi for for for 18 years to be in the same franchise over the entire period of the IPL and to finally win an IPL trophy it's a fantastic story all right Mr richard Miles thank you very much for this interview thank you for your time thank you all right" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="no I I as I mentioned it's a a very great honor um as a citizen being called upon to serve the nation at a time of crisis is a matter of uh a duty for all of us at the same time for me it is a an honor that I've been asked to lead the delegation and um I look forward very much to playing my part i have always said that when my services are required by the nation I should not be found wanting and I had no hesitation in accepting the kind invitation of the government which um to my mind is nothing to do with politics and everything to do with our country's national interests and national interests in my mind are always above everything else your party Congress has put out a list of four names Mr saying that these are the names it has been suggested and your name was not there how do you see this as I've said the party is completely entitled to its opinion um clearly this being a government delegation the government had its own opinion as to who they felt appropriate and I'm very um uh I must say unaware of any further contacts between the government and my party uh and I think you should ask those concerned as far as I'm concerned I was asked uh both in my capacity as a u chairman of a parliamentary standing committee dealing with these issues but also because very kindly the minister talked about my personal experience over the years in international affairs and the need for that experience and such knowledge as I may such talents as I may possess to be put to the service of the nation at this time and I found that uh an absolutely essential u uh what can I say uh answer to give that certainly when the nation needs my services I am available and I'm available for my country it to my mind this has nothing to do with party politics um it's all to do with what our country has been through in in in recent uh times and the need for us to present a united front as I recall and I may be wrong because I was neither an Indian nor in Indian politics at that time a similar set of delegations were sent by Prime Minister Manm Singh to various regions of the world after the 2008 terror attack so this is not unprecedented and it is certainly something which to my mind is a good reflection of national unity at a time when unity is important as you said you see this as an honor especially to bring a delegation to US and countries like that but are you sad or disappointed at the way in which your party reacted or your party colleagues reacted look I mean my party or my party leadership is entitled to its opinion of my abilities or lack thereof and I think that is really for them to explain uh I have absolutely no comment to make on that um I uh am honored to have been entrusted with a responsibility and I will fulfill that responsibility just as I have fulfilled every responsibility entrusted to me in my rather long working life uh whether at the United Nations or in the Congress party uh I have fulfilled every task given to me with sincerity and commitment and I intend to bring the same qualities to bear in my service uh in this particular mission uh we are not talking about you know it's a 10-day affair i'll be going to Delhi in any case we have a parliamentary standing committee meeting on Monday and Tuesday on various issues including on this particular issue i'm assuming that I will get further details of the mission after going there and uh we expect uh I'm sure the delegation will get briefings from uh the ministry of external affairs and and we will proceed on that basis i mean I I think that right now the focus is on a job of work that needs to be done for the country and uh I'm truly honored to have been asked and I will give my very best as I as I always try to do have you informed the party when you received this invitation yes indeed no I certainly informed them of the first call I got which was two days ago um and I also mentioned to the minister who called me who was a parliamentary affairs minister that I assumed that he would be talking to the party leaderships of opposition parties and he assured me that he would be um he he also let me know that I was not the only one he was calling there other opposition MPs that he was calling and um and I I found it entirely appropriate as I said that the country should rally together uh on this particularly important issue and um uh now that I've been entrusted with the task of leading one of the delegations I intend to give it my best shot thank you is there any communication between Yeah between you and the party because if this happens continuously this happens this communication get between you and your party no the party has my telephone number and they can call me anytime they like uh I don't think there's any difficulty there uh so as far as I'm concerned I don't really see any uh communication gap sometimes one learns about certain statements from the media uh that may mean that we have other means of communication as well but uh but I don't think there's a particular gap that I'm particularly worried about" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="there is a a regular hotline between the two directors general of military operations the message was conveyed that this was the intent that it was pointed out that no military targets no civilian targets and no governmental targets had been hit not even by accident and that the message therefore had been delivered exactly and precisely uh to the terrorists and their handlers nonetheless Pakistan chose to respond and respond I'm sorry to say uh with indiscriminate shelling uh across the border the very first day and night which sadly uh killed 19 civilians and injured grievously 59 others including Carmelite nuns in a convent uh seeks worshiping in a gurudara and uh others who happened to simply be in the line of fire because they lived in districts adjoining the Pakistani border when this happened India had no choice but to retaliate in kind the matters got worse the next day as the Pakistanis followed up artillery shelling with uh a serious u invasion of drones and and missiles um India's air defenses were able to hold them off but in turn India returned the the compliment and on the night of 9th 10th May India hit 11 Pakistani military targets um including a rather well-known air base that's just one and a half kilometers away from military headquarters of Pakistan and Robert Pindi the following morning we got a call other our director general military operations got a call from the Pakistani director general military operations saying they'd like to stop this and we said we've been saying all along we didn't want to start anything we were just sending a message of terrorists you started we reply if you stop we'll stop and they stopped uh there was an 88 hour war um we look back on that with with a great deal of um of of of of frustration because um it needn't have happened at all lives have been lost but at the same time we look back on this experience with a steely and renewed sense of determination there is now got to be a new normal no one sitting in Pakistan is going to be allowed to believe that they can just walk across the do the border and kill our citizens with impunity there will be a price to pay and that price has been going up systematically i'll just take you briefly through what happened you may remember in 2015 well you may not remember because this is our problem not yours but in 2015 in January there was an attack on Indian air base a place called Patanot and our prime minister had just made a goodwill visit to Pakistan the previous month on the 25th of December he'd attended the birthday celebrations of then Pakistan prime minister Nawas Sharif uh whose granddaughter's wedding was on the same day he had given gifts so when this happened he was so astonished that he actually called the Pakistani prime minister and said Why don't you join the investigation let's let's solve who is doing this and the Pakistani you can imagine the horror of the Indian military establishment at this idea that Pakistani investigators are going to come to an Indian air base but um but they came and uh they went back to Pakistan and said &quot;Oh the Indians did it to themselves.&quot; That was the last straw i mean it was just the we we'd already gone through the horrors of 2008 in Mumbai when 170 people had been killed and the Pakistani denials at that time were laid bare not just by the fact that we caught one of the terrorists alive and his identity his address his his family etc identified in Pakistan but equally because that drama took place over three days during which western intelligence agencies trained their recording devices amongst other things uh on Pakistani uh the the chilling voice of the Pakistani handler giving minute-by-minute instructions to the killers in Mumbai so the evidence was there there had been denial and that denial was proven to be completely false and as you know thereafter uh the Pakistanis claimed not to know where Osama bin Laden was until he was found in a safe house right next to an army cantonment uh in a in a in a in a city dominated by the army this is Pakistan and I'm afraid for us 2015 was the last opportunity for them to behave to cooperate to really show they were serious about ending terror as they claimed every time that they were and since they did not do it in January in September 2015 there was another attack uh in a place called Uri also not far from the border and this time India breached the line of control which we had rigorously observed throughout in every previous skirmish we had never crossed the line of control we crossed it with a surgical strike in September of 2015 uh that seemed to calm things down a bit but unfortunately in January of 2019 there was another terror attack in a place called Pulwama killing 40 Indians at that point and then India responded not just by breaching the line of control but also breaching the international border and striking uh uh with with with uh our air force a known terror training camp in a place called Balacot now we have not just crossed the LOC we have also crossed the international border we have hit Pakistan in their heartland and we have done so as I say only to send a message about terror we are not interested and we still remain absolutely clear that we are not interested in warfare with Pakistan we would much rather be left alone to grow our economy and pull our people into the world that they're ready getting ready for in the 21st century we have no desire to have anything that the Pakistanis have sadly we may be a status quo power they are not they are a revisionist power they covered territory that India controls and they want to have it at any price and if they can't get it through conventional means they're willing to get it through terrorism that is not acceptable to us and that's really the message that we are here to give all of us all of you in this country and and elsewhere uh we are determined now that there's got to be a new bottom line to this we have tried everything international dossas complaints to sanctions committee diplomacy um even this joint investigation attempt everything has been tried uh Pakistan has remained in denial there has been absolutely no conviction no serious criminal prosecution no attempt to dismantle the terror infrastructure in that country and the persistence of safe havens so from our point of view this is it you do this you're going to get this back and we have demonstrated with this operation that we can do it with a degree of precision and with a degree of restraint that the world we hope will understand we have a right to self-defense we've exercised that right we have not done so irresponsibly and we have not done so in a way that would have warranted a wider conflration that's really the message I wanted to give you all today i'm sure you have questions and comments and my colleagues uh represent as I say four parties amongst the five of us and there's a wide span of views we're all happy to join in conversation with you thank you all very much once again for coming and being with us today j [Music] [Music] for the good of our nation let's work together and let's truly make America great again the fastest news breaks requested PM saying that we will lab to speak to Putin and to Zalinski the biggest news makers the relationship with India is probably the most important bilateral relationship the US will have for the rest of this century the capital delivered quite an election result today expert analysis the milliondoll question today is how to stop this dance of death ground reports i'm standing at the crossroad of the Kuma behind me are more than 100 entry hearts long form interviews exclusionary politics is reflected in Manipur case as well you don't border because this is a small estate deep dive into burning issues it's often said DRC could be the richest country in the whole world it's because of what sits underneath why exactly did the US topple the Shake Casino government hd videos we don't just break news we break it down [Music]" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="i think the leader of the delegation has very appropriately given a detailed report what is going on what has happened and what we are going to do in future Being a person from the state that is Jammu and Kashmir I have seen right from student days and also from ever since I joined politics youth politics the ongoings in the state from across as a result of militancy from across the border This is not new thing because the revolution in the media now people start knowing across the country across the globe Earlier what was happening in the state of Jammu Kashmir even people in Delhi maybe except some agencies government agencies general public would not know because the media was very restricted Restricted in the sense there was not a revolution like we have today The entire media is revolutionized I think my friends and colleagues have been mentioning number of cases We have few thousand such cases few thousand over a period of time and I think in the recent past what I'm saying when I say recent past means about three decades more than 40,000 local people from JNK have been killed in during the militancy besides other our countrymen in different parts of the country and bigger attacks which have been mentioned by my colleagues here So there's hardly a day when there's not a attack by Pakistan aided abanded trained terror terrorist and we don't need any proof I don't know why asking people are asking proof because we don't have any terror activities in any part of the country We don't we can't think of having a camp We can't even think is two men camp in any part of the country terrorist activities but all the terrorist activities are emanating from Pakistan or Pakistan occupied Kashmir So let it be clear I have seen in my home almost 40 years back when my son was only one and a half year old So one of the hijackers he was a Pakistani was going to be hanged with the court judgment So that child that time I was member of parliament one year old child the ISI you you know it's not only the uh militants doing such activities even the secret agency of Pakistan is even much worse rather it is the secret agency of the Pakistan who has taught them these tactics So they were trying to kidnap him from Shirinagar from in-laws my in-law's place but somehow only day before I had gone to shinear and I that son flew with me to back to Delhi So by within a week or so I had become minister junior minister in Mrs Indra Gandhi's time and these two ISI people in my absence while I was in office came home to kidnap my child and they turned out to be two ISI people So right from that place I myself as chief minister have survived more than dozen attack So this is nothing new nothing nothing new for us any attack it is almost in 90% initially they accept they take the credit because for each credit they get extra money for each action each incident each killing the Pakistan gives them incentives gives them money promotes them they have also hierarchy I remember when I as chief minister at one point of time I almost eliminated the district and uh provincial commanders so for one month they didn't have any commander but I think within one month they again replaced them with junior commanders so this is going for those who are in Kashmir we know that who is doing it this is basically Pakistan army why Pakistan army is because Pakistan does not need any army So if they don't do this the Pakistan army becomes irrelevant Who is the richest person in Pakistan at the moment not a politician You might have heard in different parts of the globe the politicians becoming the businessmen becoming big businessmen some politician corrupt politician in different parts of the globe become a very uh very rich but I haven't heard in any part of the world a security people the army people becoming rich but I don't think even a single Indian the big Indian force army any single army general has a house in London but I think there's hardly a single general of Pakistan who does not have house in London or elsewhere in the world So this is which is why they are doing all these activities and Pakistani leadership unfortunately with all due regards for them they have been puppet in the hands of the army that is the fact in diplomatic language my colleagues may not accept it but as a political worker and as a person who have seen them very closely being in government and outside the government It is these all activities are being done sponsored paided awaited I have the proofs also as a chief minister because one boy I had told my uh security people that I want one boy or one person alive while you are shooting each other Even if he's not shooting if you are able to catch him alive I would like to know what does he say and he was an orphan boy and he was trained and sent to Kashmir and for each act that boy was given money So we know I don't think there is any need of any proof by any person being a local man we know each and every activity they undertake So this is the time when we need but we cannot tolerate we have just seen one two generations the generation after generation cannot tolerate this Now India and Pakistan got freedom almost same day Now Pakistan see the where is the Pakistan and see where is India in spite of being 1.5 billion people we export food grains we supply the food grains to I think most of the countries but does Pakistan have the it doesn't have the water they have to be at the mercy of India one of the biggest river going to Pakistan is from my district district duda there's chinab district so they are they don't have any a country which does not have water for drinking water it does not have water for its crops it doesn't have food to eat and only thing he will go with begging bowl across the globe give me money for my people for growth and development and that money is being channelized to promote terrorism and by all nasty things to kill the people in Kashmir and elsewhere inh in our country So my submission to this is that your country has already supported and thank you I think my leader has already thanked the our kingdom of this bahin for the statement issued and subsequent statements issued after 22nd of April 25 after this massacre took place and we need support at every international fora every international fora and also in OIC receive We need your support positive support We don't want to eliminate any country We just only want Pakistan to dismantle these terrorist infrastructure We want Pakistan to take action against terrorist Why should only one country take the whole soul contract of the entire globe to nourish and nurture the terrorists That is our concern They should spend time the Pakistan government should spend time they should use this money for the growth and development uh and for education facilities for health of the people of Pakistan We are not against the people of the Pakistan but all these activities which Pakistan or Pakistan government and Pakistan army is undertaking it is against humanity It is against us as peace and tranquility not only between the two countries but across the globe and across the region So in this regard while thanking your cooperation we would like to seek your further cooperation at international forum" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="and welcome to First Post America i'm Eric Ham coming to you live from the nation's capital in Washington DC and over the next few minutes we'll take you from the United States and around the world covering all the top stories of the day but before that here's a look at the latest headlines the United States vetos a draft UN Security Council resolution that demanded an immediate unconditional and permanent ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and Gaza saying it fails to condemn Hamas north Korean leader Kim Jong-un vows to unconditionally support Russia in its war against Ukraine as Moscow and Pyongyang strengthen strategic partnerships and mutual cooperation authorities in southern China offer rewards of more than $1,000 for the arrest of 20 people they say are Taiwanese hackers accused of organizing planning and premeditating attacks on key government sectors hong Kong appoints retired New Zealand Supreme Court Judge William Young to its top court as the finance hub tries to replenish its shrinking roster of foreign judges following Beijing's imposition of a security law in 2020 and consumer goods giant Proctor and Gamble says it will cut 7,000 jobs or about 6% of its total workforce over the next two years as it navigates uneven demand due to US tariff uncertainty see we begin in Washington where President Donald Trump has revived one of the most controversial policies from his first term a sweeping travel ban targeting several nations on Wednesday the president signed a proclamation burring entry to the United States for citizens of 12 countries citing national security concerns and the need to protect against quote unquote foreign terrorist in my first term my powerful travel restrictions were one of our most successful policies and they were a key part of preventing major foreign terror attacks on American soil that is why today I am signing a new executive order placing travel restrictions on countries including Yemen Somalia Haiti Libya and numerous others but we will not allow people to enter our country who wish to do us harm and nothing will stop us from keeping America safe thank you very much another travel ban which takes effect on June 6 blocks all travel from Afghanistan Myanmar Chad the Republic of Congo Equatorial Guinea Eratria Haiti Iran Libya Somalia Sudan and Yemen in addition travel from Bundi Cuba Laos Sierra Leon Togo Turkmanistan and Venezuela will be partially restricted citizens from these countries will not be allowed to enter permanently or on tourist or student visas president Trump quote stated &quot;We will not allow people to enter our country who wish to do us harm.&quot; End quote he pointed to issues like terrorist presence weak identity verification poor recordkeeping and high visa overstay rates as reasons for the new restrictions the president also cited Sunday's attack in Boulda Colorado in which an Egyptian national Muhammad Sabri Solomon allegedly threw a gasoline bomb into a pro-Israel crowd now Solomon Hot overstayed his tourist visa although Egypt is not on the ban list the recent terror attack in Boulder Colorado has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas we don't want them in the 21st century we've seen one terror attack after another carried out by foreign visa overstayers from dangerous places all over the world and thanks to Biden's open door policies today there are millions and millions of these illegals who should not be in our country now the move is part of the Trump administration's broader immigration crackdown which includes deportations of Venezuelans suspected of gang activity denial of foreign student enrollments and tougher asylum policies however the ban includes exemptions for green card holders previously issued visas athletes attending major events like the Olympics and Afghans eligible for the special immigrant visa program due to their support for US forces during the war we will not let what happened in Europe to America that's why on my first day back in office I directed the Secretary of State to perform a security review of high-risk regions and make recommendations for where restrictions should be imposed very simply we cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter the United States now Venezuela which is one of the partially banned nations reacted sharply the interior minister slammed the US as a fascist state and warned that being in the United States is a big risk for anybody not just for Venezuelans the country went on to accuse the US of targeting its citizens without justification the United States has just released something prohibiting the entry of any Venezuelan into the country it's about nine countries not even with a visa it's forbidden visas to the US are being eliminated honestly being in the US is a big risk for anyone not just Venezuelans if you're really that foolish then go to the United States somalia meanwhile pledged cooperation while Myanmar Laos Iran and others did not respond immediately now in Afghanistan critics expressed outrage over the inclusion of the country whose citizens have long cooperated with American troops afghan evac which is a self-organized group of Afghans veterans frontline civilians called the the decision a moral disgrace to include Afghanistan a nation whose people stood alongside American service members for 20 years is a moral disgrace it spits in the face of our allies our veterans and every value we claim to uphold the Trump administration's travel restrictions come amid growing global instability from civil conflict in Sudan and Libya to humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and Yemen and as the policy's impact begins to ripple across embassies airports and communities the world watches closely but the bigger question remains who might be added next and staying with the White House Elon Musk is once again mounting an attack on the president's tax and spending bill which is being hotly debated in Congress after calling the bill quote unquote disgusting abomination the Tesla CEO is now urging Americans to call their senators and kill the bill call your senator call your congressman bankrupting America is not okay kill the bill now Musk who recently left his costcutting role in President Trump's administration has gone even further renaming the legislation as the debt slavery bill and warning it would explode the US national debt his latest criticism came after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill which extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and increasing spending on defense and border security would add about $2.4 trillion to the current $36.2 2 trillion US debt pile it also comes as the bill proposes phasing out electric vehicle tax credits a direct hit to Tesla and rejects Musk proposal to shift air traffic control to his Starlink now Musk who was also the largest Republican donor in last year's election cycle has said a new bill must be drafted one that does not massively grow the deficit or increase the debt ceiling by $5 trillion the former Trump ally is is not alone in his sharp criticism however in fact reports suggest the bill known as the big beautiful bill now faces opposition from Republican deficit hawks and a handful of rural state senators their concerns include proposed cuts to Medicaid a health insurance program for low-income Americans and Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin has reportedly criticized the bill as failing to reverse the trajectory of budget deficits and debt i refuse to accept $2 trillion plus deficits we have to address that problem and unfortunately this bill doesn't do so i'm worried about our kids and grandkids the fact that we're mortgaging their future it is wrong it's immoral meanwhile amid mounting criticism Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said that Elon Musk was wrong in that issue elon and I left on a great note we were texting one another you know happy text uh you know Monday and then uh and then yesterday you know 24 hours later um he does a 180 and he comes out and opposed the bill and I it surprised me frankly and um I don't take it personal we don't take it personal um you know he's uh policy differences are not personal um I I I think he's he's flat wrong i think he's um he's way off on this now Speaker Johnson maintains the bill is the largest debt reduction package in history claiming $1.6 trillion dollar in cuts meanwhile Democrats are increasing the pressure with Senator Leader Senate leader Chuck Schumer reportedly urging senators to consider Elon Musk criticism so as backlash bills the future of President Trump's big beautiful bill remains deeply uncertain as the Republican le Senate attempts to pass the legislation before July and now shifting focus to the Middle East where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government is under pressure from one of its coalition allies a member of Israel's right-wing coalition has threatened to quit Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet and support an opposition motion to dissolve parliament united Torah Jujaism one of the two ultraorththodox parties in the coalition said it would withdraw support unless it secured lastminute concessions to formalize a law exempting ultraorththodox men from military service now this escalation comes as Israel's main opposition party led by former prime minister Dai Leid has submitted a motion for a parliamentary vote next week to topple the government even as the war against Hamas continues this Knesset is finished it has nowhere else to go all that it has brought to the people of Israel is pain and disasters and bereiement and crisis now previous no confidence motions have failed but the difference this time is the rising tension inside the coalition itself the two ultra orthodox parties who hold 18 of the coalition's 68 seats have been boycotting parliamentary votes for weeks and protest against the conscription now ultraorththodox Jewish seminary students have been exempt from compulsory army service since Israel's founding over seven decades ago but Israel's Supreme Court has ruled that this exemption is unconstitutional and reports suggest a large majority of the Israeli public supports mandatory conscription for the ultraorththodox now this has put Benjamin Netanyahu of course in a difficult position as his coalition is reportedly split on the matter reports suggest that if he fails to pass a new exemption law ultra ultraorththodox lawmakers would walk out while approving it could prompt a protest exit by secular parties in March similar threats were made to bring down the government but no action followed some reports indicate that if the ultraorththodox parties join the opposition they could have the number to force early elections a year ahead of schedule which poll suggest Benjamin Netanyahu could struggle to win these growing political tensions came at a time when Netanyahu is facing public anger over his failure to prevent the October 23 Hamas attack that killed about 1,200 people he's also under increasing pressure from protesters and families of hostages still held in Gaza to secure their release after 63 days of war it is clear that Netanyahu's government has not has not done and will not do everything required to bring our hostages home the only chance we have to get them back is with the help of President Trump and Special Envoy Witkov we are facing moral bankruptcy netanyahu is abandoning our loved ones in captivity and crushing the Israeli ethos upon which we were raised for which for his own political motives for now Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has remained silent on the looming crisis but reports suggest that negotiations within the coalition are in fact continuing still it's unclear if Netanyahu will be able to hold together this fragile coalition and complete his full term before the next scheduled elections in 2026 in a royal twist no one saw coming Meghan Markle marked her daughter Liet's fourth birthday not with tiaras or tea parties but with a throwback dance video straight from the delivery room the Duchess of Sussex shared the unexpected clip of her and Prince Harry dancing just before the birth of their daughter and like everything with the royal couple the video sparked a wide range of emotions and responses from onlookers while fans celebrated the moment critics accused Megan of stealing the spotlight was it celebration or self-promotion here's more on the reaction from Royal Insiders nothing says happy birthday darling quite like a hospital room shimmy to mark Princess Lily's fourth birthday Meghan Markle tossed another tradition out of the palace window and posted a throwback video that's part maternity moment part Tik Tok challenge and part public relations firestorm in the video which was filmed just before giving birth the Duchess of Sussex sways twirls and lets her bump Boogie to the beat of Baby Mama dance with none other than Prince Harry who's also seen busting his own dad moves right beside [Music] her megan captioned the clip &quot;Four years ago today this also happened both of our children were a week past their due dates so when spicy food all that walking and acupuncture did not work there was only one thing left to do and apparently that one thing was dancing like labor depended on it decked in a black wrap dress Megan groups with confidence harry in a green hoodie and blue jeans joins the act gamely girating while some called it bold some called it bizarre and together social media had a lot of things to say so what should have been a feel-good flashback spiraled into digital drama and after Megan deactivated comments on Instagram the social media royal insiders took to X where their backlash came harder than a Braxton Hicks contraction desperate attempt one user moaned meghan Markle is just stupid another snapped even British journalist and media personality Pierce Morgan who is always lurking in Marl's mentions delivered his signature snark sharing the video he wrote &quot;We're about 2 months away from the sex tape.&quot; Yet not all reactions were scathing some fans applauded the Duchess for keeping it real or at least calling it completely normal still the internet rarely agrees especially when Marl's involved but the birthday love did not stop at Tik Tok moves taking it to the gram Megan also released a carousel of intimate family photos equal parts windswept sentimental and glossy one black and white shot shows her cuddling a young Liet on what looks like a breezy boat ride another captures baby Liet cradled in Megan's arms moments after birth and a third shows Harry walking barefoot in the sand with his daughter bags turned flanked by palm trees the sweetest bond to watch unfold Megan wrote daddy's little girl and favorite adventurer born on June 4th 2021 a year after her parents left royal duties and moved to California Lilet became princess when her grandfather King Charles took the throne she joins big brother Prince Ashie now six in what might be the world's most watched family photo album so yes Megan danced the internet screamed but one thing's for sure Lily Diana's birthday made headlines but just maybe not the kind you find in a fairy tale and finally we bring you a story about swiping but with caution that's the message from US authorities to Americans using dating apps while traveling in Mexico a new security alert from the US consulate general in Gual Laara warns of a string of kidnappings involving US citizens who arranged to meet strangers through dating platforms with romance turning risky and digital fleeings leading to real life danger officials are urging travelers to rethink their romance abroad and maybe read the travel advisory before booking that beachside rendevous our final report has the details if your summer travel plans include tequila sunshine and a little romantic escapade to the south of the US border Uncle Sam would like a word the US consulate general in Mexico's Guadalajara city has issued a PSA that can basically be summed up as love hurts especially when it ends with a ransom demand this is after several Americans looking for sparks on dating apps ended up getting kidnapped in the pictures tourist hotspots of Puerto Valarta and Novo Nayarit instead of finding the one some found themselves in unfamiliar rooms with kidnappers authorities didn't name any specific apps but we imagine Cupid is now ghosting Bumble and Tinder what we do know is that these digital meatcutes turned into real life nightmares involving extortion and frantic phone calls to relatives back home here's what the State Department advised first is to swipe smart using dating apps in Mexico cool just maybe don't accept that invite to a private beach picnic in the middle of nowhere second is to meet in public places only that cute rooftop bar great that random Airbnb in a jungle not so much thirdly keep people in the loop tell your bestie everything about your romantic endorse who what where and on which app bonus points for screenshots fourth is to channel your inner detective if it feels sketchy it probably is you don't need closure you need an exit and last but not least 911 still works whether it's a guacamole emergency or actual 911 is your go-to in Mexico and if you are wondering should I even go to Mexico right now the US government has issued a travel advisory for Mexico the Mexican state of Yaliscoco got an official classification of level three this means reconsider travel while Naare was given a level two classification this translates to exercise increased caution all thanks to the rising kidnapping cases consider this government's language for maybe just do a Zoom date instead as online dating continues to be a global pastime romance abroad isn't going anywhere but US government would prefer your vacation story ends with an engagement ring and not a true crime podcast episode so go ahead fall in love eat tacos and live your best life just remember if your date suggests an off-grid adventure in Mexico maybe it's time to swipe left that's our time for First Post America today we certainly thank all of you for tuning in we look forward to seeing you right back here again tomorrow

president trump as part of its criminal probe into efforts to overturn the 2020 election as part of the probe prosecutors have reportedly received phone records of key officials within trump's circle including his former chief of staff mark meadows the post also revealed two aides to former vice president mike pence his chief of staff mark short and lawyer greg jacob recently testified before a grand jury on tuesday attorney general merrick garland spoke to lester holt on nbc's nightly news garland refused to rule out charging donald trump we intend to hold everyone anyone who was criminally responsible for events surrounding january 6 for any attempt to interfere with the lawful transfer of power from one administration to another accountable that's what we do we don't pay any attention to other uh issues with respect to that so if donald trump were to become a candidate for president again that would not change your schedule or how you move forward or don't move forward say again that we will hold accountable anyone who is criminally responsible for attempting to interfere with the transfer legitimate lawful transfer of power from one administration to the next part of the justice department probes reportedly focused on an effort by trump's team to submit fake electors who would claim to the electoral college trump had won states where he'd actually lost on tuesday the new york times revealed details of internal emails sent by lawyers working on this effort in one email the arizona-based lawyer jack willencek described the plan as quote kind of wild creative he wrote quote we would just be sending in fake electoral votes to pence so that someone in congress can make an objection when they start counting votes and start arguing that the fake votes should be counted unquote in a follow-up email he wrote quote alternative votes is probably a better term than fake votes he then added a smiley face emoji to the email in related news the house january 6 committee has released an audio clip from testimony by former acting defense secretary christopher miller he denied trump ever gave a formal order to have 10 000 troops ready to be deployed to the capitol on january 6 2021 a claim that's been made by former white house chief of staff mark meadows and others in the clip miller was questioned by committee vice chair liz cheney to be crystal clear there was no direct order from president trump to put 10 000 troops to be on the ready for january 6. yeah that's correct there was no direct there was no order for the president on tuesday donald

what you just have said did we understand you correctly that a professional athlete suffering from chronic pain could have been prescribed medical cannabis in the u.s for example in the u.s as a

gunfire but stopped short of saying investigators had reached a definitive conclusion in her killing the u.s said her death was quote the result of tragic circumstances unquote abu akla's family criticized the bite administration's statement saying quote for far too long the united states has enabled israel to kill with impunity by providing weapons immunity and diplomatic cover impunity leads to repetition we're here to do our part to ensure that this cycle ends they said the director of the federal bureau of prisons michael carvajal came under intense criticism during a senate subcommittee hearing tuesday examining the horrific conditions inside the federal penitentiary in atlanta georgia where at least 13 people have died by suicide since 2012. georgia senator john ossoff who chairs the permanent subcommittee on investigation said the conditions inside the prison were quote abusive and inhumane inmates hanging themselves in federal prisons addicted to and high on drugs

former administrator at the atlanta federal penitentiary terry whitehead also testified a tuesday senate subcommittee hearing and conditions at the prison i was shocked and appalled by the usp atlanta big picture on a daily basis there were numerous policy violations which put the staff inmates and the local community in danger for example there were so many rats inside the facility dining hall and fruit preparation areas that staff intentionally left doors open so the many stray cats that hung around the prison could catch the rats it is never a good idea to leave prison doors open in other

marked the start of a process to recalibrate the relationship Ties between Ottawa and Beijing have been strained for years and trade talks have been a key point of tension Carney said China is Canada's second largest trading partner but farmers and fishes across the country have been hit hard by Chinese tariffs He also raised the issue of fentinel smuggling saying it's a major concern for Canadians The two sides have now agreed to launch ministerial level talks on trade and other disputes Let's listen to those comments from Mark Carney Uh we have uh this is the start of a process of

a Hezbollah stronghold destroying at least nine buildings Israel claims the strikes hit drone factories a claim Hezbollah denies Lebanon's president called the strikes a flagrant violation of the ceasefire and urged the US and France to intervene The Lebanese army says ongoing Israeli attacks are undermining its role in enforcing the truths and warned that cooperation on monitoring Hezbollah could be suspended if strikes continue Once again staying in the Middle East Iran has condemned US President Donald Trump's recent travel ban describing it as a display of deep hostility towards Iranians and Muslims The ban which bars citizens from 12 countries including Iran is set to take effect on Monday Iranian officials called the move a violation of international law and an act rooted

          <attvalue for="7" value="&gt;&gt; A READING FROM THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. &gt;&gt; KING AGRIPPA AND BERNICE ARRIVED IN CAESAREA ON A VISIT TO FESTUS. SINCE THEY SPENT SEVERAL DAYS THERE, FESTUS REFERRED PAUL'S CASE TO THE KING, SAYING, &quot;THERE IS A MAN HERE LEFT IN CUSTODY BY FELIX. WHEN I WAS IN JERUSALEM THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND THE ELDERS OF THE JEWS BROUGHT CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DEMANDED HIS CONDEMNATION. I ANSWERED THEM THAT IT WAS NOT ROMAN PRACTICE TO HAND OVER AN ACCUSED PERSON BEFORE HE HAS FACED HIS ACCUSERS AND HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEFEND HIMSELF AGAINST THEIR CHARGE. SO WHEN THEY CAME TOGETHER HERE, I MADE NO DELAY; THE NEXT DAY I TOOK MY SEAT ON THE TRIBUNAL AND ORDERED THE MAN TO BE BROUGHT IN. HIS ACCUSERS STOOD AROUND HIM, BUT DID NOT CHARGE HIM WITH ANY OF THE CRIMES I SUSPECTED. INSTEAD THEY HAD SOME ISSUES WITH HIM ABOUT THEIR OWN RELIGION AND ABOUT A CERTAIN JESUS WHO HAD DIED BUT WHO PAUL CLAIMED WAS ALIVE. SINCE I WAS AT A LOSS HOW TO INVESTIGATE THIS CONTROVERSY, I ASKED IF HE WERE WILLING TO GO TO JERUSALEM AND THERE STAND TRIAL ON THESE CHARGES. AND WHEN PAUL APPEALED THAT HE BE HELD IN CUSTODY FOR THE EMPEROR'S DECISION, I ORDERED HIM HELD UNTIL I COULD SEND HIM TO CAESAR.&quot; ♪ VERBUM DOMINI ♪ &gt;&gt; ♪ DEO GRATIAS ♪ &gt;&gt; THE LORD HAS ESTABLISHED HIS THRONE IN HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; THE LORD HAS ESTABLISHED HIS THRONE IN HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; BLESS THE LORD, O MY SOUL; AND ALL MY BEING, BLESS HIS HOLY NAME.

AMEN, AMEN, I SAY TO YOU, WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER, YOU USED TO DRESS YOURSELF AND GO WHERE YOU WANTED; BUT WHEN YOU GROW OLD, YOU WILL STRETCH OUT YOUR HANDS, AND SOMEONE ELSE WILL DRESS YOU AND LEAD YOU WHERE YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO.&quot; HE SAID THIS SIGNIFYING BY WHAT KIND OF DEATH HE WOULD GLORIFY GOD.

AND THE RESPONSE TODAY TAKEN FROM PSALM 103 SPEAKS ABOUT THE IMMENSITY OF GOD'S MERCY, AND THIS IS FURTHER REVEALED IN TODAY'S GOSPEL WHEN THE RISEN LORD REINSTATES PETER AFTER HE DENIED HIM THREE TIMES. ON HOLY THURSDAY NIGHT, PETER HAD BEEN CONFIDENT IN HIS OWN STRENGTH WHEN CHRIST SAID YOU WILL ALL FALL AWAY BECAUSE OF ME THIS NIGHT. PETER RESPONDED NO THEY ALL FALL AWAY BECAUSE OF YOU, I WILL NEVER FALL AWAY. AND EVEN WHEN OUR LORD FORETOLD THAT PETER WOULD DENY HIM THREE TIMES, PETER RESPONDED THAT IF I MUST DIE WITH YOU, I WILL NOT DENY YOU. AND AS THE LORD SAID THE SPIRIT IS WILLING, BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK. PETER EXPERIENCED THAT AND IS RECOGNIZED AS THE DISCIPLE OF CHRIST IN THE COURTYARD AFTER THE LORD HAD BEEN ARRESTED. AND ST. LUKE TELLS US AFTER PETER DENIED THE LORD, JESUS LOOKED AT HIM AND HIS GLANCE CUT PETER TO THE HEART. HE WENT OUT AND WEPT BITTERLY. AFTER THE RESURRECTION, THE APOSTLES WERE FILLED WITH GREAT JOY WHEN THEY BEHELD THE RISEN LORD. THE LORD EVEN TOLD AN ACCOUNT OF WHEN THEY RECOGNIZED THE LORD FROM THE SHORE, PETER JUMPED INTO THE SEA. HE WANTED TO BE THERE WITH THE LORD. AND PERHAPS PETER STILL STRUGGLED INTERIORLY BECAUSE HE WAS ACUTELY AWARE OF HIS SIN. ESPECIALLY AFTER HE DECLARED THAT HE WOULD NEVER DENY THE LORD. AND THE LORD IN HIS GREAT MERCY RESTORES PETER WITH CONFIDENCE. AS PETER HAD DENIED THE LORD THREE TIMES, NOW HE IS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPENT FROM HIS FAULT. IN EACH OF THESE THREE QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES, THE LORD DOES NOT REJECT PETER BUT RESTORES THAT FRIENDSHIP AND CONFIDENCE IN TWO WAYS: FIRST, HE ENTRUSTS A VERY IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY TO HIM. TO FEED HIS LAMBS, TO TEND TO HIS SHEEP, TO FEED HIS SHEEP. THIS IS HOW PETER SHOWED HIS LOVE FOR THE LORD BY DIRECTING AND TEACHING THE FAITHFUL THAT IS THE FLOCK OF CHRIST TO CARRY OUT THIS MISSION ENTRUSTED TO HIM. IT WOULD DEMAND AND REQUIRE A GREAT LOVE FOR CHRIST AND THE FAITHFUL. ST. ANTHONY OF PADULA COMMENTING ON THIS TASK, ENTRUSTED BY THE LORD WOULD SAY, FEED THEM WITH THE WORDS OF YOUR PREACHING. FEED THEM WITH THE HELP OF YOUR DEVOUT PRAYERS. FEED THEM WITH THE EXAMPLE OF A GOOD LIFE. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE LORD SAYS FEED MY LAMBS, TEND TO MY SHEEP, FEED MY SHEEP. THEY BELONG TO THE LORD ULTIMATELY. WE BELONG TO THE LORD, ST. AUGUSTINE WOULD SAY LET US THEREFORE NOT LOVE OURSELVES BUT HIM AND FEEDING HIS SHEEP LET US SEEK THE THINGS OF CHRIST, NOT OUR OWN. SECONDLY, OUR LORD FORETELLS PETER'S MARTYRDOM THAT PETER WILL LOVE CHRIST SACRIFICIALLY EVEN TO THE POINT OF LAYING DOWN HIS LIFE. HE SAID YOU WILL STRETCH OUT YOUR HANDS AND THEY WILL LEAD YOU WHERE YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO. ST. JOHN ADDS THIS NOTE IN HIS GOSPEL TO SHARE THAT PETER'S DEATH, HIS MARTYRDOM WOULD GLORIFY GOD. HE SAID THIS SIGNIFYING BY WHAT KIND OF DEATH HE WOULD GLORIFY GOD. AND THEN PETER TO BE STRENGTHENED ALONG WITH THE OTHER APOSTLES AT PENTECOST IN ORDER TO BE STRENGTHENED TO PERSEVERE TO THE END. AND HOW WOULD PETER'S DEATH GLORIFY GOD AS ST. JOHN WOULD STATE. FIRST OF ALL, HE DIED FOR THE TRUTH OF THE FAITH AND FOR THE GOSPEL. HIS MARTYRDOM PROVED THE TRUTH THAT HE PREACHED. NO ONE WOULD DIE FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY KNEW WAS FALSE. HE HAD BEEN WITH THE LORD AND SEEN THE LORD BEFORE AND AFTER HIS RESURRECTION. HE WAS WILLING TO DIE FOR THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL. AND PETER DIED FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST, FOR THE LOVE OF OUR GOD MADE INCARNATE. OUR GOD MADE INCARNATE. WHAT IS MORE GLORIOUS THAN TO DIE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. PETER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GLORIFY GOD BY DYING IN THE SAME MANNER BY CRUCIFIXION. PETER WAS CRUCIFIED UPSIDE DOWN AFTER HE PROTESTED HE WAS NOT WORTHY TO DIE AS CHRIST. AND WHAT CAN BE LEARNED FROM THIS GOSPEL ACCOUNT? ONE THING THAT WE LEARN FROM THIS IS THAT PETER WASN'T THE ONLY ONE WHO EVER DENIED OR OFFENDED THE LORD. WE CAN LEARN FROM SAINT PETER TO HUMBLY AND HONESTLY ADMIT OUR SINS AND WEAKNESSES TO THE LORD. WE SEE THAT PETER WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND DISTRESSED. HE WAS WELL-AWARE OF HIS WEAKNESS. LIKEWISE, IT CAN BE UNCOMFORTABLE FOR US TO REPENT, TO ADMIT OUR SINS, AND TO CONFESS THEM. BUT IN CONFESSION, THE LORD RECONCILES, HEALS, STRENGTHENS AND ENCOURAGES US. PETER'S ENCOUNTER WITH CHRIST ALSO PROBABLY HELPED HIM TO SYMPATHIZE WITH THE WEAKNESS OF OTHERS AND TO REMEMBER THE LORD'S MERCY WHEN HE HIMSELF HAD FALLEN. WE ARE CALLED TO BE MERCIFUL TO OTHERS. AND IF GOD HAS BEEN SO MERCIFUL TO ME OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, HOW CAN I FAIL TO FORGIVE SOMEONE ELSE WHO HAS OFFENDED ME? SAINT PETER WOULD ALSO BE MORE CAUTIOUS IN THE FUTURE REGARDING RESPONDING RATIONALLY AND TRUSTING TOO MUCH IN HIMSELF AND IN HIS OWN STRENGTH. WE SEE THIS IN HIS RESPONSE TO THE LORD'S QUESTION, DO YOU LOVE ME MORE THAN THESE? HE DIDN'T DARE SAY YES, LORD, I LOVE YOU MORE THAN ALL THESE. BECAUSE HE WAS JUST, AGAIN, WELL AWARE OF HIS OWN WEAKNESS. BUT HE RESPONDS YES, LORD, YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU. I DON'T KNOW THE HEARTS OF THESE OTHER PEOPLE. THEY MIGHT LOVE YOU MORE THAN I DO, BUT I DO LOVE YOU. THAT WAS A HUMBLE RESPONSE. HIS FAULTS AND HIS WEAKNESSES MADE HIM HUMBLE BUT NOT DISTRUSTFUL OF THE LORD AND HIS GOODNESS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REMINDED BY TODAY'S GOSPEL THAT IT WAS THE LORD WHO TOOK THE INITIATIVE IN RESTORING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PETER AND HIMSELF. IT WAS CHRIST WHO STARTED THE CONVERSATION ASKING PETER THREE TIMES IF HE LOVED HIM. SIMILARLY, IT'S CHRIST WHO TAKES THE INITIATIVE IN RESTORING OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM AFTER A FALL. IT MIGHT BE THAT PROMPTING IN OUR HEARTS TO REPENT AND MAKE A GOOD CONFESSION. LORD, THE GOOD SHEPHERD, SEEKS US OUT AND LOVINGLY INVITES US TO REPENT AND TO RETURN TO HIM. TO BE RECONCILED TO HIM. AND ANOTHER CONSIDERATION IS TO ASK OURSELVES HOW WE WOULD RESPOND IF OUR LORD ASKED US RIGHT NOW TODAY, DO YOU LOVE ME? HOW DO WE SHOW OUR LOVE FOR THE LORD? IS IT SEEN IN OUR LIFE OF DAILY PRAYER? IS IT SEEN IN OUR FULFILLING TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY OUR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES? IN THE WAY THAT WE INTERACT WITH OTHERS THE WAY THAT WE TREAT THEM? IS IT SEEN IN HOW WE RESPOND TO THE CROSSES THAT COME OUR WAY? DO WE EMBRACE THEM OR DO WE FLEE FROM THEM? IT WAS ABOUT A WEEK OR SO AGO, THAT WE CELEBRATED ST. PHILIP NERI. AND HE SAID IF WE RUN FROM THE CROSS, IF WE DON'T EMBRACE THE CROSS, WE ARE GOING TO GET A HEAVIER ONE. SO WE WANT TO EMBRACE THE CROSS-THAT'S A WAY OF SHOWING OUR LOVE FOR THE LORD. TO TAKE UP OUR CROSS EACH DAY. IN THE CONCLUSION OF TODAY'S GOSPEL, JESUS TOLD PETER VERY SIMPLY, FOLLOW ME. THAT IS A CALL THAT IS DIRECTED TO EACH OF US AS WELL! FOLLOW ME." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] this design for the Golden Dome will in integrate with our existing defense capabilities and should be fully operational before the end of my term there's non driver once upon a time wars were fought in the trenches today wars happen miles above us skies have become the new front lines take the recent IndiaPakistan conflict there were drone attacks missiles flying and fighter jets engaged in combat and it's not just about offense controlling the skies can decide the fate of nations and that means air defense systems that protect the skies above us so Donald Trump is pitching an idea to protect American skies he's promising a dome the golden dome now if you're picturing a shiny gilded bubble over the capital I hate to burst it but this is not like a literal dome this golden dome is like a missile shield in space think Star Wars but with a MAGA hat and what's the price tag a whopping $175 billion once fully constructed the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space and we will have the best system ever built as you know we helped Israel with theirs and was very successful and now we have technology that's even far advanced from that the idea itself is not new back in 1983 Ronald Reagan pitched something similar he called it the Strategic Defense Initiative which was quickly nicknamed Star Wars it imagined space-based lasers they would shoot down missiles in flight billions of dollars were spent on this models were built but scientists were skeptical and ultimately nothing usable came out of it and now all these years later Donald Trump wants to revive it we will truly be completing the job that President Reagan started 40 years ago forever ending the missile threat to the American homeland and the success rate is very close to 100% which is incredible when you think of it you're shooting bullets out of the air so how does it work imagine this a ring of defense a layered shield wrapped around the Earth it has three core components first space-based sensors satellites circling the globe scanning for missile launches in real time that's the first part second interceptor networks missiles stationed on the ground and in orbit they will be ready to meet incoming threats midair some can collide into warheads others zap targets with lasers and the third part is an AI command center multiple centers they will analyze threats calculate responses and launch counterattacks within seconds that is the vision now the US already has missile defense systems so this will fuse what exists with what's next basically a global shield it will detect decide and destroy before a threat even touches down there's never been anything like this this is something that's going to be uh very protective i think you can rest assured there'll be nothing like this nobody else is capable of building it either is this something that military commanders asked you for did did they ask you to do this uh well let me put it differently i suggested it and they all said we love the idea sir it's just like Trump to take credit for this but this is quite the ambitious plan and look at the price tag like I said it will cost around $175 billion the initial funding is 25 billion it's included in a new bill which the Congress the US Congress needs to approve i'm also pleased to report that the one big beautiful bill will include $25 billion for the Golden Dome to help construction get underway that's the initial sort of a down deposit and we have uh probably you're talking about General we're talking about $175 billion total cost of this when it's completed so Trump is pitching this like America's Iron Dome but will it work is this plan even feasible there are two main problems with it first the area that it is expected to cover you see the United States is a big country it's the third largest country in the world after Russia and Canada america's size is 9.8 million square kilometers compare that to Israel which has an iron dome israel is just about 20,000 square kilometers that's the size of the US state of New Jersey so the United States is 490 times the size of Israel a dome to cover this vast area of land will be a tall order that's the first challenge the second one is the cost trump says it will be $175 billion that's a lot of money but experts are not convinced they think it's going to be a lot more and I'll tell you why the Iron Dome uses an interceptor missile called the Tamil missile it costs around $50,000 per missile that's the cost of each missile $50,000 so 50,000 to take down even a basic rocket imagine that for a country the size of the United States and the cost will increase every year so 175 billion is a modest assumption and beyond cost and technical feasibility there's another big problem a space war china has already issued a warning it wants the US to halt any plans for this golden dome last month Beijing and Moscow issued a statement they said this could destabilize space it accused Washington of plotting to militarize space so if the US does start putting weapons in space it could herald a new arms race an arms race in space for now the Pentagon is being cautious officials admit that the plan is is in its conceptual phase no serious funding has been secured yet except for the initial $25 billion that Trump announced it's amazing how easy this one is to fund you know some funding is tough and some is easy when we say we're going to save everyone's lives in a crazy world it seems to be very easy to get so Trump says people are ready with money it's not clear who these people are although there is a group that is very interested in this project and that is the American defense companies the likes of Loheed Martin Rathon Valanter and Anduran they are circling this plan like vultures Loheed's representatives have made a pitch using the F-35 jets to strike any threats Elon Musk SpaceX is also in the mix it is reportedly offering launch services so for defense companies this is not just a missile shield it's a billion dollar feeding frenzy also there's something quite appealing about the idea of a sky shield an invisible umbrella protecting a country for Donald Trump it's the perfect metaphor so the Golden Dome is also the perfect branding it is bold expensive and more importantly it is golden so this Golden Dome is not just about stopping missiles it's about sending a message a message to all American enemies a message of invincibility at First Post we are choosing to hold on to accuracy that means we won't always be first we may not get you your breaking alert but what you will get is what we owe you and

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] you want to know [Music] [Music] welcome to the multiverse of Pakistan here facts do not matter evidence does not count all that's important is propaganda the more ludicrous the claim the better and guess what the new one is that India is sponsoring terror against Pakistan that Pakistani insurgents and terrorists are Indian proxies and who's saying all of this mr truth himself Pakistan's defense minister Haja Af let me give you the background first pakistan's provinces are in open rebellion in Baloistan separatists are demanding independence they are led by the BLA that's the Balo Liberation Army in 2025 alone this year alone they've carried out 71 attacks 71 attacks on 51 locations just yesterday there was a suicide bombing at least six people were killed in Huzdar though in this case no group has claimed responsibility so that's Baloasan then you have Hibber Pakunwa this province is home base for the TTP that's the Tik Taliban Pakistan or the Pakistani Taliban they have carried out 300 attacks this year 300 attacks in the first five months of 2025 and finally you have Sind the province is up in arms over a canal project take a look at this [Music] [Applause] this canal would divert water from Synth to Punjab so the locals are protesting and just look at the scene security officials are being manhandled the home minister's house was ransacked and protesters are firing guns into the air frankly it looks like the state has lost control the army controls some of the big cities in Punjab and Synind but beyond that it's the wild west instead of fixing that what does Pakistan do blame India listen to Huaja Aiv's statement bla and TTP are Indian proxies they have nothing to do with religion or nationalism india is financing them and they're involved in bloodshed here we will present evidence of India's involvement we will corroborate whatever we have claimed where do we start pakistan says the BLA and the TTP are Indian proxies now first of all make up your mind are they Afghan proxies or Indian proxies because you keep saying both secondly where is the evidence india's allegations are rooted in facts we have captured Pakistani terrorists alive in India we have intercepted their communication we have seized Pakistani weapons and technology we have all of this but Islamabad has done none of this guess why because there is nothing to find india has called Pakistan's allegations baseless and attempt to divert attention from its own poor reputation just think about it the TTP wants to set up a Sharia state on India's borders they think the current Pakistani regime is not Islamic enough why on earth would India back such a group the fact is these are homegrown baloistan has been ignored and suppressed for years hence the locals are revoling the TTP is Pakistan's own evil creation time for a short history lesson pakistan cultivated radicals to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan this dates back to the 1980s the Soviets left but the radicalism did not cut to 2001 the US invaded Afghanistan after the 9/11 attack and Pakistan supported this American invasion so those same radicals turned against Islamabad they banded together with the likes of al-Qaeda this is the short history of the TTP the K Taliban Pakistan this is not an Indian proxy it is Pakistan's own creation of course in Islava's multiverse that is not the case on the one hand they blame India on the other they want talks pakistan's Prime Minister Sheba Sharif is proposing a dialogue with India he says the talks will cover four issues kashmir terror water and trade he also says that the talk should be held at some neutral venue like Saudi Arabia now first of all this is plain delusion pakistan sponsored a terror attack in Pahelgam then and they now expect India to reward them with talks it defies all logic secondly this is a blatant attempt to internationalize the issue to bring a third party on board and India has firmly rejected this approach even today the foreign ministry made that clear that any IndiaPakistan engagement has to be bilateral i would at the same time I would like to remind you that talks and terror don't go together on terrorism itself as I had said earlier we are open to discussing the handing over to India of noted terrorists whose list was given to Pakistan some years ago i would also like to underline that any bilateral discussion on Jammu and Kashmir will only be on the vacation of illegally occupied Indian territory by Pakistan now if you look at history that is true just think back to all major India Pakistan dialogues 1972 Shimla 1999 Lahore 2001 Agra 2004 Islamabad 20 2011 Mujali 2014 New Delhi and 2015 Lahore now some of these were formal summits some were informal outreaches either way what's important is the location not some neutral conference room in the Gulf or the Alps these meetings happened in India or Pakistan we don't have language barriers we don't have distance issues what we have is Pakistan's refusal to reform so India should not fall for this outreach it's a tactic to turn this bilateral issue into a global one instead we should demand action whether it's returning Pakistan occupied Kashmir or cutting off links to terrorism we've had almost eight decades of dialogue it's now time for action at First Post we are choosing to hold on to accuracy that means we won't always be first we may not get you your breaking alert but what you will get is what we owe you and that is the truth verified checked and cross-cheed we rely on sources and verified ones after all that's what separates a journalist from a loudspeaker but sometimes even we miss a beat and when we do we will tell you we ran visuals from a

The country has knocked on the doors of IMF for loan but it seems funds from the international body won't be enough to save the country from its economic distress. Just a few days ago, Pakistan's minister appealed to the nation to reduce its consumption of tea by one to two cups, because they 'import tea on loan'. Surging commodity prices and mounting debt has led the country to a position where it can only afford another month-and-a-half worth of imports. Watch this video for more." />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] pakistan is starting and appears headed for a collapse even the expected imf loan will not save it but can the world allow a nuclear pakistan to fail will pakistan's nuke save the country from a disaster first let's understand the gravity of the problem in pakistan the story unfolding in pakistan has a striking and worrying resemblance to sri lanka consider this even sipping a cup of tea is a luxury in pakistan now i appealed to the nation to cut down on the consumption of tea by one to two cups because we import tea on loan pakistan federal minister of planning assan iqbal told the nation on 14 june indeed islamabad is confronted with a massive socio-economic crisis the global commodity price surge has stoked runaway inflation it's at about 25 percent right now mounting dollar payments for the country's food and energy import bill has eroded for its reserves and the value of the pakistan rupee moreover debt servicing costs and rating downgrades have further added to the weakness of the currency which has stumbled about 25 percent against the dollar in 2022 alone it has recovered some ground in august on hopes of an imf bailout recently pakistan's finance minister mitta ismail explained the daunting challenge before the shaiba shari fled coalition the country needs 41 billion dollars in forex reserves over the next year or so of this 21 billion is needed for debt repayments 12 billion for current account deficit financing and another 8 billion to replenish foreign exchange reserves at this point pakistan only has forex reserves of about nine billion dollars about a month and a half worth of imports now you can clearly see that an imf loan alone will not bail out pakistan meanwhile pakistan has now begun meeting the preconditions set by the imf for a funding lifeline recently it has raised fuel prices substantially further worsening the standards of living in the country some experts claim millions may have slipped into poverty because of the increase in the cost of living closures of cap services restaurants and small businesses unable to afford the prohibitive price rise in the domestic economy have been reported in a section of the local media many are now worried about social and economic unrest again pointing out the similarities to sri lanka but the silver lining for pakistan is that the imf has now stated that pakistan has met all its preconditions for the 1.2 billion dollar financial assistance how many times will the imf come to pakistan's rescue in 2019 pakistan got financial assistance from the imf for the 22nd time now while a 1.2 billion dollar lifeline is quite inadequate to bail out pakistan it is likely to open more funding options for islamabad from allies to other multinational donors allies such as iran turkey saudi arabia and of course it's all whether french china may have to extend loans and grants to islamabad to prevent it from defaulting on its external debt obligations meanwhile the smile has asked fellow pakistanis to grace for bad days but maintained the country is on the right track but can the world afford to let a nuclear pakistan fail more so given that taliban ruled afghanistan is its labor very unlikely both the superpowers the u.s and china will be low to let a nuclear-armed pakistan collapse given its geopolitical significance indeed if it were to happen it would probably be seen as biden's biggest foreign policy disaster by most americans much worse than the afghanistan fiasco and china has vital interest in pakistan through the ambitious china-pakistan economic corridor instead the global community is likely to push pakistan to adopt reforms and manage its resources more efficiently than it has done so far the imf is demanding deep-seated reforms in pakistan from higher taxes to cutting subsidies the goal is to push pakistan to raise resources internally cut dependence on dollar debt and move away from the politics of handouts and populism so far pakistan seems to be complying with the imf it seems even desperate for it and understandably so in fact some media reports suggested pakistan may have led the u.s to al-qaeda zawahiri's hideout to get u.s support for assistance from the ironman still pakistan's track record is not inspiring pakistan has often green meshed on its commitments in the middle of eight programs but perhaps policymakers in islamabad will realize time is not on this side anymore pakistan over the decades has destroyed its economy with its mammoth military expenditure as it tried to match india's military muscle it pursued an ambitious nuclear program with former prime minister zulfiqar ali bhutto once famously asserting we'll eat grass but make the bomb that's how it has turned out unfortunately for pakistan put to approve president a u.s ally through the cold war islamabad depended on generous aid from washington and international donors like the imf to keep its economy afloat in a changed post-cold war era the has found a new ally in india and pakistan has turned to china saudi arabia the uae and others to sustain its debt fueled economy through all this pakistan has remained an agri and aid dependent economy political instability has meant pakistan never really invested in the building blocks of an economic boom such as robust infrastructure independent institutions or vibrant domestic industry or even a vibrant democracy in fact pakistan's crippling power shortages have been big stumbling blocks for the domestic manufacturing investors

          <attvalue for="7" value="climate crisis all of the upheavalss in the world economy even aside from the interventions of uh uh leaders choosing wrong things just the technological upheavalss are astounding and you know that better than than I So this is uh something um quite dramatic But another thing that's very dramatic is the geopolitical changes that are underway They are remarkable They're very dangerous but on the whole not bad Actually what's happening is that a familiar world led so-called by the United States and Europe is no longer led by the United States and Europe Uh it was presumptuous to be led by the United States and Europe to begin with Uh it's actually the end of a very long cycle that dates back to 1492 uh and onward because it started with a a voyage that was a little bit uh went arai and changed the world uh fundamentally Um and they say that how do you know that uh Christopher Columbus was an economist by the way uh he didn't know where he was going He didn't know where he was when he got there and it was all on a government grant Uh so this is part for the course But um the world became a Europeanled world with a a lot of uh cruelty and a lot of inequality and a lot of domination Um and with a lot of remarkable technological development uh that came along with it but that was utilized as a form of power and oppression as well and the United States dominated the world for about a half a century after 1945 Now we're in a very different world and um the uh voices of other parts of the world are really important and um growing and that means that in the media and in the political life in the western world there's a lot more anxiety actually than there is in China for example or in India where it's not pessimistic It's not feeling that the world's falling apart It's feeling that the world is changing in the right direction actually and I would say if you look at opinion surveys in Africa there's a tremendous amount of optimism actually Africa is the most optimistic single continent uh in the world uh if you look at opinion surveys So the world's changing and it leads to a lot of anxiety and the anxiety is highest in the United States because nobody likes to be pushed off the perch Uh but the fact of the matter is um the world's becoming a lot more interesting diverse interconnected You're a very diverse group but not quite diverse enough There aren't are there any Chinese faces here no we have somebody from Hong Kong Okay good Hong Kong we were just there It's wonderful Uh and uh India Great Okay So between the two you're 40% of the world population but not not exactly 40% of this room So it's just to say we don't have to have a complete demographic equality but you're a very diverse group which is extremely important very important Uh and um the world's even more diverse if I could put it that way So we need to strive for uh for that and viewed in that perspective My own view is I'll say a grim statement and then an optimistic statement If we don't blow things up which is possible then things are going to be okay uh and by that I mean the world that is taking shape will be more equal more open actually benefiting from a lot of the breakthroughs in technology The real worry I have is just disaster in the in the short term because my country is the worst lead that it's ever been and our political system has collapsed So we have one person rule which is not exactly the way to run a a society of 335 million people and $30 trillion of output but that's what what we have for the moment But if we can avoid the catastrophes we actually not just rhetorically and not just optimistically we really have a lot of solutions in this world for food production for sustainable energy for uh better education and health care systems for all sorts of things that are completely wonderful They're not they're getting discovered They're getting developed You're pioneering many of them They're not getting undertaken at any at the scale that they need and the pace that they need by any means but they could be because there's no fundamental shortfall of resources or knowhow We're not running out of particular minerals so that we can't do this We're not running out of land so that we're in a struggle for who eats and who doesn't eat We're not running out of energy because solar radiation is about 5,000 times our power usage on the planet So if we deploy uh solar power which is now cheaper than any other kind of power We're we're not in an energy shortage as well We're not in a knowhow shortage but we are in a fairness shortage We're in a niceness shortage We're in a calmness shortage Uh we're in a geopolitical crisis And we are with a lot of instability from all of the upheavalss of climate which are going to get worse for the next 50 years almost no matter what we do because underlying our physical reality is a lot of warming built into the system and a lot of shocks that will come from that That doesn't mean that the impacts necessarily get worse because things can get buffered We can become more resilient We can become adapted But the climate itself is going to become more dangerous shortly So this is our state of affairs Now what specifically happened yesterday was the US declared itself outside of the world trade system Two weeks ago the US declared itself outside of the climate challenge Uh three weeks ago the US declared itself out of the sustainability challenge Four weeks ago the US declared itself outside of the WH All right Honestly it doesn't get dumber than this really But the US is 4.1% of the world population And as I said the other 95% I don't see things diminishing in intensity of purpose but rather increasing and there are a lot of very good things that are happening even because of the United States strangeness of behavior right now For example China and India which have been at loggerheads for 60 years for a more than that for almost 80 years for a complicated reason that the British drew a an arbitrary borderline in the Himalayas uh and that has meant border dispute and conflict between China and India since India gained independence in 1947 and the people's republic of China was formed in 1949 and they're still fighting over a line that a guy named McMahon drew arbitrarily in 1880 never having been up to the Himalayas where he drew the line and there is by the way a theorem that I kind of subscribe to that all problems in the world go back to the British Um so that's true in the Middle East It's true in the Himalayas It's true in m much much of the world Yes it's true all over Africa It is actually a very good rule of thumb It's not it's not quite a proven theorem but it's a very good rule of thumb Um in any event the Indian and Chinese foreign ministers got together and said &quot;What are we fighting about uh we should trade more We should invest more.&quot; And then very positive statements came from Prime Minister Modi and from President Xi Then uh last week three other countries that are at loggerheads for no reason in the world Honestly China Korea and Japan They are divided because the United States says you're on our side and they're the enemy Uh to China and Japan and I mean to Korea and Japan visa v China The three got together because they see the US not such a great you know protector of their interests and they said we need to improve relations with each other This is very very good And if you think about Iran and Saudi Arabia for example which was defined by the US to be the uh you know the the the fundamental schism of Shia and Sunni and so much of US policy was playing the Sunnis against Shia Iran and so forth They made a raproma last year which China helped to broker in a very wise way The United States would never have done it and never even have thought about it But uh China was very helpful So truly I'm not so pessimistic at all I just see the world changing and I can understand the pessimism in the newspapers that I happen to read in the US because they're all geared around the idea of the US as number one And if you put that aside I like a world in which China's playing a much larger role and India is playing a much larger role and the African Union's playing a much larger role and Saudi Arabia is playing a much larger role To me this a great world It's it's a world of diversity much better food uh much better conversation much better places to visit much more fun uh in uh conferences and meetings and problem solving and all the rest Uh but if you just happen to be a US strategist it looks very grim and dangerous and so forth So I don't buy into the danger part I do buy into well I do buy into the danger part for the reasons I said but I don't buy into the inevitability of crisis So what I would really like you guys to do is to stay on the the networking course and the practical course and the problemolving course and I want us to help you to do that Uh so and just to be very clear you know SDSN youth is not to empower youth per se it's to help solve global problems of which you have a lot of solutions So that's a little bit different Uh we have a little more access than you do to some places uh being older and gray hair but you uh know how to fix our phones and computers a lot better than we do Uh and what's going on with the the latest apps and how to use them and so forth And that's actually unique knowledge in our world right now Um and so it's really important that you're at the table It's true you should be at the table for two reasons One to protect the interests of your generation against uh uh 78-year-old US presidents that don't know how to think ahead So that's true but I don't think that's the main reason you should be at the table The main reason you should be at the table is you can help move this agenda forward in a very significant way So I had good experience when I was young I luckily thrust into places where I could do something at an early stage of my career And um thank God it worked cuz otherwise that would have been the end of it Uh but in any event um you can do a lot but I also know um we can help you uh too because you learn you learn a lot actually along the way as well Um every day I learn something that I say I cannot believe I didn't know that for the last 50 years of trying to know what I know and pretty fundamental stuff every day which is weird to me actually cuz by now it should be kind of wrote but it's not wrote at all There's just so much to learn and I kind of walk around my whole life with a book in my hand or now with a with an ebook or on my phone or something reading reading reading every day and learning pretty basic things actually which is annoying uh really annoying because it should have been done already uh but it's not So all of that is to say we can help you uh and I can help you and I can help you network and I can help you learn things So don't presume you know everything but don't presume that you don't know what you're seeing with your own eyes about things that can be done So that's really the balance that's extremely important Now what's going to happen after 2030 let me say a few words about that cuz you're going to play a big role in that Um obviously we're not going to achieve what we set out to achieve in 20 2015 September 25th 2015 when Pope Francis ushered in the sustainable development goals at the UN The agenda was pretty optimistic beforehand Uh at the time it was very stretch goals It would have required a lot of capacity and working together to make them happen Um of course we just didn't get the major powers to work very hard on any of this Uh the only one that made a major effort in my view was China Actually uh Europe said a few things at the beginning but Europe got caught in this Ukraine war which to my mind was a just a disastrous mistake because the United States doesn't know how to make peace Uh and uh blew the chance after 1991 to help in help create a true collective security arrangement in Europe Instead it expanded NATO But I don't want to go there just to say the US didn't try Europe didn't try very much China launched the Bel and Road Initiative which is very big and positive thing Uh Africa launched the African continental free trade area which is a very important thing uh and a very positive development But the world as a whole for the major powers didn't try very hard So we're reaching and I don't want to go into it but my view is uh the US at the University of North Carolina concocted something called SARS cove 2 and made a pandemic That's another long story Uh but um we just lost a lot of time So what are we going to do my hope personally and this is something we can discuss longer is that we continue under the framework of the sustainable development goals And the reason is it's taken 10 years to have governments understand a bit about how to make such a complicated multi-dimensional programming process because it's not simple to do this to plan for 17 major objectives long-term planning strategy and so forth Now the goals won't stay exactly the same but I don't want to redo everything to have a new set of goals and uh a new framework because honestly to my mind it would be it it may be constructive in bringing new voices in to be sure So I don't want to rule out deliberations which will take place but I don't think we should throw out everything because it just would be a major loss in time sync and in our world today the US will walk away from the table anyway and it just may be very hard to get a framework other framework So I'm hoping we continue under this broad rubric resetting adding no doubt something about artificial intelligence as SDG-18 or repackaging uh repackaging some of the uh objectives and so on but to keep this framework to midentury because the next period to my mind is is to 2050 is to midentury and that's in fact what we need to decarbonize the energy system It's what we need to transform agriculture It's what we need to create a a workable digital society in which good things rather than bad things happen with these new technologies and so forth So that's what I think we will be what I am going to be aiming for in the next few years This will probably be decided more or less around 27 2027 or 2028 So there will be a UN process Uh the next secretary general will assign a commission probably There'll be a deliberations You'll be involved in national level and global processes and youth ambassadors and many ways And we should really strategize together about this and you should make further outreach to other groups uh in order to do this One basic point is that what makes all of this very hard is thinking ahead on a time horizon and a complexity longer than governments know how to do So if you want to change the energy system it's not a one year or a 5year or a 10year process You really have to be able to think about 25 years or 30 years and basic changes of technology and learn how to put that into a real political process and so forth And this is what I find most governments don't know how to do effectively Again China is better at planning in this way than any other government that I know among the major governments Europe's not bad at setting goals but it then doesn't necessarily actually create the uh the planning to deliver them very effectively I'll say also I have huge hopes expectations and demands of the African Union in the coming years There's a new AU commission that just came into office on March 15 and Africa needs to make a breakthrough in the next 30 years It can't go on like this with many conflicts with kids not in school with the systems not working with electricity not reaching still hundreds of millions of people And that's what we were discussing in the financing for development workshop that we had earlier this week How to make those breakthroughs So one thing I'm asking of you is helping to instill the idea of really basic transformation uh in your countries regions and since we're going to do it together at a at a world scale that yes we really can create a better future And it's not only wish fulfillment it's actually very practical work Very for me by the way I I caught uh who had a slide that I think uh Chened about the importance of education as being fun absolutely fundamental Was that you Chenade yeah In any event okay there are probably 300 million kids not even in school right now and we have to absolutely say no Are you kidding not another school year like this This is crazy And the reason they're not in school in some places is because of conflict and displacement But for at least 200 250 million kids is because the governments don't have the funds to hire teachers to have the schools and so forth And I want to have a fit together with you to the powers that be that this cannot go on any longer You cannot leave kids out of school in this world They cannot have a future that way This is the most basic point of everything that we're trying to do Everything every one of you had the fortune and you probably had a lot of struggles twists and turns good luck parents that helped friends that helped family that helped somehow that you could get an education But I think that's the first thing we really need to do is to put our foot down and say no more faking it to any to the host countries but they don't have the money to the IMF to the World Bank to China to anyone else You got to help make sure that all the kids are in school period and then there are all the other issues that we're dealing with I won't uh belabor the point any longer because I know the time is time is short but let's you guys are really important in this process and to add to your importance connect with others that you think we need to bring into this process because this is a very powerful group that can really make a huge difference and can really by the way you can help the older ministers in the government the presidents and so forth understand this is no joke This is real for your societies This really can be done You can tell them Professor Sax said so and that they got to get on with it and that we're here to help and we're going to get the financing that they need That was we really are going to get the financing that governments need But you need to help lay out the plans the ideas very operational the wonderful things that can be done Um and really inspire your countries and your friends and uh your the businesses you're dealing with and uh think very very big And let's uh plan to meet every few weeks to uh keep that" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] foreign [Music] let's begin with a quiz who was the first prime minister of Independent India easy right okay who was the first home minister of free India again it should be easy but do you know who was India's first Home Secretary or India's first cabinet secretary if you're a quizzer maybe otherwise chances are you don't it's an unfortunate reality of our history we only see politicians as the makers of Modern India not civil servants or bureaucrats or the good old babus now don't get me wrong the leaders deserve the spotlight most of it would not have been possible without them but they alone did not make our country the foundations were also laid by our civil servants some foreign some India they advised the ministers and politicians they ran day-to-day Affairs they put new systems and checks in place so today we are bringing you their story the story of The Unsung makers of Modern India time for a flashback our story doesn't start at Independence it begins around 200 years before that the British East India Company was capturing power in India they needed bureaucrats people to run their growing Empire so the company created the CCS or the covenanted Civil Service your marriage did not really matter the company's directors would choose you once picked you would sail down to India but by the 1850s things changed a Civil Service Commission was set up in London from 1855 regular exams were held if you crack that you would get appointed and before you think wow that's a lot like today it wasn't the exams were only held in London the syllabus was mostly European classics so for most Indians it was a non-starter nonetheless some did crack this Elite Test the first Indian in the Indian civil services was satyendra Nath tagore he was the brother of rabindranath tagore he cracked the test in 1864. three years later four others also succeeded but these men were the exceptions the norm was white British civil servants by 1883 there were just 12 Indians in the Civil Service the Indian civil service by 1915 it was 63 the rest were all Europeans the largely white bureaucracy ruled over the 250 million Indians it was unfair but then again what would you expect it was the British Raj India waited a long time for the civil services exam to be held at home it finally happened after the first world war from 1922 exams were held in allahabad later Delhi also became a center now this was important because the test became more accessible to Indians more Indians could write it so more Indians could become civil servants in their own country eventually they began acing it Subhash Chandra Bose for example stood forth in the 1920 batch he also reported for his training but the next year in 1921 he resigned and we all know what happened next same story with police officers most of them were Europeans until 1931 only 20 percent of the posts were filled by Indians this would change around the beginning of the second World War now why did I tell you this long back story because the past is crucial to understand the present and the future India's civil service was not made for Indians it was made for the British much like the Indian railways or the post don't think of these European officers as loyal to India they were the embodiment of Imperial Britain as someone once said to jawaharlal nehru they were neither Indian nor civil nor servants so even at Independence the Civil Service retained those characteristics at least some of them let's look at pre-partition India in 1947. we had 980 Civil Service officers 468 of them were European so around 47 of them the rest were Indians 352 Hindus 101 Muslims 25 Indian Christians 13 parses and 10 Sikhs after partition the service was split India created the Indian administrative service IAS Pakistan created the Pakistan administrative service both still exist their officers became the backbone of these new countries in India the politicians realized one thing good or bad you needed the civil servants especially Sardar vallabhbhai Patel this was a speech to the constituent assembly there is no alternative to this administrative system the union will go you will not have a United India if you do not have good all India services it tells you how important they were we say Sardar Patel United India but he himself said the civil services kept India United so what exactly did they do well the roles were split into different jobs some of them served in the Central department the central government as secretaries or joint secretaries others served in the judicial side of things basically in courts they could become a district judge or a judge at the State high court and finally some served in the states as District collectors or assistant Commissioners they kept the wheels running while politicians made grand plans these civil servants studied the ship and it was no easy task most of the European officers left after 1947 they either retired or joined the British civil service but a handful did stay behind meet JPL Gwynn he served in free India's Board of Revenue until 1968 he was the last British citizen from the Indian civil services by the late 1970s most of these men had retired or left the ICS had given way to the Ias the last officer was Nirmal Kumar Mukherjee he retired as cabinet secretary in 1980. he was India's final ICS officer the end of an era I guess many of these officers laid the foundation for so many things around us things that we now take for granted like elections India's first general election was held in 1951 it was conducted by this Man sukumar Singh he joined the Indian civil service in 1921 during the election he was Chief Secretary of West Bengal he was sent on deputation as a chief election Commissioner of India you think elections are complicated now just imagine the situation in 1951 around 85 percent of the country could not read or write so how was this election held using symbols sukumar San published a report on the entire process it reveals the work that went into it the number of people involved and let me tell you it's mind-boggling you need different people in different roles to conduct these elections you need electoral registration officers they fill up the voters list you need returning officers who take nominations and declare results you also need presiding officers the people who will be in charge of polling stations in 1952 all of this was done by civil servants more than 1600 registration officers were appointed around 1200 were appointed as returning officers these were Commissioners and collectors and finally the presiding officers India had more than 132 000 polling stations one lakh 32 000. who would be in charge of them sukumar sen and his team came up with a solution only government employees with a monthly salary of 60 rupees or more would be appointed no non-officials if there was a shortage teachers would be called it and even today India follows the system it was a wise decision made by India civil servants they understood how important the first election was too important to trust non-officials with it thus a proceed into a set more than 300 000 police officers were also deployed there's a reason we focused on the election because that is the Beating Heart of India's democracy had we failed in 1951 there's no saying what would have happened many newspapers called it a huge gamble but it paid off and we have our government servants to thank for that the collectors the tehsildars the Commissioners many nameless faces if you Google India's 1951 election none of them will pop up it's all about the politicians and their parties I guess that hasn't changed even now but it's important that we remember and honor them especially now the civil services are under constant criticism today the word bureaucracy has actually become negative it's almost synonymous with roadblocks perhaps we are too harsh or perhaps our civil servants have also lost their way they laid the foundation of Modern India they presided over a bloody partition and the birth of a new nation they traveled the world as diplomats and envoys those civil servants were not just wheels on which India moved forward they were also engines that pushed us along this Independence Day let's honor those unsung heroes" />

          <attvalue for="7" value="[Music] it was August 15 1975 most of Daka was still waking up but suddenly the sound of bullets rang across the city they came from here danan mondi 32 the personal residence of shik mujibur Rahman he was then president of Bangladesh pretty soon the picture was clear muji's Army had turned on him a military takeover was underway a group of young officers attacked the president's house he was surrounded by guns mujib and his family locked themselves inside one of the rooms once the firing ended he stepped out immediately the officers caught hold of him mujib kept asking them what do you want where are you taking me but shik mujib was not being kidnapped the officers had planned something worse one of them sprayed bullets on the president around 18 bullets struck him the founder of Bangladesh collapsed in a pool of blood most of his family was killed that night just two members survived his two daughters shik Hina and shik Rana shik Hina was hundreds of miles away in Germany Bangladesh's Ambassador broke the news to her it was hard to process she couldn't believe her father the legendary bangabondhu was not not alive anymore what's more Bengali assassins had killed him from that moment shik hina's life changed she would live in Exile she would make a brave comeback she would be jailed but today she's the tallest leader in Bangladesh controversial but popular and she stands on the brink of yet another term as prime minister so how did shik Casina resurrect her family Legacy how did she she rebuild from the tragedy of August 15th time for a flashback shik Hina was born in 1947 back then there was no Bangladesh it was East Pakistan she was born in a place called gopal Gan near Dhaka she was the eldest of five children by now her father was an established politician it had a downside though shik mujib was in jail a lot the children saw very little of him once a friend asked Hina how do you address your father what do you call him the young Hina had no answer she realized that she hardly had the chance shik mujib was in jail from 1949 to 1952 even afterwards the government always targeted him like in 1954 another arrest then in 1958 another one and these experiences shaped hina's politics from a young age she rejected Pakistan in school her class had a subject called social knowledge one chapter was about Ayub Khan Pakistan's military dictator when the exam came Hina ditched her textbook she wrote what her father had told her about Pakistani dictators the teacher failed her in a later exam she skipped all questions on Pakistan she lost some 20 marks but his Hina says it was about principal and this continued in college she emerged as a popular student leader in college first as vice president of the Union at Eden College then as Union member of Dhaka University in between she also got married to a nuclear scientist named M A vasid Mia by now the Bangladesh movement had gathered strength a mass Uprising was organized in 1969 Hina also took part in it during this time she also had another important job that of a liazon shikh mujib had been imprisoned by Pakistan so Hina was his contact with the outside world we all know what happened next the 1971 Liberation war with the help of India West Pakistan's Army Was Defeated and a new country was born the country of Bangladesh Hina also became a mother during this tumultous time her son was born in 1971 her daughter was born the next year so things were going well her father was President the country was slowly being built that's when Hina decided to join her husband in Germany it was July 1975 the whole family came to see her off her father her mother her brothers her sisters-in-law it was the last time she would see them months later the coup happened her entire family was massacred within days shik Hina came to New Delhi she met with India's prime minister Inda Gandhi the Prime Minister offered to help her Hina was given a house with full security she and her family took new names they lived in secrecy and security back in Daka big changes were happening military leader Z Rahman had taken charge he was ruling with an iron fist so returning home was impossible for shik Hina she kept fighting she gave speeches abroad against the military leader she tried rallying for Global support eventually things improved in Taka in 1981 she was elected president of her father's party the awami league Hina was not back in Bangladesh then she was elected in absentia the people were on her side so that year she decided it was time to return it was a massive homecoming thousands of people welcomed shik Casina the streets were lined from the airport to her home the game was on Hina brought 15 parties together she protested against the military regime a key moment was in 1983 the Army entered the daa University campus they fired bullets at students the next day Hina joined a protest in Taka the Army arrested her she was blindfolded and taken into custody this became routine in the 1980s Hina was repeatedly put under house arrest by the Army each time public pressure forced her release then came 1986 elections were held under dictator irhad Hina decided to take part her party won more than 100 seats she became leader of the opposition it was not smooth saing though parliament's under dictators are like rubber stamps Hina realized that soon enough in 1987 she called for new elections in response irad dissolved the parliament this time the military was out for vengeance once they attempted to lift hina's car with a crane and if you're wondering yes she was inside the same car thankfully the people intervened so she slipped out in 1988 there was another near Miss Hina was was addressing a rally in Chittagong the police opened fire some 80 people died 80 but shik Kina escaped many such attempts would come in total she said to have survived 19 assassination attempts but her work paid off in 1990 she proposed a constitutional formula to isad sort of like an ultimatum he agreed and stepped down If This Were A Movie elections would be held and Hina would win but it wasn't one more twist was in store for her shik Hina did not win the 1991 elections they were won by khalida Zia her arch nemesis Zia led the Bangladesh nationalist party she was the Widow of Z Rahman so Hina had to wait she rallied farmers and workers she United other parties in the opposition and she put pressure on Khaled AIA in 1996 elections were held again this time under a neutral caretaker government for the first time Hina tasted electoral success she became prime minister of Bangladesh her first term had some highs like signing the gangas water treaty with India and ending the Insurgency in the Chittagong Hills she also had bold welfare schemes like making homes for Farmers or giving allowances to widows and specially abled but the people thought differently in the 2001 election shik Hina Was Defeated and quite badly at that Khalid aia's party the BNP won a 2/3 majority Hina herself lost one of her three seats so what did she do what leaders do after a bad defeat she blamed the system she accused the caretaker government of helping the BNP but whatever the reason she lost the election Hina was now in opposition and in Bangladesh that's not a good place to be awami League meetings and leaders were targeted even former ministers were killed it was a sign of things to come in 2006 the BNP government's term was up it was time for another election just one problem though Hina and Z could not agree on the caretaker government there were protests and counter protests and in the end an emergency was declared in 2007 Hina traveled to the US while there she was charged with corruption and extortion and then she was barred from returning the caretakers said hena's return would cause disorder she refused to listen her party fought the cases in court and around 50 days later the entry ban was lift so once again shik Hina had a homecoming very similar to the 1980s massive crowds welcomed her at the airport and just like the'80s she was soon arrested the corruption charges emerged again so Hina was placed under house arrest she would be released in 2008 before the elections and that's where the story ends because after 2008 it's been oneway traffic hina's party won that election she won again in 2014 and then again in 2019 and she will win again in 2024 and the opposition they boycotted some of the elections and the others they lost each time they have alleged unfair practices so looking back what is shik hina's Legacy well her story is not over yet she's 76 years old but going strong and like every leader she has done good and bad we can think of three good things one is the economy Bangladesh is now a rising Asian giant it's among the biggest garment exporters in the world so living standards have improved two she's kept the military out it's harder than you think just look at the situation in Pakistan once the generals taste power it's hard to keep them in the barracks but Hina has done that she's kept Dhaka in civil in hands three she's also kept radicalism in check that is why Bangladesh's minorities still vote for shikina she learned her core values from her father like secularism now we come to the not so good parts you can't have elections without opposition parties that sort of defeats the point of an election some 10,000 opposition workers are in jail all of them cannot be radicals which brings us to sh Casa's biggest failure and it's a shared one the inability to create a peaceful poity if you're in opposition it's game over for you that's the rule in Bangladesh when Hina was in opposition she was targeted now that Khalia is in opposition she's under house arrest it's a cycle of persecution as a result nobody wants to give up power because if they do they know what's in store I'm afraid democracies cannot function like that you can criticize opposition leaders but you cannot treat them as your mortal enemy that's what shik Hina fought for in the 70s ' 80s and '90s she was the rebel who wanted democracy the people have given it to her the question is what will she give them in return [Music] what" />

          <attvalue for="3" value="Gurudev Sri Sri Ravishankar With Arnab On Somnath Shivling Consecration&#10;&#10;Global spiritual leader and founder of the Art of Living, Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar will perform the ritual of consecration of the the lost part of Somnath Jyotirlinga, which was destroyed by Mahmud of Ghazni over a thousand years ago. The piece of Jyotirlinga was hidden away for generations, which has been rediscovered and is being consecrated once again. The revival of the Jyotirlinga marks a sacred tale of the preservation and devotion of India's Sanatan Dharma and Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar has been chosen to facilitate the consecration.&#10;&#10;The story of destruction to revival dates back to a thousand years ago, in the early 11th century when Mahmud of Ghazni invaded India. His invasion left a trail of destruction in India, especially targeting the temples and worship places. One of his targets was the revered Somnath temple, home to one of the 12 sacred Jyotirlingas. As per the facts written in history, on his 18th attack, Ghazni's forces finally breached the temple, destroying the 3-foot-tall Shiva Lingam that seemed to defy gravity, suspended 2 feet above the floor.&#10;&#10;&#10;#srisriravishankar #arnabgoswami #sonmnathshivling #trendingnews #latestnews #livenews #arnabgoswami #arnabgoswamilive #arnabdebates #republictvlive #republictv #republicworld &#10;&#10;SRI SRI RAVI SHANKAR LIVE WITH ARNAB,ravi shankar,spirituial guru ravi shankar,somnath shivling,consecration of somnath shivling,REDISCOVERY OF SOMNATH LINGAM,HISTORIC CONSECRATION OF SOMNATH SHIVLING,GURUDEV SRI SRI RAVI SHANKAR,arnab live,arnab goswami live,arnab live today,the debate live,debate with arnab,SOMNATH LINGAM,arnab goswami live today,debate with arnab live,republic tv,republic tv live&#10;&#10;&#10;Republic TV is India's no.1 English news channel since its launch.

gurudev Shri Shri Ravi Shankar with me tonight Charan spers thank you very much gurudev thank you for joining us tonight and hello AR so good to see you every time every time every time but even better today thank you very much gurudev I just want to do a small introduction before we begin our conversation this is something that not not many people in the country know about yet but gurudev SRI Shri ravish Shankar is going to undertake a historic task and this is the task which he'll tell us about uh the Revival of one of the most sacred Shiva lingams which is believed to be a fragment of the original somat lingum destroyed by Mahmud of gazni over a thousand years ago now this has been preserved the shival lingam has been preserved in secrecy for generations and this is a remarkable story when this this shivalingam is now going to be made ready for consecration under the guidance of gurudev Sri ravish Shankar it is a momentous chapter in the history of of our great faith sanatan dhm and Hindu Heritage and so before I talk to gurudev about it and this is going to be so amazing so many people are already saying we didn't know about this social media conversations are wanting to say when what will gurudev tell us about it viewers a small news report on what we are speaking about tonight India's history of invasions is best known to all the worst of which was seen in somat one of the 12 holiest jarlings in the country attacked over 18 times Invaders may have ransacked these lands but they never conquered our civilization today another remarkable rediscovery has shown why India's civilization is truly sanatan truly Eternal the rediscovery of a fragment of the original shivalingam of somat after 1,000 years sh [Music] sh I today gurudev Sri Shri Ravi Shankar has been entrusted with the responsibility of consecrating the rediscovered fragments of the Sacred shivlingam of somno the same shivlingam that was attacked by the Muhammad of gazni will be consecrated once again with the rightful respect after a thousand years of struggle and the revelation of a 100 years Secret [Music] gurudev uh my first question is when did you know that you have been chosen to sort of facilitate the Resurgence of these sacred shivalingam fragments when did this happen when did you get the news and can you tell this how you reacted when you got to know and how long you have known about this yeah this happened just this I not just this January um Agri sit Raman came he didn't know me before but he you know because the Shankar aara has told him to send bring it to me so he brought it to me and the lingam is right here actually I've already shown everything but I would like to show again yes there is it feels like you're holding magnet yes you know if I put it in the okay I put this here look in the table you can focus on the table huh now you see yes yes so it moves mean it is very magnetic this Ling it never touched the ground it was hanging in the space so when this was destroyed the AG brahmans they took those pieces and they came to the south of India when Swami pran was holding it for a very long time he was also with Swami uh shivananda who was in rishik who know who had this Big shivananda Yoga inst Swami shivananda Rishi he was his contemporary then it came to sitaraman G's family his T his uncle and then his father then the pachar had told them for 100 years you should not bring it out after that Ram Mand will be done then you go and give it to gurv S rank then so they brought it to be only last month in January they brought this now the plan Arab is uh bring this uh Good Fortune to the whole population of our country you know I discussed also with the shankaracharya of Ki and other Saints in the Kumba MAA so we all agreed that we will take this from rames to one by one all the Jo lingas and every state and have the people see the D of the original joing you know amazing gurudev uh Mahmud of gazni he invaded India multiple times and he destroyed the somat temple I think this was in about 1,25 ad so we are we are talking about over a thousand years now and thousand years when this when the when the original snat linga was destroyed it is said that it hovered in the air it was above the ground it was hovering in the air uh can you tell us the history of this and the spiritual significance of the spiritual significance of these fragments of the original somat lingum you know among the 12 Jo lingas sash is the first one s sh Malik then you come to the Malik in telana now incomplete SRA this lingam the history goes that it is the moon who prayed to Lord Shiva and that's a so that's why it's and then moon was relieved of his pain in suffering so uh the shivalingam said to not to have been touching the ground and it was floating it has it's in the history that was hanging and it has lot of energy it's a beautiful energy around and moon is connected with the mind so mind you know that's why you call people have gone little crazy as lunatics see mind and Moon are connected and when mind troubles as a lot Shiva is the answer the Shiva holds the moon on his CR you know on his J and it's a cent Moon little bit of that Moon so the moon the Mind meditation Mantra and Mahadev have such an intimate connection I'm also joined this evening gurudev sitting to your right is Sri sitaram shastri who is a devoted priest the custodian of this sacred Legacy I'm told uh sir that you have spent the last 21 years safeguarding this with you uh can you tell us about how your family has safeguarded Ed the fragments of the shivalingam for over a thousand years and what made you bring it to gurudev Sri ravish Shankar uh what was in your mind then in the for for for gurv where will you consecrate this where will the be consecrated and which region which location are you thinking about Sir no we will first take it all over the country I mean to various places and then finally snat the snna temple is there there we will uh talk to the our prime minister is the chairperson of the temple and we will talk with him we will have a talk we will ask him and then we will with with the state government and central government help we will uh establish them there this is such a this is such a magical moment I mean this is I would say you know the whole history turns around after 1,000 years a part of the original somat Ling which was hovering in the air when mhmood of gazni destroyed the snat temple in 1025 now after 1,000 years it comes back it's back it's back and there must be a different energy to this that you're holding and then you know they it was just in pieces they couldn't see them in the pieces it was so painful for them so they gave the shape of shivalingam to them to that to the broken pieces of uh this must have been done at that time like a thousand years back uh this we don't exactly they also don't know when they gave the shape of shivalingam to it but somewhere during this time you know in the past 1,000 years they gave the shape of shivalingam like this how many pieces are there there are four pieces in my hand now total there's so total 11 pieces like this so we will establish it in different places and and what is the I mean they'll do now one in terms of uh these are these pieces represent history they represent Faith they must have a different energy to them uh you know so what you my my next question to you as one of India's most leading spiritual gurus what what does one experience in the presence of these uh these pieces these lingers what does one experience the presence is just it's magnetic you know when you do whether Mantra or meditation they all create the magnetic energy within you see and it streamlines the energy then mind becomes very focused the very idea of shivling you know sitting in front of it statue vgam which has been consecrated with the mantras is that it brings Clarity to mind it focuses the mind it uplifts the energy in the system see when the energy is low that is when you feel all the negative uh emotions you feel upset and you feel all this uh this thing you know um rage but when energy is positive then you you uh focus is very different you feel uplifted and that's what um the very purpose of Mor you know and then this morti is so ancient and it's already so energetic it will definitely impact the uh the society Mankind and and our planet to something more positive yep I I I also think gurudev this is about the Revival it's not just about the Revival and consecration of these fragments these 11 pieces these 11 lingas I think that when you do this and I really hope I'm sure the state government and the central government will all help you in your mission to bring these fragments back to the somat temple it will also shape the future of the Hindu spiritual Heritage we have been to somat that very geography that very region has always you know had a very very powerful influence on all devotees I have been there couple of times myself but I think that will be further reinforced with with these original shivalinga fragments being brought back oh yeah yeah for devotees it will mean a lot absolutely absolutely it means a lot to our Hindu psyche it just uh you know I I can't even imagine how people are already feeling you you know the Lost shivalingam is gained back again so we are gaining Our Roots we are gaining Our Heritage we are gaining our pride um it's a very very very beautiful moment for the whole nation I would say like the ram Mand we got the ram Mand back after 500 years now we are getting our original sheling back after 1,000 years huge gurv you're so unassuming you say all these things and make it sounds so normal that is the amazing thing about you but I I cannot say what what great contribution you have had to our culture our society Our Heritage and as someone uh you know as a shiv Bak myself I we look forward to going back to snat and being in your

          <attvalue for="7" value="the Israeli Air Force has made a decision and the  fighting in the Gaza Strip undergoes a tactical   revolution welcome to this special edition of  Boots on the Ground i'm your host Y Pinto and   today we're going to give you an in-depth look at  what's happening in Israel as we dive into the Air   Force's combat revolution this is more than just  a change in the way that the Israeli Air Force   strikes it is a revolution in military affairs  that is already changing the face of modern   warfare worldwide since the launch of Gideon's  chariots the current route of fighting in the   Gaza Strip we are already seeing a new layout of  the Israeli air force that includes less bombing   by fighter jets more precise operations and  significant coordination with the Navy it's all   about close support for ground troops using UAVs  and attack helicopters this is being done in order   to redirect the fixedwing aircraft and related  forces toward broader operational activity in the   Middle East strikes in Iran and distant Yemen are  complex operations that require sending aircrafts   refueling planes and of course putting the pilots  at risks so why has Israel chosen to focus on   smaller faster aircrafts is this a mistake that  needs correction let me know in the comments is   this context the question arises is why doesn't  Israel fire long range missiles at Yemen in   response to the Houthi launches instead of sending  pilots on a long dangerous mission beyond enemy   lines do you have the answer for that let me know  in the comments we'll provide the professional   explanation for this question and meanwhile the  Israeli Air Force is preparing at the home front   and the general staff systems for a multiffront  war ensuring continuity defensive readiness and   protection of vital operational components so get  ready to dive into all the in-depth analysis of   the Israeli Air Force i'm Yay Pinto and this is  your boots on the ground explainer edition today   we're examining the brave fighting of the Israeli  air force in the war against Hamasbala the Houthis   in Yemen the Shia militias in Iraq and all the  other armed groups in this region that are acting   under the orders of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary  Guards Corps which is the head of the Axis of Evil   in the Middle East in just a moment before we take  off with all the details I want to invite you to   continue spreading the truth and to support us  with a click on the subscribe button it helps us   reach more people so let's begin with the fighting  in the Gaza Strip and how the Israeli Air Force   is doing its part the Air Force is changing the  way that it strikes in Gaza by making less use   of bombings by fire jets in favor of more precise  close support from maneuvering troops using UAVs   drones and attack helicopters in the first days  of operation Gideon's chariots the air force of   Israel acted with great intensity carrying out  hundreds of bombings sorties on Hamas and Islamic   Jihad targets throughout the Gaza Strip including  terrorists and mid-level commanders of Hamas   it included also tunnels and buildings that were  used for storing weapons and containing explosive   devices and weapon systems intended to harm IDF  maneuvering forces these strikes using heavy   munitions aimed to break Hamas's defensive lines  in Canunes in Javalia in northern Gaza in Gaza   City and in the central camps but now that the  IDF has deployed five divisions into the battle   including all its regular forces three armored  brigades five infantry brigades the commando   brigade and three combat engineering battalions  the Israeli air force had to shift its force   operation and moved to close support operations  mostly based on intelligence from the Shinbet and   military intelligence as well as fire control  centers of maneuvering battalions and brigades   operating numerous aircrafts over Gaza sky the  main firepower now comes from UAVs and attack   helicopters immediately available to strike in  response to battlefield developments and the   needs of the maneuvering ground forces this is  in contrast to what happened in the first days   of the war when the Israeli air force struck  every known terror command post in the field   sending hundreds of sorties every day utilizing  bunker busting bombs and focused GBU39 bargages   every intelligence marked target got personal  treatment from the sky there was a complete   focus on kamas targets including operational  squads headquarters launch sites and tunnels   running under residential buildings and public  institutions the first hitunes Jabalia Gaza   city and every refugee camp that turned into a  bunker for Hamas terrorists but then something   changed in this round the IDF went big on ground  operations instead of distant strikes and indirect   fires suddenly the air force stopped acting like  a detached squadron and became a soldier on the   company on the ground there was a shift from long  hours of coordination with headquarters to direct   and immediate connection to the forces at the  front lines of the battle anytime ground forces   spot a threat the Air Force responds like a team  member uavs and Apache helicopters circle above   not waiting for instructions they're part of the  immediate response so if a terrorist emerges he's   hit with pinpointed fire if there is suspicious  movement on a third floor the balcony vanishes   this shift is dramatic because kamas the terror  group that thought it ruled the field has suddenly   and totally lost control every building that they  thought was safe all of the sudden becomes a death   trap as soon as a UAV arrives every attempt  to set up an anti-tank squad is interrupted   in under 2 minutes this is no longer an air  force that bombs at night and then flies away   this is an aerial force living near the ground  spotting reacting and supporting the ground   fighters at every step it's not detached fire it's  tactical fire smart sharp and synchronized to the   platoon commander level this breaks Kamas's entire  operational logic they don't know whether the blow   will come from the ground from the air an alley  and a backyard intelligence assets follow them   from every angle and fire lands on them within  seconds of the emergence from cover and that this   exactly is what reinvents the whole concept  of combat in the Gaza Strip because for the   first time the air force doesn't just strike it  fights it doesn't just hammer bunkers it covers   its comrades it doesn't just prevent future  threats it eliminates threats mid battle and   when the warriors of the sky fight like soldiers  on the ground Hamas with all of their tunnels and   their slogans simply loses control it only reacts  and once an enemy is only reacting it's no longer   winning so guys continue spreading the truth  about Israel by sharing our videos on YouTube   and

and we know whose side   God is on and guys speaking of which since the  beginning of the war the Israeli air force has   struck countless times deep behind enemy lines in  dangerous territory this raises a question about   why Israel sends its planes and its pilots on  such dangerous missions far from home instead of   just responding to the Houthis or to the Iranian  missiles with our own long range missiles which we   have very very advanced missiles so on the surface  it seems simple launch a groundto ground missile   quickly and hit the target precisely with no risk  to our own warriors it even seems cheaper than   risking a fighter jet and a pilot training but  once you dig deeper the story changes entirely   one of the main claims from advocates of a  missile core attack in Iran and Yemen is the   cost angle and on this point they have a point  because a missile certainly is cheaper than a   fighter jet but then again the fighter jet that  struck in Yemen also conducted strikes in Gaza   also in Lebanon and Syria and Iran a missile is  a one-time use item once it's launched and hits   it's gun from inventory when comparing missile  costs to aircraft munitions the longer a missile's   range the more expensive it is a L missile with  a 400 km range costs about $3 million per unit   missiles with ranges of 1,500 to 2,000 km can  cost tens of millions each a medium or long   range missile costs 10 to 20 times more than an  aerial munition some missiles cost nearly as much   as a fighter jet which can perform missions for  40 years or more the maintenance cost of missiles   and launchers and the readiness infrastructure  are also no less than maintaining a fighter jet   so if you're talking about a serious missile  force it may cost even more than the aircraft   a missile launched to Yemen or to Iran carries  a warhead weighing half a ton to a ton and it is   effective only against a limited range of targets  furthermore launch preparations are relatively   easy to detect especially with long-range missiles  as we saw before during Iran's attacks of Israel   the launch itself is detectable and the trajectory  is fixed and interceptable just look at the   Iranian launches at Israel which included dozens  or even hundreds of ballistic missiles with only   marginal damage relative to cost and effort  to see how limited a missile's power can be   on the other hand a fighter jet can carry 10 to  11 tons of bombs and missiles and hit multiple   targets or change targets mid-flight if needed  the damage that a plane can inflict is therefore   significantly higher than a missile and beyond  that air launch munitions have better penetration   capabilities than missiles which is critical for  Israel when targeting underground infrastructure   and tunnels from Gaza to Iran to Yemen finally air  power can be approached from multiple directions   and fly below the radar making interception  very hard equally important from a political and   diplomatic angle jets allow plausible deniability  unlike groundto ground missiles yes munitions   launched from jets can also be intercepted as we  saw in Syria but because of their size price and   quantity many can be launched from several jets  overwhelming air defenses and hitting the target   this is far more cost effective and efficient  than using expensive missiles a missile core   is therefore nothing more than a niched used for  very specific targets it can be a force multiplier   but it cannot replace or substitute an active  air force no advanced country in the world has   a missile core instead of an air force or even as  a major part of one in fact terror groups and some   of Israel's hostile threats the states that are  attacking Israel rely on missiles and on rocket   forces because they do not have the ability  to maintain an advanced air force just look   at decades of rocket and missile attacks on Israel  to understand the differences so guys here at TBN

Shalev, the current executive director of the group, connects the Israeli military’s targeting of healthcare workers and infrastructure in Gaza with its silencing of the great number of Palestinians who make up the medical workforce in Israel. The authors call for an international boycott of Israeli medical institutions, until “Israel stops its colonial project, [and] after the Palestinians receive liberation and self-determination.”&#10;&#10;Democracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on over 1,500 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

Sh earlier today Israel attacked the Ali Baptist Hospital in Gaza City it marked the eighth time the hospital has been attacked over the past 600 days three Palestinian journalists were killed at the hospital a fourth journalist was seriously wounded we turn now to look at how the Israeli medical establishment has responded to Israel's systematic attacks on Gaza's health system we're joined now by the co-authors of a new article headlined The Shame of Israeli Medicine published in the New York Review of Books joining us in Tel Aviv in Israel is the medical anthropologist Guy Shalv who serves as executive director of Physicians for Human Rights Israel and in London the Israeli political scientist Neve Gordon who is the first director of Physicians for Human Rights Israel he's a professor of international law and human rights at Queen Mary University of London we welcome you both to Democracy Now um Professor Ne Gordon let's begin with you uh talk about what you found what we found is that the support for Israel's assault on Gaza the genocidal assault including the decimation of its medical system including the killing of 1,400 health workers including the detention and disappearance of 400 uh medical doctors and health care workers including the torture of uh detainees has been supported by the Israeli medical establishment and through and through whether it's from the top the Israeli medical association that represents 95% of Israeli doctors the other health care associations including the nursing association and the psych ological associations and their ethical committees we found that that hospitals did not accept Palestinian detainees who were wounded and and and needed medical care we found that doctors inside hospitals were unwilling to treat Palestinian detainees or did not demand that the the shackles from their legs and their arms and their blindfold be removed before they were treated we found that doctors did not provide painkillers to Palestinians claiming that they should suffer from the pain we found doctors in Israeli hospitals that sent posted genocidal messages on their private uh social media accounts we found persecution of medical doctors and nurses Palestinian medical doctors and nurses in the Israeli establishment so there's a whole system the whole medical establishment inside Israel has been actually supporting Israel assault on the Palestinian people and particularly on its health care system now uh G Shalev you are joining us from Tel Aviv you are the uh executive director of Physicians for Human Rights Israel it is this organization your organization that gathered testimony from 24 of these Palestinian health workers can you explain how the testimony was collected and you know the key things what most surprised you about what you found right so first of all it was impossible to collect testimonies for many months since the beginning of the war uh in the beginning there was no access to detainees we could not send lawyers to visit them we could not have any kind of uh supervision of their conditions of how they're being held uh after uh approximately 6 months we could have uh starting could started to send lawyers to visit them to collect the testimonies uh and then what we heard was just uh impossible to hear uh doctors that were detained while they were doing their work in hospitals other doctors who were uh detained while crossing checkpoints across Gaza uh after they the the soldiers found out that they are doctors and then uh being taken to facilities in Israel most uh famous pro probably infamous is the man facility uh being subjected to torture medical neglect violence uh starvation um four doctor three doctors and one paramedic died in Israeli facilities uh these are four out of the 90 Palestinian detainees who died in the past 20 months um and we tried to figure out what was the the the reason why doctors were targeted in such a way uh and we realized that in their investigations they were asked uh to provide information or uh kind of reveal the structure of hospitals uh and what they know which is a violation of the international law and protection of medical workers you cannot detain a medical worker for the purpose of collecting information if you don't have any evidence that they violated any law uh and in fact these people most of these people were held without a trial without uh charges uh many of them are still held approximately 150 medical personnel are still held in Israeli detention facilities and Gala you also point to an extraordinary statistic uh regarding the number of Palestinians who work in the Israeli medical establishment you say Palestinians comprise 25% of all doctors and almost 50% of all new doctors and nurses in Israel so can you explain uh how they have been treated uh in the month since October 7th these Palestinians who work in Israeli hospitals right and yes first of all these are amazing numbers and this is the outcome of a long process of many years of Palestinians uh studying medicine both in Israel and abroad and choosing medicine as their kind of profession for the reasons that many people in the world choose that profession but also for the reason that many minorities and uh uh people of uh marginal communities cho choose medicine because they see that as an opportunity for social mobility an opportunity to be accepted as equal and that is why we see a lot of doctors in the Israeli medical system and unfortunately this ideal of a system that is uh that considers them as equal uh was was never a reality and definitely not not after October 7 when there was basically a witch hunt of Palestinian medical workers in the Israeli system uh social media profiles were scanned to see whatever they're posting there and then uh a very large number of uh doctors and medical workers were uh uh subjected to to hearings uh and other kind of uh processes uh including firing doctors and medical workers for just mo the most basic uh social media posts such as supporting uh children in Gaza or just feeling compassion for the people of Gaza um and it created this atmosphere that basically silenced and censored an entire group of uh doctors and medical workers in the Israeli system we're speaking with two of the three authors of the piece the shame of Israeli medicine published in the New York Review of Books we're speaking with the medical anthropologist Shalev in Tel Aviv and with Ne Gordon professor speaking to us from London the third author is Dr osama Tanus a pediatrician board member of Physicians for Human Rights Israel he was advised by his lawyers not to do the interview um Ghalev can you explain why yes this is exactly what we we just talked about uh it is just too risky for a Palestinian citizen of Israel to be publicly uh kind of resisting the war publicly criticizing the Israeli establishment and we've seen uh cases for example professor Nad Shalhub a very famous professor in the Hebrew university who participated in was interviewed in a podcast and was later uh had to resign from the university for very basic kind of critical opinions professional critical opinions she had over the Israeli policies in Gaza um so the the risk is unfortunately high and we are we're sorry that his voice is silenced once more once again because Nev and I are here and Osama is not and Professor Neve Gordon if you could say what exactly are you calling for well I think what we managed to show in the article is the complicity of the Israeli medical establishment with Israel's egregious violations of international law including uh the genocide convention and what we also know uh from past experience and from what we detail in the article is that change will not emerge from within without pressure from without and so what we think or at least I think is that the international medical establishment and medical community needs to put pressure on their counterparts in Israel in order that they raise their voice against Israel's policies the Israeli medical establishment in general identifies with Israel's colonial project and puts the colonial project over the most basic ethical principles of their profession and that we think needs to change so one very practical uh idea is that students and staff in uh research institutions in the United States Canada in the UK in Europe map the kinds of partnerships their institutions have with Israeli medical institutions with Israeli research teams with Israeli medical corporations ations and demand from their own institutions to cut these partnership to cut ties with these partnerships to to end the contracts with Israeli medical corporations not as a principle but as a strategy saying to the is their Israeli counterparts we'll be happy to carry out these partnerships again will hap be happy to do business but only after Israel stops its colonial project after the Palestinians receive liberation and self-determination it is time we think that the international community boycott the Israeli establishment in order to bring about change and to stop this genocide we're witnessing ne Gordon want to thank you for being with us israeli political scientist the first director of physicians for human rights Israel he's professor of international law and human rights at Queen Mary University of London speaking to us from London and Ghalev executive director of Physicians for Human Rights Israel speaking to us from Tel Aviv we'll link to your new article The Shame of Israeli
